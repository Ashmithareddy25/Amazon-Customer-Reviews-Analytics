B000001EQT|5.0|\\"The Slider\\" was the successor to T. Rex 's perhaps the only truly well-rounded album \\"Electric Warrior\\". To a certain extent \\"The Slider\\" is more of the same, of course aided by producer Tony Visconti but also by the two great Turtles vocalists Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman who help create the big sound that characterized the T. Rex during this period.<br /><br />When \\"The Slider\\" not quite matches its predecessor's heights, it is primarily because some of the songs do not quite keep the level of \\"Electric Warrior\\". But this does not in any way make \\"The Slider\\" a weak or uninteresting album - here's plenty to enjoy.<br /><br />\\"Metal Guru\\"and \\"Telegram Sam\\"(perhaps a little too much a rip-off of \\"Get it On \\") - are well-known single-hits, and \\"Rock On \\", \\"Baby Boomerang\\" and \\"Main Man \\" belong among the group's best-known songs.<br /><br />Among the less typical numbers you'll find some of Bolan's best songs, such as \\"Ballrooms of Mars, \\"\\"The Slider\\" and \\"Spaceball Ricochet\\".<br /><br />Among the bonus tracks \\"Thunderwing\\" is a good number in classic T.Rex arrangement.
1400052181|5.0|This book was truly unputdownable! I cannot remember waking up with a book on my chest as many times as I awoke to find The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks there. The author did a commendable job at allowing the African American people to speak with the ethnicity that make us who we are. She made no apologies for the people who'd done injustice to others and she made no excuses for the misgivings of the \\"good\\" people of the book.<br /><br />What I truly enjoyed the most was the way that Rebecca Skloot took the highly scientific information that was needed in order to grasp the contest on the story, and put it in laymen terms. I am not at all well acquainted with discussions that speak in detail about the human genome, DNA, cell reproduction, and even the medium in which cells need to survive in order to be studied - even though I've taken classes about these things in college. :) Skloot's prose made it understandable and even enjoyable to read!<br /><br />This was one of the best books that I have ever read for its suspense, for its truth, for its boldness, for its simplicity.<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK!!! You won't regret it.

B003Y5H4SO|3.0|This unusually brief (under 80 minutes) film is something of a curiosity. It begins with some symbolic upside-down opening shots of a cityscape (which presumably telegraphs that \\"something's not right\\") and a jumper, whose suicide is allegedly the catalyst for all of the supernatural shenanigans that ensue (don't invest too much time thinking about the suicide, though--it's never developed or connected in any way to the action that follows). The rest of the film is essentially a modern variant of the classic locked-room mystery--five people are trapped in an elevator, and they begin dying inexplicably while some hapless security guards and detectives attempt to figure out what the heck is going on. Is one of them the devil? Well, duh. Just look at the title of the movie. It all ends up in some redemptive treacle that has been carefully foreshadowed by a seemingly useless scene that takes place in a coffee shop early in the film. Overall, this film is a trifling diversion--and further evidence that M. Night Shyamalan's career is grinding to a halt.

B002N5N5M0|1.0|I was an avid Dexter fan because its a great premise, a serial killer who only kills those who deserve it.  Now why did I rate it so low? I will try to elaborate without any spoilers. The greatest curse of this series is the extremely high expectations it has set for itself.  Season 1,2 and 3 were very well written, really fleshing out the great cast of characters.  Amazingly, IMO there really isn't a bad episode in the bunch, there are bad scenes, but mostly the episodes were very well done and kept you on the edge of your seats.  Season 4 is where you start to see some cracks.  Slowly the show you love, is devolving into a mess. The first half of season 4 is fine, but from there to the shocking season finale, it all down hill, with the season finale being especially disappointing (many with probably disagree, but just my two cents). A Major plot twist and you are left wondering where the writers are going with season 5.  Sufficed to say they weren't going anywhere interesting with the twist.  IF they made changes to the plot to further the series in new and interesting ways then, great idea.  However, this changes seems to be done just for the sake of change.  Too bad, season 5 is only a shadow of what Dexter was. Made it to episode 6 and stopped watching.  I don't watch TV often if at all, very rarely, do I invest in a TV series, but with Dexter I was hooked. Season 1-3 is some of the best work I have seen on TV or in film, I would suggest not ruining a good thing and stopping after season 3.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I do not understand why people gave this book bad reviews. It was a lovely romance and a really fun adventure. I could not wait to start reading each day. It was also refreshing to read a book with vampires in it that was not all about blood. The witches and vampires were believable and likable people. This was an original  and enjoyable read --- the pages whizzed by.
B00005V9IK|5.0|During the hot Summer of 1996, my siblings and I saw Independence Day on a Tuesday morning in a cool, air-conditioned movie theater. Director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin struck gold with this action packed popcorn movie. Human beings spend three, daunting days fighting off malevolent alien beings! Roland Emmerich shows off his love for 1970's disaster films and 1950's sci/fi B-movies. ID4 is one of the movies that turned Will Smith into a movie star. David Arnold's ID4 music score is very loud, epic, and energetic. A year later, he wrote music for the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies(1997). I bought a David Levinson action figure from the unsuccessful line of Independence Day toys! Some TV stations show this film during the 4th of July. There was a Mad Magazine spoof called 'It's Depends Day'.    ID4 does have some detractors. They claim the film is \\"mindless\\" and it \\"shows human stereotypes fighting alien stereotypes\\". I guess it's true. The DVD version of ID4 preserves the 1996 theatrical version and a special, longer, re-edited version of the film. There's a scene where Julius Levinson(Judd Hirsch) almost crashes his car into people and other cars! ID4 is a popcorn movie at its best.
031261246X|4.0|This is a really good novel. it does not go to deap technically. It holds your attention well. and brings out some things that people should think about. it is so important for people to take security seriously. however they often do not. And with the consumerization of IT. it seems to be of less concern then ever before.
B004L49K20|5.0|I'll be honest, while I like a lot of the songs this group has come out with, I feel the bulk of their stuff is a bit too odd for my tastes.  But, when they are good, they are hard to beat.  So, when I heard the single \\"All You Need is Now,\\" on the strength of that song, I took a gamble and got the whole album.  Worked out even better then I expected it to.  There were very few songs here I didn't love, and even those songs I didn't hate.  The bulk of the songs here I really have enjoyed and feel that this is Duran Duran at their finest.<br /><br />I think no matte if you are a die hard fan, casual fan (like me), or not a fan at all, there is something for just about everyone here.  I recommend it.

0425241505|5.0|Pia can't believe that she was gullible enough to have allowed that slimy toad of an 'exe' to blackmail her into stealing from a dragon - talk about suicidal. Ancient and powerful, Dragos is alternately incensed that someone has violated his lair, and a bit bemused by what was stolen and the note the theif left behind. But now the hunt is on and Dragos will stop at nothing until he's found the thief - and when he does, the thief is his.<br /><br />Elder Races series starter Dragon Bound came highly recommended and for me it absolutely lived up to all of the great things that people have been saying - it was a great mixed paranormal world, including great supporting cast of griffins, fae, harpies and others, and above all a truly great leading lady (Pia) who had a very original secret, and even though Pia was not an overtly kick fanny heroine, she was still about to hold her own against Dragos, a dominant dragon-shifting male who decided to add her to his horde. And even more appealing, Pia somehow managed to bring out the hero in Dragos - an ancient powerful creature who 'used to eat people'. The whole time I was reading Dragon Bound I was torn between wanting to gobble it straight down and wanting to savor it, knowing that there is a wait for the next excursion to author Harrison's world, [[ASIN:0425242668 Storm's Heart (A Novel of the Elder Races)]].
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I have to admit I've had the book BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE for a few years and have yet to read it. When I discovered it was made into a movie, I knew I'd eventually see it.<br /><br />Aron Ralston, played by James Franco, is an energetic young man who loves adventures in the great outdoors. With only his backpack and a few supplies, he traipses off alone without telling a soul where he's gone. Before long, he finds himself trapped in a crevasse at the Utah's Canyonlands National Park with his hand wedged between the wall and a boulder that had fallen when he had.<br /><br />In the five days Aron is trapped, he documents what he believes to be his final days with a camera. After several attempts to escape, he makes the unthinkable decision to free himself the only way possible.<br /><br />127 HOURS is definitely a movie to be seen. Although not filled with action or suspense, it was done well considering the situation. After all, how much can one do with the focus on someone being trapped like Aron was. If you have a weak stomach, you may want to look away when he decides to end his entrapment.<br /><br />This inspiring movie is an eye-opener with a lesson to be learned along with a nice ending that gives a glimpse into Aron's current life.
B0050XFXT0|5.0|What a great episode.  I hope we get to enjoy more episodes written by Neil Gaiman.    I loved the word play going on through the entire episode.  I thought I was watching William Powell and Mryna Loy from The Thin Man.  We always knew there was more to the TARDIS then it being just a blue box.  I loved how Idris informed the Doctor that he did not steal the TARDIS; she stole him so she could see the Universe.    The characters were in sync with each other, the dialogue was quick and witty, and the storyline was fantastic!  Why it was... BRILLIANT!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|A love for animals and a neighbor with an autistic daughter drew me to the movie TEMPLE GRANDIN. Claire Danes did an amazing job portraying Temple Grandin. A must see for anyone who knows an autistic person. Not only will you gain knowledge and an understanding of the challenges of an autistic person and the key people in their life, but you'll be inspired as well.<br /><br />God is faithful in bringing good out of the trials and tribulations of our lives if we so chose to live life with open eyes and ears and a willing heart. And that's exactly what Temple Grandin did.<br /><br />TEMPLE GRANDIN will keep you on the edge of your seat, anxiously waiting to see what will happen next. You' be saddened by the hurtful words and actions of others as well as rejoicing in her spirit and determination.<br /><br />Temple was diagnosed at an early age with autism and recommended to be institutionalized but her mother Eustacia, played by Julia Ormond, wouldn't hear of it. Temple wasn't deterred for long by the negative words of others instead she grasped on to the positive ones from her mother, Aunt Ann, played by Catherine O'Hara, and one of her teachers, Dr. Carlock played by David Strathairn. Her life is a great example of how words can destroy or build up. Never underestimate the power of words.<br /><br />Temple went on to not only graduate from high school but from college as well, earning a doctorate and becoming a bestselling author, as well as a pioneer in the humane treatment of livestock.  I highly recommend this movie. It's one that's sure to have an impact in the way you view others with \\"disabilities\\" as well as inspire you to reach for your own dreams.
B004XS97KO|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like Matt Smith as The Doctor, but I most certainly do. I am enjoying his take on the Doctor.     In season 5 I did not like the new companion, Amy Pond.  I actually thought I might not keep watching my beloved Doctor Who because the characters just didn't seem to \\"click\\".  I am glad I gave Season 6 a try.  The cast seems to mesh better and although I'm still not sure about Pond as a companion, the character is much better in Season 6.      Now that I've watched all the Season 6 episodes to date, I hope we get to enjoy more episodes written by Neil Gaiman!  The Doctor's Wife was a great episode.
1594202710|5.0|A  monumental work on China, by such an authoritative,fully knowledgeble neye witness source as Dr. Henry Kissinger. Extremely informative and hugely interesting, from the early history of China, through all the events of consequence up to today.    A perspective into the \\"Middle Kingdom\\", which will no doubt effect our near future world order...hopefully for the good. Should be required reading at some school levels, thorought the entire world...and a strong Pulitzer candidate.    A heady topic, which DHK lays out in an easy to read and understandable format. At times a bit wordy but thats the writers style.     With the most distinctive voice of the late 20th century, I chuckled at the consternation it may have caused the Chinese translators, during his various meetings from Mao to Hu Jintao

B00461BQC0|5.0|I loved this album. As usual, Kings of Leon always surprise me. Listening to this album for the first time, it took some time for me to adjust to the songs. By the second round, i was sold for this. I love love love this album. Especially Pyro. Which in my opinion, is the BEST song yet. After seeing the band perform live, and listening to the record i can honestly say these guys are what you call a true artist. He sounds just as good if not even better live than on the record. I am completly sastified with this album. I can't wait until they come out with a new album. As usual, they always leave me mesmerized when i hear them. The instrumentals are great, the vocals are great, all that's missing are the great lyrics-or no wait.. they have those too. I give this album 5 Star's.. Kings of Leon.. aaaamazing!!!! I recomend this for anyone. It's a must have!
B004FQX5CK|5.0|Comment: I have seen all versions of this movie (at least once). This one I believe is the most \\"balanced\\" with  spectacular picture (on Blu-ray). Everything just seems to come together... music, picture, story and just enough science fiction mixed with \\"dirt\\" to give it that real (used) look. If you haven't seen this version it might be a good idea to take a look.
0553386794|5.0|I had always thought to read the series but it seemed to me that if the author was never going to finish it, I wasn't sure I wanted to start and get stuck waiting for something that would never come. (Fans have been waiting six years for book five to come out and it was finally announced that the publication date would be in July--book four took five years but in that instance he threw out a year's worth of work when he decided the format he was using would not work for it so I forgive the time lapse.) But when HBO announced it would be creating a series based on the show, I decided I had to read the books--I knew I would be watching the show and thought it best to read the books too. (The book was written to be somewhat unfilmable, so I knew it would likely be complicated and a reading of the book would probably help clear things up.)<br /><br />Now, with that preamble out of the way, I found myself greatly enjoying this series. It is not what you expect from a fantasy series. In fact, for the vast majority of it, it feels more like historical fiction than fantasy as there is virtually nothing fantastical about it. We only get a handful of magic details and scenes at all--direwolves are sort of otherworldly in that they don't exist, there are myths regarding whitewalkers but other than the opening scene we don't really see them, dragons are now extinct, and the only actual spells cast come near the very end of the book. And though the magical element is usually something I really look for in a fantasy series, I was surprised to find that it didn't bother me that they were all but absent.<br /><br />Martin has created a very in depth world filled with dozens of complex characters and history. One might even say too in depth since there are so many characters that at times it is difficult to keep them straight. Many of the deaths lack impact because I was to busy thinking \\"wait, who was he again?\\" We follow eight primary characters in first person--some of the members of the Stark family (Eddard, Catelyn, Jon, Sansa, Arya, and Bran), Tyrion Lannister, and Daenyerys Targaryn. Eddard Stark grew up best friends with Robert, the man who he helped make king of the Seven Kingdoms by deposing Aerys Targaryen, The Mad King. When King Robert comes to Winterfell, the Starks' home, they are pulled into the already fraught political world of King's Landing where the Lannisters plot for power and the last Hand of the King was mysteriously killed. While Eddard investigates why the Hand was killed, his children are left to navigate their new world--Bran, Rob, and Rickon must learn to rule Winterfell while Sansa and Arya must find their place in the capital and Jon, Eddard's bastard, must fit into the Wall where he has gone to help protect the realm from more dangerous things up north. Meanwhile in the East, Daenerys Targaryen has been sold by her brother Viserys, the last male heir of the Targaryen family, to Khal Drogo, the leader of one of the barbarian-like Dothraki tribes.<br /><br />For me, some characters' stories are much stronger than others. Where Sansa is a believable teenager in some ways she seems much too stupid, materialistic, and whiny for a Stark of Winterfell and was hard to relate to. Arya, on the other hand, was interesting and exciting as she was determined to defy the world and expectations placed on her for being a daughter of a noble family. Bran seems largely unimportant beyond the things he sees in the very beginning (it might have been more interesting to see things from Robb's perspective as he was forced to take up the mantel of Lord of Winterfell). Catelynn is an irritating character, but mostly because I don't care for her personality (and particularly the cruel way she treats Jon). It also seems like she does not know Arya very well at all, whereas Eddard, despite being extremely busy, understands his youngest daughter fairly well (though he does not seem to understand Sansa much at all).<br /><br />Most impressive about this series is how complicated it is while still managing to be clear and easy to follow. It could easily have gotten lost (in the same way as Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series sometimes did when talking about random characters that we have not seen or heard from for hundreds of pages or even entire books. Martin balances the different parts of the story well so that we get as much as we need form each storyline without forgetting what is happening in the others.<br /><br />Best of all, Martin manages to come up with twists and surprises that I never saw coming. You can't ask for much more.complicated it is while still managing to be clear and easy to follow.

B003UESJHE|4.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is charming, because its makers' intentions are visibly so modest and noble.  David Seidler's script is simple but witty, eloquent without aiming for eloquence.  That's because it's a tribute to one of Seidler's inspirations, as Seidler himself worked to overcome his stutter as a young man.  Seidler puts the focus on the people rather than the history, which is precisely why the film succeeds.  Colin Firth is perfect casting, his firm, regal brow and humble humor just what the part needs, and his chemistry with Geoffrey Rush, whose own charismatic majesty sometimes outshines Firth's own, brings to life the bond of their characters.  The film's great oddity is its director, Tom Hooper, versed almost exclusively in British TV, and it shows in the dreary colors and muted lighting.  Hooper uses the oldest trick in the avant-garde book, constantly framing each character in the right or left corner of the image.  It's to his credit because it works.
0307887960|5.0|I found this book to be a great source of nutritional information. I have used it more as a guide to better ways of eating, for example, better choices.  I do not have a lot of weight to lose, but lost whatever I needed.  the weight finally came off in the places I wanted.  I do exercise anyway, but have stepped it up a little to give myself a boost.
096798467X|5.0|I built my oven using this book.<br /><br />I loved every step of this process.  I am a smallish woman with no masonry experience, yet I built my beautiful oven almost all by myself!  It was so much fun and such a satisfying experience that I 'd recommend the project to anyone interested in wood-fired baking.  I am a pastry chef and a baking and pastry instructor, and I've always wanted a wood-fired oven, especially since I am a big pizza geek.  The pizzas that I am getting out of this oven are spectacular.  They are light as air and crisp, but chewy at the same time.  Perfect char.  And after the pizzas are finished baking I scoop out the fire and slip a couple of sourdough boules in there, and within half an hour I have lovely bread!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  And don't be discouraged if you don't get a great pizza the first time you try--it took me several attempts to even get a decent fire, but now it's a breeze!  The temperature inside my oven last night was too high for my infra-red laser thermometer to read (and it goes above a thousand degrees.  In fact, this morning I realized I singed my hair and my eyelashes when I got a little too close (I'm investigating a solution for this problem!)<br /><br />Follow up:<br /><br />Still using my beautiful oven.  I've helped others build ovens now, too.  I would recommend sealing the dome of the oven with a plaster product (I used Quikwall Surface Bonding Cement, and I added the optional acrylic fortifier), so that it is weatherproof.  I know this book disagrees.  I just didn't want to have to cover it with an ugly tarp when it rains or when the sprinklers go, nor did I want to build any kind of structure around it to protect it.  The oven is pretty and I want it to bee seen!  I got a new laser thermometer that can register higher temperatures, and now know that my oven gets up to 1200 degrees F.  I find that that is a little too hot for pizzas, and prefer 1000 degrees, for a 2 minute pizza.<br /><br />This book is really great for guiding you to build an oven.  You may want to do a little research about how to build the base for the oven.  There is little real instruction about this in the book.  I wish it took you through a step-by-step process to build the base out of brick.  Instead, it gives vague suggestions about the base.  The dome (being the functioning part of the oven) is described very well.  This is the important part.  But being such a novice at this, I agonized over the base a bit.<br /><br />The book is indispensable for building this kind of cob oven.  Denzer goes into great detail about the proper dimensions of the dome, the door (opening), the hearth, the insulation, the heat sink, and the arch.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I was prepared to not like this book as much as the Percy Jackson books - was I ever wrong!  This book was - in my opinion - just as good, or even better, than the first series.  I was happy to see familiar characters and places, but it was great to meet the new trio of heroes.  The only drawback is that now I have to wait for the second book to come out!
B003Y5H54W|1.0|Five minutes into this movie and I wished I'd spent my money on something else. The dialogue is bland and tedious and the directing horrific. Despite the cast (Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried etc.) the emotional depth of the characters never go beyond the surface. Last time I'll watch a movie by this director.
B005FWO3QK|5.0|Complete video sets of DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN have proliferated in the DVD era, but it was not terribly long ago that there were only three choices: the Bayreuth centenary staging by Patrice Ch&eacute;reau, conducted by Pierre Boulez (taped for broadcast 1979-80, now on DG DVD); the Met's, directed by Otto Schenk and conducted by James Levine (1989-90, also DG), and this later Bayreuth directed by Harry Kupfer, the orchestra led by Daniel Barenboim (1991-92). All had/have their constituents, and together they still provide a strong backbone for the RING videography. The Met's is the most conservative and literal in taking Wagner's mythic saga more or less at face value, and goes for the most extravagant realism. The Ch&eacute;reau is more provocative and idiosyncratic, treating the work as sociopolitical allegory; the Kupfer is equally provocative in its way, but more of a parable about eternal recurrence, an allusive meditation on ruin and rebirth. Of the three, I could most easily do without the Met's. For a first recommendation, I waffle between the two Bayreuths, which have in common more than their venue and orchestra/chorus. Both feature detailed and committed acting, for example. But the Kupfer/Barenboim does benefit from being the more technically up to date, and it wears its nearly 20 years well, still looking and sounding very good even alongside the post-millennial competition.<br /><br />Kupfer's greatest strength as a director here is his gift for \\"Personenregie.\\" Every character seems thought through from the ground up. Who is Wotan, Siegmund, Mime, et cetera, not just in some abstract hand-me-down sense but in *this* production, and in relation to all the other characters in his or her sphere? By the time of these video sessions, which I understand Kupfer closely supervised, most of the singers had extensive experience in the production, and this is to the good. The ones who are gifted actors in the first place (such as Graham Clark, indelible both as Loge and the SIEGFRIED Mime) create brilliant portraits, and the ones who are potential liabilities in this department (such as Poul Elming's Siegmund) are brought up at least to a level that their scenes can come off well. Unlike some contemporary opera directors with a strong and not always traditional point of view, Kupfer also has an unmistakably musical ear -- his choices of blocking and action consistently complement what we are hearing rather than ignore or fight it. A list of such episodes in a 904-minute DVD set would be too long, but I think, for example, of John Tomlinson's Wotan and Anne Evans's Br&uuml;nnhilde in the hushed interlude before their great debate in WALK&Uuml;RE, sitting on the stage back to back, facing away from each other -- the anger exhausted, but the hurt, regret, and inevitability seeming to hang in the air. One of the oft-voiced criticisms of this RING is that Kupfer's stage, especially in the earlier chapters, is often \\"empty,\\" the principal visual motif being a road leading upstage into blackness. But that isn't true, of course. His stage is *full*, not of props but of psychology, humanity, perception. I rewatch scenes here such as the Wotan/Fricka marital quarrel in WALK&Uuml;RE, which gets across not only the surface content but the subtext of a long, conflict-torn, yet once loving and harmonious union, and it almost pains me to imagine people first experiencing the RING via something like the dramatically lifeless multimillion-dollar bore the Met is currently spooling out, with its creaking and malfunction-prone 45-tonne metal planks (\\"Ticket sales cover less than half the cost of our bad investments, ladies and gentlemen\\").<br /><br />Barenboim's musical leadership occupies some middle ground between Boulez's swiftness and transparency and Levine's ponderousness and expansiveness. Though admittedly a crude measure, the cumulative running times tell something of the tale (Boulez clocking in at 832 minutes, Barenboim 904, Levine 941). Wagner always has been one of Barenboim's strong suits, and he is never less than sensible and pertinent here, often much more. The singing is perhaps as good as it could have been in the period. Tomlinson's Wotan, Clark's Loge/Mime, Linda Finnie's Fricka, and Evans's Br&uuml;nnhilde all leave a positive and lasting impression, as does Siegfried Jerusalem's Siegfried -- both in better voice and more interestingly acted here than in the earlier Met cycle (particularly good as the potion-bewitched Siegfried of G&Ouml;TTERD&Auml;MMERUNG, whom he and Kupfer play as a bit of an entitled sleaze). And what a luxury to have the greatest Wagnerian singing actress of the last 20 years, Waltraud Meier, for the single scene of Waltraute. At worst, the vocal contributions just hover around the adequacy bar: Elming is unlikely to be anyone's favorite Siegmund, and Philip Kang sounds underpowered as Fafner and Hagen.<br /><br />Barenboim and Tomlinson share their memories of the Kupfer production in a 13-minute featurette taped around the time of the initial DVD release.<br /><br />There are RING sets that would be no great loss if they vanished from general availability; this is not among them, and its status as the favorite of many connoisseurs is understandable. Its return to the Region 1 catalog is good news. Thus end my comments on matters artistic. However:<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Exercise caution when ordering! This product presently has three listings on Amazon, a search for \\"Der Ring des Nibelugen DVD\\" could lead you to any of them, and there is a potential for unpleasant surprise.<br /><br />The Kupfer/Barenboim RING was initially released on DVD by Warner Classics in 2007. Warner's NTSC release for Region 1, the US and Canada, is now available only for rarity prices (as I write, \\"2 new from $699.99\\"). The studio in the product info for this page is Rhino/WEA.<br /><br />A separate Amazon page appeared in spring 2011 and seemed to promise an identical item from third-party sellers at affordable prices, the listing even claiming \\"All Regions.\\" The item I received when I ordered from that page was the Warner NTSC release for Regions 2/3/4/5. I do keep an all-regions player as a spare, so I was only minimally inconvenienced, but I posted a brief review under the title \\"Warnung\\" and attempted (unsuccessfully) to get Amazon to change its product information so other customers would not buy discs they could not view. On the page for the Region 2/3/4/5 set, there is even a scan of the back cover in which \\"Region code NTSC 2345\\" can be read if one looks closely. The studio in the product info for this page is \\"WVI.\\" You may be reading this review on that page.<br /><br />Several months later, Kultur announced an October 2011 re-release for Region 1, and a third Amazon page appeared. As often happens when something is reissued, Amazon linked reviews of a previous release (unfortunately, the Warner 2/3/4/5) to the new page. Therefore, not of my doing, my well-intentioned and accurate warning about Warner 2/3/4/5 appeared both on the page where it applied and on one where it did not. Two other reviewers believed I was warning people away from the *Kultur*, and posted corrections and admonishments...and *their* reviews now appear both where they are accurate (Kultur R1) and where they are not (Warner 2/3/4/5). I thought a rewrite was in order, and here we are.<br /><br />The bottom line: If you live in the US or Canada, do not have an all-regions player, and are ordering this RING, look closely at the product information and make sure you are getting the Kultur reissue scheduled for October 2011. The one from the studio \\"WVI\\" almost certainly will be Region 2/3/4/5.
B004INNRFK|5.0|Amazing video and sound. The artists featured here are top of the heap (Kenny Loggins, Seal, Earthwind & Fire, Michael Bolton, NE-YO, Chaka Khan, Donna Summers, Martina McBride, Lara Fabian, Natalie Cole, & the little Phenom Charice). They all rocked Mandalay Bay that night and what else could one ask for? These singers are all amazing and the price of the DVD is so miniscule when you are watching and listening to these amazing performers rarely gathered together in one concert. A must to buy indeed!!!!!
B0041EVYVK|5.0|Black Dub is a real treat for the ears.  Lead singer, Trixie Whitley, thrills with her wonderful bluesy vocals.  The album seems to offer several genres, but the thread through each is an incredible rocking blues feel.  Another \\"feel\\" of the album is that of a live performance.  It's as if your catching Black Dub at their natural best - very fresh!      This is a very unique band and I think those that truly enjoy music must add this album to their collection.  You will be most happy that you did.
B002WY65VU|4.0|I have been watching Zombie movies for 30+ years. This one is good. Lots oF guns ( a must need for zombies) and humor. The part with BM was very funny. The only disappointment was the plot about going to a theme park?? And when the girls get there they make all this noise and wonder why the zombies attack?? oh well, nice try. All in all a very good movie

0765348276|5.0|Let me give you some advice: purchase this book.<br /><br />I mean it: if you're a fan of sci-fi and you thought this book looked interesting enough to read this review, stop hesitating and BUY IT.<br /><br />\\"Old Man's War\\" is terrific, and even more so when you realize it's author John Scalzi's first novel.  But first novel or not, the book grabs your attention from the start and gets even better with every additional page.<br /><br />Don't worry:  I won't post any spoilers here, so feel safe to read on:<br /><br />You probably know by now that the story concerns a 75-year old man who, like many of his aging fellows, trades his dwindling elderly years for a dangerous but exciting future with the Colonial Defense Forces, an interstellar army with the technology to transform him into a lean green fighting machine.  And if he survives his years of service the CDF will give him a stake of land on one the planets they've conquered, but there's a tradeoff: he can never return to Earth.<br /><br />What is so remarkable about this book is how cleverly and assuredly Scalzi has mixed character and action--it is one thing to have almost constant conflict, but is another thing altogether to care about those who drive that action.  Scalzi has accomplished both with assurance and dexterity.<br /><br />Set in an uncertain future, \\"Old Man's War\\" will also please those who like the \\"science\\" in sci-fi.  As the transformation from elder citizen to youthful warrior takes place--or at other key moments in the novel--there is always someone nearby who does his or her best to explain the technology to the others (and us).  It never gets in the way and it's always interesting.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, Scalzi asks the question of just what it is to be human--more than a physiological classification, what is it that makes us, us?  If we change our bodies, if we transfer our minds, do we change our souls?  Or is our soul something else; something physical, or mental, or beyond?<br /><br />\\"Old Man's War\\" is a thrilling, character-driven sci-fi tale that will keep you on your toes right on through to the end.  I recommend it thoroughly.ven sci-fi tale that will keep you on your toes right on through to the end.  I recommend it thoroughly.
B000069HZP|4.0|I believe 'Game' falls into the 'Action-Adventure' genre a genre which, very generally speaking, leaves me nonplussed because of multiple unlikelihoods or out-and-out impossibiities.  On the other hand, 'Game' is well acted and scripted and held my attention from the beginning to the end.  The Michael Douglas character--a highly successful and [to me] rather unlikeable millionaire --volunteers to play a real-life 'game' the rules and nature of which he doesn't understand.  He is told by his brother and others that 'The Game' and its results, will really jazz up his constrained life.  The implication, of course, is that his life will be 'improved.'<br /><br />'The Game' involves multiple harrowing adventures bound to increase the paranoia titer in any normal human being.  Implicit in the film, is that the Douglas-character's survival is always under close control of the Gramers.  I don't see it that way.  There are multiple incidents in which Douglas' behavior--and survival--is largely controlled by chance rather than the gamers.  Add them up and Douglas should die or be physically destroyed not once, but multiple times.<br /><br />In a sense, however, this is fairly typical of Action-Adventure films.  The final unlikelihood is that Douglas' life will be 'improved' by a succession of horrific events that could easily unmask a hidden psychosis, bare minimum.  It is definitely difficult to understand how such events could improve anyone's life.<br /><br />More realistically, Douglas is obliged to pay real dollars for 'fun' that would necessarily have cost millions.  Like I said, it is difficult to see how this would have improved his or anyone else's life.
0525457585|5.0|I first read The Neverending Story at least 6 years ago and I absolutely loved it. But, unfortunately I lost the copy I had and had been unable to find a decent copy until now. Michael Ende crafted a rich fantasy world that is unique to him alone, were both Fantastica and our world are connected through a book and that both worlds are in peril. The first part deals with Atreyu's journey as he looks for a cure for the ailing childlike empress, a journey filled with perils and despair. The second part of the book (which some people seem to dislike) deals with Bastian's journey through Fantastica,were he must make wishes in order to continue moving through Fantastica, but with each wish he looses something even more valuable.   Ignore the film and read the book instead.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|So I loved this app, I still use it almost everyday because it makes shopping on the go fun!  But for some reason in an update my amazon remembers lost bar code search functionality... It only has the option to search by picture...  Major disappointment because I use it to compare prices in store while I am shopping and if I have to wait for the picture to send and come back I have moved on by then...  Please fix it back to the way it was and maybe provide an option to put remembers on the first panel of options so I don't have to select &quot;more&quot; before I can get to it...
B004R0WKNE|1.0|I hated it. Not worth my time. It was funny in the middle. I thought the romance was going to be of the hook since we have the same character from the notebook. They must of payed her a great deal of money for doing a movie that sucks! Worest movie I ever have seen for a long time. Really no comparison to the notebook. Please think about it and ask your friends. Read all the reviews if you still can't make up your mind, but in my opinion don't waste your time & money.
B00064ALOK|1.0|Heard Aida long ago, except the march and \\"Celeste Aida\\", I remembered not liking it at all.  But it's so popular, I thought I'd give it another try.  Got this DVD for about $3 - paid too much.  The entire disc is 80 minutes - didn't finish it, so don't know how much of that is commentary.  Hated every note.  Worst singing I ever heard outside a church.  Colors and photography were beautiful.
B004SC8XHI|4.0|This release reflects the creative minded artist roster that STAX created during it's heyday. The concept was right and the music is quite inspiring on this collection,theirs not much that can be said that has'nt already about this 1970 classic,however I would like to add that although Booker T Jones was and still is one of the grooviest Hammond B-3 players around he is also a very underrated Blues Pianist as he has displayed throught his career. Anyone interested in more STAX should check out oneline(or visit as I have) the STAX museum in Memphis,check out their website.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|I enjoyed the concept of the book, with each chapter dedicated to the same day each year. Nicholls does a good job of filling you in on the year of time that you missed. There are some really good moments in this book, but not enough. It was a lot of reading for a story that didn't really go anywhere. There was no big turning point, and often when significant events happened, Nicholls only dedicated a sentence or two. He was dramatic in how the characters spoke (it is quite dialog heavy), but not dramatic enough in the rest of the text. Maybe the lack of turning point and drama is more like a real-life story, but I personally prefer to escape real life when I'm reading.
1444710338|5.0|My wife and I both decided we wanted to take off a few pounds, so we sent for this book.  Of course, you hear about all the diets that don't work, and the skeptic in me doesn't think it will happen.  After reading the book, we decided to have a go at it.  Let me tell you, it's much easier to stick to a meal plan if you are doing it with a partner.  Being empty-nesters, it wasn't too hard to keep tempting items out of view.  The first day or so was the hardest, but once we got into it a few days it wasn't a burden.  After the first week, I lost about 8 lbs. and my wife about 4 (she didn't have to lose as much to begin with).  We are both fairly active, so the walking/ exercise part wasn't hard either.  It's initially the all protein diet (Atkins, I guess) and then phasing in vegetables (where we are now), with a maintenance plan after you are to your target weight. It's a common sense plan, and it worked for us!  I would recommend the book.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|This is a review of the blu-ray.  I'm a huge Rush fan. Seen them live over 40 times (7 times just on the Time Machine tour, two more coming up in June). I own all their work, and this was a welcome addition.  Blu-Ray HD DTS 5.1 mix is absolutely stellar. There are 3 very old videos on here, definitely not worth it for that, 99% of what you're paying for is the DTS HD 5.1 audio remix, and it's worth it.    Camera Eye and Witch Hunt specifically are like new songs, the drums are very intricate and precise, you can almost audibly place every piece of Neil's kit on the stage. Crystal-clear with depth and detail you won't hear on previous versions. If you own The Police DVD-Audio, you know what a massive improvement that was over the original CD. This is similar or better improvement. You can hear Alex fingers touch a string before he plucks it, hear Geddy inhale a breath, Neil quiet a cymbal with his hand. Very well executed remaster.     Overall, I would say if you're a moderate to huge Rush fan, definitely a must-have, especially if you have a high-end audio system, you will appreciate the improvement.  Casual fans can probably skip it.
B004X2M7MK|4.0|Mild spoiler alert! This season seems to be off to a generally good start, however, is the secret lovechild subplot really necessary? I thought the whole who does Amy love subplot was quite nicely resolved last season, but it appears that the writers have chosen to return to this plot point, which is a bit annoying to me, as the subplot seemed a bit silly the first time they used it. However, the episodes are still generally well written and intriguing. I can't complain about the acting either, it's among the best I've seen from outside of the big 6 American production companies. The effects are still slightly lacking, but the stories really do carry this show, which is part of the reason why this whole recurring love triangle thing is starting to get a bit annoying, at this point it almost feels like lazy writing.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games is definitely a novel with a brilliant concept and a somewhat frightening view of what could happen if a government has complete and utter control over its citizens. However, I don't think I would have missed much by not reading this book. Katniss is a horrible protagonist. Period. From somewhat early on in the book, I knew that I didn't care for her, but as the novel progressed, I came to despise her. I can't quite put my finger on why without giving away the book, so that is all I will say about it for now. Suzanne Collins gave me a main character that I hate and a book that could have been so much more. I'm giving it three stars because the concept is cool, and if the main character was not so unlikable, I probably would have loved this book.
B003O86FMW|2.0|With the exception of hating Katniss Everdeen, I liked The Hunger Games, but I don't think Catching Fire is all that great. Without giving away plot points, I'll just say that it is a bit repetitive, and the pacing is really screwed up. Either you're reading about one day for what feels like forty pages, or you're reading about three weeks in two pages but so much is supposedly happening... I don't know. I didn't care for the style and pacing at all, and I still don't like Katniss Everdeen. She is an anti-hero. Just like with The Hunger Games, the background and concept are there, but the author fails on the delivery.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked the Hunger Games series. I think I read them all in one week. How is this a children's book? It's rated as 7th grade and up and I would maybe have allowed a high school student to read it. The context is a very adult concept; we didn't read Aldoux Huxley's Brave New World until senior year. The same should be for The Hunger Games. I find fighting to the death with other children for survival as a means of reminding the general population of who rules them and why to be appaling and oppresive. And to have this as a form of entertainment is a ficticious evolution of today's reality TV. These are not themes for children. But of course, Hollywood wants to make movies from these books. Why? The love triangle is dramatic and interesting. If our youth could understand the concept of the themes behind this book I'd say go for it. The drama will make more money than the idea of overcoming the life and helplessness of oppression ever will.
0061537969|2.0|I don't deny that \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is skillfully written. It's not that surprising that it has been a hit. It uses the clever device of a dog narrator. It has the dog making wise observations that might not occur to a human. Some of the dog's heightened sensitivity to what is going on is plausible. Some is not.    It's okay that not all of it is plausible. After all, this is fiction--and it's not all intended to be taken seriously. It's okay that the dog is formulating complex thoughts and expressing them to us. It's okay that the dog is able to see the folly in many human practices. If we were as guileless as dogs, we'd probably be happier, and we'd surely be better.    What bothered me about \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" was the smugness of the story's point of view. The assumption is that we all get what we really want. Those whose lives go well deserve it. Those who run into trouble have asked for it in some way. The dog's owner is a good guy, so everyone who crosses him has to be irredeemably bad. That kind of story doesn't challenge us to think more deeply or with more nuance. It doesn't encourage us to develop compassion for those whose misfortunes come to them unbidden.     You might take issue with my gripes, pointing out that light fiction isn't supposed to challenge us. You might even say that this story will encourage people to pursue their dreams. But in promoting a shallow New Age philosophy (which I take to be the book's message, not just amusingly misguided ideas articulated by its likeable canine narrator), this book encourages us to adopt an attitude of smugness and moral complacency that I don't believe any of us can afford.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|To all of you anal-retentive OCD folks popping your Adderall, this may not be the purchase for you.  Evidently if Amazon sells you a 99 cents album and you can't play the whole thing within 2 seconds, the world is coming to an end.      For the rest of us, buy this album for 99 cents.  After Amazon tells you that your purchase is complete, then walk away from your computer (slowly with no sharp objects nearby) and go chill out for a few hours.  Take a walk.  Have a real conversation with a friend.  Make yourself a snack.  Then, in a few hours, come back to your Amazon account page and the entire album will be there.      Cheers.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I can't review these songs, because I can't download them all.  In my amazon player there are four songs theat are grey and I can't download them.  Any ideas why?  Any feedback would be helpful.  Thanks.    Update:  7pm on release day I got this message....    I'm very sorry about the issues you've experienced with the purchase of MP3's. Due to the overwhelming response for the MP3 Daily Deal Album \\"Born This Way\\" by Lady Gaga, all downloads are delayed.    We're working hard to resolve this issue as soon as possible.    We appreciate your patience and understanding regarding this matter.
0439023483|2.0|I read this based on recommendations from a few other people saying it was a \\"fast read\\". Yes it was, because I couldn't wait to get to the end. I got hooked after a few pages and was all set for a good ride, but I just couldn't wait for it to end. While it started off well, by the end, I felt like I was reading one of those \\"bodice ripper\\" novels. Blah. I know everyone has an opinion, likes and dislikes, but I seem to be very out of sync with most other reviewers. I'm not tempted to subject myself to the next two installments, even though they are in my library (purchased by a family member, who also couldn't wait for it to end, but had more perseverance than I.) The whole premise of a strong, independent girl, unravels fast with insipid romantic notions thrown at us by the author. I felt manipulated and wished the author had developed the main character based on her initial character strengths, instead of subjecting her to the silliness of a predictable romance novel. A nice beginning, but very predictable end.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|the update for this game has been out for weeks and I am still unable to access the update through the App store. very frustrated with the Amazon App store experience as a whole.
0307477479|3.0|It's a catchy title and it has been on every book award shortlist so I thought how interesting, let's give it a read.  The book is more like a series of short stories using the different characters' lives as the jumping off point to weave the narrative of each chapter.  It was interesting but not engaging or satisfying because I couldn't connect emotionally with any of the characters or story lines.  It is not intellectual.  It is rather an easy read so I don't understand where the \\"post-modern\\", \\"intellectual\\" characterizations come from.  Intellectual is like Phillip Roth and his ilk who I can't stand reading.  My overall reaction after I read it was \\"Feh.\\"  Well written prose, interesting concept for weaving stories and narrative but not how I thought a Pulitzer winning book would read.  Finally, I don't even get what the title refers to at all.
0823023494|3.0|I quite like this book and in particular how the artist includes the entire process of creating a character (i.e all the discarded versions) but every time I flip through the 'Creating (Beautiful) women' chapter I cringe at how awful it is. All his 'cute' girl characters have the same large eyes and upturned nose - a thing my old teacher used to call 'recipe face'. Show me some interesting females of all shapes, sizes, ages and races! Being a female cartoonist/illustrator I found this rather uninspiring.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Regardless of previous posts about rating, this is indeed NOT COMPLETELY TRUE! I only received one song from the album and the digital booklet. Amazon should take care to fix this.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I use Amazon MP3 all the time on both my Droid and my laptop and have never experienced an issue until today. Gaga is the biggest act in the world right now, and so offering up her album for under a buck is of course going to lead to server overload. But the album is well worth the wait, it saved me time waiting on it to deliver in the mail, or dragging my butt out to Best Buy to get it. I guess all those complaining have never waited in line for anything and can't deal, oh well.     p.s. At this point i only have 2 songs downloaded from this purchase(and I already had BTW and Judas as singles), but have heard the whole album. Love it.
0316044938|3.0|The idea of narrating a story from the point of view of a murder victim (Susie) after her murder intrigued me, but I ended up liking the concept more than the actual book.<br /><br />I thought this technique was fascinating at first, especially when Susie was explaining what happened to her.  After that, she told the story from \\"her heaven,\\" as an outside observer of her family and friends.  The problem was, except for the circumstances of her murder, I just didn't find the story all that interesting, regardless of who would have told it to me.  Also, even though the book was longer than it needed to be for what it was, in some ways it wasn't long enough, because it left a couple of major things unresolved at the end.<br /><br />It's not that I disliked the book. I actually enjoyed it at times, but mostly I found it kind of boring. I just didn't find the characters' stories all that compelling, whether told from heaven or from earth.  Maybe I was expecting too much because the book has been on my \\"to-read\\" list for a long time, but I am glad I finally read it.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Lada Gaga IS THE MOST OVERRATED POP STAR IN HISTORY.     She has not done anything that has not already been done before many time over. Artist that come to mind, Alice Cooper, ELTON JOHN, Bootie Collins.    She dresses to get noticed. Her music is just a new version of Disco from the 70's. Each song sounds the same.    You can take anybody off the streets and make her a Lady Gaga!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0051QIGP4|2.0|It's a really good deal still for $0.99, but It only gave me 6 of the songs. I think if they are going to promote a deal they should at least get it right and give you the whole album if that's what it says you are getting.

B003L77TZI|5.0|This album obliterated my expectations. I originally bought it for my girlfriend, but after listening through the album a few times during car rides, I often request it and even borrow it for lonesome car rides. The album is done extremely well in all aspects. Production, Engineering, Mixing, Writing, even the song order is perfect. A+++ work coming from a person who is always slow to compliment.
B00006HYQ5|4.0|I bought this eight years ago with my first laptop to have something small and easy to pack. The size is great for portability, but is easy to use at the same time. The rubberized surface helps make it easier to hold, but it did soften and wear over time. The only issue I've had was with the scroll wheel...after a few months it started having trouble with fast scrolling. Its been through a lot over the years and still works! Overall, I've been happy with it.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great deal. Glad that they fixed the problem with downloads. Lady Gaga is so fun. Get it if you love her.
B002F6R6P4|4.0|The book was in great condition, came in a timely manner and I enjoyed it immensely!  Beautifully written with cultural flavor to educate. I never felt left out by not being from India and appreciated the richness of the cultural differences. Soul searching.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I did not receive all the songs like many others.  I guess I got a few more than most; #3,7,8,9, 11,12.  Don't off the album if you cannot deliver!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|People rating this album with low stars are doing so because they only listened to the samples. If you're going to make a purchasing decision this way, go to YouTube and listen to the full songs before immediately labeling this album a failure. A lot of these songs take more than a first listen to get hooked. And once you do get hooked...you get HOOKED. People are immediately giving the thumbs down because this is a huge departure from her \\"Just Dance\\" days. Well, I loved \\"The Fame\\" as well, but anyone can agree those were the days where she was most influenced by her label. \\"Born This Way\\" is more of Gaga's pure talent, and to see this album get such low ratings is a pity.     TAKE THE TIME TO LISTEN MORE BEFORE YOU GIVE LOW RATINGS. That said, I paid full price for the album before I saw this deal, and I don't care. This is definitely the album of the year!
B002QGUFWE|4.0|If you're not a Lady Gaga fan and looking for the disc to get, then this one is it.  It's got all the hits that have been blaring all over the place.  It's a mixture of dance rock and pop flavors.  Lady Gaga's vocals are incredibly strong and powerful on Disc 1 (The Fame Monster) specifically on \\"Monster\\" and \\"Speechless\\".  She could really do without all the over hype and marketing antics as her music should be able to speak for itself.  Disc 2 (The Fame) also considered her original first disc has a few throwaway tracks, but for the most part has a varied selection of musical styles.
0525422943|5.0|I loved If I Stay and Where She Went was a great sequel-- but you must read If I Stay for it to make any sense.  The characters are people with flaws and families and friends, even if they are amazingly talented.  I read it twice, I enjoyed the story so much.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|She wants your money, take it from me.  I got a copy, and I got it for free.  GA GA GARBAGE....<br /><br />This cd only proves more to the world that she is all hype and no substance.  Her music is shallow, over the top stupid, and she's become the biggest media 'ho of the 21st century.  I can't find a single track to speak well of~!<br /><br />Free from Farmville, I was disappointed with all the studio tricks thrown in....her vocals are like two cats f'ing, her lyrics are that of a 12 year old school girl who just discovered a Thesaurus!  As for her videos, and interviews....tone down the crazy....because that's how you appear.  And the crying jag about how money and fame are ruining your life and make you feel sad that you can't handle it all....isn't this what you wanted or is that just part of the media machine.<br /><br />Truly, Madonna did it better the first time around....GA GA GARBAGE in pale comparison to the artists that she constantly steals material from....take a few years off and write something worth paying for....even the bootleggers can't give this crap away...and she has the balls for charge almost 170.00 for a deluxe package that doesn't even include a personal autograph!<br /><br />i get better songs and more respect for my money from other dance artists like Kristine W and Amber....at least they respond to you....GA GA GARBAGE says she's all about the fans....but we all know she's all about the fan's $$$$
1608191664|5.0|Terrific and amusing book that reflects deep thought about what actually happens in the world. It introduced me to a lot of new ideas about the conventional and rather thoughtless \\"wisdom\\".    I enjoyed his skewering of those who claim \\"Africa is destined for underdevelopment.\\"  He points out that \\"free-market\\" economists only came up with a bunch of \\"structural\\" reasons for lack of African progress when their prescriptions for Africa failed to work. [My comment: this is similar to their current blathering about \\"structural unemployment\\" in the country, when high unemployment is actually a result of failure to use countercyclical stimulus and other bad policy decisions.]  Had African countries followed a path more similar to South Korea of a few decades ago, the slowing of development might well not have ever occurred.  \\"Structural\\" reasons are basically excuses for failed policies.    I also very much enjoyed his sensible observations that education is NOT some sort of magical economic elixir.  I have thought that for years, as I can see that many underdeveloped nations have a large number of very educated people whose talents are not used (which is now becoming commoner in the USA as well, not a good sign).  Although education has much real non-economic value, the \\"education fairy\\" will NOT solve economic woes.    Thumbs up to a terrific and thoughtful book!
B0051QJ83S|4.0|Contrary to every other reviewer, I was able to download the whole thing and have it playing on my iPod as we speak.  Apparently, I must have hit Amazon at the right time of the day.  I think it's a bit unfair to penalize the music for Amazon's unfortunate glitch.  I am not a Lady GaGa fan but thought that at $.99, I couldn't beat it.  As it turns out, I like at least four songs so I'm coming out ahead.  I'm old enough to remember Donna Summer's disco; Lady GaGa sounds like a more technological version of disco.  It's great for dancing and working out.  Thanks, Amazon, for offering such a great deal!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Bad story with two-dimensional characters.  Should definitely be rebooted with more action and less preachiness.   Michael Bay could direct a film adaptation with a bunch of explosions.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|happy to find the 99 cent deal bc i wouldn't have bought the album at full price - not a huge fan of either singles and i expect to only use the album amongst my workout playlist when running    i like the song you & i but none of the other songs have really stood out to me so far,  maybe it will grow on me      and as far as the 99 cent album deal goes - all songs downloaded properly for me so if there was an earlier issue, it seems to be fixed. my review is for the album, not amazon - amazon gets a five star review from me.
B001EN71CW|5.0|A lot of people say a movie or series is good or bad.  I'll just say I like it.  It is enjoyable and fun, while actually dealing with some serious issues.  I had never seen the series when it was on TV, but someone we knew told us it was really good, so when Amazon had the blu ray version as a deal of the day, I looked at the other reviews and figured, why not.  I'm glad I did.  I never expected to enjoy a space-western, but you can sit back, turn your brain off and just enjoy the unusual situations, the banter and action.  If I had to describe the series, I'd say it was Star Trek meets Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy meets Bonanza, but with a light, breezy feel to it.  The combination of characters is unique, as are the situations they find themselves in.  As I said in the title, it's fun!!!<br /><br />Considering that things filmed for TV don't always lend themselves to the the quality blu ray is capable of, this version has very good, but not necessarily great video characteristics.  The audio is extremely good.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I love Lady Gaga. She has an amazing voice! I love her attitude, everything she stands for and stands up for. She was calling this album, \\"the best album of the decade.\\" So of course, I purchased the album. What a huge disappointment. There isn't a single song that stands out. She barely uses her wonderful voice. She yells a lot and just seems to kind of talk the rest of the time. Where is the piano that she so beautifully plays? Where are her heartfelt lyrics that she can belt out like no other artist? It's not a horrible album, but it isn't anything worth owning. If I hadn't paid only .99 for this whole album, I would be demanding my money back.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I already sampled all the songs and think it's brilliant. GaGa is so out there that I avoided her for a long time. Finally saw her on SNL's season finale and, yes... she's wayyy strange, but the girl's got talent and the songs are quite catchy. I know I'll love the whole thing when I can listen to every song in their entirety. I see that many are having problems downloading the songs today, trying to buy today for the 99¢! Why? Just \\"gift\\" the song to your email address and download it later on in the next few days when things quieten down.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|When The Fame came out, I enjoyed it.  When The Fame Monster came out, I adored it!  It took the elements of The Fame and added a little bit more shadow to it.  Born This Way continues down the dark alley The Fame Monster peeked down.  I am in love with this album.  There's a little something for whatever mood you're in -<br />Marry the Night and Hair for when you wanna dance, Government Hooker and Scheibe for when you wanna feel a little dirty and dark, Born This Way and The Edge of Glory for a little encouragement, and You and I for Gaga's version of the piano ballad. (This album's Speechless and/or Brown Eyes :))<br /><br />If I hadn't already pre-ordered the album, I would absolutely take advantage of the 99 cent offer!  I'm tempted to just buy a bunch and gift them to people, even those who aren't huge Gaga fans. haha<br /><br />Note: It's sad that you can't really take the average rating to heart, since people have been giving low ratings to AMAZON and not Gaga for her fantastic work here.  &lt;3 Mother Monster!
0312330537|5.0|This book defies description for anyone who loves adventure in a very different theme. It is exotic for those of us in the West, and a great tale of love, betrayal, redemption, loyalty and torment. I would love to know the author because I am convinced this isn't really fiction...
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|I bought this mirror for my bike which is actually a recumbent (Cruzbike Silvio), It worked where others wouldn't. It might be a bit small for some people, but for my application it worked out great. It's small, light, easy to adjust, and easy to mount. It's not expensive so it would be worth a try if you can't find a mirror that will work.
B003YBUSMW|1.0|This product is being sold as a XBox accessory which is not a true statement. This product works only works on certain games that XBox supports. The customer service at Mad Cats is insufficient and deceitful. In truth, this product should not be sold. I'm surprised that Amazon.com has not removed it from their site.
B001CFLHJA|5.0|This is an album full of cinematic, modern jazz that, quite simply, sounds like no one else but Aaron Parks. The elements of indie rock/art rock (especially in \\"Nemesis\\") give the album a distinct flavor and transcends even the majority of new jazz. The sidemen could not be more perfect: Matt Penman and Eric Harland's constantly shifting polyrhythmic grooves are the perfect complement to Parks' lyrical lines. Guitarist Mike Moreno, although less noticeable, has a textural sound that falls somewhere between Ben Monder and Kurt Rosenwinkel. The playing livens Parks' haunting, dramatic, and playful compositions; the songs come to life like the characters in an aural cinema. If you dig this album, then check out Aaron Parks, Eric Harland, and Matt Penman with Joshua Redman in the brand new album James Farm (it's fantastic).
B00013RC8O|5.0|Car Fan? 70's era fan? Action movie fan? It's got it all! This is up there with Bullitt, Two Lane Blacktop and Funny Car Summer with the basics to any good car fanatic's movie collection.
B001EN71CW|5.0|No show has ever done more with less. I was not a \\"Joss\\" fan until I watched this a little over a year ago.  I spent much of my pre-Firefly time making fun of all the nerds mad about this shows cancellation.  Once my wife finally talked me into watching, I understood and agreed with the \\"nerd anger\\".  The first 10-15min of the first episode is a bit hard to sit through, but if you can manage you will watch one of the finest TV series to even grace the old boob tube.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|What if we don't use the Cloud player?? I have been waiting since 8am Central time. My songs from Amazon are moved  to my iTunes.... I am getting impatient because I want to listen to this album so bad! Can anyone help??! I love Gaga!!
0307279189|4.0|I am not a running.  But this book is fascinating.  I read it in two days!  I loved all the research and connections between the subjects and chapters.  hats off.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is a great dance record with edgy electronic notes and great melodies. Its amazing how Lady Gaga did things totally differently, releasing so many songs before the actual album release date and then totally releasing the whole album on youtube for listening. AND THEN offering this digital download for 99 cents. THIS IS MAJOR! very grateful for her openness
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This disjointed piece of trash is an album? Look LG, you have a cheap Madonna sound. Just admit you are trying to rip her off and she actually inspired you.    FYI for people crying about the cloud player you need to drill down and download the album not the single.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is among the most perfect movies I've ever seen: script, acting, scenery, accuracy (but I'm no expert), and direction.  As soon as it ended, I restarted it, intending to just review the opening credits, but watched all of it again.
B004M20YDU|3.0|This album has some good remixes.  It's something that I could put in and listen to a track or two, but it's not something that I could play all the way through in one sitting.
B0009PRNVK|1.0|I am sorry but I have to confirm that this release is very poor, both where audio and video are concerned. I have three different releases of Maiden England including this particular one, which is the worst by far. I am talking about the 2003 ROOM 101 Entertainment release.    Let's be quite clear for all you guys who don't know the product :  Maiden England is arguably (IMHO) the best pro-shot Maiden gig ever. 'Arry spent many hours producing and choosing the best scenes from those 2 days at the NEC. (I remember him saying that he spent hours synchronizing images from Nov. 27th with the soundtrack of the 28th, because the solo bit in Killers wasn't shot exactly the way he expected on the first night)    The problem is : Maiden England was offically released in VHS in 1994, along with an audio CD. The quality of the CD is stunning (LPCM for sure), but it's audio only and 2 tracks are missing (ie Can I Play with Madness and Hallowed Be Thy Name).   Maiden England was unofficially released on DVD ; this is the present product : Image is mediocre and sound is terrible (compared to the official release)    The third release is THE one so far and by far: it is an obsolete format called CDV or LD (compact disc video or Laser Disc) which was released in 1989. A CDV was a 2-sized disc, the size of a vinyl LP with the colour of gold. If by chance you ever get a multi-disc player from the late 1980's, try to get this Maiden England CDV. Image is absolutely perfect and sound is AC3... not LPCM but so much better than the sound on this crappy DVD.    But most probably the best is yet to come : I'm sure Steve Harris is gonna release a Blu-Ray for that one pretty soon. Be patient enough to eventually get a quality product and not to get screwed with this one.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'll be patient for the entire album to be available in the cloud, I can imagine that Amazon is experiencing a much higher volume of orders/downloads than normal today. I have the digital booklet and 1 song so far, I ordered approx 2 hours ago.
B0051QJ83S|4.0|I just downloaded this and it did take awhile but I did get all the songs. Some people need to exercise some thing called patience. It's a good thing. Anyways great deal and great songs to work out to.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Because of the overwhelming demand for this brand new, popular album priced at $0.99, Amazon is having trouble keeping its servers from overloading.  This is not the fault of Lady Gaga.  People are rating this album with one star because of technical issues.    Please, be patient.  You will get your ridiculously cheap album. Be happy such a deal was up for grabs and save your whining for something that warrants it.
0143116177|5.0|Niall Ferguson is a very, very good writer.  Considering the depth he goes into, I'm amazed at how accessible he makes this book to the general public.  Once in a while I might not understand a highly specific and detailed point, but other than that, I understood all of it.    Money's definition is argued within and among various linguists, philosophers, sociologists, historians, politicians, economists, workers, owners, buyers, sellers, and the list goes on.  Instead of trying to come up with one definition, Ferguson gives a contextual explanation and analysis, from the first examples of trade to Wall Street and beyond.  In fact, far from a definition, he offers more of a biography.    Money is complicated.    Yet through tracing its history -- AND the history that was influenced BY money (as Ferguson notes, pretty much all of it) -- we can grasp it with more clarity than ever before.  Well, at least I can!    So, I give it five stars.  As you can see in my title, I loved reading this book. A+. Superb. Excellent.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|When I had seen the previews for this movie I thought it looked like a typical plot but had Bradley Cooper and Robert Di Niro so I figured what the heck, lets go see it because im a fan of both actors.     This movie definetly overdeliverd my expectations, and if you have a imagination you will appreciate the plot and how Bradley Cooper uses being limitless to his maximize his potential, but of course like every great movie there has to be a so called bad guy (Di Niro) and Cooper and Di Niro had great on screen chemistry. This movie is filled with twists and turns all over a pill that lets Cooper use 100% of his brain and of course what will happen when the pills run out??      I would reccomend to rent this movie if your a fan of interesting plots and great actors, and buy it if you have a imagination and are curious just how far a person will go to be LIMITLESS??
B000VSAEYI|3.0|I bought this pool for my 19 month old daughter.  I was a little hesitant because there were several reviews claiming that their product had arrived with holes in it. Well I took a chance on it just being their mishandling of the product and perhaps they were the ones creating the holes.  This is not the case!  The much anticipated pool arrived, and I immediately went and filled it up with the air compressor. My little girl was very excited.  We started to fill up the pool...within minutes I noticed the palm tree was beginning to droop and my heart sank.  Sure enough, within the hour the entire thing was flat.  I had been very careful upon opening the package and also had a bought a tarp to place the pool upon to keep it from being punctured by anything on the ground.  I was very angry. To add to my frustration I need to mention that the bottom of this pool is very slick.  I had not read this in previous reviews, and felt I should mention it. My little girl and both of her friends continually fell in the pool until I bought some of those skid stickers for the bathtub and placed in the bottom of it.  Ok back to the main issue. My dad had showed me an old trick one time..you put soapy water in a squirt bottle and spray all over the inflated parts of the pool after you have inflated it, and tada, everywhere there is a hole it forms bubbles and makes a whistling sound. Upon doing this to my 3 hour old pool and after patching 9 holes with the handy dandy patch that comes with the pool I felt we were ready for a test drive. I reinflated the pool and added the water and it has been two weeks and still no problems.  My daughter loves, loves, loves this pool and it really is perfect for what she needed at home. However if you purchase this item be prepared to put 2-3 hours into patching the holes. Other than that I have no complaints.  Oh and I read on some reviews that the slide was useless, but I filled this pool up with an air compressor and my little one weighs 32 lbs and the slide works great.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|purchased this... but struggling with being able to download the items... I work in the IT dept at my work and it isn't an issue on my end....
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" tells the story of King George VI as he works to overcome a speech impediment, which is a huge problem especially with the advent of radio and its key role in allowing the monarch to communicate with his subjects.  While this personal struggle is the keystone of the movie, many other stories are told as well:  the relationship between King George V and his two sons, romance of Edward and Mrs. Simpson, the abdication by King Edward VIII which was required to marry Mrs. Simpson, as well as the World War that appears eminent.  Quite an undertaking to tell all of this (and more) in one movie and it succeeds completely - human interest and history all rolled into one package.<br /><br />This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  The story line is intriguing, the acting fabulous and the cinematography is fantastic.  I very rarely watch a movie that second or third time, but this particular film will go into that special category that will be watched again and again - absolutely fabulous.<br /><br />On a side note:  there was a bit of fun in noticing the many actors that played roles in the Harry Potter movies.  While vastly different films, the English thespians showed their range by pulling off both so very, very well.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This album is edgy, but not outstanding; catchy, but not trend-setting; special, but not the best.<br />I love several songs on here, especially Electric Chapels and Hard Metal Lover because they reminiscent Britney's Blackout materials. I also enjoy Edge of Glory and Judas, despite sounding like other songs, but at least they are radio friendly and catchy.<br />ScheiBe, Government Hooker, Bloody Mary, Marry The Night is really edgy and special, but looks like the production is trying so hard to give them special touches, the whole things are just messy and the lyrics is even under Katy Perry writing levels.<br />The rest are just flat. I especially hate You and I. If Gaga were to write this for somebody else to sing, it would be better, her vocals is very spiky and annoying.<br />One last thing, while this album is, in my opinion, on par with Rihanna's Hard and Ke$ha's Cannibal, the promotion and selling campaign is ridiculous and desperate. I mean, selling at McDonalds, and paying Best Buy and Amazon to sell it for $0.99, you are a world-class and very talented artist, you can do better and higher than that. I guess now she is just desperate for record-breaking numbers, when the quality is going down day by day. Disappointing!
0439023521|4.0|Sometimes I can be really slow getting around to reading things in my TBR stack and I have been slow getting to this novel. I have had several people mention it to me over time, but just recently a good friend told me I really NEEDED to read this. She was incredibly animated in her enthusiasm so I decided to bite the bullet and read it. I typically don't enjoy YA fiction, with the exception of Harry Potter which I think is wonderful (and stood in line at midnight on more than one occasion to purchase the latest installment).<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is set in what used to be the United States of America. The country as we know it has collapsed and a new country named Panem has replaced it. The new government has total control of its citizens who live in twelve districts and the Capitol (located in the Rocky Mountains). Every year, the Capitol oversees the Hunger Games when 24 young people, one boy and one girl from each district, fight until only one of them is left alive. Katniss is our main character and is a 16-year-old girl competing for her district in what was formerly Appalachia. The boy competing from her district is Peeta, the baker's son who she has encountered before but really doesn't know and appears to be very unprepared for the task at hand. The novel begins on the day the two teenagers are selected and follows all the preparations leading up to the Games, the Games themselves, and what happens to the survivor after everything is over.<br /><br />As a story, I found myself reading very quickly to find out what was going to happen and read it in just a couple of days. It is well-written and while not terribly complex, it definitely doesn't \\"talk down\\" to the younger audience it has been written for. I also appreciated how much better it is than much of the YA literature that is available with their major themes of popularity, overt sex, and superficial fluff. While there is the requisite love interest(s) it is just one theme of many, not the center of the book --- much appreciated by this particular mother. The basis of the story is disturbing (children killing children) so a parent would need to be very aware of the level of maturity of the young person reading it to know if the subject matter is appropriate.<br /><br />Bottom line - enjoyed it enough to continue on with the second book in the series and to recommend it (with qualifications) to other parents of young adults.r of the book --- much appreciated by this particular mother.

B00003CXA6|4.0|At 4 hours and 14 minutes, GETTYSBURG ranks as one of the longest U.S.-made theatrical releases ever. I wasn't surprised at all to discover that GETTYSBURG started out as a proposed TV miniseries. It has a distinct \\"made-for-TV\\" feel to it. However, unlike other miniseries, GETTYSBURG spares virtually no expense in portraying the pivotal 1863 battle in Pennsylvania that (together with Vicksburg, fought at the same time some 2000 miles away) changed the course of the Civil War.<br /><br />GETTYSBURG was based on Michael Shaara's outstanding Civil War novel, [[ASIN:034540727X The Killer Angels]]. Although GETTYSBURG was counted as a flop in its limited theatrical release, it has become a favorite in Home Video release, and a mainstay of schoolhouse lessons on the Civil War. Within its bounds, it is excellent.<br /><br />One part of GETTYSBURG's excellence is the doing of Civil War buff Ted Turner who backed this project to the full, providing funds enough for meticulous detail. Another part of GETTYSBURG's excellence is provided by the hundreds of Civil War reenactors who populate the screen bringing their unpolished sincerity and love of history to the film. Yet another part of the film's excellence is provided by the National Park Service which allowed much of GETTYSBURG to be filmed on the battlefield itself. And yet again, the performances of the lead actors capture the sense of grandeur and tragedy that pervades the air at Gettysburg National Park to this day.<br /><br />Of particular note are the performances of Tom Berenger as General James Longstreet, CSA and Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua Chamberlain, USA. Chamberlain's valiant defense of Little Round Top on the second day of the battle denied Confederate forces the opportunity to flank Union lines and roll up General George Meade's army in a messy, bloody package.<br /><br />In Berenger's and Daniel's performances it is crystal clear that both men, Longstreet and Chamberlain, profoundly feel the pathos of the war, that hideous sense of brothers fighting brothers, killing each other. Commanders on opposite sides were, or had been, personal friends, often roommates at West Point. The Union ranks included Southern soldiers from every State except South Carolina. The Confederate General Commanding, Robert E. Lee, had been offered command of the Union armies prior to the outset of war. The Civil War was nightmarish: Large bore, long range, low velocity late Nineteenth Century weapons technology met early Nineteenth Century Napoleonic field tactics that had men bunched in battle squares often face to face, making every battle a killing field; military medicine was all but nonexistent. Some 52,000 men died or were wounded in three days at Gettysburg, about half the total who fought. This almost matches the number of losses in Korea (53,000 in three years) and Vietnam (58,000 in ten years).<br /><br />Does GETTYSBURG have weaknesses? A few. The theatrical beards worn by most of the men look too obvious (a minor point, but still noticeable). The onscreen battle is almost antiseptically free of gore (a legacy, no doubt, of the film's intended \\"miniseries\\" status) as opposed to the real battle, which was a charnel house personified. But by far it's biggest weakness is the casting of Martin Sheen (normally an excellent actor) as Robert E. Lee. In what is a small part, Sheen simply doesn't carry the role. He projects none of Lee's charisma and none of Lee's inborn elegance, so evident even in photographs, Sheen's Lee comes across as truculent and unassured. I've read that Sheen was cast as Lee only a day or two before production began, and that Sheen knew virtually nothing about Lee or the Civil War at that time; so perhaps his \\"generic General\\" is forgivable, or would be, were Robert E. Lee not such a central personage in Civil War history.<br /><br />An engrossing film, GETTYSBURG needs to be seen by all Americans.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|This album is amazing and has a positive core message of loving who you are throughout the album. And boy is it one sonic, thumping, pounding, rush! Stand-outs include the mega bangers: Marry The Night, Government Hooker, Sheibe, Electric Chapel, Edge Of Glory, Bloody Mary and so many more! This is one mean, cool, yet uplifting record. The 80's are back with musicians like Clarence Clemmons from the E Street Band and Brian May (guitarist) from Queen recording with GAGA on this very album! Mega producers like Mutt Lange, Red One, and Fernando Garibay bring their A game. GAGA brought the heat! Anyone even slightly disappointed with the first couple singles (wishing this album has what made The Fame and Fame Monster such a dance-gasm) will love them once they hear they have such a amazing home and purpose in making the album a complete experience. Don't worry, you will be dancing your hearts out Little Monsters and new fans alike.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|A pesar de todo lo que se ha hablado de Britney, no se puede negar que durante su carrera ha contribuido con diversos éxitos que cubrieron los rankings mundiales con melodías simples y de rápida llegada, que es lo que el pop busca como objetivo. Justamente este CD compila en forma cronológica todos sus mejores temas de su primera etapa musical, tal vez la de mayores éxitos y lo hace de una forma impecable. Por lo tanto la lista de canciones es de éxitos probados y una compra obligada para cualquier fan de Britney. Un CD altamente recomendable.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I saw this in theaters and loved it. I got the DVD and love it. This is exactly what I wanted from a Scott Pilgrim movie. I read the books before seeing it and was pretty happy with what was and wasn't in the movie. Sure, we don't see Knives' Dad, but he only exists as a Red Herring, so he's not really essential to the story. And I'd have liked to have seen the fight scene between Knives and Ramona in the Library, but there is a similar fight scene in the club at the end so that's fine with me.    The video game references fit perfectly into the movie and the soundtrack is fantastic.   I really think of this movie as a Music movie as much as a Comic Book or Video Game movie. It wouldn't be the same without the influence of any of those things.     This is probably my favorite movie of 2010, but then I didn't really see that many movies that year, so I'll say it's my favorite Comedy of 2010, it beat out Hot Tub Time Machine at the very least.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I'd heard about this based-on-a-true-story dog story on MSN's Best Dog Movies. I happened upon it, and settled in. Unlike most dog movies, or other animal-based stories, this film is not trite, sappy, cute. It's a shame that the audience that embraced Marley & Me didn't find this film as well. While Marley & Me is an enjoyable film about all the fun and frustrations of raising a dog from puppyhood to senior status, Hachi has an understated dignity. Marley & Me, dog integrates with family and learns his place within the pack. In Hachi, there's no pack. He's a one-man dog. Therein lies the difference between this dog movie and all others. It spins the stereo-type, and that's it's magic.    Richard Gere's naturalistic, understated performance as Hachi's owner sets up the plot. But the dog carries the movie. It's all about loyalty, trust, and unconditional love. Nice touches such as seeing the world from the dog's POV, in black & white as dogs are color-blind, sets up the finale which will leave no cheek unwet. If you're not crying 15 minutes from the end, check your pulse. You are dead. RIP.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Changing my review from 1 star to 4. more than 3 hours later the album's more than 90% downloaded. what has downloaded so far is amazing and i'm really happy :)
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Well, since I can't hear the entire album due to the fiasco with \\"Cloud\\" over this release, I will review the 3 I was able to download but if these are similar to the rest, I'll still hit my target. These so far sound like copies of other stuff, music I have already heard from her.....seriously....NOTHING NEW HERE. I think her creative peak has been met and she has no more creative blood running through her veins. What I have heard so far is EXACTLY like her other stuff, I mean I can almost sing her other stuff, word for word, with this supposed new stuff. Very disappointed but I'm glad it was only 99 cents as it is indeed Dollar Store material. This seems to happen with all artists who rocket to stardom too fast. They leave what creativeness they had behind as they shoot to stardom. If these few tracks are what gaga is putting out it is a sure sign that her creativeness is no longer with her. If there's any consolation.....most of her older stuff is still good.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Amazon, your site is available world-wide. The promotions for this deal are being seen world-wide. Why aren't you providing this offer world-wide? I would very much like to buy this album but refuse to pay over ten times more just because of where I happen to live.  So I came to the site to get an album but came away with nothing. One star.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|the dvd arrived 2 days after I ordered it- very impressed, and the disc was in mint condition- not even a smudge. :) very pleased, and would highly recommend ordering from them.
B0051QK87S|5.0|I purchased this album but only downloaded 5 songs! What's going on, Amazon? This is probably the biggest album in the last year - and you screw up digital delivery? Come on!<br /><br />That said, this album is EPIC. A must have!!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Is this some kind of Amazon scam or something???   I can only play and download 1 song (even though I bought entire album)!!!  I bought it for a second time, and only 4 songs are playable!!!   I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Well no offense to the album, I think its great and the deal on this is awesome, but this review is mainly focused on Amazon.  After several agonizing hours of waiting, I've received nothing. Not even a song or the booklet. Now I've bought several albums and songs off Amazon but this is just ridiculous.  Another thing about amazon is the inability to download your music else where, unless its on the cloud player crap. I mean what if you wanted to download your purchases on to another device or what happens when your hard drive is wiped clean and there is no stored data of any of the purchases that you've made.   Amazon should revamp their system in order to make their faithful customers re-download their songs where and whenever they choose. Not every one can spend the money to purchase the same item again just to obtain what they already have.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This downloading application has literally taken 5 hours to download ten songs.  There is no problem with my internet, I have the most recent version- it's just an awful application.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I just purchased this item and I'm only being given 5 songs from a 14 song album. I didn't read anywhere that the daily deal was exclusively for only PART of the album...Needless to say, for the first time, I'm disappointed with my Amazon purchase.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I like many others have been woting for this cd for a very long time. It is simply amazing a little darker that your usual Gaga but Mother Monster can do no wrong in my eyes! I LOVE IT!!!!!!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|The only other Donna Summer album I owned was a greatest hits compilation. So I do enjoy her music but not a big enough of a fan to buy all of her CD's. That may be changing as this was a most pleasant surprise. I heard \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" at a club and kinda liked it. It was a good (not great) song and I was just in the mood to buy something that was a bit different for me. So I bought the CD with low expectations and I was completely shocked to how much I loved it. While \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" was good it was just a preview for the rest of the excellent songs. \\"Mr. Music\\", \\"Fame\\", \\"Crayons\\" are all top notch songs that are fun to dance with, exercise with, etc. \\"The Queen is Back\\" is one of the best pop songs I have heard in years. It actually seems like a tribute to Donna's long time fans. \\"Be Myself Again\\" is the token pop ballad here but is done very well. The best of them all though is \\"Slide Over Backwards\\". It's a very unique song with Donna using a Tina Turner style of singing. It has a very real sound that will make you forget she's rich and famous. While the above mentioned songs are the best (all 5 star songs) the others are very well done too. Too often I buy a pop album only to be disappointed that I wind up only liking 2 or 3 songs. It was nice finally buying a pop CD that I not only loved but actually like it more the longer I own it. Well done Donna. Here's hoping we hear more from you soon.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I wish Amazon allowed returns for digital downloads. I'd surely return this. I'm a big fan of Gaga, but this album is bad. It sounds like a bad 80s album. Well, at least the songs I could listen to. Amazon only allowed me to download 9 of the 15 songs I bought. So maybe the 6 songs I didn't get are worth it. I'm so glad I only paid 99cents for this thing. I'd be so mad if I paid full price. Sorry, Gaga, I think you missed the mark on this one. Better luck next time.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I am very sad to see that amazon didnt test the possible issues with offering this album for 99 cents before they made this promotion live.  I ordered 4 hours ago and got 4 songs immediately but have yet to get any others.  Thanks for the 99 cent album amazon but no thanks for not testing your servers first.  I guess I am going to pay in time what I wouldnt be paying in money.
0670022411|5.0|An engrossing read - my only displeasure was to finish and realize that the next book isn't due out for a year!!!!  I would call it Twilight for grownups!

0321356683|5.0|Original review written by Lauro Canonica, JUG Lugano, [...]     I have many years of Java development behind me so when people recommended this book I thought: Uff, one more book about Java. How is it possible to write an interesting book after all the already existing Java books? Then I started reading random sections and I had to change my mind. The book is written for experienced Java developers. It won't explain the basics of programming in Java (nothing for newbies) but it concerns itself with the real issues of developers.    The book is divided in 78 items and, for every topic, it comes with clear explanations and recommended solutions. The explanations are mostly concise and to the point (only a few times did I have to skip some pages of, in my opinion, theoretical discussions).  This book is actually a second edition (revised for Java 6) and was started for Java 5. So particular attention is given to the new features of Java 5 such as Generics, Autoboxing, Enums and Annotations.      If you are wondering if you should read the book just check if you know the answer to the following simple questions.  * What are the advantages of a static factory over a constructor?  * What's wrong with the statement String s= new String(\\"hello\\"); ?  * What are the dangers of Autoboxing?  * What are the dangers of overriding equals?  * How do I eliminate unchecked warnings?  * When are Lists better than Arrays?  * What's the problem with float and double?  * Why is implementing serializable a delicate issue?    If you know all the answers then you still might want to read it for a clear and precise explanation.    The fact that the book doesn't have to be read from cover to cover following a strict order makes it a book that you can pick when you have 10 minutes to spare and just read one item at the time. That's, at least, how I read it and it improved or reassured my knowledge of the Java Language.    So I'm recommending the book and I say: Good job Joshua!
B00004RFFI|1.0|Just to prepare anyone who might accidentally watch this: roughly 50% of the dialogue consists of the word \\"hurry\\" or the phrase \\"come on\\", combined in all their possible permutations.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Stop complaining. Obviously everyone is trying to download this album all at once. It's a lot for the server to handle and they're working on it. Amazon is too big of a company to cheat you over. Just have patience and be excited that you only had to pay a dollar for this great album!

0307477479|4.0|A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD is a cluster of 13 loosely connected stories that skip forward and backward in time. At the center of this cluster is Bennie Salazar, a music producer, who Egan presents as a businessman in turmoil (chapter 2), a young and mediocre musician in a punk band (3), and a sixtyish manager hyping a decrepit roadie star (13). Other chapters feature:<br /><br />o Sasha, Bennie's administrative assistant, who Egan presents as a person with strange passive/aggressive tendencies (1), a damaged college student (10), a teenage runaway in Naples (11), and a mom (12).<br /><br />o Lou Kline, a producer in the music industry who gave Bennie his start.  Egan shows the very successful Lou on safari with his children (4) and in senescence by his pool in LA (5).<br /><br />o Members or groupies of the Flaming Dildos, Bennie's punk band, who live sad family lives (3) or are unable to connect, except through their music, to the work-a-day world (6).<br /><br />o Stephanie, Bennie's wife, who copes with suburban life and infidelity (7). At the same time, Stephanie is a publicist who works for Dolly, a businesswoman with unsavory PR clients (8). And, her brother Jules, a journalist who profiles celebrities, is regaining his footing after rage overwhelms him during an interview.<br /><br />Some of the chapters in GOON SQUAD are absolutely first-rate. These include chapter six, where Egan explores the comically deranged mind of Scotty Hausmann; chapter seven, when Dolly enhances the public profile of a genocidal dictator; and chapter eight, when Jules acts out his self-hatred. Chapter 13 is also very good, where Egan shows how technology rewards unscrupulous behavior, permits wonderful moments of sharing and artistry, and gives expression to character.<br /><br />The term goon squad appears twice in this book. In each case, the term elucidates the fate of a musician; one had great early success and is depleted with time; the other was a late-late achiever, whose time in the limelight comes magically after decades off the grid. This suggests the goon squad refers to the ups and downs of fate, which Egan seems to see as both arbitrary and self-determined. Anything can happen, these stories seem to say.<br /><br />Some chapters in GOON SQUAD are very funny. In others, the satire is highly telling, especially when it aims at celebrity culture and its enablers. But the structure of this book--stories that jump from character to character and from decade to decade--does eliminate its narrative momentum and I found GOON SQUAD just good enough to finish.<br /><br />I rounded up to four stars. But for readers who understand the contemporary music scene, this may well be a five-star novel.des off the grid.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|This is a deep, touching, exquisitely crafted film. Everything is where it belongs. The focus is on humaneness  - human fragility, authenticity and the mystery of life & death. Excellent script, great acting, impeccable directing. Eastwood took a bit of a risk here but he pulls it off as the master he is.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Niiiiiice!!! I was gonna buy the album at regular price anyways because I am such a big fan, but this is great. Her music is worth so much more than the .99 you pay for here. She makes me happy with her non comformist music and off the wall lyrics. Love you GAGA. Thank You AMAZON :0))
B004UUKDNA|4.0|This is a highly anticipated CD release by the trio of Mark Foster, Cubbie Fink & Mark Ponitus since forming the band Foster The People in the late 2009. This great effort CD release (10 tracks), titled 'Torches' opens with a solid track/gem/stand-out track \\"Helena Beat\\" : a techno-pop track with wonderful high pitched vocals & melody. This is my favourite track from this CD & hence the title of my review. \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" is a great 'altered voiced' second track. Other great tracks include \\"Call It What You Want\\" (up-tempo track with great vocals & melody), \\"Waste\\", \\"I Would Do Anything For You\\" (beautiful vocals/keyboard combination) & \\"Houdini\\" (a techno-pop-dance track with some interesting whistling sounds). Okay tracks include \\"Don't Stop (Color On The Walls)\\", \\"Life On The Nickel\\", \\"Miss You\\" (rather 'noisy' music track with good vocals) & \\"Warrant\\" (up-tempo track with drum/techno sound/bass combination). The band is heavily influenced by alternative greats & dance/techno sounds producing interesting pop/dance sound. Foster The People debuts here with the CD 'Torches' to light up  the way to a successful career from here henceforth, a recommended CD listening.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Only one song and the digital booklet downloaded.  The rest show in the cloud player but are not accessible to play there or download.  The order is not showing as completed, so I have no way to contact Amazon about this error.  This \\"bargain\\" is going to turn out to be a lot of aggravation!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|What can I say that has not been said already. This is a phenomenal album for a phenomenal price. The slow download is to be expected when 100,000,000 people have probably ordered it @ $0.99 (do the math) This was a stress test for Amazon's cloud MP3 service.     Did it go perfectly? No.     Will Amazon make it right? Yes.     Is this a fabulous deal? Yes    Amazon as well as other cloud providers.. (Google, Microsoft, et al are you paying attention?) will learn from this and be able to provide even better service in the future. Don't give \\"Born This Way\\" a bad rating because your songs took a long time to download. Rate the content not the delivery.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|This is not Lady Gaga's usual style but I like some of the songs based on the samples. And for 99cents it is a steal:) I know that it taking time to download, we have to be patient the cloud crashed from the overload of downloads ( I called customer service).
192660654X|5.0|After reading The Hound of the Baskervilles I can see why, Sir Arthur Conon Doyle has a way of writing that puts you right in the midst of the action. The way Dr Watson talks about Holmes and about his own letters and diaries make everything seem real.<br /><br />The story tells of the investigation of the hound and the curse and the real mysteries that lay behind the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. Can Holmes and Watson find out the truth before it's too late for Sir Henry as well?<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book, once I got past the different writing style and language that the book had to modern books. The story kept me gripped right until the end. I never found parts of it unnecessary or slow like some books I've read.<br /><br />I have to admit I never thought this would be the kind of book I'd read but I'm really glad I did. It puts modern day detective and thriller stories to shame. I would urge anyone with an interest in this genre to read this book. This is how novels should be written, interesting, fast paced and enjoyable. I can't wait to read more Sherlock Holmes novels.
0399250573|5.0|Amazing! When this book ended so did part of my childhood. I started reading Alex when I was 12. I'm now 18 and heading off to college into the fall so it truly seems like when Alex ended so did my childhood. Really Alex Rider is my all time favorite series and offers so much to all readers of any age.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|My cousin and I hang out together so her parents can have a \\"date night\\". One of the many things we have in common is that we like Lady Gaga's music, so why wouldn't I snag the entire album for the price of a track I know we both love (\\"Born This Way\\")? I can't wait to see the look on her face the next time I see her, and I play the whole album from my netbook.
0393035158|5.0|Not a review but a comment. Sam Harris's reference to a \\"Creator of the Universe,\\" unless an irony that I missed, provides the answer to many of today's theological difficulties, most of which Harris has enumerated. So, what about the old clock maker theory of a creator who started the eternal clock and then went off to start other clocks. This would absolve the creator from blame for what has happened in Earth's history. The blame would fall squarely on the shoulders of those who have wreaked havoc in the name of belief. The Deists who were responsible for the thinking in our Constitution had it right: Faith as a component of government leads to evil things, witness the Inquisition, the Hitler-led Nazis and the Lenin-Stalinist communists. History continually bears witness to the cruelty of faith-based governments.  To put a positive spin on Karl Marx, \\"Rationalists revolt; you have nothing to lose but your brains.\\"
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Amazon acknowledges that there has been a technical issue with this download.  There is no ETA for solution were given, explanations are very vague. Though there is no download available, and the tech support does not tell when it becomes available, Amazon has no intention to  take off this promotion album from its web site until the issue is fully fixed. Is this a scam???   Please  don't waste $1 , your time and your nerves!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Like many others, I was thrilled to download this album for $1! However, I only got 4-5 songs, the rest are not available! This isn't very fair. I see that others are having this problem, but some even got 8 songs, thats more than I got, and we all paid the same price. Very disappointed!
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Apperently Lady Gaga is only allowed to sing songs like Poker Face and Just Dance. Because with the negative reviews on this album \\"it's not like her other albums\\" Well damn, thank gawd it's not.  Lady Gaga can actually break through musical boundries and bring back the fabulous music from the 80s and 90s which I grew up on and listen to quite often!  Yes the album is all over the place but it is fabulous!!!  Not a waste of money at all :) :)  ScheiBe, Hair, Mary the Night and The Edge of Glory are probably best songs on the album, amazing!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Like many others out there I woke up to an e-mail from Amazon with this $.99 Lady Gaga offer and took advantage of it. I am still trying to get all the downloads and figure I will eventually. She is popular, the price is right and I think the system is loaded down trying to fill all the requests.  Others have said the same, don't rate the service here talk about the content. This is my first lady Gaga purchase and I like it, not all of it but enough to say I'm glad I bought it.  Stay on topic, be patient breath in and out, come back and review this when you have had a chance to listen to the music.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|I've only seen a couple of episodes, but so far it's enthralling...plan to buy or rent as soon as whole series is avail.  The story takes place in a sort of medieval land of wizardry....it has some \\"magic\\", but the story isn't centered around it.  It's a real sort of story, and really pretty fascinating.
B00000J7J4|5.0|the cd was received as promised. Santana's music is legendary and goes without saying! Cd arrive like new condition without scratches and case intack! I am very pleased with this purchase as I've been with previous Amazon.com orders. I would buy from this seller again if the circumstances deem them.thank you for the opportunity to comment, R.A.Lopez
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lady Gaga's new CD Born This Way is truly amazing.  It has great dance beats, and the lyrics are very catchy.  She is truly an amazing artist with tons of creativity and talent.  The music is also mixed so you get a variety of different tones and beats.  I love every single song on this album, but my favs are government hooker; Bloody Mary, and JUDAS.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|Every once in a while I like to relax with a beer and real \\"guy\\" movie. You know, something like Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. So when the expendables came out I thought, \\"Now, THIS looks like the mother of all guy movies. And it is...if by guy movie you mean a badly written, poorly editied, nonsensical mishmash of action sequences where you don't care if everyone (heroes included) dies in the next ridiculous explosion.<br /><br />I wanted desperately to like this movie. With so many top names in action you'd think it would be great. There is even a brief cameo by Schwarzenegger as Stallone's long lost rival. I enjoyed the way those two played off of each other and hinted at a few of their other movies in the dialogue but it wasn't enough to really make me smile. Most of the time I felt as though the movie was saying, \\"Look! We got all these cool actions stars! Isn't that neat?!\\" as if that was enough to make me forget how awful the movie was.<br /><br />Movies like this seem to forget that we need to care about the characters first and then they can take us on a ride. We as audiences can forgive an awful lot if we care about the characters. For instance I wanted to care when Statham's character was so distraught over his girlfriend dumping him that he can't throw his trademark knives straight but honestly all I could think was \\"who are these people?!\\". These are set pieces, not characters. They are defined by their weapons and visual traits. You've got the \\"Big Black Guy with a Big Gun\\", the \\"Asian Guy who knows kung-fu\\" the \\"Giant Guy\\", the \\"Knife Guy\\", the \\"Tattoo Guy\\". For villains you've got the \\"Evil White Guy in a Suit\\", the \\"Generic Hispanic Dictator/General\\". There is even a \\"Damsel in Distress\\" who we never really feel is in distress but rather, patiently waiting for the end of her scenes.<br /><br />A word on editing styles. I know it has become popular to mimic the \\"shaky cam\\" action sequences in the \\"Bourne\\" movies but it must be done well to succeed. In \\"Bourne\\" the camera may have been shaky but we still had a sense of timing and flow. We felt every hit, cringed at every injury. In Expendables what you get is so many cuts to so many different angles in such rapid succession that your eyes get tired and your mind wanders. You start thinking random thoughts like, \\"I wonder what my cholesterol is?\\" \\"I should be doing laundry today\\" \\"I wonder if Guinea pigs make good pets?\\"<br /><br />Now the CG. If you can tell, instantly, that every knife that one character throws is CG, then you need to re-animate those scenes. There was not one believable piece of Cg in this entire movie. To give an idea of quality think made for SyFy network Sunday afternoon monster movie.<br /><br />In all, this was a disappointing sleepwalk through nonsense and clichés. Between this and the latest Rambo movie I think Stallone should hang up his spurs.
B004IFYMWK|4.0|Based upon the true story of a CIA agent's encounter with politics, Fair Game is a suspenseful tale about the career of Valerie Plame and her eventual struggle with the US government.  Naomi Watts does an excellent job playing Plame and Sean Penn is outstanding as her husband, diplomat Joe Wilson.<br /><br />The CIA had been watching Iraq for several years.  During the war in Afghanistan, a rumor surfaced suggesting that Iraq was seeking material to make nuclear weapons.  The Vice President sent his chief of Staff to the CIA to learn if Iraq was a threat to peace.<br /><br />Due to the White House request, CIA leaders asked Joe Wilson, a former US Ambassador in Africa, to travel to Africa and use his contacts to discover whether Niger actually supplied Iraq with yellow-cake uranium.  Joe agrees to take an informal trip to Niger, at his own expense, to learn whatever he could.<br /><br />Valerie's husband Joe gets her in trouble.  Ambassador Wilson travels to Africa and finds that the report about Niger selling nuclear material is false.  After the President, in his State of the Union address, contends that Iraq obtained weapons grade uranium from Niger, he writes a newspaper article that challenges the President's word.  The White House reacts by attacking Joe and Valerie, and releasing to the press that Valerie is a CIA agent.  Being exposed, Valerie loses her effectiveness as a agent and is fired from the CIA.  Joe's actions, whether seen as heroic or foolish, hurt his relationship with Valerie and threatened their marriage.<br /><br />The film enhances Plame's professionalism and integrity by picturing her on several overseas missions as an active and effective undercover operative.  She heads a team that engages in serious actions against foreign threats to the USA.  Valerie is loyal and totally professional.  Even when she is exposed, she insists on keeping silent about her activities and government secrets.<br /><br />What really happened to Valerie Plame?  Why did the Vice President's chief of staff  reveal her identity and blow her CIA cover?  What did the CIA really know about Iraq and their weapons program?  Was Joe Wilson's outrage based upon truth or fraud.  This movie presents answers.<br /><br />This is a good movie that does an excellent job of telling the story of Valerie Plame.  Fair Game is action packed, but also is politically charged.  I recommend this movie.What really happened to Valerie Plame?

B0051QIGP4|4.0|I saw another reviewer stated that Government Hooker was edited on this version. I have the deluxe and it's edited as well. I would think it was intentional to avoid a parental advisory sticker. It does annoy me a bit, but what can you do. Overall it's a great album and definitely a no brainer for 99 cents!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This was a tougher read for me since it wasn't in my usual genre forte. I did think that it was fast paced and although it was much for me at times I rather enjoyed it. Very creative.
0767903862|5.0|The author of A Short History of Nearly Everything and A Walk In the Woods didn't disappoint me in his book on Australia. You will learn more about Australia than you ever thought you would want to know. Bryson delivers information about the continent down below in an entertaining way. As I do with most of his books, I laughed out loud on more than one occasion. I especially love how he can't wait to get a beer in every new town he visits.
0345528581|2.0|The author has the view that intensive cardiovascular exercise is basically a waste of time and will not actually result in much weight loss or other benefits.  I don't pretend to be a physician or an expert but from my personal experience I would have to dispute that claim.<br /><br />The best shape I was ever in was when I was running 5 miles every day.  It took about 50-60 minutes and my body fat and overall weight were lower than they had ever been before or since.  My stamina and energy level increased dramatically and I felt great.  After a time I also got the \\"runners high\\" people speak of and I actually ENJOYED DOING IT.  I did a few other things like sit-ups (badly I might add) here and there but by far the focus was on my running.<br /><br />Certainly I could have used some strength training too in retrospect but to claim that aerobic exercise is not beneficial is false in my view.  He disparages it mainly because the actual calories burned are small during the workout itself but I would argue that your metabolic rate increases as well.  Again, I am no expert on the science but I did experience the benefits of cardio training first hand.<br /><br />I stopped doing it after a few years and I re-gained the weight I lost. It is one of my main regrets in life that I allowed that to happen. I also had heart surgery (not due to clogged arteries, a defect undetected I had since birth) and my doctors stressed the importance of doing cardiovascular rehab afterward which would of course involve some sort of aerobic activity.  Are the doctors just full of crap?  I don't believe so. I do believe in the benefits of strength training and muscle is far preferable to fat for many reasons as the author explains.  I just felt the need to speak up on the cardio issue.

B0051QIGP4|4.0|I don't consider myself a Lady Gaga fan in any way, but I do think \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"Telephone\\" are pretty catchy, and I think she's a self-marketing genius. (And maybe that makes me a little envious.) This 99-cent album release is another smart move. I generally go for heavy rock, but I do have a decent-sized collection of dance and house music. Surprisingly (to me; probably not to anyone else), this album fits right in with what I like. It might not (OK, it probably won't) turn me into a little monster, but at least I'll have something new and tasty to listen to, and for 99 cents, how could I go wrong?
B004P4S4NM|4.0|Great classic, timeless songs.  I'll be listening to this cd for years to come.  I have to give it up to the British songstresses (Amy Winehouse, Adele Corinne Bailey Rae) they've really been holding it down!!  Adele's voice is such an incredible instrument and she knows how to play it to the fullest.  She produces each note to pitch perfection.  Bravo.  Her songwriting is top notch too and the arrangements are catchy.  She must have gone through quite an ordeal in her relationship to produce these songs.  Much like how Corinne Bailey Rae's death informed her CD The Sea (another brilliant collection of songs by a British songstress) IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT GO AND GET IT NOW.  You must have gone thru some pain and come out better on the other end to be able to tell these stories, this poetry to music.  My 6 year old son sings along to Rolling in the Deep and Rumor Has It - actually asks me to play them - and he normally only will listen to Eminem, Soljah Boy, Bob Marley and The Black Keys.  So that tells you something right there!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|FIRST:  \\"HELLOOO, WAKE UP!--PEOPLE, YOU'RE GETTING A BRAND-NEW MAJOR, FULL-LENGTH ALBUM FOR 99 CENTS!!!  LOL!!!  I don't care what your theory is about Gaga wanting to be #1 or what, WAKE UP AND REALIZE SHE'S GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO OWN FOURTEEN BRAND NEW SONGS for 99 CENTS!  You are out a whopping total of 99 cents (and yes, you will get the whole album--the servers are just overwhelmed and slowed from the massive response--I called Amazon's customer service, they picked up in 5 minutes and verified this).  No matter how you look at that, it's astonishing and a wonderful gift to pop music lovers.  Give her a break--she loves making music, singing it live (yep, a pop star that can actually write her own songs and is able to sing them live as well!), and loves her fans.  She has said many times it's not all about money, and this only proves she puts her money where her mouth is, just as she did when she admirably canceled the Target Store exclusive deluxe version of this album when she learned they continued to give contributions to anti-gay political candidates.  Finally, an artist we can believe in AND celebrate and dance with because she sticks to her beliefs, does what she says she's going to, and makes such darned good, enjoyable music as well!  For heaven's sake, people, buy the album for 99 cents, get up and dance and enjoy!!!  This album's lyrics are all about feeling good about yourself, so why not do so and stop all the online arguing!??!  GET UP AND DANCE!!!  Enjoy life for once!!!

B004K4AUZW|1.0|I don't so much care or mind that Gaga wants to make a darker kind of pop than what she did on The Fame and The Fame Monster, more power to her. The problem with this record, however, is that it is so busy, overblown, overhyped, and self-indulgent that it borderlines on parody. She's not breaking new musical territory, she's just producing a lot of 80's techno noise and techno beats and trying to sprinkle in religion and \\"controversial\\" political/religious topics to \\"shock\\" the listeners, which is not only boring, but irrelevant and trite. It's very difficult to tell one song from another, because they all sound the same, especially with the repetitive \\"baby\\" and \\"Gaga-a-a-a-a\\" crutch that she constantly has to use in her songs. Her lyrics are just laughable and incomprehensible. Her album is more of a production than it is a record. Even though the Fame/Fame Monster still had a lot of filler amongst the infectious hit tunes, at least there was more to like than what we're seeing on Born This Way. The Fame/Fame Monster was fun, but it was also quirky, different, clever, and creative without trying so hard. Born This Way is a sad attempt at trying too hard with too much noise and hype. It's disappointing, especially from an artist who is talented enough, and famous enough, that she doesn't have to try so hard to be \\"different\\" and \\"edgy.\\" Sadly, with all the talent that Lady Gaga has, she focuses more on the image/gimmick than she does on the music. Not to mention, these days she tries way too hard to force a \\"message\\" in her songs (ex: Hair, Bad Kids, Born This Way). It's not sincere, it's completely self-indulgent and corny. She's focused on producing hit singles than she is at actually writing good music. The only track that was worth more than one listen is \\"You and I\\" (which to me sounds a little too much like Speechless, but at least it showcases the style of music that Gaga SHOULD be doing, showcasing those vocals, the piano skills, and the human side of Gaga). I hope in the future Gaga could settle with a more laid back album that displays her true musical talents than this overblow, overhyped, outdated disco/80's nonsense. Lady Gaga DOES have talent, she CAN sing, and is a phenomenal live performer, the problem is that she chooses to create a show around her gimmick, image, and \\"controversial\\" statements than on her vocals and her talent..

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love Adele and these songs.  Turning Tables is my favorite.  Music is an emotional thing for me.  I either connect emotionally or I don't, and I completely connect to her voice and these songs.
B004HO6HWK|2.0|Not up to par with other Jason Strathom projects. Lacking on content. I lost interest very quickly with this all too familiar plot.

B004XQO90O|5.0|I watched the trailer and thought to myself, how interesting can a movie be where the main character replays the same eight minutes on a train over and over? Luckily, my roommates dragged me to the movie and I'm happy they did. I walked away impressed.<br /><br />Like other reviewers wrote, think \\"Groundhog Day\\" and replace the silliness with suspense, anxiety and explosions. The movie follows Colter Stevens, played by Gyllenhaal, who wakes up on a Chicago train to find he is in another person's body. The military has placed Stevens in another person's body to relive this person's last minutes before the train explodes. How is this possible? The premise is the military uses source code, which allows a living person to relive the final minutes of a dead person's life provided the two have similar genetics. Stevens is put on the train because he must figure out the identity of the terrorists who planted the bomb on the train. The bomb on the train is thought to be the first of many bombs set to go off in the city, so his mission is critical.<br /><br />One might think reliving eight minutes over and over would be mind-numbing, but each experience brings new twists as Stevens gets closer to solving the riddle and confronts his own problems. I love a movie that engages me in its plot, leaving me in suspense, wondering what could possibly happen next. For a prospective buyer, this is the type of movie I think you can easily watch a second time, and gain from the experience. This isn't a one-and-done purchase, where you watch the movie and it gathers dust on your shelf. I'll be purchasing this, and I recommend you do too.

B004UFEJS0|5.0|Ratatouille is another gem from Pixar. The film centers on two characters, Remy the rat, who to the chagrin of his family, would rather cook than dumpster dive and Linguini, the hapless garbage boy. The two form an unlikely pair, Remy the secret master chef, and Linguini as his helper. They quickly raise the profile of the restaurant, however their partnership is found out and things go amok as you can imagine. I won't spoil the rest of the movie, you'll have to see it yourself.<br /><br />Ratatouille is an animated movie, but like most Pixar movies, it's entertaining for the whole family. From the 5 year old to the 58 year old in our group, everyone enjoyed the movie. For young viewers the notion of a rat cooking is a great hook.

B004UFEJXK|5.0|Pixar produces amazing movies, but WALL-E is for the ages. This original motion picture opens with WALL-E, voiced by Ben Burtt, making his way through a desolate wasteland that is our planet. Humans left 700 years ago because pollution and trash made Earth uninhabitable. WALL-E is the last Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth Class robot left on earth. His job is to clean up the planet, while the humans are away. Curiously enough, WALL-E developed a personality, skillfully communicated through emotional-laden beeps, whistles and other noises.<br /><br />Shortly after we're introduced to WALL-E, we meet EVE, voiced by Elissa Knight. EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) was sent by the humans to search for plant life on the planet. WALL-E soon finds himself enamored with EVE, who eventually reciprocates his feelings. WALL-E shows EVE a plant he has found and EVE shuts down to await the arrival of a ship to bring the plant to the humans. Faced with the possibility of losing EVE, WALL-E sneaks aboard the ship and in doing so alters humanity's future. You'll have to see the movie to find out what happens.<br /><br />Whistling, whirring robots...seems silly right? Well, Pixar produced a romantic science fiction thriller that is unlike any other movie created. Seriously, you will come to love these characters, feel their pains and end up rooting for their success.

1935251740|5.0|This book will rock your ideological world.  It is clear that there has been a revolution building in science in the last one hundred years.  It is a pity that so few people are truly aware of it!  I thank Dr. Lanza and Bob Berman for their trailblazing book about the centrality of life for our present experience of reality to exist.  This stands our understanding of the universe and creation on its head, and has much more in common with religious explantions of reality without being overtly religious.  There is much to contemplate in this book because it sounds so much like mystical experience--but that has been the way of things since the arrival of quantum physics and modern cosmology.<br /><br />It may take some more earthly time for this revolution to expand but there are hints that it is already doing so.  The works of Amit Goswami and others are pushing for a new paradigm in science that unites the subjetive with the objective since the observer has a central role to play in modern physics.  Theologically, the great religions faith traditions need to better understand what is happening and to find ways to integrate the scientific findings of the present with theology.  However, it is always prudent not to simply accomodate theological truth with the latest in scientific theories because of the apprarently limited and sometimes provisional nature of scientific theory. Still, the dialogue that has begun betwen religion and science needs to continue. Such a book as this will help to further that discussion.<br /><br />I must add that many of the reviews of the book miss the point and seem uninformed about the mind/brain studies and the results that strongly point to brain as a reducing valve for the mind which is non-local in nature. To suggest that Dr. Lanza is not a real scientist flies in the face of how his peers see him.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I think as with many things in our world, the unknown is often ignored.  This opens up to reality of what we don't pay attention to.  Great documentary.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|After a full night's download I have all of the songs - I almost wish there were a few left to dl that may actually be good.  This album is NOT GOOD - juvenile, high-school poetry lyrics...droning music...seems she could have created SO much more.  Maybe her illusion has outshone her talent.  She has become very over-exposed for someone with limited creativity.  I'd like to hear some decent music - perhaps she should focus on that and not her \\"image\\".
B0051QIGP4|5.0|While all songs downloaded without problem, I'm not able to find where I can get the digital booklet...other than that, I was very happy to find this album at this price - wanted to get this since seeing Gaga on SNL...
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Rating of album: 4 stars, the previous album was much stronger than this one  Amazon Service: Do we have negative ratings? This is my first Digital purchase from amazon and of course not at all pleased. I think I'll stick to zune pass for my music..
B0051QIGP4|5.0|1. I haven't listened in full yet, so I have no idea if I'll like the music or not.  But unfair rating of Gaga for Amazon's server issues is just plain stupid.      2. That said, I had no issues- sure, it took an hour or so to download, but I didn't use the Cloud, downloaded straight to my computer, and only had to hit \\"Retry\\" once and BAM- now I have the whole album.  Easy peasy.      3. For $.99, can you really complain about a short wait?  Come ON...  At least you didn't have to leave your house.      4. Gaga, I love you, but I'm sorry- that album cover art is ridiculous.  <3
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I don't like this album.  =/  Good thing I got it for free with a promotional discount.  I am sad though because I could have used my promo for a good song instead of a junk album.
0470638842|5.0|This book is great. No need to read from beginning to end. Grab a chapter that answers your questions and go back and see what else you want to read.    Recommended.
1400079144|3.0|This might seem like an oxymoron, but The Lost Symbol is a bland page turner.      Dan Brown seems to think that ending every chapter with a cliffhanger makes for a good book, but he misses the part where books are supposed to be well written.  I will not deny that I found the story to be intriguing, but I only cared to see the outcome and was happy to skip out on much of the process. I didn't like the style of switching points of view every few pages and I didn't like most of the characters.  There were way too many explanations (historical and otherwise) and not enough storytelling.  I got fed up with the book when I was halfway through and skimmed the rest, not caring enough about the prose to spend time reading it.  At that point, all I cared about was plot development.  Not surprisingly, the end of the book was a let-down and I don't think it really made sense.    I gave the book 3 stars because it's an entertaining read, but I really didn't enjoy the process of reading it.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is super cute and funny.  My 10 month old cracks up at the minions.  The blu-ray looks great!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It has taken me ALL day to download this album. I understand its due to the mass volume of everybody trying to download it at the same time. But seriously if you are going to have this type of deal you should be prepared for mass volume it produces.  Had to purchase this album twice so I hope that I am not charged twice either.  Tried to download in cloud no such luck so finally got it to go in the mp3 downloader which I prefer in the first place. Looking forward to listening to the album...some day if it ever downloads.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It can take a minute or two before all the songs are available to you.  Close the Cloud Drive window, exhale, get a glass of water or something, then check again.  It'll work, I promise!  Happy Gaga day everybody.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I knew that this wasn't going to be to far behind and so the minute i saw it advertised i was ready to make a move and advance order it. i can already tell by the packaging that this is going to be well worth it. i have enjoyed this series through and through. no matter how many bad things have been said about some of the characters or story lines i have remained faithful and true to this series. Warner brothers did a great job with Superman the ultimate collection when it came out and so i can't wait for this to be in my home. I have been collecting the individual seasons but will gladly give them up to have the complete collection. So come on AMAZON GIVE US A RELEASE DATE so i can start counting the days until this arrives in my mailbox or on my door step. I am ready to never forget Smallville.
0783240236|5.0|A classic.  Bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it.
B003UM8T3U|5.0|What is there to say about Breathless, a movie that has started so many cliches? Not much, other than you owe it to yourself to see it. It is the type of movie that if released right now it would still sell will, despite subtitles and being black and white, something most audiences would hate.     This movie isn't about depth, but the exhilarating race through Paris, and the flashy dialogue. It is a movie that will keep you in, with it's jump edits, that fit right in, despite it looking like the disc messed up. Belmundo is a low life who accidentally kills a cop and runs away, catching up with a American girl while trying to leave to Italy.    It is one of those movies that you can't pull yourself away from, and when it is over you want more.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Gift for granddaughter....she loves it.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Unfortunately, this is the censored version. I'd have waited on purchasing if I'd known that.  Otherwise, excellent music, despite Amazon glitching out and only allowing me access to half of the album... but since it was only 99 cents, not that big of an issue.
B004UID2LC|2.0|because I am mobile this will be short. app runs in background and prevents video playback in YouTube and Netflix (get blue screen)  uninstall problems gone. on nexus s
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Seriously people, ALL of the songs will show up!  There's a lag because of the volume of people ordering this album today.  I called Amazon customer service (800-201-7575), got transferred to the Cloud department was told that the songs are coming.      In the time I waited on hold I went from having 2 songs + the booklet, to 5 songs + the booklet.  I now have 11 songs.    The album is AMAZING and it's absurd that it's ratings are being skewed because of technical difficulties.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|the book has so much detail. it covers pretty much any aspect you could think of. if you think the apocalypse will happen one day then this book is for you/
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I've seen other users have this problem so I'm glad to know it's not just me, but only the digital booklet downloaded. Either Amazon needs to fix this issue or give us our 99 cents back.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I decided to purchase The Pacific partly because one of my favorite actors is in it (Joe Mazzello, who plays Eugene Sledge) but mostly as an homage to my recently late grandfather, a WWII vet who fought on Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal at the age of 17.     If you're looking for a feel-good film, you're looking in the wrong place.   However, if you want a better understanding of what the young men (and women) in the military went through in WWII, this series is definitely a good place to start.     It was harshly graphic and certainly not what I would watch for simple entertainment, and realistic enough to help the viewer realize how grave the situations were that these soldiers were in.     I certainly recommend it, as long as you don't have a weak stomach or sensitive ears.     Through watching this series, I've gained so much respect and a better understanding of those in the military. This experience has made me appreciate even more what my grandfather went through at such a young age, and I will recommend the series to anyone who will listen in order to honor his memory.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I have respect for any artist who can be true to themselves and works hard to create an album of originality in both sound and lyrics.  And although conceptually and lyrically, some originality exists in Lady GaGa's latest album, the entire sound, composition, and overbearing repetitive techno vibe make the entire album fall flat overall.  Sigh....was expecting so much more and I can see why they launched this album with a special promo price of 99 cents.  It's barely worth that :(
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Only received 2 songs on the download.   For 99 cents that's not bad, but not what I paid for.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I just paid .99 for the digital booklet- no music like I was led to believe that I was paying for.. As a college student I don't have a single cent to waste, but I figured what the heck, how often can you get a CD for a buck? Surely I could skip lunch to get it. I guess the listening-dance party I was going to have today is not happening.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|There is no question that this is a fun film to watch.  You could not get a better cast, the script is intricate, tight and funny, and the production is completely lavish.  However, the soul of it is simply empty, like the formula has completely taken over the series, which plows ahead as inexorably as locomotive rolling down a hill.  This is the case with so many movies from hollywood that I hardly ever feel any excitement watching them.  Instead, with glitzy or not, they become background noise, to be played while the kids are occupied and I can do something else.<br /><br />The guys get back together because their pal (Gould) has been swindled.  The plan is to get the guy who did it.  Of course, it appears impossible.  And then, in addition to unforeseen complications, there are scams within scams within scams.  One fun thing is the reappearance of several former victims, adding to the fun.  Unfortunately, it fails to add up to much more than what came before, though with truly fine acting.  There are also many details you might want to watch a second time around, I will let the reader guess as to whether they succeed.<br /><br />This is pass time stuff that doesn't reach a level of quality I would want to own.  But I do.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|Either Cloudplayer is buggy for this download or is just unstable and pointless. I had to send an email to customer Service to get help downloading. And they'll get back to me within 12 hours?!? Its a download service and you can't get back to me any sooner than twelve hours?  Generally a huge fan of Amazon, but the Cloud Player has been nothing but a pain in the a@@.  Too bad this has to go under Lady Gaga Album, but I have no idea what half of it sounds like so maybe I'll give it three stars and the Cloud Player and big fat raspberry.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Before Purchasing read this:<br /><br />I just purchased this album and encountered the same problem as others: it won't fully download. I contacted Amazon MP3 service and they are aware of the problem, and are fixing the issue. BUT DON'T PASS UP THIS DEAL! We will get the full album in the next few minutes to hours.<br /><br />Like usual, great music, and for $0.99 a for sure buy. =)

B004K4AUZW|5.0|For little monsters around the globe, the agonizing wait for Lady Gaga's new album, which lasted for over eight months, has finally come to an end with today's release of Born This Way, her third album. (Don't gimme any of that \\"it's her second album\\" crap, Wikipedia. [[ASIN:B002W6Z0UK The Fame Monster]] was promoted as her second, and ever since you decided that that didn't count and started referring to BTW as her second, all of the media outlets are doing so because they look to you for information, which in turn makes it impossible to get a majority of reliable sources to say it's her third, creating an [[ASIN:B002ZG981E Inception]]-like self-fulfilling prophecy. Congratulations, you're more powerful than the mainstream media. But I'm getting off topic.) Gaga promised that the wait would be well worth it, that she had created the album of the decade that would move forward music and pop culture lightyears into the future. The hype train was so big and so strong, starting with the release of Born This Way the single back in February and culminating in Gaga's SNL performance two days ago, that you could have driven it through any international monument of your choosing and it would be crushed. As a gamer as well as an avid music lover, it's easy to learn that when something is hyped up SO MUCH, it's impossible to live up to that standard... and yet, Gaga somehow managed to come damn close.<br /><br />In the interests of full disclosure, I will say upfront that I am a devoted little monster who has been a fan of Gaga since Winter 2008. However, despite this, I will try to remain at least semi-objective for the purposes of this review. As you surely know, Born This Way was released in both [[ASIN:B004K4AVAG standard]] and expanded editions (Gaga dislikes the words \\"deluxe\\" and \\"special,\\" hence the use of \\"expanded\\"), however it seems almost redundant since everyone will spring for the expanded edition anyway. It contains three extra tracks of Gaga goodness, as well as five remixes of varying quality (but more on that later). Whether standard or expanded, though, Gaga has completely shifted her mindset since The Fame Monster; while she opted for a \\"less is more\\" approach there, she has since come to the realization that, in fact, \\"more is more,\\" as Born This Way has twice as many tracks and is over twice as long as TFM. This is to say nothing of the content stylistically; The Fame Monster was about facing your demons, but Born This Way is ultimately about loving yourself and everyone around you, as well as getting a little dirty and dancing the whole night through.<br /><br />The album opens on a strong note with \\"Marry the Night,\\" a power ballad which, I think, speaks of transforming yourself but still accepting qualities you don't like about yourself. This is followed by the instantly-recognizable title track, which at this point you either really love or really hate, whether or not you're a Gaga fan. It isn't any less inspirational or moving, though, and it somehow seems all new again listening to it with all the other songs on the album. Third track \\"Government Hooker,\\" which is just begging to become a single, is inspired by the affair between Marilyn Monroe and JFK. It's insanely catchy and danceable, naughty but not totally raunchy (that comes later!). Next is the highly underrated (in my opinion) Judas, which harkens back to the Bad Romance days of yore but still stands completely on its own. It still frustrates me that this will likely peak no higher than its debut position of #10 on the Billboard Hot 100, especially since Born This Way is now moving on to a third single, closing track \\"The Edge of Glory,\\" which I'll discuss in a moment.<br /><br />Following \\"Judas\\" is Gaga's political statement song, \\"Americano,\\" which is a criticism of America's immigration policy, and since she sings of falling in love with an illegal girl, probably gay marriage as well. Don't be surprised if this ends up getting released as a single, either; not only does it have a great message, but it's one of the highlights of the album. Of course, a highlight in an album of highlights may sound like I'm being redundant, but you get what I mean. \\"Hair,\\" Born This Way's other pre-release promo single, is a song of freedom and independence which has been likened to Katy Perry's \\"[[ASIN:B003L77TZI Firework]]\\" and Pink's \\"[[ASIN:B0045DO8NI Fu**ing Perfect.]]\\" \\"Hair,\\" however, drops all pretense of a cheesy empowerment message masquerading as seriousness by driving things into even more outrageous territory, proudly declaring \\"I am my hair!\\" And, as some may have seen at her Monster Ball tour, she totally means that (those who saw will know what I'm talking about). The next song is one that was first premiered at the Mugler menswear fashion show several months ago in a remixed version, and those concerned about its quality then (myself included) can rest easy now that the album version of \\"ScheiBe\\" has been released. (I don't know how to do that fancy symbol, so a capital B will have to do.) Gaga basically sings that she's going to be as brash, bad and unapologetic as she wants, all the time, and encourages all other women to do the same, not just on the dance floor. She also manages to beat Madonna at her own \\"spoken word verses in a song\\" game, which you'll have to listen to to understand. I'm a big Madonna fan as well as Gaga, and I don't like making comparisons between the two, but still, Madge got owned. \\"[[ASIN:B000002LND Justify My Love]] sounds weak in comparison, and that was spoken the entire song and not just the hook! \\"Bloody Mary\\" is arguably the most haunting and utterly creepy song Gaga has ever done, easily beating the macabre subliminal message of \\"Paparazzi\\" or the voodoo-inspired \\"Teeth\\" from her last two albums. She starts out wailing like a ghost, first somewhat tempered and then just all out screaming, while singing in an almost monotone of things such as death and unrequited love, while also managing to reference the Bloody Mary ghost of legend, the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and possibly all murder victims named Mary in history. In case you hadn't noticed by now or will notice in songs to come, religion is a recurring theme on the album; Gaga is a devout Catholic, but also openly condemns organized religion for creating intolerance, bigotry and hate.<br /><br />Speaking of religion, next up is \\"Black Jesus + Amen Fashion,\\" one of the bonus tracks on the expanded edition. Interestingly, instead of putting the albums bonus tracks all at the beginning of the album (as with Taylor Swift's \\"[[ASIN:B002NPUCRQ Fearless: Platinum Edition]]\\") or all at the end (as with, well, everyone else), the three studio tracks are inserted at various points in the standard track listing, which is actually quite cool. It's at this point that the albums starts to fall into something of a short semi-lull. \\"Black Jesus,\\" lyrically, is all over the place, and while according to her \\"it's about how putting on a new spirit is as easy as putting on fashion,\\" I can't say I would've gotten that from listening to it. Actually, come to think of it, I have no idea what she's talking about. Despite my ignorance, the song is still quite catchy and is growing on my somewhat, but I have to wonder if something more worthy was left on the cutting room floor. Its immediate successor is the other contributor to the semi-lull, \\"Bad Kids.\\" The lyrics are good, but they're totally incongruous to the melody. Something harsher or more industrial sounding would have worked much better; instrumentally, it seemed like it belonged closer to Gaga's now-famous unicorn than it did a soundtrack for society's rebels. Of course, rebel unicorns might disagree with me. To digress slightly for a moment, it seems as though Gaga was polishing and retooling this album right up to the eleventh hour (maybe even the eleventh second of the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour, etc), as some of the lyrics in thebooklet don't match the songs themselves. I'm not just talking about the usual spelling error or omission of a word, some verses will be differently worded completely and in some cases outright missing. I bring this up now because this is especially true for \\"Bad Kids\\"... it's missing an entire chunk of lyrical content in which Gaga gets into a fight with a cop, basically tells him to screw off, insults him, demeans him, and best of all, makes a reference to her famous meat dress. Based on the missed potential alone I have to mark down points on this song, even if it wasn't so oddly misplaced to begin with. I know it sounds like I totally tore these songs new ones (if they even had ones to begin with), but they're still ultimately 3.5-4 star songs, while all the other songs on this album are closer to 4.5-5 stars (all out of 5).<br /><br />The second of the three bonus tracks comes next, \\"Fashion of His Love,\\" which was inspired by and is a tribute to Gaga's dear friend, the late Alexander McQueen. It's actually quite touching, despite being an upbeat dance song. I would imagine McQueen is dancing to it in Heaven. \\"Highway Unicorn (Road to Love),\\" which ultimately gave us the awesome standard edition cover art of the Gagacycle, is a somewhat slower song while still having some energy to it, which paints a picture of a biker gang chasing an ideal love on their other love, their bikes. I really like this song, it's one of my favorites for some reason, and that's saying something since I'm so totally in love with almost every song on this album. \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" is the aforementioned raunchy track on the album, which by comparison makes \\"LoveGame\\" and its disco stick look fairly tame. It's one of the more humorous songs on Born This Way because, without the slightest hint of irony, it speaks of a gang bang with a bunch of biker dudes. Really. In some ways you could consider it something of a counterbalance to \\"Highway Unicorn,\\" actually. Interestingly, the song following this is \\"Electric Chapel,\\" an ethereal electronic track in which Gaga plays coy with her lover and teases him with promises of possible sex before finally becoming a bit more brazen. The third and final bonus track is \\"The Queen,\\" which is surprising simply because such a great song wasn't chosen for the standard edition (however useless I think that version might be). She takes her mantra of \\"don't be a drag, just be a queen\\" to heart here, building herself up when others try to tear her down, asserting that she is powerful (and dare I say the future Queen of pop?). The penultimate track is the already familiar \\"Yo&uuml; and I,\\" which Gaga added to the setlist of her tour in its last eight months or so. Though not quite as acoustic-sounding as in her live performances, it's still a relatively stripped track that's just as powerful and amazing as a studio version, with just a hint of country amidst her otherwise old-school rock-and-roll sound. Finally, everything culminates with \\"The Edge of Glory,\\" the already classic track and third single which... oh, words can't really describe it. If you've heard this song, you know what pure and utter pop magic it is. Almost certainly destined to become one of those timeless pieces that will be sung for generations to come, by people who didn't even really know or appreciate who Lady Gaga was in the years prior.<br /><br />So, Born This Way proper is nothing sort of a masterpiece; a veritable pop opus that rises above her last two albums. However, with all masterpieces, there are still flaws; minor but still hard to overlook given the quality of the piece. The first of these is the five remixes included with the expanded edition. First up is \\"Born This Way (The Country Road Version),\\" which firmly establishes the fact that Gaga is hellbent on pioneering the \\"electrocountry\\" genre. While nothing can compare to the original in my mind, the quality of it is still just as good, and to hear a different take on it is quite refreshing. Unfortunately, things go downhill from here. The next track is \\"Judas (DJ White Shadow Remix),\\" DJ White Shadow of course being one of the primary producers of the album. Since Judas is such an amazing pop song to begin with, any attempt to change it seems destined to end in at least mediocrity and at most disaster. This falls somewhere between the two extremes, fine for what it is but still utterly unremarkable. \\"Marry the Night (Zedd Remix)\\" starts out sounding as though it's just a dancified version of the album version, but you soon find it strips away all of the brilliant lyrics in favor of some rather grating beats which sound like an auto-tuned Kayako Saeki, the ghost from the [[ASIN:B00005JNJR Grudge]] movies. This is followed by \\"ScheiBe (DJ White Shadow Mugler),\\" which is the version of \\"ScheiBe\\" that first debuted. Unfortunately, it's not the version you saw on Lady Gaga's YouTube channel that you became accustomed to in the months leading up to the album release; instead, it's what was presumably the uncut version played at the fashion show itself, clocking in at a whopping nine-and-a-half minutes. That's a good length for a music video, provided it's something like \\"Telephone,\\" but not for a remix, and a rather boring one at that which doesn't compare to just playing the album version three times in a row. The remixes end on a better note with \\"Fashion of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix),\\" who was also one of the primary producers on the album, taking the already dancy and memorable song and making it even more of an invitation to get on the dance floor. I still prefer the album version to this, but it's still a quality remix that warrants repeat listening.<br /><br />So, only two out of the five bonus remixes are worth it. That's it? Not like that really matters, that's not why you got the expanded edition to begin with! Well, that's not the only problem. The one truly bad part of Born This Way is the censorship. Yes, even after the huge uproar that little monsters caused worldwide over The Fame Monster having its curse words censored, Interscope has gone and done it AGAIN. The first song affected by this is \\"Government Hooker,\\" however instead of the usual silencing of the word, distorting it or playing it backwards, there was a loud bleeping sound like what you might expect on TV (or 2/3 of an episode of [[ASIN:B003IB0FUS Jersey Shore]]). At first I thought that this was intentional, Gaga perhaps referencing Watergate or the government's general tightlippedness, but this kept happening in later songs, albeit without the bleeps. All in all, five of the seventeen songs are affected, including the aforementioned \\"Government Hooker\\" as well as \\"ScheiBe,\\" \\"Bad Kids,\\" \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" and \\"The Queen,\\" in most instances the censored word being sh** or b**ch (both of which, might I add, were uncensored when uttered on Gaga's debut, [[ASIN:B001GM28HO The Fame]]). While I find this inexcusable and I would hope that Interscope makes amends immediately, I would urge you not to deprive yourselves of such an incredible album due to this. Yes, it's annoying, and yes, it never should have happened, but this album is too great to miss.<br /><br />Ultimately, Gaga has done what no one thought she could do: top herself and live up to the hype she and her little monsters created. This is an album I intend to keep on repeat 24/7 for at least the next month, with frequent listens afterwards. Gaga can do no wrong, simply because she doesn't know how (the subpar \\"Eh Eh\\" video notwithstanding). I would overall rate this a 9.5/10, simply because A) I don't give out 10/10s (since nothing's completely perfect), and B) because there are a few minor flaws (and one major one). What are you waiting for?s themselves. I'm not just talking about the usual spelling error or omission of a word, some verses will be differently worded completely and in some cases outright missing.

His well-researched and well-documented insights go beyond the conventional organizational Pavlovian thinking, yet makes perfect sense in our contemporary world.  Motivation 3.0 is a concept our global business community should have adopted a generation ago!  It has changed my attitude and approach to teaching and mentoring my students, as well as designing a workplace!  I see the end of management as we've known it.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|I only got the booklet and two songs, Marry the Night and Scheiße. They're both pretty fun songs and if they're any indicator of what the whole album is like, it feels very much like a dance album. She's bringing back some old beats and musical styles and I think she's doing it well. I don't know if this album is quite 5-star worthy, but at least this will offset the 1-star ones.    I imagine Amazon decided to take a loss on these sales in hopes of promoting their cloud player and digital music. Unfortunately for them these issues just seemed to make a lot of people angry. I've bought digital downloads before and used the cloud player. I've never had a problem and I really like the features. I figure with the large amount of people downloading there are bound to be issues and it'll take a day or so to fix. The way I see it, I only paid $.99 so it's not like I didn't get my money's worth with only two songs. Haha. Really though, hat's off to Amazon for making this available for customers for so cheap. I was on the fence about whether or not I wanted the album, this is at least a nice way to test drive it. Here's to hoping I get the rest of the songs fixed soon!
0553386794|4.0|I found the world that Martin created to be outstandingly detailed.  While I did start reading this right before the HBO show started, I raced through it to find out what happens to all the main characters.  The wealth of detail that Martin throws his readers is nothing short of amazing - the world is fully realized, and even without the aid of HBO, it was a very visual type of read for me.  I could see the different places in the 7 kingdoms, and I could really feel the dread at the Wall, the despair in King's Landing, etc.<br /><br />He's created such an honorable yet bafflingly frustrating character in Ned Stark, but I feel that the real hero / heroine in these books are Dany and Jon Snow.  I can't wait to read the next installments to find out what happens to them!
B0034G4P7G|4.0|i liked this movie very much<br /><br />it kinda inspired me to go out there and make my own bussiness a reality<br /><br />My only complaint is how the movie begins; for the first good 6 minutes, the ONLY thing you see is a (not very exciting) conversation between mark zuckerberg and his ex girlfriend. That's it ! 6 minutes of talk between two individuals, hella boring<br /><br />So don't be disappointed if you find it tedious at the begining; it will get better and better<br /><br />Also lack of sunlight is another problem - it's entirely recorded at night or inside.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I watched and enjoyed this film, or at least most of it.  I couldn't watch the slaughter house scenes.  The rest was really educational and a bit scary regarding what we put in our mouths!
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|Starts off very slow as the plot and characters are built but it is well worth putting the effort in.  The differences in the legal, social and financial systems took me a while to fully come to grips with but in the end made the book more interesting.  Only four stars as I have just completed the second in the series and thought that was a much better read and worthy of five stars, but it did need the ground work this book covered to fully make it so.  I guess I was expecting just a bit more after all the hype, if there had been no hype I would probably be raving about it more.
B0036TGSIK|3.0|Love Emma Stone, but not her best work.  Very good performance by Amanda Bynes though, as the Christian do-gooder.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|There's only one thing I might change - move Born This Way later in the track order.  The single has been out for such a long time, I'd have preferred something new on track two.    Otherwise, perfect album, at a perfect price!

0345529057|5.0|Geez people, I can't understand all the vitriol against the price of the kindle versions vs. paper versions.  Obviously, Amazon and the publisher are going to price their product options in order to maximize profits based on their projections of consumer demand.  That's what businesses do.  Apparently they believe that enough people are willing to pay an 80% premium for the convenience of having 4.5 pounds and over 3,000 pages worth of great literature (there's my review) on an electronic device vs. toting it around and finding eventual storage space. This is all about paying for the \\"value\\" that you put on this convenience.  It has nothing to do with cost to produce. No products are priced based simply on cost to produce - it's always about value created and what people are willing to pay for that value.  Think of the margins on Apple's products (higher value = higher margins, or the nerve of video game companies charging $60 for a disc witha  \\"marginal cost\\" of $1? ;-)    Comments that bring up \\"monopoly\\" are also rediculous. You have a choice here - if the convenience (and \\"green aspects\\") of the electronic version are not worth the premium to you, then buy the paper version.  If enough people make this choice, the electronic version will \\"magically\\" decrease in price, while the paper version increases.   You all did see that kindle books just surpassed the sales of paper versions on Amazon - right?   Demand will drive price, not cost!
0316010669|4.0|Entertaining read. Main gist of the book is to follow your gut, and follows good reasons as to why. I really liked it. Great conversational book too, or to read on plane rides.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This album is a clear evolution from previous two. I love the Rock, Metal and Electro theme. There's a clear take on art, pop-culture, fashion and religion in her latest work.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Can't believe that such a great album is at such a low price! Hopefully Amazon will do this with future releases. Thanks to Amazon and Lady Gaga for making this happen!
B004R92PYE|5.0|It's not worth taking a star off because I like the music of this album so much, but I hate the way the audio was mastered. The high frequency of the drums was rolled off a lot which really annoys me - consider Mona Lisa smile...there are a lot of cymbal hits going on there that I want to hear more!...I want to hear crisp hi hat and crash cymbal sounds. I'm guessing it was produced this way to make Brendon's (admittedly awesome) vocals stand out more and I can appreciate that if that is the case, but I think the cymbals needed to be a little more noticeable the mix than they are for a rock album. If this album were available on vinyl I'd buy it just because sometimes the vinyl gets a slightly different mastering job than the CD release for picky listeners who aren't going to be playing it back on ipods or a car stereo.<br /><br />My quibbles with the mastering aside, musically this album is awesome. If you like Panic, it is a must-have. I just saw them at the DC101 Chili cookoff this past weekend too and they are so much fun!

But I was pleased by a noticeable improvement in detail over the DVDs, especially for a show that was probably NOT originally filmed with the HD format in mind.  Like the DVDs (and unlike the episodes on Hulu and Netflix), these episodes do not contain the little Fox-mandated intro that gives thirty seconds of backstory.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|i love this CD, it is so refreshing to hear their new music hasn't been bogged down by dumb auto tuning and voice altering computer programs like so many other. In fact they took it back to the stone age by recording the CD on analog tape! ANALOG TAPE and it became their first #1 top selling CD.I can't wait to see them live...
B0051QK87S|4.0|All you guys rating this album low for the download problems are really screwing it up for people on the fence about buying it! All the low ratings make it look like the album sucks, which it doesn't. I don't think it's as great at TFM, but it's hard to surprise ppl twice. If you like any of GaGa's songs you'll like this album too.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|What a great way to start your cloud drive-20 Gigs for only 99 cents. However, only one song downloaded! What's up with that? Not a great way to premier your new cloud service. I guess time will tell if the other songs become available, but I am not impressed so far.
B0041KKYEW|3.0|What a great trailer this movie had!  Too bad it didn't live up to the hype.  There wasn't much by way of building tension and the plotting was evident to a blind person.  All in all, a disappointment (except for the person who conceived the trailer.  That one deserves a raise.)
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Favorite songs:    Bloody Mary  Judas  Hair  Scheibe  Edge of Glory  Government Hooker    The album altogether is awesome, her best to date.    I HAD problems with downloading all 14 songs from the Sound player but I was able to get all 14 songs on my iPod. Just gotta play with the player.    5 STARS!
B00004OCQ2|5.0|Other than Ray Gillen's untimely death, I wish this band could have continued. Jake E. Lee is a awesome guitarist. I wish he would reform this band with a new vocalist. Even Ray would understand having this music continue. Dusk is a very fine tribute to the talent these musicians had and have. BUY IT IF YOU CAN!
B003UESJFG|3.0|My kids 4 and 2 ask for it thinking they want it, but they never watch more than 20 mins. It is a pretty decent movie for adults and teenagers, but little kids can't follow it.  That said, it one of the rare animated stories that main characters are not static and they change through out the story. There are quite a few corny gags, I'm sure the 12 - 18 ages love this movie
B0001I561E|5.0|Awesome seller, DVD arrived very fast and the condition was better that I expected. I bought it for my grandson and he was so happy to wacht it.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'm stoked that I can pick this up for a buck but I've been waiting for over an hour for three songs to become available to download to my computer from the cloud service. 5 stars to price and Gaga. 1 star to Amazon cloud,

B0051QIGP4|5.0|**Mea culpa! I was a complainer yesterday, but I should have viewed some of the other comments first. I did what a \\"helpful person\\" suggested....went to my account>digital orders> and the Gaga album has \\"Currently being processed\\" by it. Got it within 24 hrs! Certainly can't complain about anything now....this is quite a gift!     Gaga truly does have a gorgeous voice and judging the samples, I will indeed keep most of the songs. She is certainly a talent. As far out as she seems on stage, I have seen quite a few interviews and she is just an average person, sweet, darling, and working to perfect her art. She says she still feels inferior due to childhood taunting, but she should get over that. Buck up, Gaga, you're a winner! Think how those stupid, rude, crude, bullies will feel at your next big Reunion, when you walk in and pay off all their mortgages with pocket change!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Well I love the album, its so different. SO far Im in love with:<br /><br />Born This Way: 1st Single, it may be a copy t Madonna's express yourself but its fun to listen to it.<br />Judas: Since i heard it, I like the beat.<br />Scheibe: Its so Euroelectro.. I dont speak German.. but i can if you want...cheow!<br />Americano: The beat that starts wit it and the overall song.. good song.<br />The Edge of Glory.. OMG that is my song! Love it!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I keep reading that people feel they were ripped off but you really weren't.  I know in this digital age we expect everything instantly but with this high of a volume it's understandable that it will take some time for songs to be available (we have been spoiled by faster technology).  Just be patient!    I got most songs right away although I expect by now traffic has died down a bit and aside from two songs that are still processing it's all there.  I downloaded to the cloud right away and it seems to work faster than trying to download to your computer plus then you can let it download by itself in the background with no worries.  First time I've used Amazon Cloud and gotta say I like it.  Yes it may not be as good as others but it gets the job done plus now I have my music available everywhere I go and worry about getting it to my computer.    As for the album, I love it!  She pushes the envelope again and I can't get enough of her.  She is a great artist and despite her eccentricities, she is genius and always speaks the truth.  Way to go Gaga!

Orbits fastest and remains extremely hot on surface.<br />Venus: Inspectah Deck - Not as recognized as other planets but has the densest atmosphere of all the planets.  A sister to Earth that sets it off.<br />Saturn: GZA - A myriad of layers in his lyrical intricacies as if he always has something extra around him.<br />Uranus: U-God - Barely visible to the naked eye and not as recognized as a planet by ancient observers because of it's dimness and slow orbit.<br />Pluto: Masta Killa - The 9th planet from the sun and last member to drop a solo album (critically acclaimed).  Pluto is now considered the largest number of a distinct population as kaiser belts.<br />Planet X: Cappadonna - The science community has questioned X as a planet, due to it's lack of massiveness to other planets.  It's a probable tenth that is cold like the winter wars contained within.<br />Sun: RZA - Produces the light but also darkness occurs when the planets turn their backs to it.<br /><br />ODB is Jupiter.  The largest planet in our solar system.  ODB's heart was as big as you could find in a man.  In a recording studio, he heard screeching tires in the streets and ran outside of the studio to save a girl trapped under a burning vehicle.  He would visit her in the hospital on many occasions but he didn't do it for any publicity.  He was recognized at the facility and then some media got a hold of it.  Jupiter is also the most explosive of the planets.  In 1994, a group of comets slammed into Jupiter causing an impact human beings caught like no other.

0767903862|5.0|I can't tell you how excited I was that a friend chose this book for our monthly book club read.  After reading the first 2 pages, I was already laughing out loud--needless to say, I was hooked! He writes with such a friendly and casual tone that it feels like you're in the room beside him as he recounts his amazing adventures. He entertains the reader with countless hilarious (and true!) stories of Australia's founders, prime ministers, sports, wildlife, and locals, and makes you realize just how odd and fascinating the country is.  Always in the mood for a road trip, I loved that it felt like I was right beside him as he explored the coastal cities and the great outback.    Out of the five 30-somethings in our book club, 3 of us LOVED the book, while 2 gave it mediocre reviews because it did have a \\"wandering\\" feel to it and was a departure from the action-packed plot lines they are used to.  However, I can't praise this book enough, and I know infinitely more about Australia and its lovable quirks than I ever did before.
0375751513|4.0|The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.<br /><br />Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.<br /><br />I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.<br /><br />Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\"
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Such a diverse album in all aspects. This definitely shows a completely different side to the great Lady Gaga. I see a good one or two more number one hits moving off of this album, but there is probably a solid six tracks that will hit number one on the charts.  Many of the songs have the potential to become great remixes as well.  I can easily see this album giving Thriller a run for it's money as one of the most successful albums of all time.  If not, she's setting herself up for success on the next one.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Why advertise that you get the entire album for 99 cents, when Amazon can't deliver. Only six songs showed up in my cloud player, the other 9 are..... who knows where?
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Absolutely amazing CD! I think this is Gaga's best album to date! We need her and the world needs her message! She is empowering, teaches love and acceptance for ALL. Its just a brilliant album. I think it showcases her talent and it is not your typical pop album. It shows her wide range in vocals and has a dance essence in a lot of songs.  Its simply beautiful!!! I love all of her albums, but born this way is epic!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Gaga, I changed my star rating for you, realizing that I do love the album, and it has nothing to do with the meltdown of Amazon's servers.  I came on to change my rating, and I AM SORRY!  Government Hooker is my favorite...  Even @ $6.99 people...totally worth it,  full price?? Still worth it.
0312323867|5.0|You don't have to read Something Borrowed to get what's going on in this book.  But it is definitely more fun if you do.    When I read Something Borrowed, I kept wondering about things from Darcy's perspective and what she had really been up to.  Even though I was rooting for Rachel.  I loved this story because you see the big confrontation at Rachel's that ends the first book re-told from Darcy's perspective, with a little bit of Darcy's life story thrown in at the beginning too.  In this book, we see Darcy's transformation from a self-centered, superficial social butterfly to someone who really grows into herself and figures out who she is.  While someone mentioned that in the end, she really just changes for a guy, I don't agree with that.  Ethan's Come-To-Jesus chat with her only makes her see her life for what it has become and realize that, like it or not, she has to accept motherhood, something she eventually embraces.  Sometimes it takes that kind of speech from the right person to see the error of your ways.  My other thought: is it bad to change for someone else if the change is a good one? This change made it possible for her to form solid friendships in London, something she didn't have in New York, and also to be a good mother to her boys.      Like others have mentioned, my only complaint is that I wish there was more about Rachel and Dex and their life together, but it makes sense why there isn't more.     This is a great story that will leave you smiling at the end!  Perfect light reading for the beach or another summer vacation.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|this album is amazing. i can't say i'm suprised because i knew it would be great. she's so unique and creative and that is what these reviews should be about, not technical glitches. you're getting her music for a dollar, much less than she deserves to get. so my review is 5 stars because of the product itself. it is worth every 99 pennies, even if you have to suck it up and wait a while. i want to give props to amazon for having to deal with this and thank you lady gaga for ANOTHER wonderful album. you truly are a huge inspiration to a lot of people. keep it up :)

However, I can only access six of the songs on my cloud drive, so I don't think I'll be purchasing another copy.  The other songs appear in my cloud, but I'm unable to download or even play them.

You know, you're watching an outlaw movie, outlaw movie, outlaw movie, BAM, you're really watching a vampire movie!  So, caveman movie, caveman movie, BAM iron-age movie, iron-age movie, BAM weird occult movie!  That's the story of \\"10,000 B.C.\\"  Honestly, the only way I can describe how I feel after watching this movie is: VIOLATED!

B004K4AUZW|1.0|This album is a complete disappointment and shows no growth from her excellent debut The Fame/ The Fame Monster. In fact all Lady Gaga shows with this offering is that she's a poor reproduction of far superior artists that have come before her.    Outlandish costumes and deliberately over-hyped controversy seem to be Ms Germanotta's forte. However perhaps if she placed less time on these aspects of her career and instead focused some much needed effort into her song writing she wouldn't have to heavily rely on blatant plagiarism.    Gaga promised \\"The greatest album of the decade\\" and instead has dished up a tired and generic Time Life Warner '80s/'90s compilation album.

B000089Q9D|5.0|After misplacing my VHS version, I decided to get the DVD.  I'd heard that the ending had been changed by the director to answer the questions many viewers had about what happened to Toto's first love; however, I'm a purist who liked the original ending, so I was glad to see that the DVD I ordered kept the original ending.  The movie arrived in good time and in excellent condition.
B00004XPPB|3.0|I'm apparently among the minority of viewers who found this movie watchable, but not great.  True, the risk of Donny Brasco getting caught maintained a tension which kept me engaged with the movie.  But otherwise there was very little development of the characters, the circumstances of essentially every character were bleakly depressing with no detectable bright side, and the bits of violence in the movie had a tacked-on quality which doesn't do justice to the brutality of the mafia.  Frankly, I found this movie somewhat boring, despite being a fan of this genre.  If you want to see how it should be done, watch The Sopranos, The Godfather, etc.  By comparison, this was amateurish.  Though I wouldn't say the two hours I spent on this movie were completely wasted, there are certainly many better movies I could have watched ...
0060899220|5.0|Rather than a superfluous review pointing out how vulgar he can be, how much the pages tend to ramble, the wisdom of the advice he gives, the humour in the stories he tells, or any one of the other [relatively] trivial details that are expounded many of the hundreds of others here, I want to focus on a single important detail.    Reading this book brings back a vivid memory of life on the line: the adrenaline of the Friday dinner rush, the strangely satisfying pain of another deep gouge in the hand or burn on the arm, and the overwhelming feeling of awe at what food can truly be.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Inspired by 90's techno, industrial, 80's dance, 80's metal, Madonna, Whitney, and electro, Lady Gaga returns with an album of epic scale.  \\"Born This Way,\\" christened \\"album of the decade\\" by Gaga herself is a mash-up in concept.  80's metal tracks from the likes of hair bands like Motley Crue and Bon Jovi collide with tracks from early 90's techno/rave groups like 2 Unlimited and 80's pure pop tracks from Madonna and Whitney.  On first listen, the edgy aggressive sound may be hard to swallow as it doesn't sound anything like her previous two, multi-million selling albums, but as you let the album unfold  and take you on its journey, you start to wonder if Gaga hit the nail on the head with this project and if this is where pop music is headed next.  You start to realize that you miss hearing grand and inspiring choruses and real vocal strength in music and then you realize that by breaking rules and not giving us another album of mainstream pop hits, Gaga just gave us the next pop sound.  I havent heard a 74 minute album (if you get the deluxe edition) since the late 90's/early 2000s and as far as I'm concerned it is still not long enough.  This is a full story album...THIS is bionic.<br />Highlights on the album are:<br />Schei&szlig;e<br />Bloody Mary<br />Bad Kids<br />Fashion of His Love (Why isn't this fab track on all versions of the album?)<br />You And I<br />Edge of Glory<br /><br />TRACK BY TRACK:<br />1- Marry The Night - This sounds like an amped up 80's metal/rock/dance version (claps and all) of Cutting Crew's 1986 hit \\"I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight.\\"<br />2 - Born This Way - Title track and first single from this album becoming Gaga's 3rd #1 Billboard Hot 100 and staying in the pole position for over 8 weeks.<br />3 - Government Hooker - Electro pop dark dance track with blips and all.  I expect to hear this type of sound at an industrial/goth dance night.  Very metal, distorted vocals, She sings in a lower register, there are spoken vocals, cold male spoken vocals, creepy laughs throughout.  Its somewhat anti-climactic but does help to establish a cold industrial tone early on.<br />4 - Judas - This ones already been broken down and analyzed a million times.  Truthfully, I like it.  Its a faster Bad Romance with a highly addictive chorus.  She collaborates with \\"Just Dance/Pokerface\\" hit-maker RedOne.  The video on the other hand....hot mess.<br />5 - Americano - This track is sung in a very annoying campy \\"Broadway\\" style.  It's her one Latin-inspired dance track with pulsating drum beat, trumpet, guitar, and violins in the far background but is just too busy with the distorted screamy vocals, the pulsating Latin dance beat, the guitars, the horns.  Think Madonna's Deeper and Deeper on steroids meets \\"Me No Speak No Americano\\". This one goes to the bottom of the list for me.<br /><br />6 - Hair - The first time we hear the sax on this album.  This was released before the album came out on iTunes so we've all had the opportunity to digest it.  Its a fun party track with  electric guitar, piano, hard pulsey drum machine and sounds like it came right out of the late 80's.  Throw your hands in the air dance anthem.  This track seems to fuse the industrial goth elements of the album with the 80's dance, metal rock inspired tracks.<br />7 - Schei&szlig;e - One of the strongest tracks on the album, once again, reminiscent of a previous Gaga track.  Great vocals, spoken, singing, takes me to an early 90's techno, industrial place ala \\"Twilight Zone\\" \\"Who Shot JFK.\\"<br />8 - Bloody Mary - Mid tempo, operatic; the cold, industrial goth \\"Ladytron\\"-esque sister to \\"The Fame's\\" Ace of Base inspired \\"Alejandro.\\" This is a major highlight on the album. A+ dark moody mid tempo synth dance track.<br />9 - Black Jesus - Amen Fashion - very electro-rock, distorted spoken chorus, meets very 80's sounding melodic verse/bridge meets an uninspired chorus that is almost reminiscent of Gaga's previous soundtrack song, \\"Fashion\\" mixed with title track \\"The Fame.\\"  Another track I could easily live without.<br />10 - Bad Kids - pulsating disco beat with electric guitars reminiscent of Donna Summer's \\"Hot Stuff\\" and another disco gem that I can't think of at the moment.  Half-spoken, half sung verses meets a glorious synthy chorus which is mixture of 80's and 90's classic jams.  This track reminds us of Gaga's melodic sugary pop genius. A+ Highlight!<br /><br />11 - Fashion of his Love - This one almost sounds like it was inspired by \\"Express Yourself\\" as well, but upon further listen you realize that it was THIS song where she pictured \\"Whitney Houston.\\"  This is the young sister to classic 80's #1 track, \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody.\\"  Lady Gaga sings fashiony lyrics over a hot 80's freestyle (think of Whitney's \\"Dance w/ Somebody\\" meets Shannon's \\"Let the Music Play.\\")  One of the best songs on the album.  The double disc special edition is the only edition of the release that contains both the original along with a Fernando Garibay mix which is completely dance/club ready.<br />12 - Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) - Another 80's dance rock track.  Not fond of the distorted vocals.  I feel like if she included more melodic softer vocals it could have balanced this hard track.<br />13 - Heavy Metal Lover - Dark sleek sexy dance track.  One of the most easily accessible tracks on the album.  Similar in style to \\"Government Hooker\\" but much sexier.  This song is almost a culmination of the different styles that inspired this record and this song perfectly balances all elements and highlights all of Gaga's strengths.<br />14 - Electric Chapel - Electric guitars, pulsating electro beat, sexy dreamy vocals.  This could have been a track on Madonna's Confessions On A Dance Floor record and sounds similar to \\"Forbidden Love\\" from that same album.<br />15 - The Queen - fast paced 80's pop dance track ala GoGo's but the melody also reminds me of Cher's \\"Song for the Lonely.\\"  The pace drops midway and this goes from being a dance track to a slow to mid tempo pop track with an electric guitar solo that closes the number.<br />16 - You and I - Epic, gem, the speechless of this album. Major highlight.  The only true \\"ballad\\" on the album and very similar in structure to a Bon Jovi track or even actually reminds me of \\"What It Takes\\" from Aerosmith.  Showcases Gaga's stunning vocals and melodic mastery.<br />17 - The Edge of Glory - fast paced, hi-energy, feel-good electro dance track highlight and because it was so successful during the iTunes countdown to Gaga pre-release, it is officially the third single for this release.10 - Bad Kids - pulsating disco beat with electric guitars reminiscent of Donna Summer's \\"Hot Stuff\\" and another disco gem that I can't think of at the moment.

B0051QJ83S|5.0|This offer of a long-awaited blockbuster album by the widely admired international superstar  for 99 cents wasn't necessary.  We would have paid full price for the songs.  Amazon really f****d up royal.  Tech support here was blindsided by overwhelming response, but they should have anticipated it.  Lady Gaga is a great musician, songwriter and a dazzling, amazing performer.  She takes huge risks so people understand she is the real deal.  The server was blasted by her tremendous popularity.  Don't give the album a bad review just because of a delivery problem.  It's a really great album!
B000A2W1X2|4.0|I like this movie, the fantasy of an almost instant attraction and desire.  Brought about by some internal need and goal they were depesrate to reach in their lives.    The ability to maintain this dream over years and, even when denial is present, at the moment eyes meet again the attraction allows the fire to spark into a full recognizable flame.     And the child that holds this dream work together is also the glue that brings the permanance  of the bond to a head. Along with the history and the sexually charged attraction between the two from the beginning sets in place what cannot be denied.      What woman wouldn't wish to be a part of this dream!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|i bought this @ 7am this morning and am working on downloading it to the kids mp3 palyers and burning a disc for the car. i hope amazon offers this deal more often!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I saw this promotion on Facebook and thought I'd give it a look. I admit I don't know much Lady Gaga music, so I figured for $.99 for the complete album I'd give it shot. This is a great deal for someone like me who probably wouldn't have purchased the album otherwise. Thanks Amazon.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|Amazon really does not know what it is doing here. I purchased this album, downloaded the installer, and just waited and waiting.  Nothing happened.  Before Amazon introduced this cloud music disaster, albums were easy to purchase and download.  Now, it's a total nightmare.  How many hours do we have to wait before the songs become available?   I guess you get what you pay for.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was laugh-out-loud hysterical! My husband and I both love it! My favorite parts are the chapter on Don Fey and Tina's line about the advice Oprah gave her. Tina has a hysterical view of life, and I hope to read and see more from her in the future!
B0051QIGP4|2.0|As a fan of Fame & Fame Monster I went into this thinking there Lady Gaga was back to offer more...sadly she missed the mark in my opinion. Wasn't a fan of Born This Way, somewhat interested in Judas but outside of those two songs this album was terrible. I had high hopes that she could live up to the same quality from Fame/Fame Monster but in my opinion she didn't. I feel as if I should ask for my .99 back after listening to this.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I bought the album, and the only thing I am able to access is the PDF Booklet.... can anyone tell my why I am unable to access the music?
B0051QJ83S|5.0|People should not rate this album solely on their frustrations with amazon. I look at the 3 star review and I am wondering to myself how in the world can this be true? Then I read in depth and of course, I see everyone complaining about Amazon's service, server, and download capabilities. Oh, that makes sense. STOP GIVING THIS ALBUM BAD REVIEWS SOLELY BASED ON AMAZON SERVICES! This album does not deserve 1 or 2 stars. Just be patient and the content WILL be loaded. Patience is key.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I have read, in quick succession, all three books in this series;  The Giver, Gathering Blue, and The Messenger.      I read them all in hopes of coming to a satisfying conclusion to the story - but in this I felt cheated!  The books are wonderful, don't get me wrong.  Exciting, fast paced, terrific stories and characters.  But on the last page (I have the kindle edition) I found myself repeatedly trying to page forward, as in each book it felt as if it hadn't ended.  Not simply because I wanted more - but because in each case, it felt unfinished....     One more page, one more paragraph - anything except stranding me in the middle of a story.  I thought this was simply to make me continue to read the sequel, but even the concluding book left me in a lurch.  I do not think I will be reading Lowry again any time soon.  Her lack of endings is just too frustrating for me!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I wasn't even planning on buying this album right away, but $.99? Thanks, Amazon. And thank you Lady Gaga for being amazing.
B004R63MWQ|2.0|I was looking forward to this as I always enjoyed the original as a cult favorite, but this just really didn't catch my interest. I'm sorry that I spent the money to rent it.
030745455X|5.0|Delivery was quick and the book was in excellent condition. I read the first and third book but had not read the second. The second book filled in all the blanks that were missing. Definitely read the books in order. I liked books one and two better than the third book. My only issue with the series is trying to keep up with all the names.
B002GJT4XM|4.0|ENJOYED THE EXTENDED EDITION.  WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE THE ADDITIONAL DVD'S HOWEVER ONLY TWO HAVE THE EXTENDED EDTIONS, THIS ONE AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS.  WHAT A WASTE.  I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO PURCHASE GOBLET OF FIRE HOVEVER NONE OF THE OTHER DVD'S HAVE THE EXTENDED EDITION.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|THANK YOU for the .99 album on day of release! Even though I will go out and get the extended album tomorrow as well, its so great to have it the night before!    As far as the album is concerned, I am listening and wondering how does she top this?  She combines the best styles of the 70s with the synth magic of the 80s that we all fondly adore, and the hard driving edgy techno from the 90s (think the firece DJ remixes by people like Barry Harris and Thunderpuss, Victor Calderone, Peter Rauhoffer, Hex Hector).    Thank you Gaga for burying your competition, maybe they will learn to keep up!!
B002GJT4Y6|4.0|REALLY ENJOYED THE EXTENDED EDITION.  THIS IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE BOOK. MOVIE IS WELL DONE AND ADDING THE ADDITIONAL PARTS TO THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. I WILL ONLY BUY THE ADDITIONAL HARRY POTTER MOVIES IF THEY HAVE THE EXTENDED EDTIONS.
B001EAWMFQ|4.0|This is a great collection. Its too bad *Lonewolf and cub Sword of Vengeance* with English subtitles isn't in this box.
B003UD7JEO|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet.  If your not watching Nikita on The CW, you are seriously missing out.  It's easily one of the best action serial dramas on TV right now.  With two beautiful lead actresses (Maggie Q and Lyndsy Fonseca) along with a cool leading man (Shane West), the show definitely has characters you want to root for.  In addition, the show also has 2 extremely compelling villains in Percy (Xander Berkley) and Amanda, played by the beautiful and sexy Melinda Clarke.  Awesome action sequences, martial arts fight chereography...what more can you ask for?  If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend purchasing this DVD or Blu-Ray, especially if you were a fan of the FOX series 24.  I think this show makes up for 24's absence.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Okay like everyone else, I purchased Lagy Gaga's new album and saved it to the cloud drive, BUT my download wouldnt show the whole album. So I tried a 2nd time. This is a note to EVERYONE DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT download the album to your cloud drive because it WILL NOT download. Use the Amazon MP3 Downloader and it works perfectly!
0060872675|5.0|This book makes me smile.  The depiction of Sam Vimes is so spot on.  Considering that Pratchett has said in The Art of Discworld that he has always imagined Vimes as a younger, slightly bulkier version of British actor Pete Postlethwaite, it is even more incredibly spot on. Look him up; I'll wait. (wicked grin)     When I read this book, and I do it often, I see a loving father with his child.  I recognize my own husband playing/reading to our children when they were little. It warms an area of the heart that reminds you how precious that little bit of time is.  And, remembering how stories in our house had a tendency to get ... 'rewritten?\\", it's quite realistic how Sam and Young Sam read this together.  It's not about the cow.  It's about the special relationship between a father who never expected a child and a son who is the light of his father's life.    In a few short pages, it makes you laugh and appreciate how far Sam Vimes has come and how much he richly deserves everything he has, even if he thinks he doesn't.
B001FB5634|5.0|If you're looking for a standard action-packed hollywood movie, or a thriller, or shallow fun, you might hate this. This is a super heavy, dark, grim, intelligent, dreadful post-apocolypse film. You REALLY need to know that, and be in the mood for it.     If you loved \\"Blade Runner,\\" or are in the mood for something slow and deep and grim and meaningful and dark as hell, or just love well-made apocalypse movies, this is it.       Not a kid's movie whatsoever. A very realistic, adult, educated, and hideous view of what it would be like after a real all-out global war & the aftermath.     It is NOT about PLOT. It's about REALITY. It demonstrates what our lives would be like in this scenario: painfully plotless. If you're student of film or literature or any kind of intelligent culture, you'll probably get this; if you're not, you probably won't.    The acting, production, direction, writing, ambiance, and everything else is excellent.     The message of the film is as deep and powerful as the movie is grim and dark. Which is what it's about. Not just shallow entertainment or meaningless fluff, but the exact oppositte of those. It takes you into a world of overwhelming desolation, and then explores what really matters in such a world... and the world you might be in already.    That said, I consider this one of the best Apocalypse movies around, and deeply meaningful.
0062073567|5.0|Loved this book, the characters are interesting, and the story moved at a fast pace. I know this was written many years ago, but I could, and will read this several times!!

B0051QJ83S|5.0|Haters will hate, and fans will love it, but if you're just a casual fan, you should definitely give this album a listen.    Besides the obvious Madonna/80s sound that Born This Way (single) was, you can't help but love a song she wrote for her fans. Very rarely will you see artists thank for more than 5 seconds at some award show their fan, let alone dedicate a whole song/album to them.      Don't let Judas or BTW turn you off from the whole album though, each song has a different feel, and no track feels like some \\"filler.\\"  You have a wide range of music; from house music-inspired tracks (Heavy Metal Lovers, Scheiße), disco (Bad Kids, Americano), some mariachi-inspired songs (Americano) and even 80s power ballads (The Edge Of Glory, Yoü and I); GaGa wrote an album that could be enjoyed by many.
B004K4AUZW|2.0|I have listened to this album over and over again to try and appreciate it and for it to grow on me.<br />Because after the 1st listen I was not impressed.<br />The album seemed like 1 long track to me with very few intermissions of great songs.<br />I have now realized that the album didn't grow on me and that it is kind of a disappointment.<br />After \\"The Fame\\" which I mostly loved (bar a few filler tracks) and \\"The Fame Monster\\" which in my mind was a fantastic album bordering on the accessible and avant-garde but just poppy enough to be a radio staple.<br />\\"Born This Way\\" doesn't continue this trend. You can tell Gaga tried to make power choruses and be radio friendly but it gets washed in with the heavy production which seems very lethargic and just TOO much to me.<br />The album starts relatively strong with \\"Marry The Night\\", the mega over played smash \\"Born This Way\\", the intriguing and the very dark \\"Government Hooker\\".<br />Then comes \\"Judas\\" which I thought had potential to be a really amazing song but is ruined by the Dance-Dance-Revolutionish chorus.<br />\\"Americano\\" is really over the top and ridiculous.<br />\\"Schei&szlig;e\\" is probably one of my favourite tracks. It again borders on mainstream accessibility and complete darkness which is interesting to listen to.<br />\\"You & I\\" is hands down the best thing on this album. Its a fantastic song and highly recommended. It doesnt really fit in the context of the album but its a welcome surprise after the huge filler gap of tracks 8-15<br />\\"The Edge of Glory\\" is the 3rd single and a great closer.<br />Unfortunately for me, the tracks in between these songs are major filler in my honest opinion. They go on about 2 minutes too long and dont really give you a reason to stick around and listen to it.<br />It doesnt pack the accessibility punch nor the dark avant garde punch.<br />Its just below average background music and was very dissapointing after multiple listens.<br />The only tracks in my mind worth RAVING about are Government Hooker, Schei&szlig;e, You & I and The Edge of Glory.<br />Luckily for Gaga, the public and her Little Monsters eat everything she does up even if the product is inferior and this will lead to huge sales. (That and her hawking the album for 99c on Amazon and giving it away with every phone purchase at Best Buy..which is really not an admirable thing to do as an artist in my opinion)<br />I honestly cant see any of these singles taking off and being a #1 worldwide smash like she did with \\"The Fame\\" and \\"The Fame Monster\\" and they probably wont.<br />But I'll give her credit where credits due and that is with the few songs I mentioned which are superior to a lot of songs on the radio right now.e of Glory.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|I honestly didn't even get ONE song, I got completely ripped off.   I checked my digital downloads and it says I've already downloaded   the entire album, which is not the case. Now it won't let me download  anything. This is a complete rip off.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I just bought this album for .99 which is crazy to me! I had no problem with the download. I was ready to wait as I know that a lot of people was going to download this album at the same time as me but to be honest with you I didn't have to wait long at all. Love pretty much all the songs but then I love Lady GAGA!
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I gave it 4 stars which obviously means I loved it but I know for a fact that it didn't get the ratings it deserved because people butchered it to the bitter end. The movie is action packed and I know why people didn't like it as much, because it really had a deeper meaning then what it showed. also a lot of scenes were cut out such as the sex scene with emily which I read in a magazine she was mad about. Along with some other much more gory scenes. If you skeptical about buying it because of the reviews go netflix it or red box then decide if you want to buy the movie. I feel like this is one of those movies I watch over and over again like kill bill.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I just finished speaking with an Amazon MP3 Customer Service Agent, and she explained it to me clearly that their server is having technical difficulties due to the overwhelming amounts of downloads of Lady Gaga's new album. She reassured me that their technical teams are working diligently to solve the problem.     Also, she mentioned not downloading any other songs or albums until they fix the backlog, since any more songs added to your cloud player might be placed on queue. Therefore,  preventing you from being able to download the songs to your iTunes or other music player.    So, please be patient little monsters because I know we have all been waiting for her album for quite some time now. You still cannot beat the price of this album compared to other music stores out there.    Just keep checking your cloud player until all of the songs get downloaded. I hope this review gives people a piece of mind that the album will eventually be downloaded.      UPDATE:    It is now 11:55, and all the songs are finally downloaded to my Amazon Cloud Player.    Check your Amazon Cloud Player now, and see if you have all the songs downloaded.    Thank you Amazon. I can finally put my PAWS up in the air! >_<      UPDATE: (May 28, 2011)    Hello everyone,    I hope you are all enjoying Lady Gaga's new album, Born This Way, because I know I am. She is a complete inspiration to me, and her new album was worth the wait.     I know we had some difficulties downloading her album the day it was released to the public. I was able to download all the songs by the end of the day on May 23rd. However, I think some of you are still missing some songs or even the whole album. Amazon sent me this e-mail today showing what to do if you had chosen to save the songs directly to your computer instead of the cloud player. Here is part of the e-mail:    If you saved your purchase to your computer, please follow these instructions to re-download your music:    1. Launch the Amazon MP3 Downloader.Here's how to locate the Downloader application on your operating system:    -Windows: All Programs - Amazon - Amazon MP3 Downloader  -Mac: Select \\"Amazon MP3 Downloader\\" from your Applications folder.  -Linux: The application is installed as /usr/bin/amazonmp3 and an icon appears in the \\"Applications\\" menu in the \\"Internet\\" submenu.    2. If you have failed downloads in your MP3 Downloader download queue, click the \\"Clear Completed\\" button at the top center of the Amazon MP3 Downloader window.    3. After you have cleared the download queue, go to: <...>    4. Find the order(s) that were placed on May 23 and click View Order.    5. Select \\"Click here to redownload all the tracks listed below\\".    I hope this helps you find the songs you are missing. Good luck!
1936719010|5.0|Pressman is a great respecter of time: the readers time.  He condenses a lifetime of personal experience as a writer into a book that can be read in its entirety in a little over an hour.  But don't let the brevity fool you.  His message is loud, clear, sometimes irreverent and always hopeful.  You are in control today of the destiny of your dreams and projects.  His sage advice cuts through the thousand ways we sabotage ourselves and fail to do the work.  His message got to me so quickly that I dropped the book and started writing.  It was the best kick in the pants I've had in ages.  I bought a half dozen to send to friends and colleagues.  I also bought the Kindle edition so that I could search it quickly.  The cover graphic is worth the price of the book alone. Buy it now.  Do the work.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|After 14 hours I finally received the album in my cloud player. Now I can finally review the album.    Hardcore Gaga will love the album. Anyone who isn't that big of a Gaga fan will hate it. This album has a strange mix of modern pop music with an 80's pop/electronic feel. This is very noticeable in Bloody Mary and Marry The Night. After listening to this album a few times you will find it really does start to grow on you.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|21 is a phenomenal album. Every single song is entertaining and beautifully done. Adele is a true artist in voice and in song writing. Absolutely buy this!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Don't know what people are talking about. The entire album and digital booklet is in my cloud drive ready for download. The CD is amazing!
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Definitely worth the $0.99 to get the 20GB storage. Only 5 songs have downloaded so far but honestly I expected that. Everyone has to realize that Amazon has a lot of subscribers and I'm sure no one is going to try and pass this up purposefully. The bandwidth hit right now must be huge. But great buy. Appreciate it Amazon. If only you had the player for iPhone but that's a conflict of interest now isn't it :P
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This app allows you to put a full calendar widget on your phone with multiple accounts showing up.  I will let you choose which days to show and you can add evetns straight from the widget.  It even works well on my old mytouch3g.
B000002GW5|5.0|I was a kid in the 70's - early 80's when JB was at his \\"peak\\".  I always liked his music, but in my youth I was a hard-core metalhead.  As I get older I am rediscovering music that had an influence on me but now middle age I can really appreciate it.  I've had this CD for over a week and can't get enough of it.  Every song is great.  I'm definitely going to pick up a few more of his earlier works for my upcoming summer road trips.  You can read others super-detailed song by song reviews and sample the CD if you wish, I'm not going to bore you with that level of critique.  JB rocks you will not be disappointed!
B003L77G6A|5.0|The Big Bang Theory Season 4 proved to be better than Season 3 according to a lot of people (and yet I don't get why so many people had a problem with it). I don't get why there's so many people who hate change when change is necessary in any sitcom.   Sure season 1 and 2 are great but all sitcoms have to evolve over time. If it stayed EXACTLY the same then everybody would be complaining that it's getting old and needs to take on a new direction. And they still act like nerds. Not AS much as the first two years but they're still nerds. The whole point of the show is that thanks to Penny moving in, the four socially awkward scientists are adapting to the real world full of relationships. That's why the show is called \\"The Big BANG Theory.\\" And it's been like this since DAY ONE. The only thing I miss is the old Howard when he was always hitting on Penny.         This year we had the addition of Amy Farrah Fowler (she actually first appeared in a very short scene in the season 3 finale), Raj's sister Priya whom Leonard continues their old affair, and the return of Bernadette--Howard's girlfriend. Also this year we had a reappearance of Penny's dimwitted ex, Zack, in a few episodes.     A lot of episodes this season mainly revolved around relationships but it didn't take away the guy's nerdiness. In one episode Howard proposes marriage to Bernadette. Leonard and Priya continue their old relationship from years ago, much to Raj's chagrin--and also Penny and Bernadette's chagrin because it seems as though Priya doesn't want Leonard to hang around Penny. Penny had previously broken up with Leonard and so this season they just stayed friends. She actually briefly got back together with Zack but Leonard didn't seem too happy about it. Sheldon and Amy are good friends who often chat via Skype--and give each other good advice. Amy sees Penny as her \\"bestie.\\" She, Bernadette and Penny are often seen out together for girls nights. In this year's season finale, we got a pretty big twist with two people we never thought would end up in bed together. In the season 5 opener everything should be resolved so we can finally see what REALLY happened.     My Top 10 episodes for this season include   \\"The Robotic Manipulation\\" - Howard got a robotic arm stuck on his \\"you know what\\"  \\"The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification\\" -Sheldon turns himself into a \\"robot.\\" Steve Wozniak guest stars as himself  \\"The Zazzy Substitution\\" - Sheldon \\"breaks up\\" with Amy so he replaces her with a bunch of cats  \\"The 21 second excitation\\" - The guys camp out in line to see a special extended cut of \\"Indiana Jones.\\" Special guest appearance by Wil Wheaton  \\"The Boyfriend Complexity\\" - Penny's father (Keith Carradine) visits and she wants him to think she and Leonard are still dating   \\"The Justice League Recombination\\" - Zack wants to join the guys and Penny at a New years eve costume party at the Comic Book store when they go as the Justice League.   \\"The Toast Derivation\\" - Sheldon decides to get some new friends to be the center of attention of. Kripke makes a return in this episode.   \\"The Prestidigitation Approximation\\" - Sheldon is obsessed with learning the secret of Howard's card trick.     \\"The Zarnecki Incursion\\" - Someone has hacked into Sheldon's World of Warcraft account and stolen stuff he's earned so it's up to the guys to find the thief.   \\"The Roommate Transmogrification\\" - Raj decides to move in with Sheldon when he is disgusted with Leonard and Priya having sex in his bed.     The other 14 episodes are great too but these are my top 10.       I'm def. buying season 4. I'm not a FANBOY, I just enjoy the show and don't act overly critical and picky with every little aspect of every episode. Buy it, you'll definitely get a lot of laughs out of this season!
0312360258|3.0|I enjoyed this story, but found myself skipping whole sections full of chanting to goddess' that the story could have done without. Toward the end of the book, the cult type of chants, and activities increased to a point that I just wanted to skip through almost whole chapters, find out what happened to the main character and then not try to read the next book in the series. They were a little over-whelming. So, although I thought the authors came up with a great plot, I wouldn't recommend this book -too many italicized chants to skip over.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|This film plays on the viewers primal fears.  Multiple viewings do not decrease the effectiveness of Hitchcock's masterly use of decaying Victoriana and the universal dread of an old, dark mansion.  For a real treat,  watch it with someone who has never seen it.  \\"Mother\\" would approve.    The blu-ray disc is pristine.  See what good black and white photography should look like.  The sound is remarkable.
0316056863|3.0|I read a lot of celebrity memoirs, and although it's debatable whether or not this book falls under that category, one thing is clear: Tina very deliberately decided to only let us in a little bit.  It would have been nice to set aside the constant \\"tee hee, ha ha\\" and let the reader get to know her true voice.  For example, she doesn't want to say EXACTLY how she got the scar.  Please.  That is the stuff we are expecting and wanting to read about.  We have already heard all of the self-depricating hirsute jokes, and all of the painful adolescence stories.  I wanted to get to know the Tina behind the Tina of SNL and 30 Rock.
0439023483|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I sat in the park and read for hours without realizing and walked away with a sunburn. Highly recommend this book. If you like Harry Potter and action books, you'll love this.
B00130VLZ4|4.0|The case was exactly like described and fits the Canon camera perfectly the cost was about 25.00 less than I could have purchased either locally or thru The Canon website.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I love this film.  I did not see it in the theaters.  I wish I had.  I have seen my copy of the DVD about ten times.  I never get tired of it.  The music is fantastic.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Battle: Los Angeles was a great movie.  Having been in the Marines myself (1/3 C Co.), I saw a very accurate picture of platoon cohesiveness and unity.  There were aspects that I experienced that were toned down some, for obvious reasons, but anyone who was an infantrymen knows what i mean.  The story was surprisingly well done, though some of the dialogue was semi-cheesy.  I really thought though that this was a very well made and executed movie.  The CGI was very well done and not really noticeable.  The acting was also quite good, which was made possible by very good collaboration with the Marine Corps and the military in general.  The way in which Marine close quartrers tactics and operations were porteayed was extremely accurate.  The weapons, for the most part, sounded and behaved as they should and the gear usage and placement was also impressive.    Overall a must see war/sci fi thriller.  I look forward to more movies such as this in the future.  I cant wait for the Blu-Ray to come out in June so I can experience this great flick often.    Retreat, Hell    Semper Fi
B0051QIGP4|5.0|awesome album. Gaga has done it again! by looking to the past (80's) she makes it her own. This is the album of the future. Go gaga!
B004RE29PO|5.0|I remember this much awaited Alien sequel back in 1986 when it was released in major theaters every where, and it didn't disappoint at all.  The follow-up companion to the original 1979 sci-fi shocker delivered as promised, via up and coming director James Cameron.    What I don't remember was all the gruesome details of the movie's dark atmosphere in the unknown vacuum of space.  In this recent blu ray release, I saw details of ridiculous clarity and proportions.  The once cluttered background of the colony settlement that was plastered over by the Alien resin suddenly became grotesquely clear, as opposed to standard resolution on the DVD set.  Every serial number & logo on the Colonial Marines' equipment & transport ships showed up razor sharp.  I even managed to scope out some momentary nude cheesecake inside a marine's locker never noticed before.  Heck, for the first time, I noticed Sigourney Weaver was wearing a futuristic version of Reeboks - which peaked in popularity & sales that year, when she slipped her feet into the robotic cargo loader for the first time.  That was great advertising - if you could've seen it.    I didn't notice these details before, because I couldn't see them before.  At 6x the resolution of standard DVD's, blu ray has reinvigorated this movie franchise for a whole new generation of enthusiasts and allows some of us retro-timers an appreciation of just how far digital technology has enhanced a movie that was made a quarter of a century ago.    The special director's edition of the film was also ported over to blu ray, just like the DVD set.  James Cameron explained how the studios back in the day were all about \\"Cut, cut, and more cut,\\" in an effort to trim the movie under a specific time limit.      The director mentioned in his commentary how this special edition version was the way the movie had intended to play out.  For those of you who never saw this version, you're in for a real treat: All the restored extra scenes will add many layers of explanation to the movie and doesn't really weigh it down, despite a staggering 2.5 hours of total play time.  Was every single extra scene necessary?  No, but the majority were a nice bonus, padding the overall gravitas of the film and were sprinkled generously throughout the entire length of its duration, unlike a scene or two from other titles claiming director's cuts.    If you thought Aliens was a satisfying sequel back in the day, wait until you see it now.
B004N1S25C|5.0|Stephen King not only gives great insight on how he writes, but gives some interesting background on his life. I truly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. Buy it if you like Stephen King, you will get more out of his stories if you do.<br />Cheers!
B0051QJ83S|2.0|It looks like I fared better than most and got 5 songs, but I still want my other 9! GrrrRrrr!!! I'm hopeful that the glitch will be fixed soon and I will be able to actually hear the rest of my purchase!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is awesome.. I am switching to amazon mp3 from itunes and it is just awesome. Almost all songs are cheaper..  the cloud drive works as advertised.  Yes..the album took a little longer to showup but 99 cents!  c'mon be a little patient and it is worth it.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I didn't believe it when they emailed me saying that I could get the album the day it was released, but for $.99 I took the chance.  It downloaded about 15 seconds later, and I'm listening to it right now.  If you have any interest at all in the album, buy it here. Great deal Amazon!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This is my first time buying music from Amazon and it will be my last, I will gladly pop back to iTunes and pay the album price there.<br /><br />I haven't figured out why 5 songs failed to download and trying to transfer the songs to iTunes isn't worth my continued hassle.<br /><br />Amazon, stick to books and leave the music downloads to the professionals.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|There isn't much to say. This album is unique, fresh, and EARGASMIC. THE EPITOME OF POP, POINT BLANK PERIOD!!! LOVE YOU GAGA!!!
0679731725|4.0|You won't go wrong buying this book if you're looking for a well told story with broader philosophical connections. The plot is not designed to shock you and so there aren't many twists and turns. Instead you feel as if you're listening to a favorite story from a relative. You know basically what will happen but you enjoy the experience anyway.  Ishiguro is a master at portraying emotions and each shift in the narrator's perspective on life is like a tiny explosion. It's not a perfect book. Sometimes it's slow and occasionally, Ishiguro lingers on details that frankly aren't very interesting. Stick with it though. The conclusion is worth it.
159420229X|2.0|This is an OK story about the U.S. Memory Championships. But, it's somewhat light and fluffy on the event, more so on Foer's prep, psychology, etc. And, other than presenting must other competitors as college kegger geek-types, it's very thin on the sociology.<br /><br />That said, if this is going to be more a personal story than a scientific, or even pop-scientific, look at memory, maybe, as another reviewer or two also notes, it would have been nice to hear more about Foer's study. Did he have self-doubts? Think of himself as too geeky? We read some of that, but, what about more?<br /><br />On the sociology side? Foer seems determined to not dig too much below stereotypes with most competitors.<br /><br />==<br /><br />Finally, an ugh on Foer the journalist.<br /><br />First, he illustrates bits of the Peter Principle mixed with bits of Ivy League myth-deconstructing. A guy who goes to private school in Georgetown and then to Yale didn't know Kublai Khan was a real person? WTF? And, yet, with an Ivy degree, he's in like Flynn writing for National Geographic.<br /><br />Second, his refusal to call a spade a spade, or a fraud a fraud, in the case of pseudo-savant Daniel Tammet, is ridiculous. With that type of backbone, plus your Ivy degree, Mr. Foer, you should go in working for mainstream media outlets.<br /><br />===<br /><br />I was originally going to three-star this, but, speaking of fluffery, it's gotten too much here already.
B0051QJ83S|4.0|Anybody who bought this for $.99 got one heck of a deal. I realize that Amazon had its problems, and although I did have trouble downloading everything, I got the album and the wait was worth it. Although there are a couple of forgettable tracks, the majority of the album is full of great dance beats and those \\"What did she just say?\\" lyrics. Any Lady Gaga fan will be happy to add this album to their collection, but I feel as if her best work is still ahead of her.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I was forewarned that this was the most difficult of Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games Trilogy to get through...so, to be perfectly honest, I was almost pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it! While it lacks the freshness of The Hunger Games and suffers from a few serious flaws, Catching Fire is still fairly diverting. Like the first book, it's packed with imaginative ideas, likable characters, and a premise that begs to be further explored. For a quick breakdown of the good, the bad, and the downright bizarre:<br /><br />The Good<br />1. The detail, especially of the arena. Without giving anything away, I will say that Collins puts a lot more thought into the design of the arena featured in this next installment of the Games. Scary and vivid - almost enough so to offset my disappointment in having a replay of the same basic setup as the first book.<br />2. Haymitch Abernathy. By far the most interesting character. Learning more about his past and the details of his participation in the Games turns out to be a strangely poignant moment in the book.<br />3. The scale. That the story is moving from a plot centered on struggles in a game to a plot centered on struggles on a societal level (unrest, the threat of rebellion) brings the series to a new and more compelling level. I'm excited to see where Collins goes with this in Book 3.<br /><br />The Bad<br />1. The pacing in the first book was so perfect. What happened in this one??? Collins should have either truncated the events of the first two thirds of the book significantly (at least in half), or developed them into a separate and more meaningful novel. Actually, no. I take it back. She just should have ditched them.<br />2. Katniss misses some pretty obvious clues. For being a generally intelligent and observant protagonist, she's totally oblivious to some HUGE early hints as to where the plot is heading, which makes them come across more as annoyingly transparent foreshadowing.<br /><br />The Bizarre<br />1. The love triangle, which already raised some questions for me in the first novel, became downright silly in this one. Please, please, please explain how the reader can empathize with Katniss having to choose between Peeta -- a charming, funny, loyal, devoted, cooking(!!), and generally great character whom the reader sees in practically every scene -- and Gale, who hardly ever shows up, and has almost no dialogue. Not that there seems to be anything particularly wrong with Gale. He's just not a presence in the same way that Peeta is, and the reader really can only take Katniss's word on the weight and nature of their relationship. It does seem that he'll have a larger role to play in the final installment. Hopefully this issue will be better clarified there.<br /><br />In general, Catching Fire is exactly what I assumed it would be...a stepping stone between the beginning and the conclusion of Collins's trilogy. For its flaws, it's still an entertaining read, with plenty of surprises and plenty of fun moments. Nowhere near the caliber of its predecessor, but also nothing that's raising any red flags about continuing on with the trilogy.The love triangle, which already raised some questions for me in the first novel, became downright silly in this one.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|My Son loves Lady Gaga and the digital Album is a STEAL! She is a very couragious, beautiful woman, and I myself love her songs too. The whole album is full of great songs, and I'm glad I bought it, though I only have 4 songs, I'm waiting for the other 10.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|4.5/5 Stars:    After receiving recommendations from a fairly varied selection of sources (my 50+ mother, my 17-year old sister, and, most surprisingly, a 22-year old male friend) I finally decided to pick up The Hunger Games. Couldn't put this one down! Collins has a knack for mixing suspense, genuine and gory action, and a pinch of romance in a perfect balance that prevents her novel from dragging as protagonist Katniss is hurtled into a deadly game of survival by the post-apocalyptic, dystopian government of Panem. The Hunger Games is based on a premise that draws from a tradition of popular scifi and speculative fiction (various elements of the novel recall Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" and Stephen King's \\"Running Man\\"), as well as the current obsession with reality television, while still managing to remain fresh and engaging. Collins also incorporates a wealth of detail about both the world that has arisen from the ashes of \\"the former North America\\" and the sadistically-designed arena that houses the Games, creating a vivid backdrop that's almost as much a part of the action as the fighting itself.    I don't often see YA novels with a female protagonist that are marketable to male readers as well as female (for some reason, girl readers don't mind putting themselves in the place of male protagonists, but the opposite is not often true), but The Hunger Games seems to accomplish this unique feat for two key reasons. First, this is predominantly an action novel. There are a lot of blood and guts and even some creepy creature attacks, and Collins navigates through them like a pro. The novel is extraordinarily paced. I often tire of long action sequences that drag on for pages, but Collins manages to jump quickly from one exhilarating crisis to the next without losing interest. The story is also told in present tense, which adds a sense of immediacy to Katniss's narration. For readers who enjoy action (here's looking at you, guys), this is a must-read. The second benefit is that while the book is narrated in first person by a teenage girl, Katniss is tom-boyish, resourceful, and generally butt-kicking enough that it doesn't matter. This is no swooning Bella Swan (of Twilight infamy) we're dealing with. Yes, there is a love triangle that features as a subplot, but it operates under a slightly different twist than most you'll find in YA fiction...and for every moment of romance, there's a pack of mutant killer wasps or something similarly thrilling lurking around the corner to keep the plot moving. Plus, the whole dystopian thing, the brewing of societal unrest under the totalitarian government, etc. is a plotline that never seems to fail to engage readers of any age or gender.    There are some issues to be addressed -- a few characters that lack sufficient development, a love triangle that seems to be slightly missing one side, and a few spots that could use some further clarification -- but in general, The Hunger Games is an imaginative, action-packed, and thought-provoking novel suitable for all young adult and adult readers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I purchased this book because of the great reviews I read and it did not dissapoint. I couldn't put it down. All the characters were well developed and it made you care about them. Great descriptions and just a great, captivating story. Absolutely recommend it.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but with this album (and offer) Lady Gaga has demonstrated once again that she is the undisputed champion.  The album represents a wider variety of musical influences...and with them, a larger palette for Gaga to work with.  Repeated listening yields new discoveries and a deeper understanding of Gaga's true design intentions.  Her message (fundamentally) is so positive and optimistic that in lesser hands it would come across as disingenuous, but as any 'little monster' would tell you, \\"She's the real deal\\"!    In terms of the marketing strategy,(was this hers or Amazon's? probably doesn't matter) this is like saying, \\"I'll let you eat your cake as long as you also take this ice cream\\".  Tough decision.  There are a myriad of \\"cloud storage\\" services out there, but 20GB for free along with a $1 new LG album isn't exactly a tough call from the consumer perspective.    More importantly, and this is why I believe that Gaga had some influence on the pricing, it tells those of us who are suffering through tough economic times, \\"I care about you and hope that when things improve, we'll both come out ahead\\".  Couple this with a \\"you are precious, and were born this way\\" attitude, and LG instantly is our hero.    Great music, great artist, great performer, great message, genius strategy!!    Go Gaga!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|(5/25 revision)  There must have been an error with the purchase. All songs are now visible for download. I'm still not satisfied with Amazon's handling of this purchase, though.  If there are technical issues, it's incumbent on Amazon to let the buyer know.  I'm a reasonable guy, I'll understand - if you set the proper expectations.  Unfortunately, the product review does not reflect the music review.  I'm not happy with the way Amazon executed this order, but I am happy with the Gaga album.    ****************************  (previous review)  Just bought the album, advertised for 14 songs plus the digital download.  ONLY 7 Songs are showing up in cloud player.  Is this blatant fraud? I wonder how many States Attorney's General will be working overtime to sue Amazon?      I love you Gaga, but this is Ridiculous!
B000050GBF|1.0|i managed to watched a whopping 20 minutes of this to find out no thanks - it's not for me...
B0051QIGP4|1.0|If you want this anytime in the next...6 hours or so...don't bother downloading it from Amazon...it's not happening.  They don't even apologize when you contact them via online chat!
B0051QK87S|1.0|I had the same problem! I only got 3 songs.....so lame! Please get it fixed! I was so looking forward to this album! &lt;/3
B0051QJ83S|5.0|After going to see one of her Monster Ball concerts, I thought about the odds of her coming up with even more great music.  I'm pleased to say that her Born this Way album definitely delivers!  It makes me feel like dancing and singing along to the songs.  She may not be liked by everyone, but that's OK since her music is just... hers.  She has this unique sound, it's sort of difficult to describe.      Aside from her music sounding great, another of the things I really like about her as a person is the message that she delivers.  She may be eccentric and viewed as odd by some, but her message of love of all people (like in Born this Way) is something that not every artist out there encourages.  I'd like to say she empowers people through her music, especially once they start listening to what she really has to say.      All in all, this album is great.  I recommend it for anyone.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|My first glimpse of Mumford & Sons was their video of \\"the cave\\" and i though they were a little strange but then i heard \\"little lion man\\" and that made me buy their album. There is no one like them, they truly personify great talent. The fist time i heard\\" after the storm\\", i was in tears because the lyrics touched my heart. A must buy for any true music lover.Mumford & Sons are refreshing compared to the crap played on the radio. I hope to see them in concert one day. PLEASE SUPPORT THEM.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'm still in the process of listening to the entire album (so far, I would rate it 4 stars), but I felt I needed to write a quick review about Amazon.    Via my Android phone today, I went to the Amazon MP3 app, and 15 seconds later I had purchased the album (late morning here in California) and started listening to it right away.  ZERO problems.  99 cents for the entire album!  Even if you just enjoy 2 or 3 of the songs, that is a bargain compared to other services.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Good things come to those that wait. I may have started to download 2 hrs ago. But with a lil patience, the album is complete. Another fabulous album from Gaga! I think if everyone would relax, breath, and let the download do its thing, youll be happy you did. May be slow....but definitely NOT a rip off!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I am loving the album, even though not all of the songs have downloaded. However, the review section is usually meant to be used as a forum for your thoughts on the product. Given this, its funny that all of these people have taken the time to give the ALBUM few stars when in fact they are upset with Amazon for taking longer than normal to download the album and might actually like the music.    Are people just dumb? This is a highly anticipated album and few artists are debuting albums today and even fewer have the presence of Lady Gaga. This, along with the fact that Amazon has done something quite amazing in offering this album for only 99 cents would cause many to be concerned over just how popular this might be. Considering that Itunes is selling this for $15, the amazon deal is a HUGE deal! And, with the promotion on twitter and facebook, i would be surprised if there wasn't a slowdown to the amazon servers.    Give it time, people, have you never been on a site that slows due to high traffic? at least the album is worth the wait, especially at the price.    Every song on the album is worth it. especially since you are paying the equivalent of one song. I highly recommend buying this asap
B004K4AVAG|2.0|I love Lady Gaga as a figure - she's always been highly inspirational and motivational, however, this review is directed towards her music - which in this case, has sadly been a disappointment. I loved almost all of the tracks on The Fame and The Fame Monster, but this album has largely been a disappointment. I knew that she could never live up to the bar that she set with her first two albums, but a drop of this caliber is astounding.    The \\"eargasmic\\" beats that made me want to dance have almost completely disappeared in this entire new album. I would have to go out on a limb and say that NONE of the tracks on this album are of the caliber of even the lowest of songs on her previous album, with the exception of maybe \\"You and I\\".    Track by Track Review:  1) Marry the Night (2.5/5) - It's got a good beat, I must admit. However, the lyrics - they're atrocious. It's hard to understand what she's even singing about half of this song.    2) Born This Way (3/5) - This song has a bit more depth to it, however, there are numerous covers of it that are sung better than her original. The beat, as in Marry the Night, is decent.    3) Government Hooker (0/5) - Quite possibly the WORST track on this album, and a contender for the worst track in all of pop music. It's a complete mess. It sounds like something procured by some cheap DJ in some awful club in downtown Tijuana, and her singing is rather atrocious too. The lyrics have no depth either. It sounds like the musical equivalent of someone's drunken vomit.    4) Judas (1.5/5) - An example of the many cases when the meaning she tries to convey is completely overwhelming. The fact that she named this song 'Judas' to begin with is astonishing. The beat is alright in this one. But the lyrics and their intended meaning cannot be taken seriously by any listener.    5) Americano (2/5) - Sounds like some twisted mix of the Polka / Electronic / Latin Music. The beat does not work well, and the lyrics are weak as well. Better than the previous two tracks, however.    6) Hair (2.5/5)    7) Scheibe (2/5)    8) Bloody Mary (2.5/5) - Another example of one of her overblown religious songs that is difficult to take seriously due to the magnitude of the comparison.    9) Bad Kids (2/5)    10) Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) (2.5/5)    11) Heavy Metal Lover (1.5/5) - Sounds like something taken from Kesha and Gaga put her name to it.    12) Electric Chapel (3/5)    13) You and I (4.5/5) - The only track on this entire album that would deserve to be included on \\"The Fame\\" or \\"The Fame Monster\\".    14) The Edge of Glory (3.5/5)    Overall, this has been a disappointment from Gaga. It's sad to see that she is already declining after her first two albums. The tunes and beats are worse than her first two and the lyrics' meaning are not as easy to connect to for a general audience. The fame she has received has clearly gone to her head. Her fame is all the image, and the music is deteriorating quickly.     (This will be updated again later in the day, once I've had a good night's sleep and found more words to express my disappointment.)
0802798225|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I started this book. I usually stick to fantasy when reading YA, and I didn't think a fictional book about forbidden love could deliver the same punch. But punch it did. This turned out to be one of my favorite books of the year. I loved the way you could get into both characters' heads and experience their turbulent feelings as they fell for one another. The language was dead-on for two teen characters, which kept it feeling \\"real.\\" I would suggest this book to anyone looking for a great love story!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|my purchase won't download and because there is so much trouble with it  I am afraid I am being charged twice since I clicked on it to try to rectify the situation. The album sounds good but that is only from the preview and I don't know how to contact amazon  digital to fix this and I understand this isn't the right place for this but I didn't know how else to  deal with this situation
0439023513|4.0|After reading both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins, I was greatly looking forward to another fast paced sci-fi thriller that was a quick read.  The fact that there was never a dull moment was one of the things I liked best about the other two novels in the trilogy, but was unfortunately not in Mockingjay.  However, it was similar in many ways to The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  The third installment of the novel was good. It just wasn't quite up to par with the previous two works.         Mockingjay started off at a fairly decent pace because it covered the time that passed between the second and third book. It answered a lot of questions and set the groundwork for the rest of the novel.  Katniss had landed in the middle of District 13, but was completely disoriented without the presence of Peeta.  Her struggle to understand District 13 and what role she played in the war with the capital was interesting at first, but after about 200 pages of the same old thing I started to get bored.  There are interesting moments involving Gale and Katniss; and Haymitch adds some humor, but the fast paced action was missing, or else not all that interesting.       However, the lack of action is almost made up for in the thrilling end of the novel.  There are some shocks, extremely depressing moments, and scenes that leave you surprised. The end was definitely the best part of Mockingjay.  I recommend reading Mockingjay if you've read the previous two novels in the trilogy.  Just don't be expecting a lighthearted read, because Suzanne Collins likes to lay on the heartbreak.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This is not working! I was so excited to buy this album for only .99. I downloaded it to the cloud and I am only getting 5 of of the songs. What is going on? The previous reviewer said they only got 2 songs. Who do we contact about this? I realize it is only .99 but it still should work.
1423113381|5.0|The Red Pyramid follows Carter and Sadie Kane as they try to save the world and their dad.  Carter and Sadie come from a long line of Egyptian magicians and must learn what they are capable of to help defeat the God of Evil, Set.  Carter and Sadie don't like their odds. Who would going up against an immortal god?  But Carter and Sadie have a trick up their sleeves that even they don't realize at first.  They are hosts to gods.  Carter has the power of Horus, and Sadie has the power of Isis.  With their new-found powers, will it still not be enough to defeat Set?  The Red Pyramid has an interesting way of relaying what is going on to the reader that I have never seen before.  The novel tries to give the impression that the story was recorded on a tape recorder from the point of view of Carter and Sadie while taking turns telling the story.  When either Carter or Sadie finishes telling part of the story, the other takes over where the last left off.  I really enjoy Rick Riordan's style of writing.  In The Red Pyramid, as well as the Percy Jackson novels, Rick Riordan is really able to incorporate aspects of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greek mythology into modern day society.  Riordan is able to write a book that is entertaining for boy or girl and is a great read at any age.  Riordan's The Red Pyramid is very informative about Ancient Egyptian culture.  If you have any interest in learning about Egypt this novel can really help you learn many facts about the gods and way of life of Ancient Egypt.  I do think that having prior knowledge about Ancient Egypt would make reading The Red Pyramid even more enjoyable.  With Riordan's Percy Jackson novels I had much more prior knowledge regarding Greek mythology, so I felt like I had more of a connection to the novels while reading them.  If you decide to read Riordan's Kane Chronicles, I suggest doing a little research about Ancient Egypt before reading them just to give you a basic idea of what is going on.  I give The Red Pyramid a nine on a ten-point scale and would recommend this book to a friend.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I've heard this album several times, haven't bought it yet but it's free on farmville and you can also hear it at Starbucks today, if you want to see if you like it before you buy. At first, I didn't like it much but after listening to it several times, it has grown on me. Not as good as her previous album but OK as a follow up. Nothing she does shocks me, because you expect that from her. If you are a Gaga fan, you'll probably like this album. I like Marry the night and Electric chapel the best.   Downloading it now, got 2 songs so far...it's slow but expected when so many people are doing it at the same time.
B004SEUJAA|5.0|My only problem with this release is that the part where the disc rests seems very cheap compared with WB and other Digibooks.  It is made up of a card-stock sleeve instead of the clear plastic disc holders that others use.  But other that that this is an excellent movie with reference quality surround sound.

B002NPY7FE|4.0|To all you folks that are complaining about a Saint Bernard being the wrong choice for this role, and that it was \\"too cute\\" to be scary, um that was the point. Sheesh. How could so many people miss that? It's the fact that a big, loveable dog has suddenly become a threat that makes this film so spooky. Man's best friend has suddenly become a monster. Had they used a Doberman or Rottweiller, everyone would have been like \\"Well, yeah, they're killers. No suprise it turned on them.\\" Most good horror works on the premise of the benign becoming the terrifying. This movie is the epitome of that. Also, a Doberman or Rottweiller wouldn't have been that threatening. Doberman's especially are small enough to send rolling with a well-placed kick. They needed a large dog that would be able to dent a car door with it's massive skull, and take three hits with a baseball bat. Get a clue folks.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|5/26:<br />Holy crap I'm so annoyed.  Amazon sent an e-mail about how to download the album since it didn't work on 5/23 - - and the instructions don't work.  Simple things shouldn't be so difficult. ;p<br /><br />5/23:<br />Uhhh... can't rate the album if I can't get it to download, can I?<br />It's only available to download for a limited time after you buy it, so after I did the troubleshooting it was already too late.<br />Good job Amazon!
B0051QJ83S|5.0|This is another great release from Gaga and even better that she and Amazon are practically giving it away for free on the day of release.  I find it laughable that so many are assigning 1-star reviews to Gaga's album because they feel cheated over what is obviously a technical glitch caused by overwhelming response to this offer.  Amazon will make good on the offer so it's time to stow your false outrage and temper tantrums and rate the product on it's merits as opposed to you feeling cheated out of 99 cents.
0385523912|4.0|Reading books like \\"Nothing to Envy\\", \\"The Rape of Nanking\\", and \\"Machete Season\\" makes me want to buy a nice ranch in Montana, away from people and society. It is absolutely CRAZY that some individuals feel they have the RIGHT to impose by force their \\"correct views about everything\\" on ordinary people and FORCE them to accept living standards that are not worthy of sewer rats! I was horrified to read about 3 millions death by starvation; the personality cult of the leader; the appalling lack of EVERYTHING in North Korean society. I liked how Deming weaved the stories of several people who escaped hell and rebuilt their lives in other countries, especially the story of the two lovers who could not keep their romance alive following their escape. What am I reading next? A biography of Pol Pot: different country, same madness.....
B0051QJ83S|5.0|I just purchased this item for $0.99 and got what I paid for... only 2 songs from the album are available to listen/download    Hair and Highway Unicorn are the only playable songs at this time.

My favorite part of the Study Bible is that they have clearly and continually shown God's plan of Salvation throughout the entirety of the Scriptures.
B00003CXRM|5.0|\\"... I figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought...\\"<br /><br />The Cohen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, have a certain style as co-directors, and they have certain regulars who often turn up in their ensemble casts: John Turturro, Holly Hunter and John Goodman from OBWAT? have been in Cohen Brothers' films before. OBWAT? is similar in some ways to other Cohen Brothers' films such as Fargo, The Big Lebowski, or Raising Arizona, but it stands out, even among Cohen Brothers' films, as a singular achievement. It has been described by them as \\"a hay seed Lawrence of Arabia.\\" It is also a Three Stooges film, with Clooney as Moe, Turturro as Larry, and Tim Blake Nelson as Curly. There is a bit of Popeye, a bit of Ma and Pa Kettle, and yes, the story is based loosely--very loosely--on Homer's Odyssey. The film addresses lofty topics like racial intolerance and political corruption, but in a very humorous way. The film has its own color--kind of a hot and dusty yellow--and music is an integral part of the cinematic OBWAT? experience. While not a musical per se, there is a plethora of blues, gospel, and 'old timey' music to savor. All of these diverse elements are combined here under the able direction of Joel and Ethan Cohen.<br /><br />\\"... pick up the pieces and retie the knot, mixaphorically speaking... \\"<br /><br />Not content to rest merely on their directing laurels, The Brothers Cohen also contribute to the film with their writing. Homer is listed as one of the writers (and good luck getting him or his estate paid their royalties, since none of them are to my knowledge members of the Writers' Guild). Like Homer's Odyssey, a man takes a journey that takes him far from home, but he longs to return to his wife and family before she succumbs to other suitors' advances. Along the way he encounters challenges, such as a Cyclops and some very seductive sirens. But it is what the Brothers Cohen do with the narrative structure provided by the Odyssey that stamps OBWAT? as a Cohen Brothers' product. Especially the dialogue, in particular the words spoken by George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill. He speaks with the eloquence of a backwoods philosopher, but sometimes his thought process is flawed, mixaphorically speaking. He sees himself as having the \\"capacity for abstract thought\\" but those thoughts are at times perhaps a bit too abstract to be practical. Though his thoughts aren't always logical, as he tells Pete, \\"it's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.\\"<br /><br />\\"... I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated ...\\"<br /><br />Clooney is perhaps best known as a dramatic actor, but he has an undeniable flair for comedy. His McGill is quite a creation--an arrogant buffoon who thinks he knows it all while he clearly does not, and yet he is quite endearing. He is kind of a snob, refusing to use FOP because he is a Dapper Dan man, and yet somehow the audience can't resist his obvious charm. John Turturro is a bit harsher as Pete Hogwallop, but he also wins over the audience. Another brilliant characterization for this talented actor. Tim Blake Nelson is a revelation as the naive, good hearted chain gang escapee Delmar O'Donnell. One is reminded of Buster Keaton when TBN is onscreen. The dead pan expression that says it all.<br /><br />\\"Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys performing \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\"?<br /><br />I had the good fortune of seeing Alison Krause and Union Station perform in Bakersfield when they were riding high on the crest of the OBWAT? wave. The guitarist for this group, Dan Tyminski, is the guy who actually sang \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" while Clooney lip synched it. T-Bone Burnett did a fantastic job producing the music for this odyssey. From the seductive song of the sirens, to the blues of Tommy Johnson, and the hit song of those fabled Soggy Bottom boys, or the gospel numbers like \\"I'll Fly Away\\" it was all top notch. The soundtrack all but swept the Grammies, very unusual for a sound track LP, but understandable, given the caliber of the music.<br /><br />\\"... if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?\\"<br /><br />One final thing I'd like to mention about OBWAT? is the cinematography. The film was shot in the traditional manner, on film, but then the images were manipulated digitally, to give the film a dry and dusty look, like an old time sepia toned photograph, and watching it, you almost feel like you are Grapes of Wrath migrants fleeing the dust bowl in the depression, or chain gang escapees with hell hounds on your tail. The DVD contains bonus material, and one of the segments details the way that color was used to enhance the look, by digitally altering it. They pioneered some cutting edge film processes, and in spite of how modern that may be, it all went toward creating a look that made you feel like you'd traveled back in a time machine to the dry yellow dust bowl of the depression era.<br /><br />\\"Well, that right there may be the reason you've had difficulty findin' gainful employment. You see, in the mart of competitive commerce... \\"<br /><br />In conclusion, OBWAT? was a triumph that featured excellent directing and writing from Joel & Ethan Cohen, great acting from Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and the rest of the ensemble, fabulous music put together by T-Bone Burnett, and great cinematography. You don't have to know about Homer's Odyssey to enjoy this film. It can be enjoyed by fans of Homer and fans of Homer Simpson alike.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00007ELEL The Big Lebowski]] (1998) Cohen Brothers cult classic that two Johns--Goodman and Turturro--were also in.<br />[[ASIN:0792846427 Fargo]] (1996) Another Cohen Brothers cult classic.<br />[[ASIN:B00006LPGP Raising Arizona]] (1987) Besides Nicholas Cage, this Cohen Brothers comedy also featured John Goodman and Holly Hunter.<br />[[ASIN:B002WNU0QW Leaves of Grass]] (2009) Written and Directed by Tim Blake Nelson.<br />[[ASIN:0783227949 Do the Right Thing]] (1989) Besides being a Cohen Brothers regular, John Turturro has also appeared in 9 Spike Lee films.<br />[[ASIN:0784011176 The Piano]] (1993) Holly Hunter received the Best Actress Oscar for this role.<br />[[ASIN:6305161968 Crash]] (1996) Not the winner of the Best Film Oscar, this Crash is a cult film directed by David Cronenberg that Holly Hunter appeared in.<br />[[ASIN:B00003CX74 Three Kings (Snap Case)]] (1999) George Clooney was in this film one year previous to O, Brother, where he also held down the \\"Moe\\" position in a trio of stooges.<br />[[ASIN:B001QOGYBI Fantastic Mr. Fox]] (2009) Clooney was the voice of the Fantastic Mr. Fox in this feature length claymation epic directed by Wes Anderson.<br />[[ASIN:B00005JH9C Sullivan's Travels: The: The Criterion Collection]] (1941) Preston Sturges film that provided this film's title.<br /><br />\\"...

B004RE29PO|4.0|I'm not sure whats going on with other reviews here but on my Panasonic Blu-Ray this movie has tons of white snow with the blacks. Like say in the beginning when they find Ripley in the ship, her hair has tons of white noise all in it. Actually most of the movie is like that. If you are sitting anywhere near the TV you will notice the white noise all over almost pulsating softly the entire time. My DVD version looks better then the Blu-Ray. And no I really don't think it's my Player or my Samsung LCD 1080P TV. Other movies I play on Blu-Ray look amazing. The star rating on I gave it isn't about the movie itself.. thats a 5 star to me. This review is about the quality of the Blu-Ray only. And my player also have the lastest Firmware. My player is really sensitive to any flaws in the transfer. Thats why when I watch a movie thats transfered to Blu-Ray well it just looks fantasic on my TV. I know this is an older movie but at this point i'd rather watch it on DVD in upscaled.     What this reminds me of is Predator all over again. Clear but grainy. Thats why they did a second transfer of Predator \\"Ultimate Hunter Edition\\" and fixed all the grain. Some like the grain but I don't. I don't think a Blu-Ray movie new or old should not have snow and/or grain.    Again not bashing the movie itself, i'm a #1 fan of Alien and Aliens. I've probably seen both 100 times.    I'd like to add also that I just watched ALIEN on Blu-Ray and that has none of the white noise. It looks 50X better than Aliens. I'm not sure they did wrong with the transfer with Aliens but it's a shame. This proves that my equipment is not at fault.     I will give ALIEN a 5 star with quality as my review. That does looks amazing. Ticks me off about ALIENS though as that with Alien are 2 of my favorites.    *Updated*     Beware of Panasonic players ( BD-60 )with this movie, I have discovered that was the problem. I tried it in a Sony player and it works great. So i've changed it to a 4 star instead of 2. Nota 5 star as there is still a slight grain to it from being an older movie although Alien looks better. Why that is I have no idea and it's an even older movie.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|It seems that so much attention has been given to Lady Gaga's resemblance to Madonna and her using the gay community as a marketing tool that her music has been overlooked. And that's a shame because \\"Born This Way\\" is a gem with some amazing songs. \\"Marry the Night\\" is a piano ballad with vocals as soft and smooth as honey and opens the album. The chorus arrives in an eruption of drums and power chords, and the sound gets bigger and bigger. As that song ends, Gaga holds true to her promise to deliver \\"sledge hammering dance beats\\" throughout the rest of the tracks. A triumph in sound engineering, she uses a variety of ways to open her tunes: pizzicato strings, operatic vocals, 80s rawk guitar, and then soon engulfs them all in buzz saw synths and robo-precise rhythms that make an instant impact. She touches on various themes: religion (\\"Judas\\" and \\"Bloody Mary\\"), freedom (\\"Road to Love\\"), identity (\\"Hair\\" and \\"Born This Way\\"), and hammers home the message like only Lady Gaga can. \\"Scheisse\\" has a ridiculously catchy chorus with Eurodisco-influenced techno beats. \\"You and I\\" is a beautiful piano ballad that offers a breather from the hammering pace set by the first few songs. \\"Edge of Glory\\" features some rad Clarence Clemons played saxophones that add a unique texture and is apparently a love song to her late grandfather. \\"Bad Kids\\" pays tribute to the NYC club kids era with a chorus that catches you and pulls you in. Everything about \\"Born This Way\\" is meant to provoke a reaction, and as such, it is a perfect expression of Lady Gaga's attention-hungry public persona. Highly recommended!!!

1593272839|5.0|I took a class on functional programing and the book assigned for the class, while useful, was entirely too difficult and abstract for a beginner to the functional world. Enter Learn You a Haskell for Great Good. This book is amazing.  It covers the beginning topics to get your feet wet beautifully and intuitively and then transitions, seamlessly to more and more complex topics. You never have to stop and wonder how you got to where you are. Eventually we had to write our own Haskell interpreter and while others struggled, having read this book, I breezed through the assignment. Excellent resource and highly recommended.
B0036B4ETS|1.0|Purchased this item for my new Sony Handycam.  Well, it worked while it was charging, but as soon as I started using the battery, I continually received an error message that told me this was a \\"bad\\" battery.  I did some research and found that I'm not the only one who has this same experience with batteries from Amazon.  I returned this battery, purchased another one from another vendor, (not Amazon) and got a good battery, no error messages.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Love it! What an epic follow-up to Lady Gaga's last album. And who can complain about the .99 cents cost? For those in need of patience, try saving it to your cloud drive, and check back in a couple hours. It will probably have published (it takes time due to the current server overload)- and then you can stream it anywhere and download to whichever computer you choose. Lovely music Mother Gaga.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|[Update]<br />Amazon.com finally got around to delivering the album.  I am imagining that whoever it was that came up with the \\"really popular artist's new album on release day for $0.99\\" promotion is probably in some hot water right now.<br /><br />But, anyway, Amazon's spectacular issues with digital file delivery in this case aside, the album itself is decent.  It is, in my opinion, a love letter to the 1980s, specifically to Madonna.  The album screams 1980s in its beats, \\"synthesizer\\" additions, and general feel of the music.<br /><br />None of the songs really grabbed me, unlike past albums.<br /><br />4 stars (updated from 2 stars from earlier today, when I couldn't get hold of the album to properly review it)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Please see the \\"customer image\\" I am uploading along with this review.  I went ahead and purchased the album with the Gold Box deal for my girl.  I have my mp3 store settings to put any new songs into my Amazon Cloud drive storage, AND to auto-download to my PC.  The auto-download didn't happen.<br /><br />So, OK, no problem, I can just go into the Amazon Cloud Player for the web, and select the album, and download it manually... um, actually, no ... I can't.<br /><br />I can't listen to the songs, I cannot download them, I cannot interact with them.  Only \\"Hair\\" seems to be available to me right now.  I am going to fire off an e-mail to customer service, but I thought I would put a \\"head's up\\" out there, to anyone who might be considering this deal.<br /><br />It is, most likely, just server load issues, and they will get it worked out.  But I (and I imagine, you) will be quite irritated if it is some DRM thing, or some sort of a \\"street date\\" thing.  If the album is available for purchase (at whatever price is set for purchase), then if I purchase it, I should have immediate and full access to it. Period.<br /><br />I will update this when/if this issue gets worked out, or I get more information.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Pretty good! One I would watch more than once! But I have a few other romantic comedy's (such as how to lose a guy in 10 days) that are my favorite and deserve 5 stars, so I only gave this one 4 stars!

B0051QIGP4|2.0|I was only able to listen to half of the previews before I had to turn it off.  I had already listened to 4 of her songs including Born This Way and Judas and they all sucked.  The Fame was so much better than this.  She's changed her sound and is no longer as great as she used to be.  This is why so many singles have been released and why Amazon has this for 99 cents and why GaGa herself has said it is the album of the decade.  They are doing everything they can to make you buy this piece of crap.  If it was really that good, they wouldn't have said or did any of these things.  99 cents in a good deal if you like one or two of the songs, but quite frankly her and her label should be embarrassed.  What a letdown!
B003R0LBVW|2.0|Franzen's depiction of the \\"nuclear family's facade\\" is all too real, not allowing the hardened ironist some comedic interlude from the oppressive mimicry of the odd.  The character's dialogue is not believable either, to me, and if to you, then God bless you and keep you.  And keep you away from me.  An excerpt of the dialogue may prove the point: \\"Excuse me,\\" she said, \\"what happened here? Can somebody tell me what happened? Did somebody declare war on trees without telling me? Who is this Paul Bunyan with the truck? What's the story? Is she not renting anymore? Are you allowed to annihilate the trees if you're just renting? How can you tear the back wall off a house you don't even own? Did she somehow buy the place without our knowing it? How could she do that?...

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Gaga does it again! Born this way is a 5 star effort, and well deserving. This will be a \\"MONSTER\\" seller for sure!

Could acting be next? GO GAGA!

B000HWZ4A2|3.0|You can definitely tell that the screenplay was done by Ayn Rand.  She made sure the director followed her theme exactly which stifled the feel of the movie and the directors attempts of making the characters a little more human.  Most if not all the characters dialogue felt like they were delivering a speech and in such a frenzied pace.  It just didn't feel people would talk like that in real life.  It's nice to see a film in black and white which has been shot so well.  The lighting and shadows are used to good affect, but the acting is too stilted and often the dialogue is obviously one sided in trying to express the author's point to excessiveness.  It's too bad since I admire Gary Cooper as an actor and felt that the movie might have been more effective in getting it's message out had it not been for the heavy hand of Miss Rand.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|Yes, 99¢ for an entire album is a bargain, from an economic point of view. But when the music is this bad, is it really a good deal? I submit, \\"NO!\\" Bad disco is still bad, no matter how cheap it's offered. Better to spend that 99¢ on one good song than throw it away on junk.

If she didn't try so hard to be over the top and copy, or out-bizarre, Madonna, I might enjoy it more than I do.    On to the purchasing snafu some people are having. I purchased the Born This Way [+digital booklet] version three times for three different people using three different computers; a pc, a Mac, and a netbook. All purchased and downloaded with zero problems. I use the Amazon Cloud Drive and the Amazon MP3 downloader. And the fine print of it all is that Amazon does RECOMMEND people use them to purchase, stage, store, and download your music purchases. Quite a few people have opted for neither and solely came to Amazon for the .99 album.     These people will eventually get all of their purchase. But they are unfortunately on a low priority service tier. Cloud users with Amazon MP3 are top tier. Amazon MP3 is second tier. The bottom line is that some people opted to not use those services; so their music was not instantly transferred and/or downloaded. They will get it today; it just won't be for a while. Be patient and keep checking your download queue. And ALWAYS please, please, please, read the fine print.
B004EPZ070|3.0|Gennifer Goodwin is really sweet, shy and really beautiful. She played the youngest of the three Mormon wives of Tom Paxton in \\"Big Love\\". She is so pretty she just lights up the screen whenever she's on it. She is so pretty she almost makes you forget what is happening.

A wedding where she is slated to be maid of honor.<br /><br /> Yeah, Darcy is loud, lewd, vulgar and brassy (Kate Hudson). And the fianc&eacute; hasn't the dangling things to make up his mind. So I guess it's OK to steal her intended. As long as its' fluff and you don't think about it too much... . Directors try to manipulate your feelings about characters, try to make you like characters who do reprehensible things... Gennifer Goodwin is just beautiful in her pencil skirt and stiletto heels, did I say that? she's a lawyer...<br /><br />The only truly likeable, well-motivated character here, a character with character, who can see what's really going on, is played by John Krasinski, and he who just sort of disappears...<br /><br />despite what is said below, the movie is very well-cast, in fact the casting is its greatest strength, and that includes the brassy Kate Hudson.

She does talk about some serious matters, including her scar and how it happened.  She also explores being a woman in a male dominated business, motherhood, marriage and trying to manage it all.  She sometimes seems a little guarded about sharing too much of her private life.<br /><br />The book sometimes jumps around a lot and like SNL, some bits are better than others.  In particular the story of her honeymoon is one of the funniest things I've ever read, well listened too since I `read' the audio which was read by Ms. Fey.  It's a short book and made for a pleasant few hours and put a smile on my face. Good job Don Fey's daughter.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Took over an hour to download @99 cents for the album, but got it all by hitting \\"retry\\" a lot.    Some toe-tapping tunes here....don't know that I'd pay full price for it, but it was worth a buck.
0307477479|5.0|Choosing tags for Jennifer Egan's \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" is an exercise in creativity, for this is a book that does not belong in categories.  It is what it is. . .strange, provoking, insightful, funny, heart-breaking, experimental, and weird.<br /><br />The interlinked stories follow a group of people who share a common interest in music. Their lives are wonderfully warped.  Each does something that changes his/her life and repeats doing something else to change life again.<br /><br />Time (the goon) is a consistent theme as is the making of music and the making the most of both. The book covers the eighties and onward into a sci fi world beyond us.<br /><br />From Scotty's fish to Dolly's PR adventures to Stephanie's tennis whites, each character is marked by a fixation and a result that is less than stellar. The trip to Africa and the presence of Albert in that part of the story were my favorite part of the book.  I also love the way Egan occasionally fast-forwards to fill us in on what happens to the character after we leave him/her in the present moment.<br /><br />Of all the adventure tales in the world, I happened upon \\"Goon Squad.\\" Lucky me!
0307887960|5.0|I was very impressed with the book \\"The Dukan Diet\\".   It has a lot of information that helps you understand how this method works.   I am very anxious to begin this diet and feel very confident that it will help me lose the weight that I want to lose and keep it off.     I highly recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I got angry birds rio the day it came out.. now i cant install the update. whats with that? disappointed is an understatement.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I am no fan of Lady Gaga and I have no intention of ever listening to this music I just purchased. In fact, I can honestly say I have never listened to a complete Lady Gaga song--the first thirty seconds are usually enough to send me out of the room. But seeing that this $0.99 purchase makes my 5GB Amazon Cloud Drive suddenly a 20GB cloud drive, I decided to do it anyway.    If I can find a way to do so, I'll likely just delete the music and never miss it. But I'll gladly use the free space online for the next year.     My rating is 3 stars for the awesome offer, but minus two stars for the embarrassment of having to admit that yes, I did once buy a Lady Gaga album. May the universe have mercy upon my soul.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I wasn't quite sure I would like this movie but it was unexpectedly very touching. My grandsons also enjoyed the movie.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I'm only able to access 5 songs, for 99 cents still a good deal. bad on Amazon.com for this issue.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|First time using cloude AND buying from amazon ... i only got one of the songs and the book (though all others are listed there and grayed out ... what happened?
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It downloaded the digital booklet and that's all. Very perturbed.    Love the music though hence the 5 stars.
B000002J1O|5.0|If I only got to keep ONE Genesis album, this would definitely be that one!  This, hands down, is the finest hour of not only Genesis the quintet, but of the entire Genesis catalog.  \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\" and \\"The Cinema Show\\" are two of the absolute best progressive rock songs ever written!  Why, oh why, did Banks, Rutherford, and Nick Davis remix this album to sound so drastically different from the original.  They could have made an improvement here and an improvement there while still staying true to the original, but they chose to mix this masterpiece in a manner that was so unnecessarily jarring to the people most likely to purchase the SACD in the first place.  Unless you have a good virgin vinyl copy of this album, as well as the means to play it properly, then this 1994 Definitive Edition is the only one I would ever encourage anyone upon which to spend their hard-earned money.  I do hope that maybe, just maybe, they release the original mix on SACD.  In the meantime, I'm gonna stick with the 1994 remaster and lick the wound on my wallet that the remix left.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|That's not a put down. All films in this genre are fantasies (duh, I know). But the film has an interesting premise and plot... There were opportunities to use some Jessica Biel's physicality (no tongue in cheek), but they were missed. Too bad! ... I like Julianne Moore, but she was miscast in this. Tough cop is just not a good role for her.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I quite like this album more than I thought I would. I'm not a huge fan of the song Born This Way (good message, annoying song) or Judas (it's kind of catchy but overall, pass).    For $0.99 (go go student download!!), I figured why not. And it is definitely quirkier than her first 2 albums. Side note though, it takes a year and a half to download. I'm not sure why, I've never had this problem with amazon MP3 downloader but it's been downloading for roughly an hour and I've received half the album. From what I've heard, interesting songs to listen to so far are tracks 7 & 9. Also I'm not sure if there is an unedited version but if there is it would've been nice to have advertised that instead of this.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|I bought this CD solely based on Adele's Tiny Desk Concert on NPR.  She's much better in the intimate setting of TDC with just her and two other bandmates.  Her talent shines through on TDC, not so much in the studio.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It is 5:40pm EST and I just downloaded the whole album in less than 2 minutes.  I heard about the promo earlier in the day but waited because I expected a mad rush in the AM.  Whatever problems Amazon had earlier in the day are obviously resolved.
B000002GVO|5.0|So punk music came along to save as from the type of music The Eagles put out?  What a lot of garbage and just how many punk records from that period are remembered as fondly as \\"Hotel California\\"is.Sit back and listen to what The Eagles do best,sing fantastic songs with great voices,amazing harmonies and produce music that flows like a velvet river. This album along with \\"Rumours\\" and \\"Sgt.Peppers\\" are essential albums for any collection plus of couse \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\",thanks Bob.  From the openning bars of 'Hotel Calfornia' to the glorious conclusion of 'The last Resort' this is an album of highlights.  The magnificent harmonies in 'Try and love Again' and the joyful yet sad feelings of loss depicted in 'New kid in Town',simply glorious.  When this amazing record came out I was just finishing high school,I remember hearing this played repeatadly at bbq's,sitting around a swimming pool,having a beer and enjoying another great Australian summer,ah the memories!  So  dear Eagles long may you be remembered for this amazing, fantastic,sublime record.Thank you from a fan!
B003ASLJO0|4.0|The first two-thirds of this I thought were hilarious, though I don't suppose this is intended as a comedy. Clint's gruff old man sneers and wheezes made me laugh repeatedly. He is so miserable that it's comic. He reminds me of Charles Bronson's old 1970s \\"Death Wish\\" character, a grizzled man who sets out to take revenge at any cost. Then it slowly morphs into a PC tale about a Hmong gang in Detroit taking shots at a next door family of Hmongs that Clint befriends after first finding them annoying and repulsive. It gets a little violent at times. The Gran Torino of the title is an actual 1972 Ford that was never one of the better cars of its day. Here, because it looks pristine, there is a certain attractive quality to it. This somewhat strange feel-good movie brought an occasional tear, surprisingly.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This album is definitely one of Gaga's best. She's gone from bubblegum pop to hard edgy rock infused pop. Gaga is definitely kicking butt and taking names. She wants to showcase her music skills in ways that many artist are scared to venture in. \\"Born This Way\\" has few filler tracks which venture into new styes of music that only indie musicians would dare experiment with. If you haven't gotten into Gaga yet, then I'd suggest Born This Way as a must buy album. You'll like at least ONE song from the album. It's worth every penny.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Awesome album! Every song is Lady Gaga at her best.<br /><br />If you're thinking about getting the $0.99 version, note that it is a promotion for Amazon Cloud player<br />and YOU WON'T RECEIVE YOUR SONGS FOR UP TO 3 HOURS unless you download their cloud player.<br /><br />That is all! Get this version! :D
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|This is a great implementation, but I find the video performance to be lacklustre on my Optimus T.  This only has a 600mhz processor so I suspect a 1Ghz processor or above really gets the best out of this.  I tried the 'lower color, more speed' option but it didn't do great.  I still need to get some time to optimize it.    I'd love to see an addition where the plex app on the phone can act as a remote for Plex on the TV.    The only app I've actually paid for so far.
B0046W1692|4.0|I love this CD!. full of emotions, particularly the song about the death of Feir's mom and sister. Great music however I still like better Amar es combatir. Well, I have to have every Mana CD so I beleive this is a must to have!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I ordered THE KING'S SPEECH the day the DVD become available.  It arrived by mail about 4 days later, and it's been seen at least 4 or 5 times.  I've now seen it 3, and I don't get tired of it.  The performances by Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter and Colin Firth (all Oscar nominees)were just wonderful.    I recommend it highly...
0061120073|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn tells the story Francie Nolan and her family growing up in Brooklyn in the early 20th century. The book is divided into five parts. In part one, the reader meets eleven-year-old Francie and her little brother Neeley. Francie and Neeley live with their parents, Johnny and Katie in the tenements of Williamsburg. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic and Katie works as a house cleaner. Living in utter poverty, Francie and Neeley earn pennies selling scrap metal with other children of the tenements. Part two tells the story of Johnny and Katie's meeting and falling in love as first generation immigrants. Part three describes the Nolan children as they begin school, as well as the death of Francie's father from pneumonia. The rest of the book chronicles Francie's coming-of-age as she and Neely grow up and get jobs to support their family. As Francie's life appears to have more on the horizon than that of her mother, she can't help but remember the small apartment in Brooklyn where she grew up.<br /><br />Though written almost seventy years ago about a time long since past, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn remains one of the most celebrated and classic coming-of-age tales .The character of Francie Nolan is one many teen girls can identify with: she struggles to find out who she is while coping with her father's alcoholism, her family's poverty, and her unfortunate surroundings. Addicted to reading and education, Francie's unending struggle to better her life has and will continue to inspire many. Betty Smith paints a rich portrait of the characters in the novel, and as they grow, the reader feels connected with their lives. The book is also an excellent look at life in the early 20th century. Smith's attention to detail is perfect for creating a realistic backdrop for her story. In a way, Brooklyn itself is another character in the novel. Francie's ability to overcome adversity, essentially becoming the \\"tree\\" that grew out of Brooklyn, is what keeps generation after generation interested in reading this wonderful, heartwarming novel.<br /><br />I have read this novel twice, once when I was about 14, the second time as an adult. Both times I thought it was wonderful. It is truly a classic piece of American literature, but I have met quite a few people who've never read/heard of it. It's definitely a must-read for people who enjoy historical fiction or period novels, but can be enjoyed by all audiences.<br /><br />Like my review?

B0051QIGP4|1.0|I thought that this promotion was a good deal and bought it immediately, However, instead of the whole album, i just recieved the MP3 booklet and one music i.e. Electric chapel! Quite disappointing. I do hope Amazon will find a way to rectify this problem.
B0051QK87S|1.0|I'm sure the album would be great. I love Lady Gaga and want to listen to it, but only 1 song got copied to the cloud player. Um... Amazon... you might want to check/fix this. The review rating probably would be 5 outta 5, but since Amazon screwed something up.. it's only a 1 and should no way reflect Lady Gaga's talent as a artist.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Just pre ordered [[ASIN:B004Y9CREU Alpocalypse]] by Weird Al Yankovic and it came with a free .99 cent credit towrds an mp3 purchase. Since Lady Gaga was kind enough to approve Als parody \\"Preform this way\\" after some idiot working for her said no, my credit goes towards her album as thanks. Not so much a huge fan of that style of music but am a huge fan of her sense of humor and appreciation of her fans. I have no problem supporting that. My girlfriend on the other hand will love this album.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I have been using AmazonMP3 for several years now and the technical difficulties are extremely rare! They are almost always cheaper than iTunes and they even automatically add the tracks to iTunes for those really technically challenged people.     Now on to Born This Way.     I think it's important to note that I am a casual fan and not a Little Monster. With that being said, I'd say this album goes right in sync with her other material. It's not award winning lyrically and actually pretty cheesy quite often. However, Lady Gaga makes up for her often uninspiring lyrics with grand theatrics and sheer musical genius. She's actually a talented singer who does not need to rely on the hated auto-tunes. She is also a talented musician with a background playing the piano. Finishing it off, she hires some of the best musicians to help co-write her songs and the best producers to complement her personality/style. Overall, I'd say this album is filled with more than enough quality pop gems that will no doubt be over-played for the next 2 years until Gaga releases her next monster album.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for months now. Lady Gaga is my absolute favorite artist. Her songs on this album are very rock techno. She sings a lot about love and being who you are which everybody needs to hear every once in in a while.     I listen to every song on this album over and over again because some are fun, while others are sad but still catchy.     Right now it's only a dollar, so how could you go wrong?
B004LZRRRE|5.0|I received my DVD of a-ha's final show and was pleasantly satisfied. I was able to see them last  year in New York City for their farewell tour and since I've seen them, the group upgraded the light and stage show for their final show's in Oslo. '    I had no problem with any playback (I have a Sony Blu-Ray player) and the dvd also contained a brief  documentary as well as quick photo gallery of some the concert and backstage photo's. I had hoped for more but a-ha leaves you wanting more!    I highly recommend this dvd. Sorry to the fellow reviewers that had bad luck with their dvds!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|TIMELESS......HER VOICE IS UNMISTAKABLE AND AGAIN STEVIE NICKS TAKES US TO THE DARK PLACES OF HER MIND THROUGH MUSIC. FOREVER POWERFUL AND INTENSE.....A MUST HAVE!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|There is so much packed into this album, that it's impossible not to find a favorite. I admire Lady Gaga for incorporating different styles of music into her second studio album. She's one of the few pop artists out there at the moment who would be so daring as to add rock and roll-esque music to a pop album, and the results are impressive.
0811836363|5.0|THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY si no es el libro \\"definitivo\\" sobre los BEATLES, si que es un libro impresindible para todo beatlemaniatico. Repleto de personalisimos articulos, elaborados en base a recortes de todo tipo (entrevistas,radio, television,etc etc), donde en primera persona, nos enteramos sobre la historia de los BEATLES a través de los mismos BEATLES. Esto es muy novedoso, y el plus de tener una gran cantidad de fotos e imagenes raras en su mayoria de los FAB FOUR, y el tamaño generoso del tomo, la gran calidad de impresión, lo hacen increiblemente muy atractivo. Lo unico discutibles es la falta de análisis \\"imparcial\\" sobre esta ya legendaria época musical.Pero para eso ya hay muchos y excelentes libros que complementen la información que se da en este libro. Hay que destacar que el este THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY es el libro acompañante de esa magnifica serie de tv del mismo titulo, disponible en DVD, además de cds de musica relacionado. En conclusión, con este THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY es un libro que debes tener y leer si tu corazón es beatle. No hay pierde en este. Debes tener este libro, asi de simple. Saludos de Perú.
0375842209|4.0|Many negative reviews of this book insist that the writing is bad.  While I can easily understand that the style may not be to everyone's taste (and may even be grating to some), I'm almost offended that people could say the writing is \\"bad.\\"  The writing is spectacular.  This is the English language as it was meant to be treated.  It's purely artistic.    As for the story itself, I found it thoroughly engaging: the terrors of the Holocaust lurk behind the snapshot of a seemingly tranquil German town.  The atrocities of the Holocaust are not news to me, and still I cried several times while reading.  I loved the characters and appreciate the way Zusak treated them with such honesty and dignity.    The story does drag a tiny bit through the middle, but all in all it was a worthwhile reading experience.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|The music is good...but Amazon isn't delivering what they promise!  BAD AMAZON!  I purchased this morning at 9AM by 3PM, I still only have the same 4 songs I had 2 seconds after purchase.  Don't be deluded that you are purchasing the entire album for 99 cents...you will only get a couple songs...
B0051QIGP4|5.0|One dollar for a day one album release?  That is $0.29 cheaper than a single off iTunes!  For once, the legal way to download music is the easier way.  My cloud player has instant access to the songs and I downloaded them to my hard drive in roughly two minutes. Amazon provided 20 gigs of cloud storage at no additional cost and the songs are actually good!
B0051QJ83S|4.0|I bought this album w/the Amazon MP3 app for blackberry 4 hours ago and the songs still haven't downloaded + I keep getting error messages, then I logged on to the actual Amazon site and I see that mostly everyone's having problems here as well. I'll be happy if the problem gets fixed and I get the WHOLE CD for 99 cents, and if it never get's fixed, I'll just have to go to a real store and buy a real CD full price. I guess this is what I get for being a cheapskate :(    ::UPDATE::  After 10 hours of downloading time, I finally got all songs. It was well worth the wait, the album is lovely!

B004U52VPS|5.0|OK, OK..<br />It is angry birds In real life game.  The only thing it is missing is sound effects!!<br />This was a birthday gift for my 4 year old..  YEAH YEAH the box says 5 and up, but he sure is enjoying the game A LOT!<br />TO be honest we haven't sat down and played through a round according to the rules, but we don't have to to enjoy this set!<br />The blocks are plastic, but a very sturdy plastic with fund wood grain detail!<br />The birds are a great size, CUTE and look amazing!  the pigs are well designed to sit on their blocks and not roll around.<br />I have read through the rules and am sure it will a fun game to play.  The instructions are definitely easy to follow.<br />I know my kids will enjoy just playing freely, or trying to build what the cards show.<br />It can be a bit tough building some of the set-ups, you will accidentally bump things over, no biggie, comes with the concept of the game IMO and only adds to the play time.<br />The catapult can really get some air with it and launch those birds!  That is the biggest challenge, figuring out where to start your catapult and how hard to let it fly!<br /><br />PS the Catapult and one bird made a cute addition to an Angry birds Birthday cake I tried to \\"build\\"!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I've been an Adele fan since she released her first album and enjoy \\"19\\" very much. I was front row at her concert for that album and I must say that her voice is as flawless in person. I felt so honored to be in her presence.---Just when I thought she couldn't get any better, she releases \\"21\\". I can't even begin to describe how much I enjoy this album. She deserves every award she is nominated for for this album. She is such a \\"powerhouse\\". Not one day goes by when I don't listen to at least one song from this album! (I'm partial to \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" and \\"Lovesong\\" (cover)) You MUST BUY this album because it's absolutely amazing! I think there's something on it for people to relate to in all types of situations, from break-ups to the recovery, she puts it out there! If this album doesn't win \\"Album of The Year at next years Grammy awards, something is terribly wrong with the music industry! I love Adele so much! Enjoy!
B004SIIBGU|2.0|the app works , I really like the version on I tunes better. this doesn't give any access to ur saved searches. please make it better ......
B0051QIGP4|5.0|EVERYBODY!!! Please calm the FRACK down! This is Lady Gaga were talking about! Yes there are technical issues and glitches with the cloud player & downloading app! Remember though you paid just .99 for an ENTIRE ALBUM! The most important thing IS you've locked in this amazing price! Amazon will make it right and you WILL get your music! If you want it in your hot little hands so bad then may I suggest you go to your nearest brick & mortar shop and pay the FULL retail price, like a TRUE FAN would, otherwise just take a breath and go listen to the full songs on youtube! Giving this album a 1 star review because of a technical bottleneck is unfair to the artist!      PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE!!!
0345529057|1.0|I don't think anyone could sufficiently explain to me why delivering something electronically would cost double delivering it physically.     There is no explanation. It is an impossibility.    What's worse if the fact that I have all of these books in Hardcover, but to get them on the Kindle (books I ALREADY OWN) would cost me THIRTY FIVE dollars. Completely absurd.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I know nothing about Lady Gaga, other than a few pictures that I've seen that make me roll my eyes at a new KISS wanna-be or something.  But I do like Amazon Gold Box Daily Deals, so I thought I'd download the album.  I mean, only 99 cents, and at that, I already have an MP3 credit, so it's free.  How much better could it be to get a taste of this hit-pop-star?    So I listen to the music and I'm quite surprised that I don't hate it!  She may look like heavy metal, and I may not like the pictures, but her music has a great beat.  I didn't listen too much to the words, but I did notice the review that complained that some songs were edited for the release-date version of the MP3 album.  This is great for me!  Being \\"younger-at-heart\\" (i.e., don't like vulgarity), I greatly appreciate this Gold Box deal today.
0316056863|5.0|Absolutely fantastic from the moment I picked it up. To quote my wife, \\"I've never seen you so eager to read a book.\\"  Funny, witty, intelligent- most of these things were lost on me, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Tina Fey's autobiography clearly explains how she became the amazingly talented woman that she is today. Overall a brilliant read, accompanied with lots of pictures, which is a must for any book. Highly recommended.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This album has a variety of different songs featured on it and I always find it interesting when I hear a track and it's a little different than the last. Gaga rarely if ever disappoints and this album proves it! My favorite songs (in no specific order) are: You and I, ScheiBe, Americano Judas and Marry The Night. Get it here because compared to my local ad, Amazon has the cheapest price! Target wants $14.99!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Amazing beats, vocals, and songwriting! Expect the unexpected from Gaga, and be amazed. Every track will make you want to dance.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Only the pdf has downloaded, but message is that my purchase is complete.    Where do I complain on the Amazon website?  I haven't listened yet, so haven't rated appropriately.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This experience is horrible and is why people are stealing music instead of buying. It makes Lady Ga Ga look desperate too. Shame on you Amazon. I'll wait to go get it a local record store.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|i love it. classic turn based rpg action reminiscent of dragon warrior and early final fantasy. kinda steep in price but well worth the loot
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I am on my second listen of this album and am blown away by Lady Gaga's range and influence. $.99 for a brand new album, including a PDF booklet, is an amazing deal, especially since I was going to go out and buy the album anyway. Plus, if I had been disappointed, it wouldn't have been the worst dollar I'd ever spent.     Gaga is a creative genius, and even if she is a little weird, everyone knows her name because of it. Be who you are and love yourself, cuz baby, you were born this way!
B0034G4P80|4.0|Just ignore the critics' reviews and go see this movie!  It is an action filled, high energy production that you don't want to sit an analyze for technical or historical authenticity.  The story is based on comic characters and a myth ~ experience the movie for what it is --  entertainment -- romantic, full of spectacle and special effects, creepy monsters  and the hunka, hunka, hunka star Chris Hemsworth (drool...) Natalie Portman is the brainy and pretty (of course)  scientist who falls for Thor; and best of all, the master of his craft, Sir Anthony Hopkins, plays Odin the King of the Realm.  Hopkins is always great and lends gravitas and legitimacy to any production in whatever role he plays. The soundtrack is good and complements the action. Get some popcorn and settle down and enjoy the ride. Can't wait for the sequel!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I wrote to Amazon many times a few minutes right after an accidentaly order, asking for cancelling it, but have no answer. only after check the order the site shows all the costs. It should be before. Now i dont have this option for replacement, only refund with another cost.  What can it be done?  Thanks Gilmara
B004FQTGYQ|5.0|A couple of dynamite shows recorded when RJD was at his best. I picked up the vinyl, two-record set and it sounds awesome. It's good to hear some of the between-song banter left on the tracks instead of editing it out. For me, all the big hits were there and I got turned on to some good deep cuts. Definitely a must buy.
B004WMMFBY|5.0|I have watched every episode and they keep getting BETTER. OMG does anyone know when season 3 comes out. I have watch entire season in 3 days i am hooked MAJOR FAN...cant get enough!!! BY far my favoriate show ever!!!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I am not sure if it was a fluke or not, but I purchased this great deal online and paid for it, and I did not get any of the songs, but ended up with a virus instead!  I had to get my IT department involved, it was Malware.  I usually really love Amazon, but for this purchase I was dissppointed.
B0029LHWFO|5.0|This is quite a remarkable book considering that this individual is now President of the U.S. It was written when he was far removed from the Presidential radar.<br /><br />It is well written and the narrative is very vivid. The book is divided into three sections with very little inter-connectedness between them.<br /><br />The first is about his roots and growing up with his mother and grand-parents - in far flung regions of the world - Hawaii and Indonesia. The second is focused on Chicago and the community work he attempts to do. The last is about his journey to Kenya to be with his father's side of the family.<br /><br /> I found the first section to be the most revealing and personal - it sets the tone for the overall book. There are confessions of his awkwardness, of anger and rebelliousness, of not fitting into society. These are common complaints of most young people but Mr. Obama is quite eloquent about them. We sense an intelligent person with a keen sense of worldly observation - an individual who can astutely look at people from multiple viewpoints.<br /><br />I did become somewhat confused during the Africa portion; it would have been good to have a kinship chart to keep track of all these people - the half-brothers, many aunts and uncles and grandparents.<br /><br />One also gets the feeling that Mr. Obama is obsessed with finding the meaning of his long-lost father who was absent throughout his developing years (his father spent two weeks with him when he was 10 years old). It is like he is looking for a lost ghost - trying to find a missing link - a replenishment.<br /><br />This is a rare instance in modern times where a President has written a book (an autobiography at that) years prior to becoming a President. The only comparison I can think of (coming from Canada) is Pierre Eliot Trudeau who wrote several journalistic articles before becoming Prime Minister.<br /><br />Mr. Obama's book is distinctive and enjoyable.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|None of the songs on this album will download. I REALLY hope amazon either refunds me my whopping 99 cents or lets me know when i can download this album without an issue.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|My first thoughts on the album were a little short and narrow-minded, so here are my thoughts after a close second listen. I haven't read along with the lyrics, and even though there are plenty of political allegories and deeper meanings, I'm a \\"music first\\"-kind of guy. Melody and vocals is king, if the lyrics are good, that's a plus, but bad lyrics can't break a good song. Just like with the best metal music, what draws me to Gaga's music is the heaviness, the tempo and the relentless melody, simple as that. I find it sad that people are discussing the quasi-religious aspects to such a degree; if we can't even express ourselves freely through art and music, what kind of world do we live in? It does give the music a controversial edge, true, but I've always loved those kind of overdramatics; epicness, color and controversy, being bolder and larger than life, it just makes for a stronger iconography and mythology, which is exactly what made Gaga who she is; the myth and icon.<br /><br />\\"Marry The Night\\" is a great way to set the stage. The song establishes the almost non-stop tempo and is the first that you'll be slaughtering in the shower.<br /><br />\\"Born This Way\\" wants to be a lot better than it is; Gaga wants the whole world to embrace in an anthem of acceptance, but the in-your-face subject matter can't hide a rather bland song. It does stick a little bit, so passable if only for the catchiness.<br /><br />\\"Government Hooker\\" will divide people; it may come across as the most self-indulgent nonsense ever or an amazing feat of originality and art. It's actually pretty good, if a little bit annoying. One of the only songs that is neither sledgehammering nor entirely slow. Half-decent.<br /><br />\\"Judas\\" is \\"Bad Romance\\" done again, only faster and better; the way Gaga builds a dark, heavy, pounding structure and then soars above it with her vocals is so amazingly infectious, and I've never heard anything like her wonderful wailing. Fantastic.<br /><br />\\"Americano\\" is hilarious but also freakishly original, had Britney Spears attempted anything like this she would've been kicked out of Mexico in a heartbeat. Gaga nicely balances humor and musicality, making for a somewhat decent song, at least it's one of the album's few brighter moments.<br /><br />\\"Hair\\" isn't too bad, but there's nothing radical going on here. Steady beat, a love for follicles (ironic coming from someone who mainly wears wigs), good times. My favourite part is the \\"stuttering\\", but Gaga's known for that, and she's done it way better in other songs. Good.<br /><br />\\"Schei&szlig;e\\" is uhm...no musical highlight, let's just put it that way. Gaga throws together nonsense-German in a speaking manner, the result is underwhelming, maybe a little bit funny if you don't hail from Germany.<br /><br />\\"Bloody Mary\\" is another highlight. A slow and very dark (musically and lyrically) dance-ballad with Gaga's haunting vocals and all-out bloodcurling screams. Very inviting, great change of pace, absolutely memorable. Awesome.<br /><br />\\"Black Jesus  Amen Fashion\\" is the song that always passes me by; almost the entire song can pass before I realize it's started playing. That's not a compliment to any music, but the song doesn't strike me as particularly \\"bad\\" either though, it just doesn't reach out and grab you by the ears.<br /><br />\\"Bad Kids\\" sounds a bit off for me, sort of merging the dark and light, suddenly becoming a little \\"jolly\\" in the chorus, which doesn't cut it for me. Weak.<br /><br />\\"Fashion Of His Love\\" is a song I'd describe as \\"cute\\". One of the lighter, jollier little gems of the album, it might just stick in your head as well. The rhytmic percussion is a little much (a little too \\"present\\"), but the joyfulness in Gaga's voice makes up for it. Good!<br /><br />\\"Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)\\" is probably the weakest on the entire album. It always strikes me as a mishmash of tempos and ideas that don't gel; the overblown epicness of \\"Marry TheNight\\" and \\"The Edge Of Glory\\" combined with weird breakdowns and the typical Gaga-repeating. Keyboards and drums fight for sonic space, making this song sound like a bad overblown mixture of all the better songs on the album. Bad.<br /><br />\\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" isn't very heavy metal at all; it's a heavy dance/techno-grind with spoken and electronically skewed verses, blooming into a wonderful \\"ooh\\"-melody. It doesn't take much to make a memorable track, and this is definitely one of the better ones. Very solid.<br /><br />\\"Electric Chapel\\" is actually the most \\"metal\\" song on the album, it opens with a gripping heavy metal-guitar melody and builds into a steady thumping rock/dance track, which is equally subtle and hypnotic. The \\"du doo doo\\" melody is unbeatable; simple but undeniable, and followed by a guitar solo, it makes this the album's absolute highlight. Short but oh so very sweet.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is the companion to \\"Born This Way\\", another joyful up-tempo track that might put a smile on all kinds of queens' faces (take that anyway you please), but it's nothing for me. Bland, forgettable and with an odd tempo-shift. There's a little more soft guitar going on in this one though, which is the only saving grace.<br /><br />\\"Yo&uuml; And I\\" opens sounding almost beat for beat like \\"Speechless\\", but suddenly it adds a slowed-down version of the drum/clap from \\"We Will Rock You\\", so it's just a little bit heavier than most power-ballads. It's a little bit better than \\"Speechless\\" too, the overall melody isn't as \\"pop\\", and it works well with just piano and vocals as well. Decent.<br /><br />\\"The Edge Of Glory\\" will probably go down as one of the most memorable singles from the album, it's an unapologetic rock anthem disguised with dance-beats. An epic, victorious song for graduating students, drunk graduating students, skydivers and graduating skydivers. Clarence Clemons closes the album with his saxophone, bridging the gap between dance and rock, old and new, beginning and end. Very good.<br /><br />There's also a bonus disc with remixes, they are as follows.<br /><br />\\"Born This Way (Country Road Version)\\" is exactly what it sounds like; if Gaga's vocals were merged with some mellow Bon Jovi, this is what it might end up sounding like. I don't think it's the ideal song for a country-rendition (the chorus is far too grand), but it's really nice to hear a slightly different vocalization by Gaga in the verses. Decent.<br /><br />\\"Judas (DJ White Shadow Remix)\\" is the shortest of the remixes; it's what I like to call \\"zipper-techno\\" (technically electro house), the sound Benny Benassi is most famous for. Pretty epic nevertheless, far from the worst remix I've heard. Good.<br /><br />\\"Marry The Night (Zedd Remix)\\" sounds like a giant bass bumblebee (more electro house?) fighting a mosquito who fires beeping lasers. Weak.<br /><br />\\"Schei&szlig;e (DJ White Shadow Mugler)\\" goes on for nearly ten minutes, and sounds almost exactly like the previous track, except with Gaga's fake German interspersed. The horror.<br /><br />\\"Fashion Of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix)\\" dispenses of the odd percussion and provides a much cleaner and more straightforward take on the song. Good.<br /><br />\\"Born This Way (Jost & Naaf Remix)\\" chops the chorus into pieces and mixes it into a crescending keyboard battle. Half-decent.<br /><br />Overall, Gaga's taken her music to a darker and far odder place than the shallow hits on \\"The Fame\\", but she's also building on the legendary foundation set with \\"The Fame Monster\\", it's just too bad she goes so far it almost ends up sounding like parody at times. There is fierce originality here, and overall it's an album that shouldn't be missed, but most of the songs never make the extra leap from \\"passable\\" or \\"very good\\" into \\"new territory\\", or lack that extra bit of hypnosis or intensity. A weak four out of five is my final grade. Gaga's without a doubt the most compelling and interesting artistin the mainstream world today, but if she only dared to make a cohesively dark and intimate dance-rock-opera (and dispensed with the silliness), she'd make history by transgression.exactly what it sounds like; if Gaga's vocals were merged with some mellow Bon Jovi, this is what it might end up sounding like.

B000B8QG4A|1.0|Today 5/23/2011 I still have not received my purchase.  9101900007540570137517 is the postal tracking number I was Given.  The purchaser advised MEEE to file the search, which I have done, todate they still have not found the Package.  I feel the sender should have done the tracking since he/She knows what they sent it in.  I do not advise first time buyers to use Amazon
B000784WMW|3.0|This could have been one of the best versions and is quite true to the book.  The only thing that keeps it from being four star is Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre).  She moves like a snail, has this down cast look and sound as if she is about to be beaten at any moment and has absolutely no expression of emotion. Even when Rochester confesses his love for her, her expression never changes. Pity.
B001G9FFIQ|1.0|Let me start by saying I LOVE this album.  The low score is for the production value of the Vinyl release.  It is mixed so low it is barely audible.  I changed records and cartridges thinking I may have received a defective copy.  After looking at past reviews it turns out I am not the only one to have this problem. Hopefully someone will see this prior to purchasing a vinyl copy. Save your money and stick with the CD version.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|This review isn't a review of the album, but of the Amazon's digital music service.  I tried this as an experiment to see if I wanted to order more music this way, but it only downloaded half the songs.  Still a deal at 99cents, but not an experiment I'll want to repeat with a full-price album.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|I'd read about people having numerous problems with the down load I just downloaded mine in under 90 seconds.  Even if it would have taken longer it would have been worth it for 99 cents (Using Mac OSX and the Latest edition of Safari)
B002VRZEYM|1.0|A friend highly recommended the movie, so it was particularly disappointing.     More government regulation of food is what got us to a few companies processing most of our food in a few facilities. Government regulations in the name of safety mean small farms and small processing plants cannot afford the mandated equipment. Big companies can lobby government to get rules written and subsidies for their products. Stop subsidizing corn production and stop diverting corn to make ethanol.     If corporate managers and directors at competing companies are not accountable when they have to keep their customers from migrating to non-industrial farming, what makes the film makers or their on-screen speakers think that the USDA can do a better job if there were just more laws?
0812973992|4.0|After hearing many people tell me this book was wonderful I decided to read it (in paperback, not with a kIndle). The book appears long but believe it or not the author really allows his words to flow and the book moves fast and with an interesting interlocking of the characters. Although everything on the ground is mostly fiction, his ability to weave these personal stories into the action above the ground at the famous Trade Center Towers was wonderful.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Gaga has done it again.  This record is pure genius, the amount of different styles is great but it somehow remains cohesive.  It also crosses cultures and has such powerful messages.  Happy Born This Way Day!  99 cents you cannot beat that! (I got a hard copy as well though!).
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Giving the album the boost it needs for ratings after seeing bad reviews given for other reasons not even pertaining to the artist's work.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|DO NOT BUY THIS FROM HERE!!!!!!!!!  IT IS A RIP OFF!!!  i HAVE BEEN DOWNLOADING FOR OVER ONE HOUR AND ONLY ONE SONG HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOADED.  iF YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU GET SOMEONE FROM INDIA WHO CAN BARELY SPEAK ENGLISH AND THEN GET TOLD THAT ITS A TECHNICAL PROBLEM NOT A CUSTOMER SERVICE PROBLEM!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Don't pay too much attention to those complaining about not being able to access all the tracks.  This has happened to me to, but who cares-- it's just a glitch; I'm sure Amazon will take care of it soon.  I can only access one track at the moment, but it's a great track \\"Hair\\" and I'm looking forward to  listening to the rest soon.  Meanwhile, what could be better than getting the latest release from Lady Gaga for less than a buck!!!!
0525422943|5.0|Where She Went takes place three years later, and is told from Adam's point of view. It's revealed that after Mia decided to live, she went through rehabilitation and then promptly moved to New York City to attend Juilliard. In the process, she leaves Adam. Now, a major rock star with a very famous girlfriend, Adam is living the life, yet is still hurt from the break up three years ago. He's suffered a major downward spiral, and still has questions, but knows they cannot be answered. Then, when in New York for a day, he happens upon Mia's performance at Carnegie Hall. So he goes inside. And thus starts a night that re-awakens what was lost, and brings them so far from where they started.    The second book definitely added to the story, finalizing it in a way, and I'm so glad Forman wrote it. It once again showcases her brilliant talents, bringing these characters, this night, to life. Once again, the book was amazing. I didn't cry as much, but there were definitely tears. Tears as I learned how much Adam and Mia hurt, and how they had so far to go. Once again told in both present and past tense, chapters in-between the main plot explain what happened in the three years missing. The back story gives so much meaning to where Adam has come in his life, how hard it is for me to get by day to day.    New York City was the perfect setting for their reunion. Gritty and dark, like their past, it offered momentary lapses of bright lights and hope. Just what they needed. And the ending was absolutely perfect, if not better. And once again, music plays a huge role in the book, bringing them together and helping them take the next step.    When I finished Where She Went yesterday, I had to remind myself that I was in my bedroom, and not roaming the streets of New York, or not in the audience of a Shooting Stars gig in London. The characters aren't real, and neither is their story - but for one day, a few hours, I felt part of everything. Completely engrossed in their night, Ifelt like part of them, and even as I read the last word and knew it was over, I didn't want to let go.     The two books are sad, yes, but they're also full of hope and wonder and love and joy and music. Pick them up. Have a box of tissues ready. And let Mia and Adam into your life. You'll be happy you did.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Gaga has done it again.  This record is pure genius, the amount of different styles is great but it somehow remains cohesive.  It also crosses cultures and has such powerful messages.  I was worried she wouldn't be able to top herself, but I shouldn't have been worried.  It is Gaga after all!  Happy Born This Way Day!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I've been waiting nearly two hours, and have not even been able to download one single song.  Every download attempt fails and when I retry it \\"waits\\" forever and fails again.  I know this album is good because I've heard cuts from it, but I sure as hell won't ever buy it from Amazon!  I'll go back to my original method of saving individual mp3s to my desktop...too bad for Lady Gaga that she ends up with lousy ratings because you have rotten tech help...the rating I gave WOULD have been a five, but the aggravation lowered it by half
B003YFIUW8|4.0|easy, great read. very interestingly written. made me realize how important it is to expose my son to various things in the world! i would definitely reccommend!
B0051QJ83S|4.0|I read the previous reviews and was hesitant to buy the album.  I don't really like the singles from born this way and with so many people complaining about song downloads I decided to give up.  Then I remembered it's a dollar, so I gave it a try and sure enough three songs popped up.  I laughed, listened to Americano, liked it and went back to my cloud player and 5 more songs popped up.  Something that most people in this day in age are not used to is-- waiting.  I checked my purchased songs and yes, indeed, I have purchased all the songs from the album.  I'm sure due to the heavy traffic of all the people buying the album amazon is having trouble getting people the songs instantly.  The album is, thankfully, not as bad as the Born this Way single.  So chill out before you believed that Amazon scammed you out of a dollar that's probably somewhere in your couch.  I'm going to keep checking my cloud player and if I don't get the rest of my songs I'll delete my review and have a scathing one replace it.  So put your paws up and come to the realization that you can probably download the album illegally for free if this doesn't work.
014241543X|5.0|After suffering a catastrophic car accident, which leaves her family dead, 17-year-old Mia Hall is left in a coma. As friends and family gather in the hospital to mourn what happened, she experiences an out-of-body experience and witnesses everything happening. She comes to realize that she must decide what to do - let go and die with the rest of her family, or hold on and fight. I cried through probably 30% of this book, it was just that good. (Also, I read it on a plane, so you can only imagine how embarrassing that was). The book, told through Mia's point of view as she witnesses everything, is raw, beautifully written, and emotionally poignant. Forman did an amazing job bringing the characters to life (and then, well, killing them). And I loved Adam, Mia's boyfriend, and how he handled the situation (almost literally breaking into her hospital room to see her), and Mia's rock n' roll parents. Told both in present tense and past, as Mia reflects on her life pre-car accident in between chapters, it's emotionally charged and leaves you wondering - what would you do? And I honestly didn't know what Mia would do until the last page. I absolutely adored it.
B003JJYERY|5.0|Ok, I've been waiting for Asia to release something that made me feel like I did listing to the first one back in '82. (Oh, geez, I'm so old...)Phoenix got SOOO close, but this one does it for me.  Part of it may be the sheer sound quality, which I think is the best of any of their recordings. But the harmonies NEVER, NEVER, EVER stop blowing me away.  Plus, the little \\"dancy\\" keyboard parts that I liked so much from the first make the occasional appearance again, with matching guitar licks. It's just an amazing recording. My favorite track so far has been \\"There Was a Time\\", but the opener is the best since \\"Heat of the Moment,\\" in my opinion. Enjoy!
B004BLJQOK|4.0|With the various depictions of vampires in contemporary American culture, LET ME IN, a remake of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, relies less on flash and style than on emotional investment and neediness. Not having seen the original Swedish film, my review comes only from my impressions of this version. On the whole, I found the story troubling in a number of ways. Placing the film almost entirely from the boy's perspective suggests the various vulnerabilities he faces, victimized by school bullies, abandoned by his separated parents (the father having moved out, the mother resorting to alcohol and sleeping pills), and finding consolation only in candy and voyeurism, the boy seems a product of any number of cliches. Frankly, the film telegraphs its patterns early on, and there can be little question after the first half hour how it will end. The film works for me, though, in how we reach this ending. There are some stylistic turns, such as camera placement in vehicles, that can be absolutely disorienting. There are subtle indictments of institutions--the most blatant being the overcrowded school system, where even the most dedicated teacher cannot possibly keep an eye on all students--that suggest that children face any number of difficulties aside from the \\"monsters\\" of fantasy. There is also the restrained employment of conventional horror elements--shocking when they occur, not used so much to dull the senses. This film offers a talented rendering of familiar patterns and deflates the high romanticism of its contemporary vampire stories.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Full album for .99 as a special on the release date. Excellent idea. If you think you will like one or two songs it is cheap enough for you to buy the whole album. Other songs may even grow on you. New soon to be super pop songs like Marry the Night and Highway Unicorn are already holding a place in my heart. It's great to have some new Gaga at this price.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Gaga is brilliant in more ways than one! The album is a masterpiece, a great mix of songs. Making it $.99 is Lady Gaga's gift to all of us. I hope everyone enjoys it!! #PawsUp ;)I love Lady Gaga!!!

0440243688|5.0|Gone Tomorrow is one of the best Lee Child novels. The plot is tighter and the writing is better than in most of his other books. This is more of a plot driven book than an action driven book, especially the first half of the book; however, the action scenes are very good. There are good plot twists, and the reader and Reacher have to figure out who is lying and why in order to deduce the truth. Once Reacher puts it all together, the book finishes with Reacher as a one man army dealing out vengeance and justice.
0545123275|1.0|I bought the book because a friend suggested it. To me it wasn't good at all. Very poorly written. Seemed to me that it was rushed, and just slapped on the page.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|First the technology. It's 3pm Eastern. I paid for the album and was able to immediately listen on the Cloud, so no complaints. Just wanted to reassure those who anticipate problems. Not sure what's up with the digital booklet, but am assuming it will appear when I download the album. Still on my first listen, only to third track, and am digging it. Gaga continues to create a mix of light-hearted pop and social commentary, all in the groove.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Although I purchased this roughly six hours ago and I still only have two songs, I trust the rest will come with time. I'm a Gaga fan, so I'm sure I'll like the complete album.  My rating is technically only for the songs I've already heard, but I thought that the album could use some love since it's being rated low because of the technical issues with Amazon.
006135323X|2.0|First came inspiration: [...]    then, came disappointment. Predictably Irrational is a book that adds nothing particularly insightful to our life. While there are some interesting observations, most are very obvious. He proves very obvious hypotheses through sometimes crude experimentation. One example is from the chapter 'The Influence of Arousal,' in which he seeks to prove that our decision-making is at time shrouded by our emotions, particularly the emotion of arousal. He hypothesizes that when people, especially teens, are in a situation of sexual arousal, they will be less likely to make sensible decisions such as wearing a condom, or forcing their partner into doing things they may initially have been reluctant about. His methodology: have teens answer a series of questions, then have them answer the same series of questions whilst masturbating. The conclusion: teens are more likely to engage in sexually promiscuous and irrational behavior when they're horny. OBVIOUSLY!    It gets worse: his brilliant solution to this inherent human flaw of being too-easily swayed by libido is abstinence! Yes, instead of having to deal with difficulty in trying to make the right decision while horny, we should just avoid being in that situation altogether. Particularly teens, yes, they should just be discouraged from having sex. likely.    His lectures seemed so promising, he's a humorous, brilliant speaker with a quirky yet charming accent. If only his writing were as striking as his speech.
B003NHRGSQ|1.0|Just like the first book, this one was very poorly written. Seemed that the words were just slapped on the page. The love story is horrible, not believable at all.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Lady Gaga has outdone herself again! I absolutely love this new album and how she made it for her fans! Born This Way is my favorite!
B000EHQ57Q|2.0|If you read enough reviews you'll find many, including myself, who don't like the disc being touted as 5.1 when it's really quad. I think people would be interested if it was advertised as just 4.0. Another issue is the bonus tracks. They can not be heard on the SACD layer, only the CD layer. Here's my particular problem. When I first played it, I could tell the horns and background vocals on the song, \\"Question\\", were completely missing. The guitar is all you hear. My machine would not pick up the CD layer at all making it seem then that it's a single layer SACD. But if the bonus tracks can only be accessed through the CD layer then it can't be a single layer so there's another faulty disc issue. I went to my car and the CD layer played but guess what? The horns and vocals missing on the SACD layer for \\"Question\\" were now audible as normal. Although I like a few songs, QOB was never my favorite Moody's title so I'll never replace it unless I can find a really cheap copy sealed or if used, only if I know all the music plays and the condition is pristine. This is the only Moody's SACD title that so expensive. All the others on SACD are $20 or so. The DTS versions are still fairly rare though.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Dwayne Johnson does it again with this in your face immediate action packed film.<br />He shows he has the talent to go from a Kids Hero and Comic Relief to a Stone Cold Killer. He acts as well as does a great job with stunts.<br />As he plays the character who is set on revenge for the murder of his brother, the film shows that though he is out for revenege he does have a heart and can forgive.<br />It was a great movie from start to finish.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|What an album!! I'm a Gaga Fan so I waited until they finally released on Amazon... and to my surprise it was only a buck. I bought the 99 cent version and opted to buy the 3 bonus tracks since it only ended up costing me 4 bucks all together! By far the album is a growth. Still Gaga and still catchy in that gaga way. Take a hit and pay that 99 cents and even if you don't end up liking the whole album, you basically got it for the price of one.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Know before you buy: This IS the edited version.    This album is fantastic! Well, the 11 songs that I have been able to download from Amazon are fantastic anyway.  Still waiting for the remaining 3, but I'm enjoying these in the mean time.  Can't believe it was really only $.99.  For that price, I'm willing to wait until the Amazon servers clear up before delievering the rest of the album to me.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Nice dance album, great songs, but nothing that we will listen to 20 years from now like Madonna, more like the Party Monster soundtrack. fun songs though.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|love it hands down. being able to have my music anywhere without eating up space on my sd card. also not having to fumble with syncing with the pc is a plus
B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast just kills it on this LP. This LP was WAY ahead of it's time, they really took the game to a whole other level with this LP. Damn, makes me miss those days. This album is a CLASSIC.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Does this deal look too good to be true? That's because it is. Several people have had trouble downloading the full album. I am one of them. I paid my 99 cents and got one song and the digital booklet. Oh Well. This is what happens when you have too many things going on at once.
B004K4AUZW|2.0|Let me preface this by stating that I love Lady Gaga.  I think The Fame Monster is virtually flawless and I still listen to it regularly.  That being said, I see no reason to give her a free pass just because I think she's great.  I had a lot of problems with Born This Way and I'm not sure how to feel about this CD.  Parts of it are flawless; a lot of it sucks.  Track by Track review ahoy!<br /><br />Marry The Night (2/5) - This song is growing on me a little.  It is definitely catchy, but unfortunately it sets the tone for the rest of the CD.<br /><br />Born This Way (1/5) - There is just so much I hate about this song.  Everyone knows what this sounds like so there's no need to get into that.  What I dislike the most is that Gaga has proclaimed this song to be the Best Gay Anthem Ever.  There is zero subtlety to this song and there is little to draw true inspiration from.  Totally calculated in my opinion.<br /><br />Government Hooker (3/5) - I know a lot of people have trashed this song. It's true that the lyrics are completely insipid and the screeching \\"HOOOOOOOKAAAAHHH\\" is obnoxious.  But this beat is FIERCE.  It just makes me want to strut around my apartment in the highest heels I have, smearing lipstick on the walls or something, haha.<br /><br />Judas (2.5/5) - I don't mind this song.  There is a lot happening musically and I really think this song would have benefitted from some paring down.  The best part of the song is the breakdown (despite the fact Gaga is terrible rapper) and the bridge which is all percussion.<br /><br />Americano (2.5/5) - Okay, Full disclosure.  I kind of love this song - the driving beat, the handclaps, the trumpets, the terrible Spanish, all of it. BUT - for some reason Gaga insists on singing in foreign languages with terrible accents, and she butchers a lot of Spanish for a large portion of this song. Wasn't there ANYONE to tell her that it sounds pretty awful?<br /><br />Hair (2/5) - The Sax makes it's first grand appearance.  Clarence Clemons is undoubtedly talented, but his inclusion makes the song almost seems like a parody.  All this reminds me of is theme songs from 90s TV shows like Full House.  This song works better as a self-empowerment anthem - I think it's because the focus is decidedly more personal than talking about being \\"Orient-made\\".<br /><br />Sheibe (3.5/5) - I want to love this song - and it starts out awesomely (bad \\"German\\" aside).  But...Gaga seems slavishly devoted to this terribly dated techno/quasi-industrial sound.  Minor key verses, Major key chorus.  It could be so sinister and dark but the chorus wrecks it.  I will still probably jam out to this.<br /><br />Bloody Mary (5/5) - Gaga really shines on this one. There aren't a lot of vocal acrobatics but the restraint really fits with the music here.  It is dark and melancholy and I like this direction a lot more than the 80's power pop.  This is just a tightly crafted song and I can't stop listening to it.  Best song of the album for me.<br /><br />Black Jesus + Amen Fashion (3/5) - I like this song, but it's nothing spectacular. The beat is nice and I can dance to it.<br /><br />Bad Kids (1.5/5) - this is another almost for me.  The drum machine is rocking to be sure, but I HATE HATE HATE the chord progression in the chorus. It grates on me something awful and renders this song totally unlistenable, which is a shame because I like the rest of the song.<br /><br />Fashion of His Love (0/5) - You can tell from the opening strains of this song exactly how it is going to go.  This song is terrible from top to bottom and is probably the worst thing Lady Gaga has ever written.<br /><br />Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)  (0/5) - Gaga has to be trolling us with these song titles. Jesus, the intro sounds like Van Halen and it hurts me.  I have no idea what's happening right now - I guess this is what pop would sound like if unicorns wrote it?  I just can't.<br /><br />Heavy Metal Lover (4/5) - This song is pure sleazeand I love it. The only detractor is that the lyrics are kind of cringe-worthy.<br /><br />Electric Chapel (4/5) - Another standout track.  It's giving me Galaxy Ranger Fever (cowboys in space!) and that probably why I love it so much. Yes it borrows wholesale from groups like Enigma - the church bells, the chanting, the synths - yet somehow it works and I like it .<br /><br />The Queen (2.5/5) - I'm feeling pretty ambivalent about this one. I don't hate it, I don't love it. Though I enjoy the guitar duet/solo.<br /><br />You And I - This sounds just like Queen and it makes me rage so hard. I understand that they were a huge influence on Lady Gaga, but this song irritates me to death and back. I'd bet both my big toes that this will be a single and a big one at that. While it's a well written tune, this offends me on a personal level that I can't fully articulate.  I just cannot get behind this.<br /><br />The Edge of Glory (4/5) - This is song is going to be huge.  And truthfully it is a solidly crafted song.  Do I like it?  I will probably be Stockholm Syndromed into enjoying it because I'm going to hear this every time I turn on the radio or go out in public.  Does this make me happy?  NO!<br /><br />Obviously the overarching theme for Born This Way is being true to yourself no matter what.  But to veil that in all of these \\"shocking\\" religious overtones is just the most. This whole Jesus, Mary, and Joseph are Government Hookahs thing is just tiresome. It's trite and it's been done and Madonna is still alive.  I'm just saying.<br /><br />The vast majority of these songs sound so incredibly dated and I really don't know what else to say except that they are giving me late 80's/early 90's fever.  To be fair, I was a kid then, but I remember the music and to say that Gaga borrows heavily from that era is an understatement.  She aped everything but the hammer pants and the puff paint.<br /><br />Born This Way just falls so far short of the mark.  I suppose that's the way it goes when you really stretch yourself creatively.  A few times (Bloody Mary, Edge of Glory) this sound she is working with really, truly works. The rest is a spectacular mess.  All of the songs are tightly crafted - that much cannot be denied - but they mostly just sound out of touch instead of sounding she is bringing the past into the far reaches of the future (which is what I think Gaga was going for).  This album will probably sound like a revelation to anyone under the age of 18 - those tender-footed young folks with no frame of reference for the music Lady Gaga is borrowing from - or anyone not interested in anything but the current pop landscape.<br /><br />2.5/5 Starsapel (4/5) - Another standout track.

0143038419|1.0|I picked up this book out of curiosity as my wife was reading it at the time - it was well written and engaging in the technical sense, but I kept reading it for the big reveal, waiting for the author to pull back the curtain and let us in on the joke: \\"Ta da! I'm not really that narcissistic or self-indulgent!\\". It was not to be.    Did you ever have that friend that went backpacking through Europe/Asia/South-America and came back as *that* person? You know, the one that wants to share with everyone their new found worldliness and appreciation for foreign cultures? As they hold you hostage in the corner, trying to convey the importance of every minutiae of their adventure to your increasingly wandering mind, you begin to realise that they are simply a self-centred bore who wants to dress up their fancy vacation in the guise of a shallow, faux-spiritual journey of the soul.    No? Well, you're in luck. Elizabeth Gilbert can be that friend in 352 glorious pages!
0316069485|4.0|I felt this drama fooled me with it's outcome. I expected something different at the end that never came and normally that would mean a book with a cool twist, but somehow the ending fell flat for this reader. The dynamic of Haller and Bosch didn't seem to mesh as well. I wished their daughters could've connected and bought something interesting into the fray.<br /><br />There are some sparks of reading excitement, but not enough overall \\"thought\\" to make it one of Connelly's best dramas. I enjoyed the recent \\"Nine Dragons\\" and \\"The Brass Verdict\\" a lot more. Having said that I'm giving this 4 stars because I'm a hopeless fan of the authors catalog of work and anything less than a four would be impossible to do.
B000X9PNOG|5.0|This is a great concert on DVD.  Aspen Miller singing the female lead in Paradise by the Dashboard Lights is simply astounding.  I'd never heard of her before this but she's so good I took the effort to look up her career.  The rest of the band is great and they really look like they're having a blast.      It's a good DVD.  If you're a Meatloaf fan you won't be disappointed.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|First of all BE PATIENT! at first you'll only get like 6 songs, but in the next hour or so  you'll have the whole album. This is truly an amazing deal! I can't believe that amazon is offering Born This Way for 1 dollar!...About the album: Well, the album is amazing. Just listen to songs like You & I, Bloody Mary, Sheisse, or Marry the Night. She's pushing boundries and setting new standars. GREAT ALBUM GAGA!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I am in love with this album, and Lady Gaga. I have loved all her albums. As for those who say its too \\"different,\\" why would you want just more of the same? You could hear her evolving just from The Fame to The Fame Monster. She is refining her music and her art without losing what shot her to fame to begin with. The songs on this album are just great. At first, I wasn't sure what I thought of Judas. The more I listened to it the more I loved it. The Edge of Glory is awesome. I have yet to listen to the album version of You and I, but I saw her perform it live and it was the most incredible song. Just Gaga and her piano (it was on fire of course). This woman is incredibly talented.     As for the 99 cent download, it is working just slowly. Just be patient! Totally worth it!
B001H9MYPW|5.0|Excellent, excellent show. I had rented it from Netflix. Loved it so I decided to buy it. Can't wait for Season 3 to come out.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|I just can't stop listening to this CD.  So many of the songs stick in my head.  If you are looking for Mozart or something don't buy this CD.  If you are looking for a hot dance mess of a good time,  This CD is for you.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|I can't believe there are so many negative reviews. Take your misplaced anger and contact amazon rather than leaving a bad review for Lady Gaga. Thanks to this fiasco, I doubt she or her producers will be green-lighting anything like this in the future.<br /><br />Personally, I've been trying to download this album for the past 5 hours, but I'm not petty enough to give this enjoyable album a bad review because of it. I like what I've heard so far. I don't consider myself to be a little monster, so I like the promo because I'm going to be listening to Lady Gaga, something I never might have considered otherwise.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This is the first HP movie where I've felt like Hollywood tried to honor the book.   Way to scary for really little kids.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS EXHAUSTING AND SATISFYING LIKE THE BEST SEX YOU EVER HAD!  This is Gaga's master piece (so far)  Every song is beautifully crafted, it's an experiment on electronica  At times the beauty of it all is so surreal it cannot possibly be reality! I thought it had to be a dream  Some of the songs take longer to digest than others, but every song here is a winner, so much art I thought I would die of Stendhal Syndrome! Gaga has done it again!! She slays and scalps the lesser bitches!   Favorite Songs, in no particular order:  - Marry The Night  - Born this way  - Goverment Hooker  - Judas  - Americano  - Hair  - Schiebe  - Bloody Mary  - Highway Unicorn  - Heavy Metal Lover  - You and I  - Edge of Glory  Those are the more \\"immediate\\" songs I think, but the other ones:  - Black Jesus, Amen Fashion  - Bad Kids  - Electric Chapel  - The Queen  Are just as beautiful but took me a little longer to digest them, they are somewhat more alternative perhaps  The album is gorgeous and so full of energy it's exhausting!  EXHAUSTING AND SATISFYING LIKE THE BEST SEX YOU EVER HAD!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|can only listen to one song and the digital booklet.  This is contrary to EVERY OTHER album I have found where you get full rights.      This is just a promo for their cloud player which does no good if you have apple products to listen to them on.    Really bummed and I am one of their most loyal customers.
0756405890|5.0|The more I read fantasy literature, the more it seems as if authors want to invent myths not tell stories.  Patrick Rothfuss loves stories.  Stories educate, entertain and warn the characters.  They are understood, missed and completely misunderstood.  And throughout these stories there is a sense of the Behind the Story.  Patrick weaves these stories like threads to form a carpet with a foot-print already impressed: this isn't a myth, though it spawns several, it is a story about an all too human character: great hero and arrogant bastard.    Kvothe as a character has several threads you can see and more hinted at.  For example, there is a woman he is obviously in love with but is absent in his apparent retirement.  His earliest days follow him constantly but never overshadow him, followed as threads pulling him in several directions but always to the future, never stuck in the past.  His flashbacks show him as childish in his youth, contrasting greatly with his present state.  The missing threads tell you as much as the ones included.    Reading the story that spawned a myth, hairy warts and all, shows a much greater sense of stories themselves and gives a much greater sense of depth to the overall story.  Like a deep pool, you want to see how deep it really is and you will enjoy the dive.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This comment is for Amazon and not Lady Gaga's album primarily. These kinds of deals are exactly why I quit buying from iTunes 2 plus years ago. Amazon has the same selection but better prices. I've downloaded numerous albums from Amazon and only once had a problem and had no problem downloading this album today. The one time I had a problem with my download I did the option where you put in a phone number for a customer service rep to call you and instantly someone was calling me and in 2 minutes I had my problem resolved. As long as Amazon keeps the competitive pricing, kick a** deals, and awesome customer service I'll always be a loyal customer. In my opinion every other company could learn a thing or two about how to run their business by looking at Amazon. I felt I should help offset some of the negative criticism everyone is complaining about on here.    As far as the album itself I would rate it somewhere around 3.5 stars so far. After a few more listens that could change.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This really is the best calendar app out there.  It is simple and straight forward to use and the calendar viewing options are the best.  There is no lag shuffling through the months like some of the other calendars I have tried!  A must own calendar...
B0032JTV6U|4.0|I loved that I got GLEE for so cheap, but when it arrived it was MISSING THE SPECIAL FEATURES DVD. And I know for certain it isn't on a part of the episode DVDs- because there was a missing place in the case. So I didn't get what I fully paid for, but then again I don't entirely care for the special features. I can get them from my friend... but still.... for those that want this the dvds are fine minus the MISSING dvd. the quality is good and like new and everything. :P

1596680296|5.0|I am a new knitter (3 months) and, within 12 hours of receiving this book, I knit my my first sock. It's badly done, has errors, but that is a reflection of my inexperience as a knitter and not at all the fault of the book. This book calmly walks you through, step by step, and manages to demystify horrors such as sizing and heel flaps.<br /><br />So, my fellow newbie knitters, follow your socky dreams, dare to knit socks, and armed with this book (and even with no sock class, as in my case,) you shall produce sockage!
B004PGO25O|5.0|This short, provocative book was my first introduction to Pressfield's rather novel theory of the creative process. After reading it, curiosity compelled me to get a quick sense of what other people were thinking -- and I was struck by how many readers here have taken issue with the book's brisk, seemingly superficial style, and how many have doubted whether it was even worth their time. While I recognize the style takes brevity to an extreme, I think most readers will still find it informative and worthwhile, because it contains at least a few notable ideas.    One is the notion of resistance. Pressfield's genius here is to invite us to identify a series of seemingly disconnected forces -- internal and external -- that ultimately hinder our creative processes, as one and the same. The urge to procrastinate or make excuses to put off writing until tomorrow, the inner critic constantly second guessing us to the point of paralysis, or the spouse who radiates real or imagined guilt about our self-indulgent artist-fantasies, are, in Pressfield's view, really the same thing: what he calls `Resistance'. To conquer this relentless cancer of the creative spirit, we need to adopt a warrior ethic, and be cunning, dogged, and hyper-aware of the machinations of this singular entity that we now discern, thanks to Pressfield's indispensable concept.    But contrary to many of the criticisms voiced here and elsewhere, the picture of the artist painted here is not essentially dark or violent (although it is certainly less placid than some!). As an antidote to the notion of Resistance, Pressfield speaks of the ultimately superior power of `Assistance', which refers to the guiding role played by our deeper creative vision that fills us with the inspiration to continue and somehow always reappears after the episodic crises of self-doubt.    If all of this sounds too metaphysical, there are many smaller gems to take away. He implores us to `begin before you're ready', to place yourselfon a `research diet' (since research can quickly become resistance), and to avoid mixing writing and reflexion, at least at the beginning. Momentum is everything. Quit delaying and begin the work that has been percolating in your head for so long by simply stating its theme in one sentence; sketching its beginning, middle and end in a sentence each, and then filling in the gaps, step by step. Above all, keep working. Reflect latter, once the momentum begins to build.     In short, this book has something worthwhile to impart to anyone serious about the creative process. After all, there are many other books about writing that cost more, take longer to read, and have much less to say.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|In keeping with all the other Harry Potter movies, the same quality and drama was in the movie.  The clarity of the DVD was fantastic.  this was my first HP movie that I bought in blu ray and I was not disappointed.   Look forward to the next one.
0307477479|5.0|I LOVED this book. Egan has constructed a courageous and brilliant piece of work that spans 30 years and weaves together the lives of characters that are perfectly crafted and pieced together in a manner that kept me going back to the beginning and to earlier chapters. It was like putting together a masterful puzzle. The PowerPoint section was probably the most powerful for me - confirming that less is more and that deep emotion and compelling narrative can be conveyed so very simply. Bravo to Egan and thanks for a fascinating read.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Great little interface. I can now use the terminal on my Cisco ASA, and I can do it without having to install a pci express serial card in my new computer. I am running Windows 7 and this product installed seamlessly with the supplied drivers.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|This is not a review for this item but for Amazon's Cloud service. After purchase, I only had available 3 songs. Apparently, many people are experiencing the same problem. I hope Amazon solves the problem soon.
B004XUDJII|5.0|I love this CD, especially the song \\"Arms\\", am totally addicted to it. Every song she does is not going to sound like Jar of hears, its the songs / beats you get to like and I like many of these songs.
B004DMIIO6|2.0|Goemon is just plain bad.  If you like fakey wire work and CGI that looks worse than an Xbox game, then you might like this.  Otherwise, stay away.  There are WAY too many good Japanese movies out there for you to be wasting your time on this.  Even the cheaply-made Machine Girl is entertaining.  This movie is not.  It's painful to watch.  Try Ichi instead.
B000RZGFZC|5.0|SLAYER!!!!!  That being said, in my opinion, this album is only eclipsed by \\"Reign in Blood\\" in its quality. \\"Reign in Blood\\" is the more complete album, but \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" does have bright diamonds (such as the epic title track) that make the lower points diminish. I have bought this about 3 times now over the years. Good Times. Great driving angry music.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I use it to download all of my favorite music without paying for it.  total lifesaver.  kind of slow however.
159668139X|5.0|Book was very informative - good information whether you are a beginner or more advanced weaver. Will definitely be a good reference book for my weaving library.
0307887960|5.0|This book explains the weight loss hurdles as it applies to individuals- not just assuming that all people lose weight just because they follow a plan.  It helped me know what to expect for my age and weight loss goals.    This may not be for everyone but it sure worked for me! The attack phase was not difficult at all-the only thing I missed was my wine in the evening-but it was worth it. The elimination of bad carbs has resolved 95% of my usual stomach issues. I planned to stay on the attack phase for 2 days but did 4 because it was easy.  I was a bit more tired than normal by the 2nd day but that resolved quickly. After I started the cruise phase I was able to see what I could add and still lose the weight.  I lose weight VERY slowly but lost 5 lbs in 8 days.  According to the book- it was mostly \\"stagnant\\" water in my system (YUCK).  I sure feel better. I highly recommend at least reading the book to see if its a good fit for you.
B00454U1NS|3.0|Of course I knew that I bought the unedited greatest hits, and I don't mind cursing in context, but I'd recommend the edited, since some of the cursing takes away in a large way from songs like \\"Perfect\\", which really is a quite different song when the F bomb is in the otherwise beautiful chorus. Furthermore, as other reviewers have stated, I scratch my head as to why the anti-Bush song \\"Mr. President\\" is included and not a single like \\"Feel Good Time\\" from the \\"Charlies' Angels\\" soundtrack. I don't get that one at all. Otherwise, its a straight forward greatest hits, and does well in that regard.
B000002O51|3.0|I can't stand it when artists start taking themselves way too seriously and their art suffers as a result.  Somewhere between \\"Don't Look Back\\" and this, Tom Scholz decided his band was Pink Floyd or Rush.  Not in terms of composition (get to that in a moment), but in terms of thinking that his fans wanted to hear some structured concept album with a common theme that strings all of the songs together into one heady piece meant to be taken as a whole.  The problem is, when those songs have titles like \\"I Think I Like It\\", \\"Cool The Engines\\", \\"We're Ready\\", \\"To Be A Man\\" (wow, that's original, Tom...you had a song on your last album called \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\", but here it's like you've taken that concept and totally turned it on its EAR), \\"Can'tcha Say/Still In Love\\" (is there any reason whatsoever why the boring bridge in this song is considered a separate song unto itself??), and any of several various tunes named after chicks, you can tell that the concept is nothing but a weird, out-of-place distraction, and that if that crap had been stripped away and replaced with a couple more decent tunes, this would've been the ultimate Boston album.  Because, quite frankly, \\"I Think I Like It\\" and \\"Cool The Engines\\" totally rock, while \\"Amanda\\", \\"We're Ready\\", \\"Can'tcha Say/Still In Love\\", and \\"To Be A Man\\" are classic ballads or midtempo rockers that will satisfy any fan.  \\"Hollyann\\" is good even if its hook is just a lame re-write of \\"Can'tcha Say\\", and \\"My Destination\\" literally IS a lame re-write of \\"Amanda\\" strutured as yet another of this album's several artsy-fartsy connecting pieces meant to take you through this \\"journey into life's third stage\\".  Lame.  Just lame.  Just give us the straight tunes without the haughty concept and ROCK for us, Tom...that's all we ask.
B00005NTJK|4.0|Had this on Vinyl - dont know where it went. Remembered I really liked it and thought Tull were very clever and musical back in the day. Great to revisit on CD and dont know what the fuss is from some reviewers about the re-mastering. I have a decent stereo and it sounds plenty good to me.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|From the singles released so far, I like what I've heard from this album. I figured at $.99 for the album, I'd go ahead and get it.<br /><br />So far, I only have access to two songs and the digital booklet and I had them transferred to my 'amazon cloud player'. I'm going to guess that Amazon is being bombarded by people buying this digital album, and the transfers are queued but not completed yet. I was getting ready to send Amazon a message regarding only being able to get a few items, when I looked in my account under digital items, and noticed that my order is still being processed.<br /><br />I haven't received an email receipt, yet, either. I'm going to hold off sending them a ticket for the next hour or two. If the full album doesn't show up by then, then I'll go ahead and send a ticket.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|so when i started reading this i didn't love it... then it turned so good i finished it in a day!! just amazing!! great job to the author looking forward to the whole series and more books!!
B0019NG73G|5.0|UPDATE:    I had a reader contact me telling me that the Blu-Ray disc of Gettysburg does indeed have the full 271 minutes.  I did get the disc and he is correct.  It is amazon.com's write-up that is not correct.    However, I am still correct with the Pearl Harbor information in the review.    ORIGINAL REVIEW:    Why, oh why, can't the studios release the entire (extra footage) feature length discs on Blu-ray?  I have the Limited Collector's Edition laser disc of Gettysburg running 271 minutes.  This Blu-ray edition is 261 minutes.  The director's cut of Pearl Harbor on Blu-ray is also the PG-13 issue, not the R-rated 184 minute issue available on DVD.  When films as these are finally released on Blu-ray disc - we should be able to purchase the extended cuts of the films which this format particularly favors.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This review has NOTHING to do with the actual album, its quality or the talent of fabulous Lady Gaga.<br /><br />Buyer beware! Even after reading all the negative reviews due to a flaw in the download process, I went ahead and plunked my account info to Amazon.com to purchase this album.<br /><br />You know what they say out there: you get what you paid for, and this time that saying came painfully true. The download process stalls from the very first track, which in this case is the digital booklet, and it does not budge. I have tried at least 10 times to download even ONE SONG and nothing happens, I keep getting the same error message: Download Failed, please try again later or contact customer service. I did just that, and nada, nothing, zilch.<br /><br />I guess I will count my losses, go to iTunes to download the album and pay more for it, and vow never to purchase anything else from Amazon.com. There, I said it.
0789310627|5.0|sasek's books are all visually lovely, no doubt about it, however they are also incredibly informative, which i quite appreciate. this book is littered with amazing images, interesting facts, and this particular entry makes me yearn to discover the london of yesterday/today in person.<br /><br />and as with all the updated printings of sasek's books, there is a welcome list of \\"this is the city...today!\\" at the end of the book with changes listed since the original printing. it is great to see both the way the city WAS as well as the present day differences.<br /><br />i highly recommend this book if you are interested in either london, or simply in wonderful illustration.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great movie. If you ever wondered how someone with Autism thinks, or why they act a certain way, watch this movie. It is awesome. It's also a great triumph story about Dr. Grandin. She and her mother are amazing people. LOVED IT.
0307454541|5.0|The story is a mystery novel. The main character, Mikael Blomkvist, is a journalist who was hired by a rich old man to take another look at the disturbing disappearance of a family member. A second main character, Lisbeth Salander, is a computer hacker with lots of *personal* issues due to its own sad life story. Being misunderstood from young age, and exploited in later parts of her life, she has very little trust in about basically everything that society has to offer: the authorities, work colleagues, and consequently has almost no friends to relay on. However, being highly intelligent, she manages to get through life in very original ways.<br /><br />As expected in the genre, the books starts by jumping from Mikael story line, to Lisbeth's plot, and eventually both stories intersect and a joint story-line emerges. Two things that I've noted while reading: First, in contrast to many similar novels that usually takes several background chapters before they become interesting, this books is very engaging from the first pages. This is probably due to Lisbeth, who is a very original and interesting character. Second, the flow and pace of the book is great: it starts interesting, and half way through you simply cannot put it down as you want to see what happens next. Lisbeth's character is very interesting, and it is especially intriguing to learn her way of thinking about different issues, and her biased, yet logical view of reality.<br /><br />Great fun, read and enjoy. By the way, I know there is a (Hollywood) movie around the corner for the book. However, I think that in this case I recommend reading the book before watching the movie, as I'm not sure that a movie script can make a good case of presenting Lisbeth's unique thought process.

0312360258|4.0|***NOTE MY REVIEWS OFTEN CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is without a doubt a troubled teen trying to hold things together when we're first introduced to her.  Abandoned as a child by her father, her mother has remarried to an emotionally abusive religion freak who treats her mother like a scared and willful child and becomes jealous even if her mother shows attention or affection to her own children.  Stuck in those teen years her siblings who are only barely mentioned other than in passing and don't actually appear in the novel haven't learned how to be anything but rivals with her and the only places she feels at home are at school and at her grandmother's home that her stepfather doesn't approve of her visiting.  When she is Marked as a vampire and made an outcast in her own school even that ceases to feel at home and she forced to move into the House of Night, a Vampire boarding school that holds the only answers that might prevent her from dying of the sickness overcoming her as a sign of being marked.  She's has two choices, become what she thinks of as a monster, the vampyre she's destined to be, or to lay down and die.  Fortunately for readers, Zoey isn't ready to lay down and die.<br /><br />In the path to accepting her fate she is visited by Nyx the Vampire Goddess among other things and marked as the eyes and ears of the goddess herself.  While being different in hours and coursework, the school is very reminiscent of your average high school right down to the awful mean girl that everyone pretends to adore while secretly hating.  Because of her calling, that she shares with no one Zoey starts right out standing out because her mark, which should only be an outline as a fledgling is already filled in.  From there you follow her on a journey to realizing that being different isn't always wrong and finding her path to growing up, by accepting her gifts and using them to do what's right.  While there is a small love story within the story, it's not prevalent enough to be mentioned and at this point in the series seems more like a crush than actual love.<br /><br />I'll begin with mentioning the major problem with this book, basically it's that it was a mother daughter team and what teenager daughter is going to tell her mother that she swears, or ever really does anything wrong and what mother is going to create a character with any moral imperfections if she's writing a story with her daughter?  The character flaws are understandable because of the dynamic between the writers of this book, however that doesn't make them any less annoying to the reader.  Because of the lack of real honesty between the pair, which is totally common of course, and not an insult, it's the way of the world, Zoey Redbird, the main character of this novel is like a walking Just Say NO campaign.  I mean no I don't want to read about a sex crazed, drug addicted, alcoholic teenager who swears like a sailor drunk at a bar.  However for her generation she's way beyond prim and proper and delving into prude.  While I'll admit there are a few teens like that in the world, those are not the same teens that are dating the quarterback of the football team or rather in her case fending him off.  She doesn't curse, she thinks oral sex is being used and demoralized, she won't go out with the quarterback because he drinks and she lectures her friends on the dangers of drinking and smoking.  She says words like poopy.  What teenager says poopy? Teenage girls realistically think about sex, consider things like oral and regular sex even if they aren't ready to cross that line and actually do anything beyond a chaste kiss.  It's part of puberty and it's unrealistic that the thought never even crosses this characters mind and while I don't expect her to curse like a sailor, typical teenagers do curse at least occasionally.  And while I'll buy that she's strong enough to resist the peer pressure to drink or do drugs, many teens can, I will not buythat she gives an adult-like lecture to her friends on the dangers of the habits and what influences those habits could have on their future.  And if by chance she did do these things she wouldn't be the type of person that got invited to the in crowd parties or attracted the attention of anyone on the football team.  I don't care how beautiful she is, even in high school her personality would be off-putting enough that the in-crowd would avoid her.  They might talk about her behind her back and the things they'd like to do to her body, but they wouldn't even attempt to date her because being around her would be a complete drag.  If the character had been a little more realistic in her behavior concerning real life teenage dangers, this book would have easily been a 5 star novel for me.  But as I already mentioned the fact that she isn't doesn't really surprise me.<br /><br />I read this book in only a couple of hours, it was well paced and easy to read.  I didn't even notice the time passing until I'd reached the last page and got annoyed with myself for not having already purchased the entire series.  I only bought the first book because I didn't want to invest a bunch of money only to end up hating the series.  You sort of have to be cautious in your purchases as an adult reader of young adult novels, some series just aren't mature enough for an adult reader to still enjoy them.  That doesn't lessen them as a novel, it just means it's not the type of story that transcends age ranges.  This series however is both mature enough for an adult to enjoy and for the most part clean enough to feel safe handing over to a child.  The only really questionable scene involves Zoey accidentally walking in on a teenage couple performing oral sex in a hallway.  Having said that if your child is old enough to understand there isn't a stork, she's probably mature enough for this book.  It's a story about being different being better because you accept and embrace your difference and a story about understanding what a true friend really is and does.  Yes it has the excitement and dark suspense of a vampire novel mixed with teen angst, but even with that as of yet, the Cast duo hasn't really made blood, or drinking blood a constant in the book.<br /><br />My final comment is for those who question if the book is anti-religion or anti-Christianity.  I definitely have to firmly disagree with that, the religious faction within the novel The People of the Faith are never described as a typical church or religion, the behavior and zealousness is clearly characteristic of a religious cult.  There's a big difference between the Waco compound and the Catholic Church and the behavior displayed by members of this religion fall just short of Waco.  The behavior of the religious members mentioned in the story would never be accepted or approved of by any current organized religion unless it was a cult.  Even Christianity or Catholicism is about belief, and faith, it isn't about control, where as this religion as well as any actual cult is about the same thing - control.  Unless the writers themselves were to come out and say this was meant to bash on organized faith, I'd never view this story as bashing on Christianity or anti-organized religion.  If the People of the Faith were anything other than a cult the writers I would hope would have given them at least some compassion and reason even if they didn't agree with the religious beliefs of Christianity.  I can't see the Pope or the whatever other major religion figureheads are out there approving of a cult and all this story demonstrates is that the authors don't either.<br /><br />The book is definitely a must read if you like young adult paranormal stories.  I look forward to the next in the series, though I can't help but hope that Zoey stops carrying her Just Say No sign in the next story.like lecture to her friends on the dangers of the habits and what influences those habits could have on their future.

B00466HN72|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  I'm 34 and took my eight year old niece and my brother who is 35.  We all laughed the whole time.  The movie is cute!  I loved the ninja bunnies, the bunny who had a dream to be a muscian, not the Easter Bunny as he was suppossed to be.  And Carlos the chick really added some fun to it.  The eight year old still talks about the movie!  It was a cute story and the E.B. kept you laughing the whole time!
B0043X1FOK|5.0|I really liked watching this movie. It picks up where the first Short Circuit left off. Most sequels do not match the original, but this one does! Really worth the money and watching if you liked the first movie!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The more you mess with something... the uglier it gets.  Just like Michael Jackson's face.... this gets more and more ugly each time George tinkers with his movies.      All the \\"one\\" star ratings in the world won't change anything.  We will never get the originals.  I knew that when the DVD's first came out and bought them anyway.  As for BluRay... I will pass on this.  There was a time I wanted the bluray for my collection.  Suddenly I am not interested anymore.  Thanks for giving me great childhood memories and destroying them in my adult life.  I am dissapointed and finished.
B0051QK87S|2.0|I really want to listen to the album HOWEVER Amazon Clous is not allowing it to download. Hopefully they fix this soon. Don't download it via Amazon if you want to listen to it now because it doesn't work... go to itunes or use another method of purchasing it until they fix it... ugh......!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I've been a fan of Lady Gaga for some time now, mainly because of her originality in this day and age. Yes, some of her music is obviously influenced by people who have come before, but that's inevitable. These aren't covers, they are original works that, if anything, pay homage to an entire era of music.     In a period where original Pop music is hard to come by - Lady Gaga delivers. Even though this CD is noticeably different than anything she's previously put out, it shows she's actively experimenting with new material. I tend to be more disappointed when every CD that an artist comes out with sounds the same with different words, and that is not the case here.     For 99 cents, this is a steal. Heck, for 9.99 this would be worth it. It's upbeat, fun, uplifting music - that might get you off your chair while it's at it.     Enjoy!
0385341008|5.0|I loved this book and grieved when I finished it. It starts slow, but keep reading. Everyone that I know who has read it has had the same enthusiastic reaction. You too will miss it when you are done. It really is a book to savor.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I can't imagine... how could have I not watched this movie as a kid? I loved everything about ''the Fog'' but the end, when the movie stops and credits roll. It's a must have. It's very very good classic horror movie.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is a wonderful album. I think it's really solid. Every song sounds different, it's really dance-y. If you like Lady Gaga you'll still like this album. 5-stars for a great album.
143350393X|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is a classic reference tool for serious students of the Scriptures. The notes, maps, articles, and charts are always  reliable and faithful to the text and context. It is a BIG volume, but there is no other way to be this complete in hardcopy. The Tru-Tone cover has the feel of real soft leather and seems to be very durable.
B004XWLN20|2.0|As this is a review of the show, and not a DVD vs Blu-Ray rant, be warned that spoilers will be present.    The feel and format of Smallville transformed over the years.  The first seasons' plots focused on Clark learning how to deal with his developing powers, learning about his origins, and dealing with the \\"freak of the week\\" (title unofficially given the latest \\"meteor rock\\" infected local) and the other effects caused by the massive amounts of kryptonite in the area.    The show then switches focus to prophesy. There are Native American prophesies about the coming of Superman, occult proficies about him, secret societies looking for his arrival and the means to control him, etc.    The last few seasons did away with the \\"freak of week\\" and the prophesies in exchange for story arcs based on actual comic book villians such as Doomsday, Zod, and Darkseid.    The series also started out with a lighter feel in the beginning and slowly got darker and darker as the series progressed.    What worked:  - Clark learning to cope with and control each new power as it developed  - The relationship between Clark and Lex. It many ways, it was more interesting to see Lex's decent from friend and ally to villian.  - Introduction/guest shots of variouos other super heroes and villians.  - The moral grounding that Jonathon Kent gave to the program. (Both Clark's character and the show suffered from the loss of Jonathon Kent).  - The help Clark received from the small circle of friends who knew about his powers. (I am mostly referring to Pete and Chloe in the earlier seasons. Then it worked as friends who had his back. As that circle got larger and larger, it felt as if there were less and less meaning behind it.)    What did NOT work:  - Lana. She was fine in the beginning as the girl young Clark has a crush on, but it was drawn out far too long. Her character became a cruch for the writers who kept going back to the \\"will they/won't they\\" scenerio, even as late into the programas season 8, after Clark had already started a relationship with Lois. She should have been regulated to \\"just friends\\" status back around season 4. Season 5's \\"Reckoning\\" was a perfect time to cement the fact that Lana was not \\"the One\\". After Clark proposed, the writer's should have had her unable to be able to deal with the fact that he is an alien. Instead, they went with the tired \\"let's change things with time travel\\" nonsense.  - Clark does not fly. This was fine when he was still in highschool, but it became rediculous when Supergirl was added, and could fly. When Zod could fly within moments of getting his powers. And when other Kryptonians are flying within seconds of getting their powers. Ten years of Clark not being able to figure it out is far too long. (I know that the creaters had a \\"no tights/no flights\\" policy, but the the show outgrew at least the flights part of that policy by the 6th season.)  - Replacing Lex with Tess.  - Clark is too wishy washy throughout the series with the inability to make decisions.  - The show became far too dark, both in feel and film. Superman is supposed to be bright and uplifting stories about good triumphing over evil. By the end, \\"good\\" feels like its been wallowing about in the muck right beside evil as the character interaction between the good guys devolved into a \\"who is sleeping with who\\" senerio.  - The final payoff, the \\"birth\\" of Superman, felt weak as well. Almost nothing was seen of Superman and he did not dispell the darkness by the \\"light\\" of his example, but by simply pushing the planet away. There were other loose strings that it seemed that the writers noticed at the last minute and just rushed to tie up, like Lex needing to be Clark's greatest enemy.    In conclusion, this is a series that had a tremendous amount of potential, but much of that potential is squandered.
0393327655|5.0|i am a huge sam harris fan, in fact i love all of the 4 horsemen. when i read hitchens \\"god is not great\\" i loved it, although i felt like i was only reading everything i had already heard him say in his debates. i didnt feel that way with this book, yes there were some similarities, but it was fresh enough for me to enjoy through and through.<br /><br />i think this book is best suited for those who already agree with sams points, or those teetering on the edge of the debate.<br />i would recommend this book to most anyone, but i dont think a closed minded x tian is going to get much out of it
B001BMKOZW|3.0|There is a lot of critics saying this album sucks and I don't think its horrible, but its not SOAD.  Daron is the man though!  And he proves it on this album and if you dig Daron you will love this album.  Half the cd will probably bore System fans, but the songs that are good... are REALLY good and make ya miss the System days.  Decent cd though!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Luckily it only cost me $0.99 to realize Amazon MP3 offers subpar quality compared to the iTunes Store. Only 2 items from this album downloaded and the sound quality is terrible! Back to iTunes for me.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I had very high expectations, but Lady Gaga did not fail to deliver! 5 Stars and double rainbows all the way!
0385341075|5.0|Other reviewers have outlined the basis of the story so I will concentrate on my reaction.  Living nearby to Boganville I was quite aware of the conflict there. Australian newspapers however generally took the PNG view rather than the rebel view. I am now angry when I realise that the helicopters supplied free to the PNG Government by Australian taxpayers such as myself were used in such a horrible way. Some research on the internet has revealed the shocking statistic that up to 10% of the 130,000 or so people on the island died during the war.  Despite the horrific background the book comes through as as a pleasant and inspiring read where humanism rather than violence is the main theme. I have decided to give a copy to my daughter ( who I know doesn't like violence in books ) because of its inspiring message. I was almost moved to tears at the end and can really understand the reviewer that said it was the one book the she felt the need to start and reread as soon as she finished.  I hadn't heard of Lloyd Jones before stumbling across this book and it is another tragedy that inspiring writers like him from small countries such as New Zealand tend to be ignored in favour of the popular authors from the major countries .
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Alright so I heard Bleed it out on the radio and was enticed to want to get this album in some way shape or form.  After I got it I was so bummed out.  I am seeing a whole Limp Bizkit fiasco again.  They gave us hard rock to start out with and some rap... now its all poppy and makes me wanna vomit.  If you like their slow songs then this cd is for you, but if your a hard rocker then stay away... horrible
B0051QJ83S|1.0|Well, I can't rate the music because it won't download.  As far as the process goes, first off, it's annoying that it won't work unless Safari is your default browser (personally, I prefer to use Chrome).  I've bought it twice and tried the versions w/ and w/o the digital booklet.  Neither will even remotely begin to download and it's been 30 minutes. I've read all the FAQ and help topics Amazon has on its mp3 downloader but nothing has addressed this issue nor helped.  PLEASE FIX THIS AND MAKE THIS RIGHT AMAZON! :(
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I'm not exactly sure why so many users are complaining -- I guess we've gotten used to digital quickness.  I just purchased this album and uploaded to the cloud.  As soon as the cloud loaded there was only 1 song available for my listening pleasure, which is aligned with the folks complaining about the digital download.  After it loaded I just refreshed the page and it jumped to 6 songs available, upon another refresh 8.  Folks -- it's not going to *PRESTO* have 650 megs available for you at the drop of a hat.  It takes time to move files and with the number of users Amazon has, give it some time.     Working fine for me -- still only 8 songs available but I have no doubt that Amazon will get the rest up there as the day goes on.  I would bet they'll all be available by the time I listen to the 8 that I have now.    People get too worked up about having to wait a few minutes for something.  Just because it's digital, doesn't mean it's INSTANT.  Patience is a virtue.    Songs so far, I've only listened to 'Judas', as I LITERALLY just purchased it, but that song was pretty decent.  Americano just started playing.  Enjoy!  For .99 cents this is a great deal folks -- and have some faith -- Amazon will get it all fixed up.
B003I55BIA|4.0|Why I read the book:  I picked up the book at Target.  I saw the cover and was intrigued so I turned the book over and read the back cover.  It piqued my interest so I went home and started to read it.  I finished it in two days and wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />What I liked:  I liked the characters that Simone Elkeles brought to life.  Brittany was the \\"perfect\\" girl who didn't lead such a perfect life.  It was all an illusion.  Alejandro was a gang member that was judged by others on that basis alone.  However, there was depth to Alejandro.  He wanted all the things that many young people want.  A better life that included going to college but circumstances were not on his side.  I liked the pairing of Brittany and Alejandro.  The author wrote a great story that paired two people of different backgrounds but with so many similarities that they make sense together.  I was rooting for Brittany and Alejandro all the way through.  I liked the way the author alternated the chapters to show what Alejandro and Brittany were thinking.  One chapter would be Brittany the next would be Alejandro.  In this way we get the complete story and we become engrossed in each characters thoughts and emotions. I also liked that the book touched on diversity and acceptance.  It wasn't in your face but subtle.<br /><br />What I didn't like: there wasn't anything to this story that I didn't like. It was a book of bad boy meets good girl but that why I read it. I truly enjoyed this story so much that I ordered the next book Rules of Attraction on my kindle.  I have become a fan of this author and can't wait to read what else is out there.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lady GaGa is Awesome! I am positive that I will not be disappointed with this album either. Especially for ninety-nine cents. Cry Cry away you little one star reviewers!!! For ninety-nine cents what do you expect from the server! Especially when they do it with a star of this magnitude! I mean come on people!! If you have heard and liked the song Born This Way then that is enough to buy the whole cd. You would pay this much just for the one song so please stop your crying about the technical problems and just wait it out. Amazon has posted that if you buy it today you will get all the songs.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|The installation of this unit was very simple. Getting it to work with Google Earth took a little effort, though. After I found geepeeyes, it all clicked. I am receiving as many as 6 satellites in my house and many more outside. I was looking into buying other mapping software, but searched the free methods first and am very happy with the Google Earth/geepeeyes combination. One tip to make Google Earth/geepeeyes work is that you need to close the software that came with this unit and let geepeeyes do it's magic.
1400064287|5.0|Good scholarship, good insight, well paced. I would never stop reading if I ran into books this good on a steady basis. Well, I am getting better at choosing them I guess.  The PDF download proves how sticky the book is. Each illustration or story it refers to is so easy to recall an self council from.  A serious work of thinking went into this book, and I love it.
030746363X|5.0|I only tried the diet part, and i lost 28 inches from my waist, thighs, arms and hips in the first month. Very easy to follow, and i don't think i've ever eaten MORE during the day, therefore i was satisfied and not hungry for snacking.  The 'binge day' addresses the problem of metabolism, and really works, psychologically and, it seems, physically.  With the exception of binge day, when i felt like crap, i have had more energy and an improved mood, due i think to the lack of sugar and non-veg carbs in the diet.   I love it, lent it to all my friends and they, too, are losing weight.  Next, the kettlebell swing!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I don't understand why everyone is complaining. I bought it and the ENTIRE cd was downloaded in about 5 min. I only give this 1 star bc I don't like Lady Gaga. I bought it bc it was only 99¢ and I kinda like 2 songs making it worth the 99¢ purchase. So if you like Lady Gaga, or even just ONE song or so on this cd, I suggest you buy it today bc it is a bargin :) YAY Amazon!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|.99 cents and 20GB cloud storage?  What's not to like.  The music itself is very irritating. Kind of like a nails on a chalkboard type of feel to it.  Good music to have on when waterboarding someone.
B004K4AUZW|3.0|Well...after she bragged this album up as being the best of the decade I had high expectations especially due to the fact that I am still in love with the Fame Monster...How could you not be...Speechless, Teeth, Bad Romance, Telephone...etc...This CD is very good in spots but only in a few...Sorry Little Monsters...I do love Gaga and what she stands for but I have to be honest here...Born This Way is a great song...Hair has a great beat and melody but some of the worst lyrics I ever heard.  Judas is above average but I had to skip past Americano which is one of the worst songs I have heard in a long time...skip now to the end...You and I and The Edge Of Glory are the two best songs on the album and are among her best ever.  The other 9 tracks should have been left for a B-sides compilation...
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Actually zero Stars! After purchasing the album only one song and the digital booklet downloaded. I can't even access any other song on the cloud player. Amazon needs to fix this or reimburse everyone.
0470450266|5.0|O Livro é ótimo, e o DVD que acompanha também. Mesmo meu inglês não sendo tão bom, dá pra ler e entender tranquilamente o que o autor quer passar. O livro inteiro é a criação de um só personagem este da capa, estudo de anatomia e proporção de cada parte do corpo e no final a preparação para exportar p/ games e animação.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great great deal! so excited!  It does take a LONG while to get the songs to appear (playable) in the cloud account, but I cannot complain-- with all this traffic it's a miracle we get them at all!  Awesome deal, thanks Amazon & Lady Gaga :)
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Quite possibly the best work to date!  I cannot wait to see how Ga Ga evolves.    Thank you for great music, great shows and everything else you do for the world!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I understand that they're offering one of the biggest artists in the world right now for a dollar...but you mean to tell me that they didn't EXPECT one of their biggest days ever when they inked this deal? I've been trying to download this since 10am EST...I'm 4 songs in...deleted the downloader, loaded it again, and purchased it AGAIN... and still, nothing... sure I'll be patient...but they really should have beefed up their network for such a big day...
0316067598|5.0|In the beginning Marcus takes you back to when he was a teenager and how growing up on a horse ranch in Eastern Texas prepared him to be a Navy SEAL. After he explains this the book picks up into high intense gear and you won't want to put it down. Marcus attitude and his love for his country are awesome. We should all have this group's patriotism.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Hayo Miyazaki's movies in my opinion are all worth more stars than the five amazon allows. These movies are amazing and if I had to pick favorites out of the directors curent opus I would say Princess Mononoke and Spirited away are my favorite. The story, art and music are all unbelievable. Amazing.    I love this movie.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Beware!! Only 1 song and pdf album cover downloads. Not the entire album as advertised.    I have purchased from Amazon before and also have their cloud player. Amazon Coud is a useless rip off. Will have to dispute credit card charge.  Negative rating is for Amazon Cloud and NOT for the artist.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Anything lady gaga music wise I get, I will say this  is not like her last album, I loved the fame monster so much more, don't get me wrong I love songs on here too but it's a completely different feel and way of like and appreciation then I have for fame monster.
1594484805|3.0|I read the whole book. I generally thought the message was spot-on, but got progressively more annoyed at the repetition of the message. Could have been edited down to a good sized magazine article (or much shorter book) and said just as much. And a 1-3 page summary of the key concepts would have been very useful.     Good concepts overall, but really nothing new -- most businesses, parents, etc. still use \\"carrot and stick\\" motivation. But that's not appropriate in many (most?) circumstances today where encouraging autonomy, contribution to a larger cause, and development of skills requires a different approach.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It's an amazing CD and I just wish people could see past her clothes and not judge her (very 1990s of those people).
1591841666|2.0|I've read Seth Godin's Purple Cow and Lihchpin which I thought were pretty good. This book? Not so much.     The concept of \\"The Dip\\" isn't new. It's amazing how often authors seem to point out past successes or failures in business, and claim their \\"theory\\" would have predicted the outcome. Sorry, but it's just ain't so.    Knowing when to quit (and when to stick) in Godin's own words isn't easy. And suggesting you should ONLY stick when you think you can be the BEST IN THE WORLD at something is ludicrous. Sure it's great to be #1, but if everybody else quit if they were #2 or lower, where would that leave millions of successful people?
B0000041LL|5.0|Simply the best interpretation of these very difficult pieces!! Beethoven have here the perfect musicians to reveal the powerfull and passionate music of the composer. The quality of the sound is totaly impressive....recorded in the 70's!! It's amazing. Don't look elsewhere...this is the box of quartets you must have.
0345529057|1.0|I came on with the intent of downloading this for reading in my reading device- sadly they've out priced themselves out of it would appear a significant amount of sales. I adore amazon, but sometimes the prices reach epic madness and greed- ah well, I'm off to seek out better deals on this- or wait for the demand to recede and the prices will bottom out again.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I can't comment on the album as of yet, I'll be listening to it shortly, but I am going to comment on using Amazon for a digital purchase.  It stinks.  I'm only a nominal Lady Gaga fan, but seeing her new album for $.99 seemed like a win-win, so I figured I'd buy it.  The process of actually getting the album onto my computer was really simple (if it's Opposite Monday).  I'm pretty tech savvy and have had a PC since the mid 90's, have upgraded systems with hardware, software, networks, blah, blah, blah, yet Amazon's way of doing things was still one of the more technologically frustrating episodes I've ever had.  They don't make it clear that you should download the mp3 downloader BEFORE you make your first purchase, so I don't know if that was part of the problem or not, but along the way I did see mention of it, so I'm guessing that maybe that played into the level of absurdity at least a little bit.  Once downloaded, it wouldn't launch.  After you download it, it says something like, \\"Now, so you can see how easy this works, here's a free song for you to download.   You'll be able to see this wonderful app launch and the warm and good feelings you will have cannot be overstated.\\"  Okay, I paraphrased maybe a little bit, but anyway, you click on the button to download the free song (and supposedly launch the downloader app), and instead of feeling the joy and glory of Amazon's technology, you sit there like a moron as nothing happens.  Nothing.  Ever.  No matter how many times you re-try the process.  Nothing.  To be honest, I don't remember all of the lousy stuff that happened during this process as I've since tried to block it out, but I know that eventually I had to go through the whole installation process each time I downloaded something from my Amazon Cloud Player.  Before I figured that out though, I do remember that I would click to download a song from the Cloud thing, and the active x installer warning bar would show up at the top of my browser, I'd click \\"download the file\\" and then the page would just reload with no downloading the file.  It lied.  I've left out some details and steps from the 45 minutes it took me to get from purchase point to actually having the songs on my computer, but I can tell you this:  I won't make any more digital purchases from Amazon.  For a computer novice I can see the process of buying and downloading an album from Amazon being more agonizingly frustrating and confusing than figuring out The Da Vinci Code.  I hope the album was worth it, because even at only $.99, for as much time and cursing it took to get the album onto my iPod, $.99 might be $10 too much.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I did not experience any errors and was able to get all the songs.  For those of you who are missing some, you really aren't \\"missing\\" anything.  I'm just mad they are taking up space on my computer at this point.  This album sucks.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|after the fiasco of amazon's downloading disaster, i finally got to listen to the entire album.  can't complain about the long wait (over 10 hrs!) since it WAS only 99 cents.  i'm not a big gaga fan, but my 9 yr old daughter is.  i downloaded the album for her, and i have to admit i like several of the songs.  as much as i want to hate lady gaga because of all the hype, she delivers.  it's a very catchy and enjoyable album.  my favorite being \\"the edge of glory\\".
0810983915|5.0|my 11yr old loves these books, I have gotten here everyone of them and took her to see the movie, which to my surprise I enjoyed alot and i read alil of the books they are very amusing.  Very good product for you child to have.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Wishing I'd just bought the mp3s and downloaded them directly instead of using cloud player.  Only two show available, the others are all \\"being processed\\" and it's been half an hour already.  No good.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|What amazes me is that PIXAR continues to keep the story, characters, and action fresh in a third installment of the story line.    How many sequels come close to the original? How many \\"part 3's\\" come close? Very few.    But this is great and my kids and I enjoyed it every bit as much as the first two. if you have children then this is a MUST buy. (assuming you've seen the first two).
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great offer to give to fans. I was someone that probably wouldn't have paid full price for the album, instead opting to buy just a few songs that I heard on the radio. But this offer allowed me to purchase the whole album (which I think is quite good) and listen to all the songs I might have missed out on.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lady Gaga you are truly amazing with your digital partnerships! I cannot believe how much I have been hearing about this highly anticipated album with partnerships with Google Chrome, Zynga, and now Amazon.  This is a great promotion as to create urgency with people buying the album instead of downloading it for free somewhere.  I was going to purchase her album at Target like I usually do with new albums because they usually have a deal for $9.99 or something along those lines but I mean you cannot beat less than a buck.     Granted it took a couple hours to download but its because I was on a wireless network.  It went faster with some people with a better connection.     Also the great thing is that you do get a digital cover- a PDF with 14 pages about the songs, etc.  This is better than the actual  CD because when I buy the CD all I do is go on my computer, rip it onto iTunes and transfer it on my iPod so this just takes one less step and for 90% cheaper! Thanks Gaga and Amazon!
B0051QJ83S|5.0|My down load worked perfect with no issues.  This is the whole album for the amazing price and 15G worth of space.  Pretty kicking album to boot.  Granted it's all you are going to hear this summer, but hey be first and get the best price nothing wrong with that.  Come on she has 10 million twitter followers and a great stage show.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Thanks for stealing my $1 amazon. I downloaded this and didn't get any songs. I wish I would have read the reviews first because it seems everyone is having the same problem.
B0039208CG|2.0|Look, a Batman movie is only as good as its Batman, and considering there have been a number of them throughout the entire series, I've gotta say that Val Kilmer is not only a terrible Bruce Wayne, but also a horrific Batman. Perhaps the worst, probably moreso than George Clooney. This movie was successful due to lots of advertising, flashy effects and the fact that it was a Batman movie. It's not so much that Val Kilmer can't make a good hero, but his acting performance in this is simply pathetic, he's like a piece of wood it's ridiculous and painful to watch a fantastic actress like Nicole Kidman putting her heart into her role meanwhile Kilmer is just responding like a stiff.   Jim Carrey and Kidman make this one work. I have no idea what they were thinking casting Val Kilmer, it's no surprise to me that shortly after this film his career pretty much went downhill, they should've fired him early on and gotten someone else. No Batman will ever match Michael Keaton.
0811879542|5.0|Those that claim the impending demise of the book, picture or otherwise, need to sit in the audience while I read them this book; it's so simple, yet so enthralling. I knew as soon as I previewed it, before introducing it to my 1st grade students, that they were going to really like it. Then, they proved me wrong.<br /><br />They LOVED it!<br /><br />If you are an elementary librarian reading this review, you MUST add this book to your collection.  It's interactive and an entire class has an opportunity to participate. I even decided to introduce it to my 2nd and 3rd grade students to it and encouraged them to think back to when they were \\"young\\" and would get excited over something as simple as dots. Even my seven and eight year olds embraced the element of surprise (even when I knew they could predict what was going to happen next) and commented how \\"fun\\" it was.<br /><br />I read one review stated that one would require very long arms to read this to a group of children. No, this is not true. I simply picked a child to come up and stand by me and help press the dots. It worked just fine.<br /><br />FIVE PLUS stars.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I only got one song and the booklet, which I didn't want anyways. False marketing!!!! I want the rest of the songs.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|What more is there to say? Anything that's got the name Dirty Harry has got to be good. I'm surprised there haven't been re-makes of the series of movies, but really, is there anyone in the acting community that can pull off Clint Eastwood? I didn't think so. If you haven't seen them, order them. You won't be disappointed!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I absolutely love lady Gaga's new record, I especially enjoy that she took such risks on it.  I know not everyone likes it, she very much went against convention on these songs.  I would argue that \\"fans\\" who hate Born This Way have missed the whole point of what kind of artist Lady Gaga is, and therefore are not as much of a \\"fan\\".  Anyway, I love it, and a majority of reviews agree with me (that's all that matters).
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth has done it again. The first time I ever saw him in a movie, it was Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, since that time, I've watched Firth as he portrayed various characters and was always convincing. The King's Speech really deserved the Oscar awards it received. Good story, great character portrayals and great directing.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I've been planning on buying some of the $5 albums Amazon has available, but this one is too good to pass up for the 20GB of storage.    Thanks GAF.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|The description says that you get all the songs.. Do NOT believe it. I downloaded it and got 3 songs and the digital booklet. That was it! I'm not very happy with Amazon at the moment. If you're going to advertise that it's the whole album for $.99 then deliver what you advertise!     This was also my first purchase of digital mp3's from Amazon and I will never do it again! Sticking with iTunes!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Not sure if I just got lucky, or if Amazon has fixed its issues, but I purchased the full CD for 99 cents about 20 minutes ago and they are all working perfectly on my Cloud drive right now. Might have been quicker than that; this was the first time I checked for a status update, and found all songs working great. Don't hesitate to grab this great deal!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The phrase \\"inside job\\" sounds like money being stolen from a bank with the collusion of someone in the bank. In this case it's money being stolen by a bank, or actually many banks with the collusion of many politicians.<br /><br />It begins in Iceland where we are treated to the rich natural colors that typify the sub arctic landscape as well as the vibrant shades for the quaint homes. Iceland was a country with a sound economy, low unemployment, and 12 billion dollars tucked away in their provincial banks that did no lending outside of the country. That was before deregulation took place, and outside schemers and investors began borrowing 10x the amount of Iceland's wealth. Today Iceland is a country beset by debt and high unemployment, and unfinished labors that dot the Reykjavik landscape.<br /><br />This is the introduction to \\"Inside Job.\\" Actor Matt Damon takes us through the deregulatory steps in this country from the Savings and Loan Scandal during the Ronald Reagan era, to the present day banking debacle perpetrated by many players from Alan Greenspan, to Robert Rubin, Phil Gramm, Larry Sumners and Hank Paulson, none of whom were willing to be interviewed.<br /><br />One of the biggest canards of our current economic circumstances is the subprime mortgage debacle, This movie explains graphically the previous relationship between homeowners and bankers, and how it was replaced by bankers who gave loans to home buyers, who in turn paid off the people who invested in the mortgages sold by the commercial bank to the investment banks.<br /><br />Appearances by CEO's in front of Congress can make you physically ill when one says that a AAA rating is an opinion not a recommendation to the investor. There is a financial lobbyist who says that CEO's who helped engineer the demise of their own company and the economy, actually deserved the pay and bonuses they received. Some of the interviewed are college professors who have been paid handsome consulting fees for espousing deregulated positions. In other words, selling deregulation has even come to the college classroom.<br /><br />But it's more than the classroom. Inside Job shows the careful and deliberate dismantling of regulation that protected consumer and investor for decades. It reveals the plutocracy that is casting its long shadow over our republic and our democratic process. Although many European nations have reached a consensus that executive compensation must be regulated and curtailed, the Obama administration has been mute. No regulation has become law that will prevent such a financial crisis from ever happening again thanks to a lobby that has five lobbyists for every member of Congress. Not one commercial bank or investment bank, or banker or executive has been charged with fraud, malfeasance or theft for their illegal business and investment practices.<br /><br />Spend two hours. See how the Inside Job occurred, and then ask yourself, what are you going to do about it.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002CMLQXY Free Lunch: How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense (and Stick You with the Bill)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385529953 Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids, and the Long Con That Is Breaking America]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1603582053 The Looting of America: How Wall Street's Game of Fantasy Finance Destroyed Our Jobs, Pensions, and Prosperity--and What We Can Do About It]]  Griftopia, Free Lunch, and this one should be sold as a package of three.

B00003JRCQ|3.0|The movie was good but honestly Amanda Roots' expression throughout the movie until near the end was like a deer caught in the headlights, maybe better yet a bowl leakage expression.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|A couple of years ago I wasn't a fan of Lady Gaga at all. I didn't understand the hype and all. Then one of my friends convinced me to watch a couple of videos. One was Bad Romance and the other was Paparazzi at the VMA's where she's covered in blood and hangs herself in the end. After watching that I became an instant fan. I realized her voice is absolutely fantastic and that she pretty much always sings live, unlike some other artists, plus her voice is to die for! After that I got the Fame Monster album and fell in love with it. And now....she's made the best album I've heard in about 12 years, releasing Born This Way. The BTW album is a huge step up from The Fame Monster. It shows a woman who's really grown music wise and this is what she's made to do - sing rock!! I am totally in love with this whole album. This one really comes from her heart. The awards are going to pour all over her for this album, I know it. You can clearly hear some Bowie influences in this album. Several months ago I heard snippets of Sheibe and Government Hooker and knew they would be totally amazing, and finally, after listening to them I can say that they absolutely blow my mind. No bubblegum pop for this woman anymore - this is what her voice is made for. I give this album 10/10. I haven't heard anything this mind blowing in 12 years. She's shown that she's here to stay.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I have not yet listened to the music, nor would I normally buy a Lady Gaga album from what I've heard on the radio.  However at $.99 I have decided to buy and check it out.  This is the way to transition from the old music marketing system people!  Give people no reason not to listen to the music legally and then subsequent albums (and concert tickets and merchandise etc.) will reflect what the market truly is for such tunes.  Looks like a win-win for everyone, albeit not the sort of thing studio execs are used to doing to wring every penny out of every possible avenue for exploiting the consumer.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Ten years ago, the world lost \\"the quiet Beatle\\", George Harrison.  I thought it appropriate to review the 2003 DVD of the Concert for George as a way to mark the ten year anniversary year of his passing.<br /><br />When I opened the packaging of this star laden concert DVD, I honestly didn't know what to expect.  I've often witnessed memorial \\"projects\\" -whether they be services for the deceased (celebrity or mere mortals) or concerts - turn into demonstrations of macabre self-absorption or out-of-place evangelistic services.  In the case of Concert for George (organized by Eric Clapton), neither is the case.<br /><br />Concert for George is a brilliantly organized and produced musical memorial that beautifully presents the beauty, brilliance and kindness of Mr. Harrison.  A devout follower of Hinduism, the DVD appropriately opens with a sitar performances by Anoushka Shankar (daughter George's dear friend, Ravi Shankar).  One doesn't have to be a practitioner of Hinduism in order to appreciate the beauty and emotion of Your Eyes, Arpan and The Inner Light.  The latter song was joined by ELO's (and Harrison's fellow Traveling Wilbury's bandmate) Jeff Lynne and was followed by a \\"crack\\" line up from Monty Python (you'll have to watch the video to appreciate the previous comment).<br /><br />Also performing various Harrison related tunes are Gary Brooker, Eric Clapton, Joe Brown, Jools Holland, Sam Brown, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, George's son, Dahni, Billy Preston, Ringo Starr  and Paul McCartney.  To say that this DVD is precious history in the making would be an understatement.  You will laugh, cry, smile and muse at the memories that this wonderful collection of music performed by some of the most exceptional talent gracing this planet.<br /><br />If I was asked to select a favorite performance from this video, I would find it near impossible to choose.  If I Needed Someone by Clapton would wind up on my short list as would Taxman by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Although, come to think of it, While My Guitar Gently Weeps (by Clapton and McCartney) and Wah Wah by the entire roster of performers would also jostle for the top position of my favorites.  Clocking in at almost five hours of total viewing time, I would wager a guess that you, too, will have a very hard time selecting a favorite.<br /><br />Whether you're a classic rock historian or loyal Harrison fan, Concert for George is a must-have addition to you DVD library.<br /><br />Randy Patterson<br />Boomerocity.comnk of it, While My Guitar Gently Weeps (by Clapton and McCartney) and Wah Wah by the entire roster of performers would also jostle for the top position of my favorites.

B002ZG983M|3.0|Apparently based on an actual comic book, it's about a kid who wants to be a super hero. Until he doesn't. A really well paced, fun, funny, and somewhat thought provoking smaller but well done movie. Kind of a \\"I didn't see THAT coming' movie! Only cast member I recognized was Nick Cage, but they were all good and Hit-Girl stole the show.
0061537969|4.0|A very good book with a great view point.  Well written, with a good story that tugs on your emotions, and a satisfying ending.  I enjoyed it very much.  My only real criticism would be that, in my opinion, the blows to Denny's life keep coming to the point of almost being ridiculous.  I found myself thinking, \\"Oh come on, now you're just dragging the story out unnecessarily.\\"  Despite that one flaw, I found the book and characters very engaging, definitely a book worth reading.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|most amazing album ever. this is the first album i bought from gaga. this will be a classic for the next 1000 years.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I bought this and had it downloaded to my cloud drive.  Only 4 songs and the digital booklet were stored there.  Be cautios about using cloud drive.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|The price is a great deal. The only problem is that the entire album does not download. Only received a few of the songs. This is the first time I have ever purchased something like this from Amazon, and it will probably be the last.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I only received two songs and a booklet.  Not my fav songs either.  I want my money back! Definitely has download problems.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Haven't listened to the album yet... I honestly don't care much about Lady Gaga's music.<br /><br />I bought the album to show support for reasonable digital file pricing.  Thanks Gaga, thanks Amazon, for making a statement on downloads, music prices, and the New Music Industry.  I wholeheartedly support this statement.<br /><br />I noticed that downloads were going slowly... and I did have to hit the \\"restart downloads\\" button to get all my files.<br /><br />So what?  How easy, how affordable this is.  Even with the download issues, I couldn't have driven to a store and back to buy the album before it got here... and I could start playing some songs within a couple minutes.<br /><br />Seriously, one-star reviews because they priced something so reasonably and made it so convenient that demand is out-stripping technology?<br /><br />Congratulations and thanks again to Lady Gaga and Amazon Music... from a devoted iTunes guy who doesn't listen to Lady Gaga.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|Purchased the Lady Gaga \\"Born This Way\\" for $.99 and only have track numbers 2, 6, 8, 12 and 14 [total 5] in the \\"Cloud Drive\\". Did NOT try to download them yet since I read posts that Amazon is having problems with the links. Not to mention that the PDF isn't available either.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Two paws WAY up!  I was afraid that I wouldn't really love Lady Gaga's new album since I didn't really like the \\"Judas\\" single, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Get ready to get out of your chair, shake your butt, and sing along! My favs: Born This Way, Hair, Scheisse, Heavy Metal Lover.        I hope that the people who gave poor reviews based on technical issues will re-evaluate since the low rating simply reflects poorly on the album, not amazon.
B002ZG97RE|2.0|Heard bad things about this movie, but took a chance because I love the Bourne series. This movie was definitely lacking and the political agenda got really annoying (even though I agreed with it). WMDs WMDs WMDs. Give it a rest.
0446195529|2.0|If ever there was an example of squeezing too much blood out of a series, then this is it. I have been a great fan of the Camel Club series up to now, but honestly it was only out of respect for the entertainment I have gotten from Baldacci's previous works (both Camel Club and others) that I finished this one. Too many red herrings and blindsides, boring politics, cliched foreigners, and - most of all - not enough input from Stone's other Camel Club colleagues. These were the characters that made the previous books in the series so entertaining, but in this they are pure bit part players. Time for you Oliver to retire to the beach..........
B0028IDXDS|4.0|Totally keeps pacifier within reach and our baby is learning to put it in his own mouth now that the pacifier isn't falling all over the place.  And even when he falls asleep and doesn't need the soothing of the actual pacifier, he likes to cuddle with the stuffed monkey.  The only con is that I had originally thought the pacifier would be removable for easier cleaning or be interchangeable with other pacifiers, but that is not the case.  However, this item is such a must have in our house that we bought a second one, a dog (and it is quite fun to select a different animal).
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I was a bit worried when I read all the bad reviews about not being able to download songs by other customers before I clicked the \\"Buy Now\\" button anyway. I trusted that Amazon would solve these problems if not already. As it turns out, I didn't have any problem downloading the entire album so I am guessing Amazon had already successfully solved the download glitch. Good job Amazon!! Thank you for this AMAZING DEAL! I am still listening my way through the entire album, I do not think it is as good as her previous ones but I love Gaga anyway!!! I do hope that her next one will bring more surprise though.
0071636080|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2KS3V3YFFNWWK]]When this book came out, it seemed as if everyone was trying to cash in on anything and everything Apple -- knitted iPod holders, custom-designed Macbook sleeves, and of course an orchard-full of books with \\"i-Something\\" \\"Mac,\\" or \\"Jobs\\" in their title.<br /><br />So when Carmine Gallo's \\"The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs:  How to Be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience\\" came out, I instantly dismissed it as another glib attempt to turn a quick buck off of the prevailing Mac-mania.<br /><br />... But I kept hearing from trusted sources, \\"you have to read this book.\\" As I began to give more presentations professionally, my hunger to know what was current in the literature on public speaking intensified. Finally, seeing a few promotional videos for the book by Gallo himself, who is a communications coach and skilled presenter in his own right, convinced me to make an impulse Kindle buy.<br /><br />Watch the video for my full impressions, but the quick take is this: Every executive, manager, or anyone else who gives presentations needs to read this. It's tragic how many productive hours are wasted with presentations that fail to inspire, motivate and get results.<br /><br />Gallo's book provides the antidote for presentations that are boring or confusing, by offering smart tips and examples on how to prepare, refine and deliver your presentation. I like that he fires broadsides at some of the stodgy, stubborn, stiff and formal techniques that I still see some speech coaches advocating -- yuck! Speeches and presentations should be fun or at least engaging for our audiences, not preachy. This book shows you how to make them so.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|WOW!  See, there are some benefits to being in college for 10 years! lol best deal ever & took less then 3minutes minutes to save it to the cloud and download it to my itunes. DANCE PARTY STARTS NOW!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This album is an absolute masterpiece! A nice blend of pop, rock, electro, hair metal, dance and a hint of jazz and country. I don't think it will appeal to the majority of fans/casual fans as it will to the 'monsters', heck, I think there's a few monsters who wanted another 'Just Dance' or 'Poker Face', but this is a huge step up from 2008's 'The Fame'. I'm glad this album is a bit more dark and heavy, and love the 80's/90's throwbacks too. I've always wanted Gaga's pop-rock side to come out since 'Blueberry Kisses', 'Electric Kiss, 'Fever' and 'Red & Blue' (pre Gaga days), so this makes me even more than happy! Love this album, it's more than I could have wanted from Gaga. I think she outdid herself, and glad it's nothing like the sounds of her contemporaries ;) Job well done, Lady Gaga.  Album highlights: Government Hooker, Hair, Scheiße, Bloody Mary, Fashion of His Love, Heavy Metal Lover, Electric Chapel, Yoü and I, and The Edge of Glory.
0670022411|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the most unique, amazing, thought-provoking, and just plain awesome books I've read in a long time! All of the characters were well developed and you either loved to love them or loved to hate them. The history, science, alchemy, magic, and supernatural were mixed with action, adventure, mystery, and romance for a spellbinding blend that will keep you reading long into the night. The descriptions and plot were dazzling and breathtaking, so much so that I was sad to close the cover, but I am excited to read the next book in this trilogy. This is a thrilling novel that stands out among the crowd! Please, please, please pick up A Discovery of Witches and get mesmerized!!<br /><br />All Souls Trilogy: A Discovery of Witches (1), Shadow of Night (2), \\"untitled\\" (3)
B004LL1HM4|4.0|A: \\"The Helplessness Blues\\" by Fleet Foxes. These folkies have the rich, gorgeous harmonies of the Beach Boys or CSN down to almost museum quality, but where most would call Beach Boys harmony sunny and fun, Fleet Foxes' hit you like 42 sad movie endings spliced together into a 40 minute compilation. They make feeling glum feel oh, so groovy.<br /><br />Clouds of vocal atmosphere are what Fleet Foxes specialize in. \\"So now I am older than my mother and father/when they had their daughter\\" are the first words on the album, and that sets the tone on the remainder of the album. It helps that heaping stacks of near gospel harmony climbs the hills behind lead vocalist Robin Pecknold cushions the fact that Robin is pouring his soul out on each song. The band also eschews traditional instrumentation (marxophone? Hammer dulcimer? Water harp? Tibetan singing bowls?) to enhance the other-worldliness of their sound. That's not to say Fleet Foxes are totally out there; hearing \\"sim salabim\\" in the middle of a tune made me smile and think of Jonny Quest. (Well, maybe that wasn't their original intent, but it works for me.)<br /><br />\\"Helplessness Blues\\" is an album that never goes static, never stops to judge what it's doing and sometimes erupts in surprising ways (the cutting, dissonant sax barks and string arrangement at the end of \\"The Shrine/An Argument\\"). While often rooted in a familiar base - like the CSN harmonies in \\"The Plains/Bitter Dancer\\" - yet taking routes that aren't staid, \\"Helplessness Blues\\" moves Fleet Foxes into a place of their own. As the title song draws to a close, Robin wistfully sings \\"someday I'll be like the man on the screen.\\" There's a hope and idealism to that one line that belies just how deep and treacherously much of the album looks at life, and on their sophomore album, Fleet Foxes sound like they may be up to the challenges.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I can't believe I got this album for a dollar.  This just goes to show that amazon is a serious contender against apple and their total dominance in digital music downloads.  Pick this one up you wont regret it not only that you get 20 gb of cloud storage free!
B003UESJH4|5.0|What an inspiring movie.  I did not see this when it was released and had heard how great it was.  Wow... what an understatement.  This was superb.      A bit slow-moving here and there, but truly a great work.  The character interactions and persistence was a job to watch and appreciate.  Great men often are less than perfect.  And for some that is what made them the legendary men they became (women too!!!).    This is a film you will want to watch again and again.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app is so much better than iheartradio, i ended up uninstalling it and now this is my number one radio app.
B004X2M3SI|5.0|Due to Apple's failure to provide the latest episode of Doctor Who (Rebel Flesh), this will be my very first and LAST iTunes Season Pass. For the second half of Season 6, I will give my money to Amazon.com, which seems to have figured out how to put the show up the morning after it airs.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|People should think before giving a review, it is not that difficult.    The album is great and it is a daily special for 99 cents which it a steal if you ask me.  You get the entire album + 20GB cloud storage for the price of 99 cents.    If you haven't got all your songs it is because the order is still \\"processing\\", due to so many people purchasing and taking advantage of this great deal.    Amazon usually takes less than 60 seconds to send the order receipt to your email account, if you haven't got it, then you now know why..    I purchased the album probably 2 hours ago and I only have access to 7 songs out of the 14 and my order is still \\"processing\\".    If you would like to speed up your order give them a call.. simple as that.    Now, please consider editing your review as it is a delay from amazon's processing system, not a problem with the album.. remember this is a digital download order.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|just received my x41s in the mail. most experience i've had with surround sound is my old 5.1 dvd home theater by sony but living in an apartment now i can't really play loud anymore hence me trying out the x41s.   first off wow. first game i tried with em was black ops multi-player and wow u can really hear a lot more than just normal speakers. and the 7.1 was amazing. with stereo headset, i'm used to looking to the radar every time i hear gunfire to figure out where its coming from, but with the X41s i didn't have to bother looking to the radar for i could hear exactly where it was coming for, making it for quicker response to events like that. great detail to foot steps also but then with the great sound, people using the ninja perk (silent footsteps) become a great threat.    7.1 surround is great, highs and lows are nice though bass could be better (my old turtle beach, the px21 had better bass, but being wired it didn't last too long) and being wireless, i recommend these a lot :)
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Clint Eastwood's movie \\"Afterlife\\" is well acted, and very well done.   There were no shortcuts on locations.  This movie doesn't deal with heaven or hell, but something else.  There are parts that move little slow but that could be due to an action scene at the very beginning which leaves you wanting more but that scene needs to be early to set the stage for the rest of movie.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Overall, I love the price of this album and the Digital Booklet that comes with it.  However, I am having trouble downloading 6 of the songs on the album (Marry The Night, Bad Kids, Highway Unicorn, Electric Chapel, You & I, and The Edge of Glory).  It keeps stating that the download failed while the other 8 songs successfully downloaded.  I am hoping that an issue can be resolved.<br /><br />**EDIT:  It ended up downloading everything after a few hours.. (5/5 stars)  LOVE!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I don't even like Lady Gaga but 99 cents for a whole album, why not?  Guess what.. got one song!  Waited a couple hours, kept reloading Cloud Player.. still only one song.  Sounds more like a scam to me.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Before this album I've only heard a few Gaga songs thanks to Rock Band and Glee, but after hearing this album I'm going to buy and try more of her music. \\"Born This Way\\" and \\"Government Hooker\\" are what I've been replaying more than other songs. Over all great album.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I really liked this movie.<br /><br />I've worked in the industry and grew up on fantasy/sci fi. Just be aware of a couple things: stick with the darkness. The first \\"encounter\\" was way too dark for the first half, but once you get your first \\"sighting\\" it all picks up from there. Also, don't expect a clean Hollywood ending. One of the things I really liked about this movie was that it was unique and not predictable.<br /><br />The acting was amazing. The way the director pulled off the reality of the trolls is enthralling. I wanted to see more of them and see them interacting as real animals. It was so great.<br /><br />... I would recommend this to all of my friends.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great album. I got in early so I didn't have download issues. A few songs took a little bit longer to come in but nothing a refresh couldn't fix.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|No idea if this album is any good or not, 99 cents seems like a great price but thus far only 7 of the songs are available to play or download. Amazon really dropped the ball here. I'm sure they were hoping to poach all of Apple's cloud service potential customers before they rolled out their own cloud service but failures of this magnitude on such a huge release will end up costing them more customers than they would have gained. A for effort but I gotta give you a failing grade here. GaGa should sue.  Update. 8 hours after writing this review I STILL have only 7 songs. For all the devout Gagites whining about people reviewing the service rather than the artist, sorry but there is no place to register complaints about Amazon's failure to deliver the goods that were paid for and to warn others away from using said service other than reviews. Deal with it. I'm sure your idol will get plenty of money and I'm pretty sure defending her honor on Amazon is not going to get you a personal visit or anything so get a life.
B001M3LG84|5.0|I have about 7 or 8 of Andre Rieu's DVDs and this is one of the best.  I have already watched it twice and love it.  I especially like the skaters.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|Tired disco beats from another era, all sounding bland and quite the same as all her other stuff with a few blatant Madonna ripoffs. She basically just changes the lyrics and reuses the same tracks. Ughhh!
0446560073|5.0|For those who enjoyed \\"Simon's Cat\\" both on YouTube and in the first written book, you will love this sequel!     Normally, Simon's Cat is a series of disjointed scenes and scenarios that highlight the antics of our feline friends. In this sequel, the author actually presents his comics in a story like fashion. The cat starts out at home but gets frustrated with his loving owner (one of my favorite scenes). He runs away from home and experiences what lies \\"Beyond the Fence\\". The way this is presented as a story and not as random feline acts earns the author kudos in my book. It works well and will keep you entertained throughout your reading session.    I highly recommend \\"Beyond the Fence\\" for all you Simon's Cat fans. I hope the author continues to make these entertaining and heart warming comics!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|The controversies swirling around Lady Gaga as of late are all religion-centric.  It is true that Lady Gaga's new album is filled with religious references (some right on the surface as song titles).  Some criticize Lady Gaga for mocking or trashing religion on some level, but this is far from the truth.<br /><br />Although some religious references may appear at first to be offensive, they're all either surfacy references (how many people have tried to explain that \\"Judas\\" is about loving someone who's wronged you or someone you love?) or criticisms against people who've hounded her fans (e.g., \\"I don't speak your Jesus Christo\\" from \\"Americano\\").  Lady Gaga's self-proclaimed mission with \\"Born This Way\\" is to let her fans know that it's okay to be who they are.  Since many of her fans have witnessed protests and oppression at the hands of those who claim to be religious and Christian, it seems only natural that she at least vaguely reference these people and their misled beliefs.<br /><br />THAT BEING SAID, the music is the real star here, and even the religious references aren't nearly as common (and certainly not as inflammatory) as many would have you believe.<br /><br />Heavily influenced by 80s rock and pop, \\"Born This Way\\" may be a throwback to a great era in music while, but it still retains newness and originality.<br /><br />The special edition is worth the extra cost.  Of the three additional tracks, two (\\"The Queen\\" and \\"Fashion Of His Love\\") are some of the better tracks on the album.  The remixes are interesting but not vital or necessary to the album.<br /><br />Overall, Lady Gaga delivers exactly what she's known for and what we've come to expect: great songwriting, great vocals, and an ever-evolving since of exactly who \\"Gaga\\" is as a songwriter and an individual.  It does not disappoint.
B0027CSNBM|4.0|This small book (in size as well as page count) was intended to tide fans of the \\"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\\" series over until the final book, \\"The Last Olympian\\", was released. This was not necessary in my case as I never read any Percy Jackson until all five books were in print.<br /><br />The book is something of a mixed bag. There are three very entertaining short stories and some filler. The short stories are not at all necessary to enjoy the book series and two of them have no real connections to events in that series. Still, they are well up to Riordan's usual standards and I don't regret the purchase.<br /><br />Still, a bit sparse for the asking price, hence the four stars.
1594202842|4.0|The hardcover copy of this book has below the title the following words:  \\"This is the story about a mother, two daughters, and two dogs.  This was supposed (in italics)to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones.  But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old\\".  This was written by the author, which seems to me to be a fair assessment of the book.  There is emphasis on \\"supposed to be a story\\" and on \\"how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old\\".  Most people parent their children in much the same way they were parented themselves. We all would like to think we don't make the same mistakes, and sometimes we escape that trap.    Let's assume that everything in the book happened much as Amy Chua relates it.  Chua is complimented by many others for the way her children have been raised.  Her daughters are equally praised.  Not everything a child achieves is because of his/her parents; not everything a child does wrong or poorly is because of her/his parents.  But, either way, in most cases the parents' influence is reflected.  The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as some wise person once said.    Would I have wanted to be raised by someone like like Ms. Chua?  Most likely not.  Would I have wanted to achieve even a nibble of the finesse and intelligence her daughters have?  Absolutely yes.  Ms. Chua says that her parenting is of the \\"Chinese\\" variety, but I believe that other Asian cultures have similar parenting patterns.  Is it truly cultural though?  I think that economics has a lot to do with it.  No matter how much parents of any culture want the very best for their children, some simply can't manage or afford it. This is true in the west as much as it might be in the other parts of the world, at least proportionally.  What is it that so many parents often say about raising their children?  Doesn't it have something to do with \\"the very best\\" or \\"better opportunities than I had\\"?   I admit to having been quite alarmed by some of Ms. Chua's methods and goals.  I also read the book seeing much of the humor Ms. Chua uses turned towards herself.  I think she is talking about cultural differences, which shouldn't be limited to one particular set of guidelines, but gleaning from the best of all things available.  The final chapter relates how Ms. Chua is finishing up this book and is taking input from her daughters and her husband.  The dogs apparently had no say.    How many Western parents would admit to having been \\"humbled\\" by their thirteen-year-old child?  How many thirteen-year-old children would be permitted to take the actions which Lulu is ultimately allowed?  Why is everyone so willing to judge the book in Manichean terms, to quote young Amy, in black and white terms?  How many parents would tolerate being called Manichean and then take pride in the fact that her young daughter even has that term at the ready, armed for battle?    I don't mind the criticisms of the readers who apparently read the book.  I think there are worthwhile criticisms to be made.  There are also very valuable lessons to be learned.  Really, folks, is the world really as \\"black and white\\" as you would have it?  I admire Ms. Chua for the honesty she demonstrates.  I think her book is far more valuable than many of the other reviewers are willing to grant.
B004LQ1XBY|4.0|As a blues fan, when I heard Hugh Laurie had an album coming out I was curious. I'd seen him play both guitar and piano on HOUSE.    I have to say, I gave him a chance and this album is very enjoyable. It's a nice slow New Orleans blues style. Hugh is backed up by some excellent musicians as well. A very pleasant surprise indeed.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Did the artist put out a bad album or not.  If you download isn't finishing send a ticket to amazon, don't post a 1 star review of the album (until they fix your download and you actually listen to it).<br /><br />Amazon should remove all reviews that are based on download problems and don't even mention the content of the album (mine included).
B000FC10MU|5.0|Being an avid Prachett reader, I finally got to reading Good Omens. I liked it so much that I decided it was time I read something of Gaiman. Luckily, my sister got it to me for my birthday.<br />It's a really really good book. It's both entertaining and educating. I learned from it more about folklore and myth than I did from books dedicated to this very subject.<br />Gaiman is a very talented writer, and I've started sampling his other works on my Kindle, so I guess there's more to come.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Previously left a 1-star review because of the frustrations with downloading.  Editing this review to 4-stars because this is a great album at a ridiculously awesome price.  WOULD rate it 5-stars if the downloading process would have gone more smoothly.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I just talked to Amazon.  The lady I spoke with was rude and it was almost like i was inconveniencing her for calling due to her company's product not working.  She said they are aware of an issue and to try and re-download it again in a few hours.  Then basically hung up on me and said thank you for shopping with Amazon.  Definitely no longer buying from Amazon.  ITunes from here on out for me.  Worst.  Experience.  Ever.
B000PFFXOS|4.0|There's not a lot to say about this album that hasn't already been said.  It's superb, although that can be said for quite a number of Tull albums, in reality.  Since the same reviews seem to appear on Amazon for all of the various different CD incarnations of this album, however, the only reason I'm actually writing this review is to inform the buyer that not all releases of this album are desirable to own.      This was one of the first CDs I acquired for my very first CD player back in the late-80s.  The first version released by Chrysalis had some major flaws.  For one thing, the sound quality was pretty poor (typical, actually, for many CDs of earlier music being released at that time), and the tape hiss was very excessive (also pretty typical).  But worst of all, the last track, \\"Wind Up\\" was actually downcut by approx. 1/2 minute.  The entire end of the song was simply lopped off.    I wrote to Chrysalis complaining about the downcut and the tape hiss, and was sent a \\"corrected\\" version.  Yes, the last track was now included in its entirely, but their \\"solution\\" to the tape hiss issue had obviously been to just roll off the high end, meaning that the excessive hiss was now replaced by muddy sound.  Some improvement!  It was not until the 90s era \\"remaster\\" that Chrysalis finally got the CD of this album even remotely right, and while it was much better, I still wasn't enormously happy with it.  I own the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs Original Master LP of Aqualung, and it still blows the Chrysalis CD away (I haven't heard the rare and pricey gold disc that exists so I can't comment on that).  I agree that Chrysalis needs to do another remaster, because there's no reason why the CD of this album shouldn't at least closely approach the sound quality of the MFSL LP.  That having been said, however, in the meantime the latest CD version currently available is definitely worth owning.  The sound is very decent, if not terrific.  But if you're shopping for a used copy, there may be some of those earlier versions still floating around, and you definitely don't want either one of them.  So be careful!     Then dim the lights, grab the drink or substance of your choice, and enjoy one of greatest rock and roll albums ever released.

B002ZG99TK|4.0|Unstoppable (action, drama, thriller)<br />Directed by Tony Scott<br />Starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson<br /><br />20th Century Fox   2010   98 min   Rated PG-13   Released Feb 15, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Cantonese, French, Mandarin (Traditional), Portuguese, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital copy<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />After directing movies about planes, cars and a submarine, Tony Scott's last two efforts have involved trains. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 used a train as a setting, but Scott goes a step further in Unstoppable, making a train one of the movies' stars. Trains are big. Scott has Washington walk in front of a few at the start of the movie to show us just how big they are.<br /><br />An irresponsible worker makes two mistakes that set events in motion, deciding to move a train without connecting the air brakes and then leaving the cabin to pull a lever at the side of the track. The train is moving too fast for him to get back on and pulls away under full power.<br /><br />Will Colson (Pine) has been a conductor for four months. He reports to work and faces resentment from the older workers. They assume he's inexperienced and think that younger, cheaper workers may be a threat to their own job security. He's assigned to work with Frank Barnes (Washington), who has similar feelings. Colson makes a couple of mistakes and Barnes thinks his fears are justified.<br /><br />The runaway train is initially thought to be a \\"coaster,\\" but it soon becomes clear that it's under power and capable of traveling at approximately 70 mph. An early effort to board it fails, so a decision has to be made. Yard Master Connie Hooper (Dawson) suggests derailing it before it reaches populated areas. Her bosses disagree because they are worried about the financial cost.<br /><br />Various other attempts fail to stop the train and it's left to our heroes, Barnes and Colson, to try their own solution. They give chase in their train and plan to link up with the runaway and use their own brakes to stop it.<br /><br />Other factors are also thrown into the mix. A group of children on a school trip are on a train on the same line as the runaway and the threat of a collision is high. The runaway is pulling half a mile of freight cars and several contain volatile chemicals. The track leads to a curve which has a speed limit of 15 mph and it's close to a heavily populated town.<br /><br />Just enough time is given to establishing the back stories of Barnes and Colson and it explains their motivations for chasing down the runaway. The tension builds throughout the second half of the movie and the action rarely allows us to take a breather. Failed attempts early in the story show us that our heroes are in danger if they continue the pursuit, but the alternative is a potentially huge disaster should the train derail.<br /><br />The story doesn't sound very complicated and it isn't. The action takes center stage, but what did you expect? I found myself engaged throughout and the three main actors put in good performances. I'm rarely disappointed by Washington and I also liked Pine and Dawson here.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />Unstoppable looks good on Blu-ray. Scott seems to have made some of the colors unnaturally bright, making everything stand out. The train in particular looks imposing with its red and yellow paintwork. Detail is excellent throughout and the print is clean. It felt like most of the action was taking place right in front of me.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />Nominated for a sound editing Oscar, Unstoppable sounds great too. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix places us in the middle of the action. Trains aren't just big, they're heavy. The track makes us aware of that with a pounding rumble that will give your sub a good workout. It's backed up by the squeal of brakes and metal-on-metal. Dialogue comes across clearly and there's plenty of supporting effects from the rears.<br /><br />Special Features 3.5/5<br /><br />The special features focus heavily on the technical aspects of making the movie.

B00028HBKC|5.0|Having thought about this movie for a long time, I'd imagine that likely - but not necessarily only - practicing Catholics with a strong life of prayer/faith & an advanced handle on the doctrine of the church can get the very max out of this incredible film that should be prayerfully watched (I'd strongly recommend, first and foremost, praying for wisdom BEFORE seeing it, so as to reduce the chance of coming away with a false or superficial understanding of the film).  The reason is because this movie itself transforms into a kind of mystery because of the levity and holiness of its subject and what exactly it is trying to portray to us in great detail.<br /><br />This movie is a work of art in the highest cinematic order, a visual meditation on the Stations of the Cross (as I once heard described on EWTN), and a prayer.  At a church meeting about the movie, I heard it described not so much as \\"violent\\" as saliently \\"brutal\\" and I would tend to agree, although the difference between these terms is subtle and yet eventually, intuitively perceptible.  As explained to me, violence - especially Hollywood-style violence - tends to be associated with a kind of chaotic/disorganized action (like something you'd see in \\"The Godfather,\\" \\"Aliens,\\" \\"Boys in the Hood,\\" or \\"City of God,\\") but brutality is more of a focused action carried out, in this case, toward Jesus.<br /><br />A lot of movies instruct, but no other movie has ever, and probably will ever, make me feel the Passion as this one.  God clearly used Gibson as His instrument to produce this great work and Jim Caveziel's acting - (the very wide range of ideas and emotions portrayed in his gentle face and expressive eyes) - is sublime.  Definitely worth seeing at least once, if not more, in your life.  Let yourself work up to being ready for it if need be, but don't miss out on an otherwise very spiritually enlightening and tremendously moving film.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app is like having Network Stumbler or inSSIDer on your phone! Very fast and accurate. It works great with my phones B/G/N wireless card.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I was very excited to see that I could buy Lady Gaga's new album today for 99 cents. However, like many others, I was only able to download 2 songs at first and when I refreshed, I had 4 songs.  I hope that this will be fixed soon.
B0051QJ83S|2.0|I only received 6 of 14 songs.  I would like the rest of the album, please.  Who can I call or ask to fix this?  Please help!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Within 5 minutes, I'm already playing it on my iTunes.    Looked at my Cloud Player in the browser, only one song available, so I downloaded and installed Amazon Cloud Player, all the songs were available, downloaded all and now in my iTunes.    Good or bad album, if it's $0.99, why not get it. At least support the musicians in these times.    Thank you for the deal
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Slow downloading because of the great .99 cent deal, but it is well worth the wait for \\"The Edge of Glory.\\" This song is freakin' awesome!!!!!
0439023513|5.0|this whole series was one of the best that i have read in a long time. from the first few pages of the hunger games, through catching fire, and into this book (mockingjay), I was hooked! definitely a must read for the entire trilogy!! none of the books were a let down!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Like sevral other reviewers, only got part of the album. I got 5 tracks and the digital booklet.    I've not had this happen before....what is up Amazon?    Music is fine that I've heard. I will update this when I get full album.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I just brought this album and I can't seem to access any of the the music except Highway Lover. I will be hightly disappointed if I can't get the rest of my music. This seems like a good deal but I would hate for anyone else to have to go through a hassle to get their music!!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I love this album. it has great dance beats and song that have points of view (immigration, female empowerment, self acceptance).It's a good move in the right direction. I think she's got some very epic songs to choose for her 9 singles!!
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I usually don't bother with music I am not familiar with, but since I do admire Lady Gaga because of her support in the opposition to SB1070 in AZ, I wanted her songs.  The disappointing part of this purchase and upload to the Cloud Player is that only 7 out of 14 songs were uploaded.  When I tried to obtain help, I got a stock reply referring me to FAQ about downloads and the Cloud Player.  BFD. So, until the Cloud Player upload process is easier and more reliable, I will not quickly try again.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Had to chime in here. This is the best (albeit lengthy) Red Hot Chili Peppers album ever.  Sure its no BSSM... but that was fit for the 90's and this is easily the best showcase RHCP has to offer from the decade, and is their best compilation yet.  Wide range of style, yet still with that Red Hot signature sound... Truly an achievement for an already well accomplished rock band. Well done!
B0051QK87S|5.0|Let's be honest: I was extremely worried about the outcome of Gaga's second full album, Born This Way. I wasn't a big fan of Born This Way (the song) and Judas took an extremely long time to grow on me. I was thinking she was really going to crash and burn for once. But then I downloaded the album. And I listened. And then I listened again. And you know what? It's really terrific. However, there are going to be a lot of people who just won't get it for whatever reason. The album is full of club ready music, it's not watered-down electronica per the Black Eyed Peas style. It's truly authentic electronica. I mean, listen to Scheisse and Government Hooker. Honestly, Gaga is an artistic genius, but she's a true artistic genius, one who refuses to go against the grain of her art to appeal to the masses. If the road strays toward the public, that's ok, but if it doesn't, she's cool with it. I think that's the biggest reason I admire her and her force in the industry. The absolute musts on this album are Americano, Edge of Glory, Government Hooker, and Marry the Night! You go GaGa!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'm not sure about the problems people were having earlier with purchasing this album for an incredible $0.99. All I can say is that I had ZERO ISSUES. I opened Cloud Player and the whole album was right there. I'm listening to it as I type this review. It sounds good so far but I'm mainly writing to counteract the inane and baseless 1-star ratings that have appeared all because folks are having download difficulties. Do you really think THE largest online retailer is going to screw you out of a whopping 99 cents?!? Really?!? I now buy all of my music through Amazon's MP3 store since it's DRM free and almost always cheaper than iTunes. I have never had a single issue with any purchase. As others have already posted, exercise some patience and use the proper channels to voice your concerns with Amazon and not the artist!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I wish I could review this album, but amazon only made 2 songs available to me, even though I paid for the whole album.  This makes GaGa look like she's part of the rip off.  The two songs I got, I don't care for.  If you plan on cheating people, at least pick two good songs to cheat us with.  I am giving a poor rating based on the two garbage songs I did get to listen to.  They were awful, could have been anyone singing these frumpy songs.  American idols reject songs, I've heard better singing in karaoke bars.  GaGa goes country and loses her edge.  Yawn.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I got 1 song. I thought I was to get the album. I WILL e getting my $ back. Too bad. I love GAGA
0756404738|5.0|I have just an issue with these book, I can't leave it. It has a great story, and if you read the last one you will now what I am mean.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|after announcing last summer that her next album would be born this way, it is finally here! and it was WELL WORTH the wait!    this is pop at it's absolute best! get ready for born this way to dominate the charts for a while!
B0051QJ83S|3.0|I really wasn't impressed with the two singles released from this album. I was going into this with low expectations (but at 99cents, how can anyone resist?!). So far, I'm as unimpressed by the album as a whole as I was by the singles.     A few standouts are: \\"You And I\\" which has a bit of an Elton John sound to it. \\"The Edge of Glory\\" is pretty awesome and brings me back to the likes of Pat Benatar or 80's anthemic rock (\\"Marry The Night\\" and \\"Hair\\" also fall into this category but not as good). \\"Americano\\" is pretty fun and quirky and probably my favorite so far (must be cuz it stirs up my Latino sangre). \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" has a really nice dreamy/New Agey sound to it that I love, with some sugar techno on top.     \\"ScheiBe\\" is like a rehash of previous Gaga, but I feel that I'll start to love it after hearing it a few times more. I appreciated a tiny homage to Michael Jackson at the beginning of \\"Bad Kids\\" (assuming Michael didn't get it from someone else himself).     The rest seems to alternate between the worst of Madonna (\\"Government Hooker,\\" \\"Bloody Mary\\") and more of what I consider Gaga's own cliche gone wrong (--what I love about Gaga is mainly her ability to switch a song 3 or more times throughout and make it seem smooth and groovy, but in this album it's not nearly as smooth and feels like a cheap imitation of her skill---). If you knew me personally, you'd know how much it pains me to compare her to M, but...it is what it is.     The reason I don't give it 1-star is because Lady Gaga is a true artist and you can hear it in this album more than in The Fame/The Fame Monster. It's very different and you can sense her love of music and the effort she put into it to make it different than anything else out there. But...you just won't find anything as unique and exciting as \\"Bad Romance\\" or as fun and funky as \\"Just Dance\\" or even as catchy and danceable as \\"Telephone.\\"  Except maybe in the exceptions I listed above.    But it's 99cents and I'm no musicexpert. I just go by what sounds good to my ears (you'll notice I mention nothing about lyrics, but other reviewers have noted her awesome song-writing and how political her songs can be). So it's worth checking out for yourself. Great deal any way you slice it. And please be patient, the songs will become available if you give a bit.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I purchased my download and it took 5 and a half hours...As for Ms. Gaga, I will continue to support you by purchasing future albums.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|I purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  He has several old LP records that he could no longer listen to.  He was able to copy these onto our PC and then put into our iTunes so we can listen to on our iPhones.  Very pleased with product.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|If all of your songs are not showing up, check your order status, it probably still says PENDING!!!  And if your songs don't show up by tomorrow, then contact Amazon through chat, give them your order number, and they will fix everything. This is not the end of the world.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorites.  We actually purchased this as a gift and the recipient loves it.  Perfect guy gift!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I have bought the item, and I have 9 songs downloaded currently.  For those people who have only gotten a couple songs, just be patient and give Amazon a chance.  I've downloaded several albums from Amazon mp3 in the last few months, and the quality has always been great; don't give up on Amazon just because of their high volume for this album.<br />About the music, definitely worth buying the album.  I was planning on buying it anyway, and I got the email and quickly accepted.  The songs are all great, at least the ones I've listened to so far.  I definitely like listening to the full version of \\"You and I\\", rather than Haley Reinhart's (American Idol Top 3 Finalist) shortened version.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Lady Gaga has a new edgier sound, but she continues to show the genius and variety that marked The Fame and The Fame Monster. I've read other reveiws that comment on the variety of sounds on this album. They have evidently forgotten the difference in tracks on The Fame and The Fame Monster. Just Dance and Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) are as different as Judas and The Edge of Glory. Like any album, it has its gems, but even the tracks that will remain less well known show the polish and genius that would make a charting single for most other artists.    This album is the next step on the journey she started with The Fame Monster. Musically she voyages to a new place while lyrically she gets more personal with songs about life and love and parents who don't appreciate her. This album is aimed and her little monsters with tracks ready to play in the clubs and lyrics to inspire others put down by their peers and family.    This Deluxe edition is definitely worth it for the additional songs and the remix disc. Truly a deluxe offering musically. I highly recommend this to all Gaga's little montsters.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Hey guys,    I've read your reviews and I hope that the Amazon server is just under issues and that amass delay in the tracks is the reason why you ain't getting anything.  If you've bought it from Amazon MP3 but it's not coming, just download it from iTunes if you can spend the cash or download it online, since you've bought a copy already.    I hope everything works out and maybe a little patience will do it all. I'll keep looking.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I have to say that I hope Lady Gaga starts a movement! For once an artist is admitting she doesn't need the money from the album by selling it for $0.99 I almost went to target today to buy the new album but instead I signed into my driod to see what Amazons deal was today and I was floored! I actually looked it up to make sure that it was for real. So if it doesn't download right the first time just try again people you paid less then a dollar!
B0034G4OVS|2.0|***This review is full of hilarious spoilers, be advised!***    There is something about a film so bad it makes you laugh, mostly that it probably isn't worth watching and it certainly is not worth buying for more than $5.  Frozen is in that category, it's so incredibly ridiculous that you're left wondering why you sat through to the end and yet your stomach hurts from laughing.      The film has a simple plot: three college students are stuck on a ski lift after they beg the operator for one last run down the mountain.  Why?  Well, the girlfriend wasn't supposed to tag along and crashed the fun \\"Guy Weekend\\" and now feeling guilty they're headed out to try and salvage a day of dealing with the Bunny Hill.      I really wanted to like this movie; I found the entire concept to be really great: stuck alone on a ski lift in freezing temperatures knowing that if you can just hang on a few more days someone will be there to rescue you.  This is one of those stories that could hypothetically happen to anyone, and that's what makes it so chilling.  Instead of going for that creepy feeling of loneliness and playing it to the hilt we're met with the idiotic antics of children.      Now, you can say that young adults really are pretty daft in certain situations, so are adults.  No one is as stupid as these characters.  Jumping off a ski lift without first hanging down from the bars to give you that extra drop of height, jumping feet first, jumping at all when you know it's too high in the first place?  Not army crawling over the wire toward the ladder so that you can climb to safety, the ladder you must know is there because you've been skiing your entire life and using lifts?  Not huddling together for warmth?  Not zipping your jackets up over your face and ears when you know you're getting frostbite?  Taking off your equipment and throwing it at wolves?  Wrapping your bare hand around a metal bar and somehow managing to fall asleep like that?  Peeing in your own snowsuit because you can't be bothered to ask someone to help hold you while you lean over the side of the lift or at least hiking it up / down and peeing through the bars?    Those are just a few of the stellar moments and really they'd be excusable if we aren't presented with the knowledge that the two boys know how to ski / snowboard well enough to go on the hardest of trails and have a lifetime of knowledge about being on a mountain in the snow.  Actually no, throwing things that help keep you warm at wolves far below you thinking that will scare them off is not excusable no matter how distraught you are....    Which brings me to the title of this review: the multicultural wolf pack; was it that hard to actually find a proper pack of wolves?  Is it too difficult to present these animals appropriately?  Or was it not fitting because wolves would never (unless rabid) act the way they do in Frozen?  Seriously, you want me to stomach that wolves are going to go and eat a guy without stalking and harrying him to death.  Then you want me to believe they just hung around and waited so that they could within a 15-24 hour period eat another entire human being?  A bear would wait; a bear would -if hungry enough- have stalked them and eaten more than one full grown human being in a 15-24 hour period.  A bear, even though it would have been hibernation season, would have made a lot more sense than a mixed pack of timber and gray wolves on a human eating binge.    The characters are trite, but they're also very good portrayals of the surface level of a young adult's personality and character flaws.  I could have overlooked a lot of the movie had it ended before the second wolfing (ha!) down of a character and they just froze to death and were found when the resort opened back up.  That would have been really quite fantastic.  Instead our intrepid fools figure out when they should be dehydrated and going through serious pangs and weakness from hunger, how to army crawl over a wire.  Then he is eaten.  Now we're left with the girl, who is vapid, who manages to escape to the road.  I was hopeful at that point, \\"Please let her die right here, let her succumb, it will make her managing to shimmy on her belly past the whacky wolves alright\\" I thought to myself.  Then she was picked up by a car, survives, touching ending where as usual in cinema the girl lives when she should have been one of if not the first one dead, and it was over.      Needless to say it wasn't to my taste; there were too many glaring issues with the plausibility of such a simplistic plot to overlook.  I think Frozen could have been great; it could have been well worth the entire wolf debacle.  Unfortunately something that could have had that simple soul-touching horror of the everyday had a bunch of bunk injected into it and turned into something annoying and at times downright laughable.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|1. Marry The Night - 6/10 I am just not feeling this track, at all. It hits me as too high of expectations for what she hyped it up to be (and what we were expecting with that epic instrumental).<br />2. Born This Way - 7/10 Remarkably, the more I listen to other tracks on the album, the more I like this song. I hated it at first, and it's still not one of my favorites. However, it is so different from anything she's done so far.<br />3. Government Hooker - 8/10 I really like this track a lot, and it's fierceness is nice. Compared to the best dance tracks on the album, though, it's not as good. But it is still amazing in its own right.<br />4. Judas - 9/10 I had to decrease this rating from a 10 because of You and I. But this song is one of my favorite GaGa uptempo song so far. It is good, and it sounds so amazing when you're jamming in the car.<br />5. Americano - 9/10 Other than the awkward introduction, this song is BEAST. It is simply amazing, the mariachi techno beats description was certainly appropriate. Another song to blast in your car.<br />6. Hair - 5/10 Honestly, my least favorite track on the album. I honestly can't believe that RedOne and Gaga made a track I didn't like. The meaning is contrived and honestly it sounds like something Miley would sing.<br />7. Scheisse - 10/10 Now THIS SONG IS FIERCE. Easily one of the best on the album. The pulsating dance beats put you in a trance, and you wanna stay that way.<br />8. Bloody Mary - 9.5/10 Now THI S ROCKS. The instrumentation is my favorite she's done. It sounds so...epic. I absolutely adore it.<br />9. Black Jesus / Amen Fashion - 8/10 - Based on the title I thought that I was going to hate it, but I actually enjoy it a lot and get the message behind it. Definitely one of the stronger bonus tracks.<br />10. Bad Kids - 8.5/10 Definitely a hard track, and really interesting and epic. The intro is amazing, and so is the chorus.<br />11. Fashion of His Love - 8/10 I loved the \\"Then You Love Me\\" shoutout in the song, it was a nice treat for the little monsters.<br />12. Road to Love) 7.5/10 - Not really memorable to me, but a good song nonetheless.<br />13. Heavy Metal Lovers 8/10 - Fierce fierce track. Just hot.<br />14. Electric Chapel - 9/10 Yet again she is slaying me with these instrumentals. They are so on point and key parts of the song. I love the eerie feeling of this song.<br />15. The Queen 8.5/10 Prolly one of the best bonus tracks, I love the meaning behind it and the PIANOOOO<br />16. You and I 11/10 Honestly, this is her best song to date. She will find it very hard to top herself with this. I do believe that the song did give me chills when she first performed it in June last year, but she is doing the same thing EVERY time I listen to it.<br />17. The Edge of Glory - 10/10 A Perfect Pop track. What more do you need?<br /><br />The album leaves little to be desired. The thematic direction and creative and artistic output present on the album more than compensates for the occasional weak track. Notice how I use the word \\"weak\\". That is simply because there are no BAD songs on this album and when you get right down to it, that's what matters the most.<br /><br />5/5ittle monsters.  12.

0385341008|4.0|I used this with second semester seniors at the high school where I teach.  Even after the Advanced Placement exam was behind us, the students still stayed focused.  Both the story and the way that it is told through letters really reaches out to readers.  Admittedly the girls in my class seemed more engaged than the boys, but even some of the guys enjoyed reading the letters aloud during class. I cannot think of a better way to learn some history.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP IT WAS ON ANDROID MARKET BUT IT IS NOW GONE BUT I'M GLAD IT WAS ON HERE
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Gaga delivers. You can see her handwriting on every single piece of this album - if that's what you wanted to hear than please buy this album and rock on!
B0051QJ83S|1.0|Purchased the album for 99¢ and got what I paid for, two songs and the digital booklet. Don't know what happened, but Amazon needs to fix this glitch fast and soon.
0060989157|5.0|If you like the music, you'll love the book.  If you don't like the music, you'll like it even less...but you'll still love the book.  This phenomenal read is not at all for the faint of heart.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This album is awesome.  Another great job to our Mother Monster.  From another cool Nebraska guy.      -Thalisman
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great test of Amazon's new cloud service... unfortunately, at Lady Gaga's expense.  The music is great.  Go ahead and download and be patient while Amazon fixes the downloads.  99 cents for an album of any quality is amazing... for Born this Way, it's the deal of the century so I can forgive Amazon for not being able to enjoy it all right away.  Worth waiting for!
0879309210|5.0|As a newbie to guitar set up and repair, this book is a must have. It helped in tools, procedures, examples, and useful alternatives in each category. The DVD was an added plus. I am working on my first acoustic repair with great results so far. Plus with Amazon it was shipped quickly, at the best price.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Get some hot pepper spiced gin in an ice cold glass.  Drink it, pour it in your ears, it burns like fire either way.  This is the effect of Gaga's latest fantasy world--hot, infectious, degenerate, rebellious.  Gaga lights the disc up with synths, pounding beats, and that something that her imitators do not have--her voice.  She constantly impresses me with the power of her vocals--she has all the talent that you could hope for, and she uses it to light up the dance floor.  This album is a little harder than the last, but not in a way that should put off any of her fans, just make them dance harder.  If you need a new companion to your workouts, or something to sing too loudly in the car on a road trip, this album will fit the bill nicely.  Great danceable pop by a master provocateur.  \\"Americano\\" is a delightful side of infectious dance--\\"I met a girl in East L.A., in floral shorts, as sweet as May...we fell in love, but not in court\\" Gaga sings, inviting us all to sing along, dance along, and the tune is impossible to get out of your mind.  As a bonus, the song is sung in a hybrid of Spanish and English, as catchy as anything you will hear this year.  \\"We don't care what people say, we know the truth\\" she declares brashly in the opening of \\"Bad Kids\\"...\\"Don't be insecure if your heart is pure, you're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby\\"  seems like a ray of hope in a season of uncontrolled misundertanding and pain; the lyrics are a heart breaking indictment of family gone awry, hinting at a deeper pain that may be show, may be pathos, may be real.  With Gaga, it is hard to know what is real, what is a pose, and in the end, as long as it speaks to you, I suppose it doesn't matter.  In one of the most ironic lines sung with a straight face by anyone in recent memory, she sings \\"I'm not that cool and you hate me\\" (ha) sings to the insecure teenager in all of us.  The fact that it is wrapped up in such a catchy package is fantastic.    I love this album already, and am certain that it will be burning up my speakers all summer long.  It wouldn't surprise me, based even on my limited first listens, is that this may very well keep a space on my ipod for a long time to come.
0307454541|4.0|The book was a little worn and had some writing in it, but overall good quality.  The shipment was quick and was received within the given time frame.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|this is terrible, for a company like amazon to make such an offer, you would expect it to work, i have only been able to download two songs, and have many errors connecting. If this does not work, I will be a penny pincher and demand a refund.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I not even a Lady Gaga fan (I kinda hate her music, honestly), but for 99 cents, who can resist?  1 problem.  Where's the digital booklet, most of this woman's success is attributed to her crazy imagery.  It's still worth it, but a little disappointed.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|`Unstoppable' is a film that is so gripping and exciting that it will have you on the edge of your seat for much of the duration.<br /><br />Inspired by true events this film follows Frank Barnes and Will Colson as they attempt to stop a runaway train in Pennsylvania.  When a set of unlucky circumstances come together and a train is left without an engineer, carrying a highly flammable, toxic load, into a highly populated area at great speed, it will take great bravery and forward thinking to stop it.  Fortunately you get exactly these attributes in Frank and Will.<br /><br />Washington (as Frank) is as good as we have come to expect and Chris Pine plays the roll of Will very well indeed.  There are other excellent performances, most notably from Rosario Dawson as a railway despatcher clearing the line and giving advice.<br /><br />This is a relatively short film at around 98 minutes, but it kept me hooked and jittery throughout.  There is something about a runaway train that makes you very nervous.  The extra elements of the flammable cargo and the fact this is based on true events make it all the more potent.<br /><br />This is well scripted, directed and acted and made for one exciting and compelling film and I recommend it highly indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|14 Songs for $0.99, awesome. Not sure how I feel about all the songs, but when the album is only 99 cents, how can I complain that much. 5 stars.  Thanks.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|There are a few cheesy songs on here, like Born This Way, Hair and the Unicorn song, but there are also some real bangers like Scheiße, Gov't Hooker, etc.  Gaga is very creative and this is an interesting album.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|This album perfectly mixes techno, industrial, rock, and electronic dance pop music with heavy 80's and 90's influences. Their are great guest artists on this record including Clarence Clemons who plays sax perfectly in \\"Edge of Glory\\" and \\"Hair.\\" Guitarist from queen sets in on Gaga's song \\"You and I.\\" The songs are a different step for Gaga with (at times cheesy) but more meaningful lyrics. Some songs are comedic and theatrical like Bloody Mary which is a spooky pop record and \\"Americano\\" which is a Mexican inspired dance track about gay marriage and involves her in a lesbian relationship with a girl in east LA. Some songs are inspirational like \\"Born This Way\\" which gives a shot out to the gay community who she loves and respects. \\"Schieße\\" is a German inspired acid house dance track with European flair, this is my favorite track on the album. Some filler songs for me are \\"Bad Kids\\" and \\"The Queen.\\" \\"Fashion of His Love\\" is a callout to the great music of the late 80's and gives a mention to the late McQueen who designed Gaga outfits in some of her videos and performances, overall a very fun song. The album closes with an emotional but upbeat song with great lyrics and a great inspirational melody with \\"Edge of Glory\\" which is a great album closer. I highly recommend buying this album, it is great to dance too :) and Gaga continues to grow as an artist and she really cares about her fans.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|After the disappointment of the Born This Way and Judas singles I must admit I was worried about how this album was going to turn out. Had Gaga lost her magic?   I'm delighted to say that those two tracks are the weakest songs on the album and every other track is 5* classic pop.   Memorable choruses, pristine production values and so many magical moments I had to listen to the whole album twice just to really start to process how great this album really is.  It would be unfair to pick out highlights because there arejust so many, I only skipped Born This Way and Judas (sorry but I just don't think I can ever like these two).  True Gaga fans need to buy the deluxe version as the 3 extra tracks you get are absolutely awesome and should really be on the regular version too. Black Jesus alone is worth the price of an upgrade.   This is one relieved Gaga fan, can't wait to see these songs being played live on the next tour.  Is this the album of the decade? I thought following up The Fame was a tall order but she pulled it off. Go gaga go!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lady Gaga has done it again by making a great album. When Lady Gaga first came out, I didn't know what to think of her but then my friend let me listen to The Fame Monster and I was hooked. This album really shows her diversity when making albums. She released the song Judas off of this album and she became even more controversial then she already was but that doesn't replace the fact that she is a great artist. She makes deep music that really allows her to express herself. My favorite song off of this album is probably You and I. I really recommend everyone sit down and really listen to each song because I guarantee that you will fall in love with how she is able to express herself so beautifully. Though people say she is a Madonna rip-off, I say that is a good thing. Madonna is a music icon and Lady Gaga is following in her footsteps. Just give her a chance and you will be pleasently surprised on how she can affect you emotionally. Deep and emotionally attached is the making of a great album. I definitely recommend this album to everyone.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Currently keeping my amd 965 Black Edition Cool on a slight overclock of 3.8ghz average temp at load 44c in an air conditioned room. 49c in a heated room. Idles at 29c. while overclocked. Not overclocked, and with cool and quiet enabled idles at 23c and under load ,3.4ghz, around 38c.  The max safe operating temp of the 965be is 62c. Was  approching 60c while overclocked on the stock heatsink and fan. Im a heavy gamer so this is running under load constantly. The only drawback i can find is that it is easier to install, even if you have a cutout for your motherboard backplate, by taking the mb out of the case. But it is well worth it. It is huge so make sure you have the room in your case to install this. It cleared the plexiglass side of my antec 600 case by about 3/8 of an inch. Looks real nice in there too. Oh yeah these spec are with using only 1 fan in a push configuration out the top of my case though the 200mm fan. Heat dows travel up. adding the second optional fan for the pull would lower the temps even more. I am sure.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have nothing at all bad to say about this app. It does exactly what it says it does, and it does it with a minimal amount of fuss. Highly recommended, if you're needing to download YouTube videos.
B004RC8NXI|4.0|I did not know what to expect from this film, however I blind bought it and I'm glad I did. Based on the title I thought it might be more sexual than it was, like Love and Other Drugs where there were naked people everywhere. No Strings Attached was simpler and really focused on the two main characters and their friendship/relationship. It was very funny at times yet had its serous moments. I am not an Ashton Kutcher fan at all. I think he is really annoying, however he did well in this role and meshed well with Natalie Portman. Kevin Kline plays Ashton's father in the film and he was hilarious, one of my favorite funny actors. All of the actors did well and pulled their weight through the film. Over-all the entire movie was quite enjoyable and entertaining. There were some slower parts however they were very minimal.<br /><br />The picture quality is perfect. I didn't notice any video issues or graininess or anything. The audio is also great. There was mostly just dialogue throughout the film, however there were some times with loud music playing in the background and it sounded great. Clean and crisp PQ & AQ.<br /><br />Extras were basic, nothing out of the ordinary.<br /><br />All in all it was a great blind purchase for me. I will watch this movie again and again and I am happy to add it to my collection.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This album really does contain snippets of every kind of style.  It takes a steady ear, but it pays off.  Try two listenings.  When told that Gertrude Stein did not like his portrait of her, Picasso replied, \\"She will.\\"  One of my favorites is Bloody Mary, in which she reveals perhaps the true message of the album: \\"And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you.\\"
B004S699HC|3.0|I greatly enjoyed the first 2 Crow films. Since it seems to be quite difficult to find a region free version of The Crow, I thought I would start with The Crow: City of Angles. As far as the actual movie goes it is not as good as the first. However it does have a decent story which keeps you interested. The ending is a bit of a let down in my opinion, however still a great flick which I am happy to have in my collection.<br /><br />The PQ and AQ are nothing amazing however the PQ was much better than I expected based off of some of the reviews I had been hearing. I was quite impressed with the clarity of such a low budget older film. The detail isn't enough to blow you away, however there are some great closeups of the characters faces which look great.<br /><br />Over-all it is well worth the $10 and fans of the films should not hesitate for a second.
B004XUD762|5.0|'Song Remains Not The Same' by the talented metal band Black Label Society. First 4 tracks are from the unplugged sessions & the remaining 6 being the sessions additional material. This CD opens with \\"Overlord\\" : great drumkit sound & vocals creating a great rock track. Other great tracks include \\"Parade Of The Dead\\" (a slow ballad track, great piano & vocals), \\"Riders Of The Damned\\" (great rock sound), \\"Junior's Eyes\\" (a slow track with incredible vocals reminiscent of Axl Rose of Guns 'n Roses), \\"Helpless\\" (another slow track with beautiful orchestral base track & great vocals), \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" (a Simon & Garfunkel cover, great violin/guitar/keyboard combination & vocals), \\"Darkest Days\\" (album version featuring John Rich) & \\"The First Noel\\" (beautiful guitar string pick-ups & orchestral base track). Solid track/gems/stand-outs include \\"Darkest Days\\" (unplugged version, wonderful orchestral base track, great guitar string pick-ups & vocals) & \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" (beautiful melody & great violin/keyboard combination). On overall, this is a great compilation (well sort after wonderful unplugged & sessional music material put together by Zakk), a highly recommended CD listening.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love the Rocky Collection. I'm biased though because  I grew up watching Rocky movies. PQ great for all of the movies.  It looks better than DVD. Its not the best blue-ray I seen, but   it wiil do just fine.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Wow, after reading the lyrics in the digital booklet I cannot find anything commendable about this album. It's Gaga, so I didn't expect it to be \\"uplifting\\" per se, I just didn't expect it to be this bad. I wish I could say there was at least one song I liked to justify the 99 cents, but at least it's only a buck down the drain. Can't be too disappointed over a wasted dollar.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Lady Gaga sucks. 99 cents is still too much for this album, especially when you take into account that every \\"sale\\" boosts her ranking in the charts.
B001N9ESQ4|1.0|Before Sunrise, when it breaks down to it's base information, is a one-night-stand.     Before Sunset is about cheating on your spouse.     If this is supposed to be romantic, it is something that highlights love as a feeling, a connection to another person, etc... and while that is part of love, it is only a small part. The much greater, much deeper love, is when you commit your life to caring about someone, their wants and desires, above your own. When you are no longer the most important person, but the one you love is.     In these movies, both of them are just selfishly pursuing what makes them feel good. They do not love each other. It is sad. I wish they would make a movie that shows the actual result of what their relationship would be... they will end up miserable, because they are both romanticizing who the other person is. When the butterfly feelings wear off, and you have hard times... what do you do? When the other person fails you at some point, because they will... what do you do?     This movie isn't good, because it is taking a false idea of love, and making it seem appealing and attractive. This is easy to do in a short movie, but far far from reality. And LOVE is real. It is not an idea that is unattainable.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I purchased this album but NOT A SINGLE SONG HAS DOWNLOADED.  If Amazon intended on giving Gaga fans a deal like this, they should have fraking been ready to GIVE HER FANS WHAT THEY PURCHASED.  This is one of the most disappointing experiences I have ever had on Amazon.com
B003UD7JEE|5.0|This show is action packed awesomeness. Nikita 2010 blasted onto the screen and took me by surprise. As a previous viewer of LFN I was a skeptic. Well skepticism has a new name Legendary.    Maggie Q as Nikita is amazing, from her fantastic martial art skills (which she is so humble about) to the captivating emotion of Nikita's life inside and out of Division while she is rogue.  Shane West as the stoic Division agent Michael has brought new levels this character never had before. West expresses the deep emotions his complex character is feeling with one look.   Lysdny Fonseca plays the tortured Alexandra Udivof with such a heart wrenching story you would swear she was Anastasia.    The cast as a whole (mention to) Melinda Clarke, Aaron Standford, Xander Berkley - great.   Melinda plays the chilling and sinister Amanda nicknamed 'The Inquisitor'  Aaron Standford is the surly and newly improved 2010 Birkhoff or 'nerd' as Nikita calls him, his wit and mannerisms make you crave the whole ensemble of the cast!  Xander Berkely the head of Division, Percy, with little regard for human life and much for power and control.    This season was an amazing start and is only the beginning.    Only improvement (but this could also be a device done to maintain mystery)- the audience needs more on Nikita, Division and her life before it and DURING it!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I loved this video. It was very well put together and I wish that I had been there for the actual event. This made me feel like I had the best seat in the house and I could't stop thinking about it for weeks after I watched it.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|This album took quite a long time to download. Eventually, it all came through & all 14 songs work as promised. Folks line up all day for free music.
B004BBDHEK|4.0|Yanni returns with a new  (mostly) instrumental record. I am enjoying this CD that reflects his early 1990s recordings.
1442337966|5.0|This is a great product. It has helped me to look at the obsticles in my life in different ways so that I can truely enjoy everyday.  Sometimes all it takes is a new thought and a little help from others.  This is a great CD.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Alien is one of the mos terrifying films of all time. It is clostrophobic, suspensful, and keeps even a multiple time viewer on the edge of their seat. The set decoration is absolutely magnificent. The cast is perfect. The music is beautful. The creature's design is not of this world. Alien is one of the greatest creature films to ever be created. It ranks at the very top along with King Kong, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and The Wolf Man among the greatest science fiction horror creature films ever created.    Aliens is a high energ level sequel that ups the anty in every way. You have an army of aliens, being given birth to by...____. There is plot on top of plot featuring Burk, Ripley, and all the other characters in the film. Stan Winston created amazing looking creatures in this high energy action packed adventurious sequel to the amazing original terrifying science fiction classic.    Alien 3 finds Ripley on a maximum security prison planet along with murderers and rapists. Of course the predators become the prey as the tables are turned on these violent criminals when an alien finds its way onto their planet. There are two destinctively different versions of this film. They are like watching two different films entirely and are both amazing films, but for different reasons.    Alien Resurrection is probably the weak link of this franchise. Frankly every franchise has to have a \\"worst of them all,\\" and this film is it, but that doesn't mean it is a bad film by any stretch of the imagionation. That just simply means it is not as good as the first three. However, the evolution of the creatures is fantastic. They can learn more and do things they could never do before. This is a fun filled exciting film filled with social commentary on genetic cloning and fun action packed chase sequences.    Fox put a lot of work into this release. The picture quality on each and every film and every version (including the work print edition of Alien 3) all look so good, it was like they were made yesterday. The ultra amazing sound allows one to turn up their 5.1 surround sound systems and blow the walls off of ther houses. This box set is also cram packed with over 60 hours of extra features, including online interactive features that can keep one busy for over a year after purchase.    The Alien Anthology Blu-Ray bo set is absolutely THE greatest Blu-Ray product released to date bar none.
076115728X|5.0|I adore this book, it's also one of my daughters favorites! Accidents happens and to see the beauty instead of getting upset is such a great concept!
B004YF6MHW|1.0|Camera Zoom FX is a waste of money.  It doesn't work.  It seems to be just advertising.  The functions do not work at all on the Nexus S 4G.  I was at a Josh Grobin concert last night when I downloaded it.  I was hoping to zoom in and take pictures.  It definetly has no zoom properties at all even though it is called ZOOM FX and the other functions didn't work either.  I was disappointed I paid for something that doesn't work and I uninstalled it immediately.  I hope I get a refund or I will be less likely to buy any more android apps.  This was my first purchase.  All the other apps were free!
B004NJW976|5.0|Can get enough of  the amazing Inyang Bassey  on the 4 tracks of Destroyed -  Rockets, Right Thing, Victoria Lucas & After.     Bassey is  the only reason I bought this album....oh and Moby also
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Had no trouble getting every song. Did the one click to order the cd. And less than 10 seconds I was streaming it from my Droid. Amazon MP3 store is leaps and bounds better than iTunes. I think I've been converted.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|The album is different from Fame in a good way.  We all had gotten use to her sound and she didn't take her fan base for granted and just redo her past success.  This  album gets better with each listen and the insane price of .99 cents is crazy!  Born this way is sorta like an Ars Poetica and it's a full of all her influences smashing together to make on thing.  This is probably more about her then her last effort.  Enjoy.  Or don't and avoid, it's a free country : )
1582701709|1.0|For some reason I couldn't make any sense of this book.  It quickly gave me a headache and I had to stop reading.  Even thinking about this book makes my brain feel all twisted up.  I've noticed manipulative people tend to put a lot of emotional energy behind vague and confusing words and I think that may be what's going on with this book.
B0016OOS16|5.0|In days gone by the 3D mouse ( when I used to work on my SGI reality engine ) this was an expensive luxury item I dismissed as a gimmic.<br />Now that they are far less expensive and support is pretty much universal ( in applicable apps, I use ( lightwave ) LW10 and LW core, I van see what I have been missing!<br /><br />Must have for the 3D artist.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Full albums typically release on Tuesdays. Stop complaining that you are going to get the full album tomorrow for $0.99.
B004N66XYE|4.0|While this was no competition for the recent hit Downton Abbey(watch it!!!), it was certainly well acted and stunningly filmed. I loved the costumes, and seeing familiar faces like Keeley Hawes(Spooks) and Eileen Atkins. I hope they will be making a second series, because three episodes was not enough!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Took over 2 hours to download the songs due to the technical error from Amazon, but for only 99 cents for the whole album it was worth it! Great deal!
B004JN1D2I|2.0|Can't understand why the Kindle version of this series warrents such a high price?  The paperback collection is WAY less than that, but I happen to enjoy my books on my phone via the Kindle app.  Wanted to order the four books together, but looks like I'll pass.  It's a shame that Amazon feels the need to gouge their kindle readers with this outragious pricing...
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I just purchased the Lady Gaga album & got charged but it didn't download! I will have to stick with i-tunes!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I was concerned about getting this because of all the technical issues that people described, but although it may be a little on the slow side, (and I can appreciate that, given the millions of people that must be downloading at this price) it is definitely worth the wait.  I have about 7 songs in 45 minutes, and it is still going at a resonable pace. The songs I have played so far are amazing, the audio is superb.  This is a great deal!
0380713802|5.0|You will laugh so hard you will embarrass yourself.  Bill Bryson is the best.  His experiences with the strange behavior of Europeans just brings me back to my days as a student abroad.  This book, like all of Bryson's, is meant for the English-speaking public.  I can't imagine it would translate.  His prose is desperately funny.  I think this one is my favorite.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I bought this album today.  Amazon took my 99 cents, but gave me nothing.  It said I'd already downloaded, but I hadn't downloaded anything.  I called customer service who reset my downloads.  But nothing will download.  DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM or you will get ripped-off by Amazon too.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is my first bought Gaga album. She definitely delivered. I can hear rock elements (my fave genre) and 80's beats. Completely obsessed with most of the album. I recommend this to any genre music lover. It doesn't disappoint.
B000KIPT30|4.0|Exactly what I expected for a headphone amp at this price. I have used it for recording and for live gigs. Works as expected.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|This case makes it easier to keep up with your headset.  The clip-on is a great feature.  Women can clip it on to their person or purse.  No more searching down in the bottomless bag known as our purse.  Even though I returned the PRO headset, I kept the case and I am using it with a different Plantronics Headset.  Great value for the price.
0316056863|3.0|I got this book from the library hoping to be entertained by a funny read. While there was some humor in the book I was mostly bored. After about 50 pages I quit reading because of all the f words. I felt like I was reading a book by a gay rights activist not a comedian.
B004QPOVF0|4.0|Way too many edits  almost get seasick    Why does the band want or allow this?   A real disapointment   I saw the tour live at Madison Square Garden from up high but dead center   much better with just that one view
B0051QIGP4|5.0|After seeing the deal, previewing the music, and reading the reviews with problems, I've come to two conclusions:    1) The new album is definitely different, and I while I don't think it's quite as strong of a showing, it's still solid - especially for $0.99!    2) Amazon needs to moderate comments/ratings when there are known technical issues on their end!  People should not be allowed to give 1 star ratings on a product simply because of issues on Amazon's end; That does not contribute to the product rating in any way.    *EDIT* 5/23/11  1 PM EST I should also clarify that I have purchased the album, and have so far only received 6 items as well.  6 PM EST - Just received order confirmation receipt email, so things are slowly moving ahead, just have patience people.  5/24/11  Have received all files, as expected.  Will updated with further album review once I can listen all the way thru.    5/25/11 - Full Album Review  After listening thru the whole album, I have to say I like it better than I did from just listening to the samples.  Overall it comes across as another successful adventure in new sounds and song styles, and has a distinct sound that separates it from The Fame/Fame Monster.  There don't seem to be as many stand-out songs at first pass, but it may grow on me the more I listen.  I will revise my review if I change my mind along the way.    The album has a very 'big' sound, is somewhat whimsical at times, and covers a whole range of styles:  Upbeat club/pop; Driving, darker electro beats; 80's synth-pop; Even a Ballad thrown into the mix (You and I) - This one almost has a country sound to it    I am keeping my original star rating for the album, as I feel that artistically it deserves 5 stars.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|All i have to say is this album is amazing she has done it again bigger and better. Writing her own music creative genius like no other singer out there. You see why a lot of other artist are trying to copy off of her.  Buy this album now if you have not<br /><br />Way better then britney which every song sounds the same and very very auto tuned not for gaga though!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|The ratings on the album may be skewed only because Amazon couldn't keep up with all the traffic; so, don't let a low rating scare you.  It's not the album that most 1-star raters have commented on... it's the inability to download the complete album as a result of spotty service.  The album itself, in its entirety, is fantastic.  Even if you're only a mild Gaga fan, for the .99 cent sale, there's bound to be something on here you'll love.  My favorites: Marry the Night and Edge of Glory.<br /><br />As for the server delays at Amazon, run a Google search on the sale and you'll find it's already hit the news.  For 1-star posters, please update your rating after the full download... it's not Amazon you're rating, it's Gaga.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|With her latest album, Lady Gaga is once again revolutionizing pop music. Born This Way is an amazing album, and is both unique and complex. Without a doubt, compared of all her albums, this is Lady Gaga's most different album. The style of the majority songs are not what many expect from an artist like Gaga or from other artists. Because of this, all of the songs on this album are unique and fresh and extremely interesting to listen to, something very hard to find in many modern albums. Additionally, the variety of the genres and styles of songs on Born This Way also contribute to the album's uniqueness.    While listening to the album, I realized that all of the songs are very intricate and complex. Beside being well made and produced, each song on the album has a deeper message than what is heard. If you think the songs on this album are just like the many other songs about the usual topics such as love, drugs, or sex, you are wrong. Force yourself to look beyond the surface of Gaga's songs on this album. For example, \\"Hair\\" is a song about one's hairstyle as a way to express their identity and freedom, \\"Judas\\" is a metaphor for facing one's past and forgiveness, \\"Born This Way\\" is a song about everyone having the potential to be great and to achieve many things in life, regardless of sex, race, sexual orientation, etc., and \\"Americano\\" describes Gaga's disapproval about unjust immigration laws in the United States.    In conclusion, I rated this album five stars, because it deserves each and every one of the stars. Many of the songs on this album are pleasing to listen to, while some are great for dancing to, and others can uplift spirits when you're down. Due to the variety of  songs found on this album, I suggest listening to every one of the songs on this album. There is a good chance you'll like at least one of the songs. In my opinion, Lady Gaga's genuineness and dedication as an artist is clearly evident in this album.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This was instantly transferred to my Amazon Cloud drive (which I've never used before) and I found out I can access it on my phone as well. I'm going to have to burn this on a CD to use in my car, but on the whole, 99 cents for an entire album with instant access is an absolute steal - thank you Amazon!
B003Y5H55G|5.0|Anyone with a functioning sci-fi funny-bone will get a big buzz from this movie.  Start with a basic road-trip plot that's not far off \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" (it's the RV, duh). Mix in the naughty bits from \\"Men In Black,\\" \\"Invaders from Mars\\" (1953 & 1986), \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\\" and dozens of other aliens-among-us classics.  You really have to be a compulsively critical party-pooper to not like this flick. Here's a clue: it's NOT HIGH ART, it's just a heart-warming tale of a trash-talking alien's journey among us confused Earthlings on the way back to his home planet. Foul-language alert: the \\"Paul\\" characters can cuss better than any of y'all. Also, this movie is basically a happily-ever-after confection, without any gore -- sorry.
B004IK30S2|4.0|This is a good movie and the transfer looks great, but by default it starts with the commentary track running. We didn't know what was happening. You must stop the movie and then start it again making sure that the audio is set with the commentary off.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|is what matters. We're getting an album, by an awesome artist, for $.99. Lady Gaga isn't even my usual cup o' tea, but I sometimes need some get up and go music - and she gets me up! Plus... her care for her causes rock.    Now, as to the tech issues... hrm, a slow download for $.99. Have you ever... had a problem with something that costs $.99 before? A bad cup of coffee (which probably cost more than that)? A million other things you've wasted money on?    Please stop spoiling the page of an artist because you're too impatient, or \\"thrifty\\" to deal with a slow download of an *entire* album that cost you $.99.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|SG-1 did 10 seasons. SG: Atlantis made it to 5 seasons and it was more of a continuation of the the SG-1 format! If they tried that again they would have been lucky getting anything more than the pilot.<br /><br />See the pattern here?<br /><br />The writers decided to make a bold move and do something radically different so they went ultra hardcore. And why not? The old format wasn't working anymore and the writing was on the wall, clear as day.<br /><br />How can you call yourself a true Stargate fan when you get a top-notch serious SG show, and you hate it. I dont get you haters. Perhaps you prefer the more popular nonsense on that damn channel like \\"Sharktopus vs. Gatoroid\\". Or do you prefer baby oiled men, in underwear, rubbing up against eachother. You haters disgust me and dont let me catch you in the street because you got lumps and bumbs comming! Frak you haters and frak the SyFy channel! Im done watching....
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I can't complain. I already had the Amazon Cloud Player installed from previously purchased MP3s. By the time it took me to open the Cloud Player after I purchased this MP3 album, all of the songs were already installed and ready to play.  Another great bargain from Amazon.  If you want to build up a classical music library, try their classical album downloads for the best bargains anywhere.
B004Q9T4E4|2.0|Though the title clearly suggests the writers intention to glorify the West, I was expecting a better and more balanced analysis on this subject.    The writer is British but seems completely obssessed with China/ Japan and Europe/ America, as if other nations do not exist. India, which was a former British colony gets only a passing reference and that too totally in the negative. It seems that what is happening/ happened in India and South Asia is either contrary to his beliefs or do not seem important. This region (South Asia) along with China is poised to dominate the 21st century but no such trends emerge from his analysis. Even, Turkey, South Korea and Incas/ Mayans got better coverage.    It seems that the writer is convinced that the Western ideology will continue to dominate in perpetuity even if the Western nations decline. Countries who do not subscribe wholly to the Western concept (like India where ethnic clothing and religion other than Christianity are still widely followed)are best ignored.    Some of the facts and figures quoted by the author and its presentation was good to start with but the reader will lose track once (s)he sees the graphs, which are not distinguishable in black and white print.     Over all I believe that the book is below average and I have read better and more balanced analysis before.
0553582038|3.0|Was so looking forward to reading this, after the first three. Can't say I was disappointed, but was not pleased with the results. What happened to Robb making Jon his heir and now Jon is Lord Commander? Didn't catch that one, oh well. Bring on number 5 and my girl Dany! Hope the Imp is back as well and repaying his Lannister debts! (Liking the HBO series, not to shabby.)

B004K4AVAG|1.0|the upside of this misfire of an album is that she is actually trying. points for an attempt at originality...what mainstream pop artist uses scarification as a gimmick?    I am almost speechless while listening to this. Lady Gaga, say what you will about her, is exciting. It could be for all the wrong reasons but this woman knows how to create a buzz about herself. But this album is so beyond anything typically mediocre...it is an utter slap in the face to the listener. It's attempts at shock value ring entirely false...the second single judas manages to be both dull with its forced attempt at controversy, and its blaring and unpleasant beat. The song isn't even fun as a bad pop record. If she was going for pop art she fails on both counts. Born This Way has some spark to it in parts but while the sound of the record itself is in your face, the song itself lacks lasting appeal and won't be that iconic moment gaga was so clearly planning. One listen to Hair and it's clear what gaga target audience is: depressed a.d.d. ridden 11 year olds.    Slight highlights halt the blood letting. Kids is a bit cute though it's just another insincere pose and thus comes of as condescending. Bloody Mary has a bit of melancholy to it and a hint of italo disco.    With this album, you are astonished by what will pass as creativity these days. It's just a dull record...the thematic elements fail to be compelling due to her simply not branching out on them. Madonna was an artist that always courted controversy, but she was always able to walk the walk and create a superb album as well. Madonna always had fun. This album isn't fun...it's just preachy. It's not something you want to dance to, it's more like filth you have to wade through.     This album is self indulgent to the point of sheer torture.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I had 7 right away, then a few minutes later I refreshed and had 9 but I'm still missing 5 of the songs, they are grayed out at the moment.  At least let me enjoy my impulse buy immediately!
B0051QJ83S|4.0|Love the ecstatic/religious tone of this album.  Lady Gaga delivers lots of dancey tunes, but manages to slip her politics in between the beats.  Monster on!
B00006DEFA|5.0|Quite surprised by the extra scenes. One really explained something that was left in the movie that always confused me.
0307272702|5.0|This book delivers the science of fat regulation written for a non-scientist.  It presents a convincing case that low-calorie diets and exercise will not work, but low-carbohydrate diets can work.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Very excited about it being only .99...but only 4 of the songs have shown up so far...the rest of the album is grayed out??
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I have purchased music from Amazon in the past and have had no problems. With this being the lauch of the album and the promotion that has been done for it... I wish Amazon would have been better prepared for the flood of people buying the new Lady Gaga at this incredible price. I am sure the latency in all of us downloading the music will be cleared up, but I did expect a much better experience.
0545265355|4.0|I've heard a lot about these books and was curious.  Its targeted for young adults, but as a 30something, I thoroughly enjoyed them too!  Quick, easy read.  I flew through the books in less than a week.  Having read the other reviews, I didn't know that a similar book, Battle Royale, was of same content and written in Japan several years ago.  Battle Royale was very, very good and I recommend reading that book if you like the Hunger Games.    Essentially both books are about a bunch of kids being selected by their oppressive governments to kill each other \\"Survior\\" style.  Very Lord of the Flies like.  The Hunger Games trilogy is interesting and entertaining, and in the end gratifying to me.
B003UESJF6|4.0|A GOOD PICTURE FOR THE FAMILY. I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.  WE SAW THE CHANGE FROM VILLIAM TO HERO.  ITS TOUCHING. ES UNA BUENA PELICULA PARA LA FAMILIA. VIMOS EL CAMBIO DE VILLANO A HEROE.  CONMUEVE.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Kept force closing on my LG Apex. Thank you to whoever posted the work around thru the YouTube app. Now it works great.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I revise my one star rating, which was of Amazon's service and not the album, which is very good.  I also forgive Amazon's initial delay since they sold me this album for $0.99.  Good deal, good album!  Love my gaga
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Takes a minute to let it all soak in. But overall, I really like the new album. Lady Gaga is a very talented musician who's always pushing the limits and isn't afraid to take a chance.
0345509617|5.0|This book is well worth the money. It's filled with many colorful photos ranging from concept sketches, to behind the scenes photos, to George Lucas's own notes on the movie. It shows the many drafts the script went through, as well as a transcribed piece of the workings of the Cloud City Carbon Freezing scene. There's not much I can say badly about this book. It really completes the craving for inside trivia I have, and is perfect for any movie buff.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|First off, I really wish people would stop giving 1 star reviews because they cannot download the album. It's really annoying because it makes the album look bad. It's Amazon you need to review not GaGa.  That said, I love this album. I was a little nervous because I didn't know what to expect. Favorite song has to be Heavy Metal Lover. It's flawless. Other favorites included Government Hooker, Bloody Mary, Americano, You and I, Bad Kids..I guess I primarily just love the album for being fresh and a different vibe from Fame Monster/Fame. I'm a proud little monster, and I'm raving.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is a beautiful, spirited adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. The only other adaptation of this book I had seen previously was the Gwyneth Paltrow version (and Clueless!), and although I liked that film, this one far surpasses it, in my opinion. The costumes and sets are beautiful, as well as the cast! Some reviewers have mentioned Romola Garai's modern mannerisms in the film, like flopping down on the bed and what not. First, I don't think there's any reason to believe that people did not act like that when they were alone. I also think that these sorts of moments with Emma allow us modern viewers to connect to the character and the time period more easily.     Finally, the dvd case is beautiful as well. It opens like a book, with the cover resembling and feeling like that of a hardcover.    If you are a fan of Jane Austen, period dramas, or both, then I highly recommend this dvd.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Rob Reiner (the director) has done a beautiful job of capturing many things: an amazing era, adventure, serious-ness, and friendship. It is definitely a cult classic of the 1980's, and I highly suggest everyone watch it. All of the young actors come across so pure and wonderful - making it an easy watch, even though they are each battling their own wars with themselves, parents, and eachother at times.     One of my all time favorite movies.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I purchased this cd and love it. It takes time to appear on cloud drive. Song by song. Just hold your horses it will be there. This is a great deal.    Edit: I really did buy from amazon. I didn't see a link to get verified purchase.

B004K4AUZW|1.0|Yes, I'm disappointed. I think Gaga's problem was she rushed this album. Alot of great ideas, but the poor girl didn't have time enough to execute them the right way. This is my breakdown.    1. Marry the Night-Ohh, I like this one a lot. The chorus is rad. But...there is something missing to this song. I feel like it's not \\"finished.\\" Could've been a hit if Gaga added an extra special element to it.    2.Born this Way-No. This is bad. What in the world was Gaga thinking when she recorded this? The better question, why didn't her team tell her this apes \\"Express Yourself?\\" So many questions, no answers. Bottom line, this song sucks.    3.Government Hooker- This is what I'm talking about. It's like I'm being transported to a London hipster club, circa 1991. The beat is sick. The bridge will be stuck in your head forever. My favorite off the entire album.    4.Judas-Oh, this one. Look, I know Gaga tried to give us Bad Romance Part 2, but it doesn't work. The sad thing is, it's not a bad pop record. But it's not good either.     5.Americano-Techno. Horrible Spanish. No hooks. Mariachi band. No explanation needed.     6.Hair-This is when the preachy, cheesy, bad 90's sitcom-intro music starts to kick in. To start with the lyrics are really bad. The melody is ok, but the production collapses the whole thing. Will not listen a second time.     7.Scheiße-This is something I could dance to, for sure. But it's not cohesive. For an audiophile like myself, I listen to every nuance of a song, even if it is a dance song. It sounds like, to me, this was originally two separate songs mashed together.    8.Bloody Mary-I like the melody and production, but the message of the song is grating. Again, it has a religious theme. So tired, so trite.    9.Black Jesus/Amen Fashion-A throwaway. I understand why it was a bonus track. Nothing special.     10.Bad Kids-Another dance number. Another preachy attempt to bind together destitute youth.     11.Fashion of his Love-The absolute worst song of Gaga's career. This is horrible. I'm thinking that maybe this is a gospel song with a throwaway mid-80's beat. Sounds exactly like \\"I wanna dance with somebody\\" in the worst way.     12.Highway Unicorn(Road to Love)- I don't feel either way. I don't love it, but I would listen to it again.    13.Heavy Metal Lover-Well, the title sure is misleading. No metal elements to this song at all. Pure Techno.    14.Electric Chapel-I do not like this at all. Sounds just like Kylie Minouge circa 2002. This is bad. The song has no message. It is dead.     15.The Queen-The third bonus track. I can see why it's a bonus.    16.You and I-A good song, but gosh, I've been hearing it for the past year now. There is no mystique to this song. Just another 80's inspired power ballad. yawn.    17.The Edge of Glory-Great message. Tightly executed song. But like a lot of things on this album, it's just boring. This is a fan favorite, but I don't like it all.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Took awhile, but I finally got the album and updating my review to focus entirely on the album.    Not a Gaga fanatic, but like a lot of her singles and took advantage of the special offer yesterday to get the album at 99 cents. There were a number of songs, particularly in the first 1/3, that had jarring aspects to them and would have benefitted I think from a little more time and editing. She's at her best when she focuses on pure pop music and less on theatrics that don't serve the song at hand. It's a fairly uneven album, with some real bright spots in it.
B002ZJGN96|5.0|James Horner and James Cameron work excellent together.  Cameron blows your mind with stunning visuals and heart-touching stories and Horner blows your mind with beautiful sounds and majestic notes that bring you back to Pandora every time you listen to them.  All the songs are great, but my favorites are the calm and peaceful ones that are played while Jake is exploring the forest with Neytiri.  There is just something magical about them that sets your imagination going.  Horner's soundtrack compliments the movie nicely and, in my opinion, advances it further.  This is an excellent soundtrack and is worth the money.  Great to listen to anywhere!
B004NGYXIM|1.0|As Mana's #1 fan in Australia....lol, this CD is a piece of crap.    Five years in the making and all Mana can serve up is drivel. Apparently the CD release was held up because the band weren't happy with some of the end product???    12 songs and 2 versions of No Te Rindas, the band must have been hard up for any decent material to put on this album.    The one star reviews have summed up my thoughts exactly, so there's no use repeating what has already been said.    To the reviewers who gave this a 5 or 4 star rating, what did you rate it against? I rated this CD against Mana's previous releases and gave it the appropriate rating of 1 star.    BTW, I have read other reviews on this album and some Spanish speaking reviewers have recommended trying out Jaguares and Andres Calamaro which I did. It'll help me get by until Mana release their next studio album in 2016.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I first saw Avatar about a year ago. But I saw it on DVD, since I didn't have a Blu-ray player then. Even then I was amazed at the visuals and everything. But since then I have gotten a Blu-ray player and I watched Avatar on Blu-ray as soon as it came in the mail from Amazon. IT LOOKS SO GOOD!!! If I could only own one movie on Blu-ray, it would be Avatar! You haven't seen this movie if you haven't seen it in Blu-ray!!!!     I really loved the underlying themes and story of Avatar. In fact, I think the themes are so important that they should set an example for how we should treat our planet. I mean if we continue to neglect it, less and less will be around for future generations. That would be a shame. Yes, the story of Avatar does have some similarities with other movies (one movie that comes to mind is Dances with Wolves). But I still think it is a story worth telling and may even be a sort of wake-up call for us on Earth.     Also I like the extended-collector's edition. The extra 16 minutes compliment the movie nicely and fill out the story better. Now the movie opens on Earth instead of in space, they visit Dr. Augustine's school on Pandora that they only mentioned in the theatrical version, and they lengthened some of the fight scenes and Jake and Neytiri's love scene etc. It is worth it to see this version, but you can also watch the theatrical version or the re-release (with 8 extra minutes). I don't really think they are of much importance though because everything that's in those is in the e.c. edition. And unless you don't want to watch some of the extra scenes, you might as well watch the e.c. edition every time.     This edition has a lot of extras too. Two whole discs of them!! They range from deleted scenes, to behind the scenes, to scene deconstruction and documentaries. There is about 45 minutes of deleted scenes and it is interesting to watch them because it reveals some plot details that aren't revealed in the other editions (like before Quaritchattacks the Tree of Souls, Selfridge fights with him about using mining explosives and threatens to fire him. Quaritch then chokes him and says that he's in charge now because of emergency authority). The behind the scenes are nice and they explain how they worked on it with interviews and such.  Gosh, it is amazing how much work they put into this.    The coolest part is the scene deconstruction. This is where they play certain parts of the movie and you can pick which way you want to view them. You have 3 choices: Full, template, or capture. Full is what is sounds like, Full definition (the quality of the movie). Template is a very rough CGI scene where they do enough to see how it will look but don't spend all the time making it look nice because they don't know if they are going to keep it (there was a really nice Na'vi dance scene in the deleted scenes that was in template). Capture is where they show the actors/actresses in their body suits with all the sensors on them. Capture is the coolest one because it shows you how they act it out without any CGI over them.     The case is very nice. The discs go in little sleeves. Each sleeve is essentially a page in the little book. The book slides into a case and another cover slides on top of that (if you don't know what I mean watch the video on this Amazon page). The pictures on the inside sleeves look great and are very high quality. The case isn't as sturdy as a regular plastic case, but it looks a heck of a lot better, so I guess you give some and get some. Overall I was pleased with the case and VERY pleased with the quality of the movie.     Also, I read on some other reviews that they had to change discs in between the movie. At first I was puzzled because I didn't have to switch, but then I realized that they were reviewing the DVD version. Reviews written on this page appear on both the DVD and Blu-ray pages. So if you're going to buy Avatar in Blu-ray (which I strongly recommend that you do, you won't besorry), then you don't have to worry about switching discs in the middle of the movie. Blu-ray discs are just a lot larger than DVDs are and can hold the entire movie. You do have to switch discs if you want to watch bonus features, as there aren't any on disc 1 (the movie disc). Also I should point out that because the Blu-ray edition fits the movie onto one disc, it has 2 discs for bonus features, instead of one for the DVD version. So you get another couple hours of bonus features when you buy Blu-ray, just another reason why to get it.     This version should please any Avatar lover out there. It has everything you want: Blu-ray, extended edition, lots of bonus features, and a cool case. The only thing this doesn't have that some might want is 3D. But I didn't want that since I don't have a 3D TV.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|This is a well-done composite of Michael Jackson's music and moves, and a fun back-stage experience to see how the shows come together.  Was shipped really fast, too!
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Made us want to jazzercise dance at work this morning.  For 99 cents you can't go wrong.  Great value for great music!  Go Gaga!
B004K4AUZW|3.0|I admit some of Lady Gaga's songs make you tap your feet or even make you stand up and move a little. However, the rest of the album sounds like a very bad workout track.<br /><br />With lyrics made to \\"shock and awe\\" the world, I wish there would be some sustenance to them....there isn't. If you don't care what she says, then you should be in pretty good shape. She has about 5 songs with great lyrics/messages (out of 17). I guess she figured if she gave you an album with 100 songs on it, you wouldn't take the time to worry about the quality.<br /><br />But, heck, what are you reading this for? You're still going to buy this album aren't you?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: Preview the songs first.
B0051QJ83S|4.0|After I finally got the album due to Amazon's cloud issue, finally got a chance to listen to it.  Overall a good album, but not as good as last.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|As described this product works perfectly! I am now able to connect to any tv to watch netflix, and the quality is better than average. When connected to WIFI the artifacts are at a minimum, the sound is great, and using the television's settings I am able to adjust for either full or widescreen viewing. Purchased an open item return in like new condition, and would highly recommend that avenue for the savings. Many, and by the comments on this item its clear, purchase this expecting iPad2 functionality from an iphone or ipod and return it disgruntled... Read about it before you buy it and verify you're getting the function that you're looking for!    PRO: Small, stays attached firmly, pass-through for charging    CON: None!
B0036EBARO|5.0|Very briefly, this is a great companion piece if you are at all a fan of the Australian band Cut Copy. Expect the same '80s inspired indulgences here, just done with the style only Goldfrapp and her compatriots can bring to the dance floor!
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Who buys cds anymore anyway?! My songs finished downloading in no time and for .99c even if they didnt I could have waited. Put your paws up for Amazon for the dirt cheap price for such an amazing album and for Mother Monster thanks for another amazing album!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This really sucks... Going back to iTunes. At least when I buy music it downloads. All I got was the booklet. Who cares !! What up with this crap Amazon ! Using your customers are beta testers ?
B0051QIGP4|4.0|The 4 stars are for all of Lady Gaga's singles thus far which I like which I realize may not be helpful straight off but I just wanted to write quickly to let you all know I was having the same problem too with the album download [only actually seeing the booklet and not being able to click on or play any of the tracks in cloudplayer]. I was getting ready to contact customer service but when I went to check for my order number I saw that the album is still being processed so PLEASE before we end up w/200 negative reviews check your orders in your amazon account and make sure your order has actually COMPLETED before you get all fired up! :)
B004IQMXD4|4.0|Legend.  Incomprehensible talent.  Take an example...Italian Summer.  Into a triplet rhythm a la 1950s and a harmonic cadence that is so familiar launches a voice that towers, that defines what great art should be...utterly original and equal to our ontology.  She's our Edith Piaf.  But much more.  Singer but also songwriter and survivor.  Stevie has a hard-earned ability and right to wish that few have.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Like so many science fiction movies today there is not much of a story. Water is available in the Solar System on other planets, and I doubt that a space faring alien would have much of a problem conquering the Earth. All they would need to do is go into orbit and throw rocks at us. Little we could do to stop them.      Having said that it is a great action packed war movie. There are some terrific fighting scenes. The acting was reasonable, the filming is great.     I enjoyed it a lot, I liked the ending too.
0452289963|4.0|Love this book. It changed the way I saw and lived my life. The most important piece for me was recognizing what he calls the 'pain body' and how that effects us when we are wrapped in it. I've never heard it described so well.
0061726826|5.0|What if love was illegal? The concept sounds ridiculous. In fact I wasn't even adding this one to my TBR just for the sheer fact that the synopsis sounded like -- well like what if we took vampires and made the sparkle and put the in high school. I guess I should have learned from my mistake with that one also, right? I was expecting a fluff piece compared to THE HUNGER GAMES and DIVERGENT but what I got was a surprisingly astute novel that had my head-spinning in an emotional whirlwind. I was literally sobbing throughout most of this book and while it does seem to be happening a lot lately, I'll just chalk it up to the great books I've been reading of late. Because crying over a book is not the norm with me. DELIRIUM has taken some flack from the hardened reviewers, but I can't give this one any disrespect. Oliver made some hard turns on this baby and it gave it depth and originality that has me dying to see what she has in store for us next.  I would also like to say, dear reader, if you are scouring the web for other reviews, I might not read ones with spoilers, because this one needs to be appreciated with the surprise intact. I think if it is spoiled it won't have the intensity that it should have.<br /><br />In the future there is a cure for love. Scientist have finally narrowed down the causes to all that is wrong with human nature and that is love. Love causes deleria, insanity and usually death. The cured are free to live without fear, heart-ache and the emotional turmoil that is associated with the disease. Lana Holloway, who prefers to go by Lana Tiddle, so she will not be associated with her mother who committed the heinous act of suicide, can't wait for her cure. After she is cured the pain will go away, she'll stop missing her mother, they'll pair her with a good man and she can begin living her easy, emotionless life. Because all Lana has known most of her life is pain. Everyone in the end leaves - so if you don't, well you know, then you won't care when they leave or die or forget you.<br /><br />Yet, as her cure date approaches, Lana begins to become more aware of what is happening around her. Her best friend Hannah begins opening her eyes, telling her that not everything is as it seems. And then the unthinkable. Lana meets someone knew. someone male, someone who makes her feel like she's never felt before. Suddenly the cure doesn't look so appealing.<br /><br />Definitly not was it appears to be, because just what the synopsis states is not what this book is. Yes, there is Lana who is content the way her life is, but then she meets a guy and he shakes up her whole world. Very typical of YA books. But then add the dystopian factor into this and it brings a little more depth. It was very -- well Cold Waresque. The heavy handed rulers dictating what is best, changing everything from religion to classical literature, everything was regulated. To even stray from the \\"regulated thought\\" could have you branded as a sympathizer or a rebel and the whole community would turn from you. Then the extra layers of the emotional trauma Lana had to deal with of her mother and then the fact that all the adults were emotionless automatons that showed hardly an ounce of compassion to the children was just horrifying. Added touches like the fact that the government had to state the proper raising of children because these emotionless parents would often kill their misbehaving children, was just more sickening fodder. This novel was definitely not as it appeared. Delirium was layer upon layer of intensity of emotion that I needed to decompress afterwards. I can't wait to see what Oliver has in store for me with the next installment. This is a must read for dystopian fans.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Lauren deStefano's Wither but I do not recommend this as a transitory dystopian. I think you might need to get used to the genre with lighter reads before undertaking this one.leave or die or forget you.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|There's no need to rehash the plot of GRR Martin's fabulous \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series; everyone remotely interested in this extraordinary piece of fantasy/adventure is familiar with its medieval story-line.<br /><br />Things I liked in this HBO series...<br /><br />1.) it's not often a movie-series turns out to be the perfect visual compliment to what many consider to be the gold standard for epic fantasy writing...but this does. It captures the atmosphere, the subtle edginess, those brutal, unexpected moments; it really does grasp the mood and essence of the book.<br /><br />2.) in addition to presenting a riveting tale, the production gives us acting that brings the books' characters to life in realistic settings.<br /><br />3.) a computer enhanced animated map is shown as a short cut scene at the start of each episode. Giving those of us familiar with the books a brief refresher and those new to the series a sense of the geography, direction and distances.<br /><br />4.) a pulsating, musical score to start each episode that perfectly fits the heraldic spirit of this story.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />HBO has done a wonderful job making this first book (Game of Thrones), into a first rate TV series. 5 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
0385737955|3.0|There was much hype surrounding The Maze Runner upon it's release in 2009. I had been slavering to read it also, especially after seeing the \\"movie\\" promo that coincided with it's release. Quite compelling. But, did the book live up to the hype? It was good, yes, but did I run out and scream at literate people to read the book? No. I really think I did this one an injustice by listening to it on audio book while reading Divergent in book format. The Maze Runner just paled in comparison. The Maze Runner had an excellent and compelling story backing it, had worthy characters backing up the competent writing and even left me a little breathless in certain places, but it just didn't have that little extra that made it a great dystopian.<br /><br />Thomas comes to consciousness in an elevator. He is pulled into a fake world, greeted by dirty boys his age that look at him either with eagerness, as if he were a new puppy, or with distrust and open hatred. They talk strangely, using slang words he hasn't heard before and treat him as if he is an annoyance. Their attitude is \\"catch up quickly or die\\" and as night falls and screams can be heard from the only structure in this strange clearing, Thomas knows something is really wrong with his new world.<br /><br />Thomas' new world is surrounded by walls and a maze. There is no way out, but it doesn't stop the boys from trying desperately to find their way out. There are heinous creatures that occupy his world. Bulbous and hideous creatures that stab you with needles or drag you away into the night. If you survive their attack you become infected and have to go through a long torturous period where you change into something else. Thomas can't remember his past, he barely remembers his own name...but he does know one thing, he needs to find a way out of this Maze.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies meets Ender's Game in this dystopian mystery adventure.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|These fools who are rating it 1 star probably don't like gaga anyway..... It's better than anything Gaga has ever done and is critically acclaimed, so extremely negative comments are probably from people who wouldn't appreciate anything she does. It's definitely worth a dollar LOL, I'd pay 40 dollars for this album.
0061537969|5.0|Oh my. What can I say. It was 1:00 A.M. and I began this book hoping this read would tire me enough to fall asleep. It started with my own tears and a gulp in my throat, but I decided to forge on anyway.  I'm so happy I did. This is a remarkable book - a \\"tail\\" told by the sweetest golden lab with a philosophical view of life and a sense of self that is beautiful to see. If only all of us could look at life with the view of this extraordinary animal. Even though at 4:30 A.M. I put the book down and had to leave the bed so my husband wouldn't hear me crying, I believe reading this book was worth it.  This writer must have been a dog in his former life. He certainly understands what the bond is between dog and person. Please, animal lovers and those who appreciate all things good, read this lovely book and take a peak at what our beloved pets see when they look at those of us who love them so.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I bought my copy at 3:00am this morning, and was able to download all 14 tracks.  The strange thing was, I never got the digital booklet! Which seems to be the *opposite* problem that people are experiencing now.  Anyways, I don't care much about not having the booklet, so onto the album review...<br /><br />This is the first complete Gaga album I've purchased, so this is interpreted by a person who has only heard previous singles \\"Just Dance\\", \\"Poker Face\\", \\"Lovegame\\", \\"The Fame\\", \\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Telephone\\", and \\"Alejandro\\".  I really enjoy Born This Way!  Just about every song is geared for the dance floor, and like with her first album, I can see many successful singles being launched from this album.  The production/instrumentation seems a bit \\"heavier\\" than her previous albums, but that's certainly not a bad thing.  Lyrically, she is sending a message to be yourself and do whatever you wish, regardless of criticism from others.  For example, \\"I'm as free as my hair\\" are the chorus lyrics to Hair.  Each song has a tiny message of individuality and freedom attached to it.<br /><br />Now I wish I could be one of those people to look deep into the meanings of each song, but I'm not.  But if you enjoy dance music with a positive message, there's pretty much no reason not to enjoy this release.  And please stop complaining about your downloads, because I've been using AmazonMp3 since their launch in September 2007, and they WILL help to resolve your issue.  But it may take some time to issue a re-download for people, considering their servers are currently overloaded from download requests for this album.

0156029065|1.0|Baudolino is an incredibly boring book.  I loved \\"Name of the Rose\\" and had high hopes for this novel, but it was a colossal disappointment.  The book meanders hopelessly for 500 pages and lacks any suspense whatsoever.  It took 3 attempts to actually finish the novel.  The first time, I read to page 200 and desisted.  I then waited 2 years and made it to page 400, but stopped reading due to shear boredom.  I then waited 6-months and read the final 100 pages.  I have read close to 2,000 books and this is one of the 20 most boring books I have ever encountered in my lifetime.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THIS NOVEL unless your are an insomniac that requires a sleeping aid.  Reading this book is the equivalent of watching paint dry or grass grow.  Baudolino is boredom at its finest!
B0002TRIOU|3.0|While highly recommended by The Gramophone, I found the sound quality on this recording to be disappointing.  It feels as though the performers are playing behind a curtain.  Much of he string playing seems to be softened by an enveloping fog.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Just a little patience, people. So many people are buying this album, the server is a little slow. Besides, it's a dollar for an album! The download wait is worth it.    I wonder how iTunes is after Amazon owned them.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|She needs to quit looking at the Madonna playbook and just be herself. This doesn't even sound like what many thought Lady Gaga would be. She's a flash in the pan..another dance hit)  12. Highway Unicorn (rock, dance, youre gonna swear you hear Journey in some parts, in fact I felt like holding a lighter up in parts...awesome beat, lyrics...another great dance hit, one of my faves)  13. Heavy Metal Lover (smooth dance hit)  14. Electric Chapel (rock, sound like Debbie Harry sometimes... dance...another dance hit)  15. The Queen (feels rock...beautiful lyrics and melody...gorgeous vocals...another hit)  16. You and I (rock ballad...channeling Queen...another hit)  17. The Edge of Glory (feels rock...beautiful melody and lyrics...another hit...I hear Bonnie Tyler, among others sometimes on this one)    Gaga is channeling the last 40 years of rock and disco and dance music. She's brilliant. Her love of rock and dance definitely comes across.     Born This Way is an aural/audio hurricane, and if you are unprepared you may very well find yourself bewildered and dazed. For those ready for the trip, it's nothing short of brilliant.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I admit that didn't have high expectations for this album when I first heard the title track back in February. I had feared that GaGa had finally \\"jumped the shark\\" but, after hearing more of the songs, I have definitely changed my mind. The songs are good and I only had some of the downloading issues that others have had. What worked for me was to go back to \\"view your digital orders,\\" view the order, launch the Amazon Cloud Player again and click on the songs that were not successfully downloaded the first time.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I probably would have given this 'album' 4 stars 20 years ago, but these days it seems there are fewer and fewer bands putting out traditional 'rock' music for many reasons.  Foo Fighters have always stuck to their guns and resisted the urge to any type of fad or novelty and for that alone they are to be commended.  This sounds like music used to sound (in a good way), which has traditional song structure and not some 'drone-a-thon' I hear all too often, with no hooks, no solos, and no much melodies..... modern 'rock' seems to be slow moving chord changes with no melody and boring vocal performances....in a word: there is nothing *dynamic* about it.      Foo Fighters are one of the last remaining mainsteam acts to put out music that is NOT any of the things I just listed.  It has hooks, actual verse, chorus, and dare a say a bridge!.... and solo and excellent thoughtful songwriting and lyrics.    I think a great example of what I'm saying is the tune \\"Back & Forth\\"...there is all kinds of chord changes, rhythms, and vocal changes going on.... great writing and keeps the listener interested in the song.... but still has a traditional feel.... LOVE IT!    5 STARS from this music fan!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is not a review of Lady Gaga's music as much as how impressed I am with Amazon's new MP3 Cloud service.  True, I was drawn to Lady Gaga's music after seeing and hearing her on a recent American Idol show.  OK, I paid my $.99 for the full album and within 1 minute it was loaded to my Amazon Cloud service. I am playing the album righ now on my Droid X, plus my storage was upgraded from 5GB to 20GB for this one purchase.  Oh yes, I can download the full album to my desktop computer when I get home.  Needless to say, this is one heck of a service!  I should also note, at the same time, I am beta testing Google's new music cloud service and I would say that Google's product is more like pre-Alpha when attempting to play songs loaded to their cloud service on an Android phone or tablet  --- Only available to view from the browser; as soon as the browser screen goes black or you open a new browser tab on the Google service, all music stops. They desperately need an Android App similar to Amazon's.  Enough said. Go Amazon!
B000OVLBFS|4.0|I ordered three Jessie Stone dvd's which I'd seen on my movie channel on TV with closed captions. Because I'm careful to get subtitled movies because of hearing loss, I ordered these since subtitles were listed. They arrived and subtitles were also listed on the DVD. In the setup, however, only audio choices were given. No subtitles. I tried accessing the menu through the menu button on my remote and got the same choices. The option SAID Audio/Subtitles, but, again, only audio choices were provided. This was a big disappointment since I love these Jessie Stone movies. I hope Amazon will double check this and let those changes show on the website.[[ASIN:B000OVLBFS Jesse Stone: Night Passage]]
0307272702|3.0|I read Gary Taubes article about sugar in the New York Times magazine some weeks ago and then got interested in reading some more by him, because I thought that he made a good case against eating sugar.   I am not as impressed with this book. I do not disagree that we need to eat almost no added sugar and certainly limit the amount of white flour and maybe even carbs overall that we consume, for our health and for our weight. I also agree that eggs and meat and even cheese are not bad for us. But Mr. Taubes does not convince me that he is writing this book for our health, rather he is only focused on being lean and lowering our risk for \\"Western diseases\\" by losing weight. But he is no Michael Pollan. Mr. Taubes is not interested in the quality of our food,  in the fact that beef that is not from grass fed cows may not be good for us and contains more omega 6 fats than we need. We can eat all the meat and eggs and poultry we want according to him, but then it leaves out the debate on whether we will be healthy when we consume these corn fed animals pumped full of antibiotics.   Another major fault in his argument that I found is that he glosses over the fact that the majority of the population in the world consumes large amounts of mostly white rice and they are not fat, in fact they are rather skinny. I am talking of course about every single person in Asia. Mr. Taubes uses some very selective examples of cultures that consume only carbs and are fat, but he leaves out the majority of the population of the world that is skinny and eats tons of rice!  I do believe that the book is valuable in many ways, but as far as pleasant to read (I do not care much for the way he writes either) and informative information on nutrition, I prefer Michael Pollan and Nina Planck.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is a movie that is a classic; I see people already making references to it.  This copy comes with 3 editions, Blu-Ray, DVD and digital download.  It's the first time I compared Blu-Ray to DVD one after another and it's amazing how much better Blu-Ray looks and sounds on a HDTV.<br /><br />There was an expiration on the download printed on the slipcover of May 6, 2011, so since that date has passed you won't have access to it unless they reprint it.  The download is DRM protected which is a pain because I disabled hyperthreading on my computer and it says that because I changed the hardware setting that I couldn't download, so I changed it back and downloaded.  Now it also won't play without hyperthreading enabled.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I bought the physical, two-disc, special edition of this album, so I can legitimately comment on the music itself rather than download errors from Amazon (unlike approximately one third of the reviews listed here). This album represents Lady Gaga at her finest, an artist who has successfully matched and surpassed her phenomenal dance-pop brand to create music that represents who she really is.  On this album, you will find a blend of familiar (yet excellent) pop tracks in addition to genuine rock ballads about human dignity and acceptance.  Aside from the typical favorites on the album (Born This Way, Judas, Edge of Glory, etc.), I've enjoyed Bloody Mary, Americano, The Queen, and Bad Kids.  All of the remixes are also quite good, especially DJ White Shadow's remix of Judas.
1423389387|4.0|A 43 hour long story better bring something special to hold most people's attention - and thankfully Brilliance Audio did things right: Nick Podehl's the perfect voice for Qvothe and  for narrating the characters from nervous schoolboys to arrogant warrior maidens. He's not a somber humorless narrator but that's exactly what Rothfuss' story needs: Rothfuss writes his story in a modern day vernacular, not attempting to create distinct medieval-like speech patterns, instead most people sound like 21st century Americans. And Nick Podehl's got that down; along with a professional tone and rhythm to his reading. He never takes one out of the story.    As for the tale itself, I have my misgivings. Frankly as pleasant as it was in general, it was hardly ever more than that. There was very little dramatic action and while Rothfuss avoids excessive, intricate description - a la Terry Brooks who'll describe every leaf and plant in a forest - he does go on and on like the old Grandfather on the Simpsons.     I have to admit by hour 20, about the time Qvothe reminds us he's \\"led an interesting life and has a long story to tell, I was reminded of the aforementioned Grandpa Simpson who'd said something similar about his life story (\\"Well, it's not so much interesting as long\\").  In fact, I put the audio book aside for a week or two because I had the distinct feeling that nothing really dramatic was going to happen.    When I returned to listen to the remaining 23 hours of story, I discovered I was mostly right. There was a brief battle in a forest, an interlude with a faerie queen, and training with some Amazonian warriors. I can't say it justified listening 23 more hours for that. It did make my morning commutes marginally less dull.    A mediocre rating for The Wise Man's Fear. I've listened to other audio books recently which were far more tedious - Off Armageddon Reef, for example, spent several hours on bureaucratic meetings which left me wishing I'd just got a memo - but I'd expected better from Rothfuss. The audio portion was impressive though; including the packaging:  36 CDs in a sturdy, small package.
076790592X|1.0|I laugh at all of the positive reviews people have written about this book. I would never recommend anybody spend their \\"Tuesday\\" reading this book, and here is why. I had to read this book in English class. This is obviously a book that appeals to the low level high school student. Most of the reviewers on this site have pretty summed this up pretty well. Morrie must have really been a loving and caring professor and one who I would love to have. However, Mitch's middle school/sports journalist writing style turned me off from the very beginning. I'm sorry, but I truly do not show much interest in learning about a self centered sports journalist who waited twenty years and finally got back in touch with his old professor because he was too focused on his career and money. A true friend is somebody who will make an effort to keep in touch with you as often as they can.     The only thing you can really get out of this book is reading the title for the chapters in the table of contents. Each chapter repeats the same message over and over again. I know Mitch cared about Morrie enough to visit him once every week, and I know that everybody makes mistakes. I honestly can't decipher whether listening to a pastor preach a long Sunday sermon or reading this book is more boring. This often makes me wonder what people will say about Mitch at HIS funeral.     To sum it up, I can't say that I recommended this book to anybody who wants to learn about Morrie, or who wants to learn about \\"the meaning of life\\". It doesn't explain in a way that will show me why I should \\"have to read it\\" as most adults say. Let this book be a lesson to anybody who writes a biography about somebody else, don't focus on how the person was influential only to yourself and your spouse. Mitch should have focused on how Morrie impacted the lives of his family, friends, other students and coworkers and write it in a less of a \\"middle school writing essay\\" manner.
B003VIWO8Y|3.0|A somewhat enjoyable read, nothing warranting a second read.  The usual things are there: how he got started, the ups and downs, the drugs, the women...    There are two things that really limit the enjoyment, and full-exposure that this book needed.    The first, and the minor of the two, is Dave's 'involvement' with Metallica.  To hear Dave talk about it (and talk about it and talk about it) is that pretty much Metallica owes it's existence to him.  It almost borders on the pathetic...Sure, \\"Kill 'Em All\\" was important, but it is just a small piece of Metallica's history and catalog...    The second, and the biggest hole in this book, relates to drug use, and his seemingly lack of ability to focus his microscope on himself.    \\"(This guy) is a loser, got addicted to drugs, so he got kicked out of Megadeth.\\"  Repeat that multiple times, with different names, and varying degrees of embarrassment to said person.  Dave sometimes gets insulting and directly personal.  That's all good and fine, if he would have done the same to himself.  He readily admits his drug-abuse, his rehabs, etc. but doesn't give himself the same treatment.  It's either glibly skipped, glossed over, or blamed on someone(thing) else.    It makes the whole thing ring a little hollow...
B0051QJ83S|1.0|I tried to download the album this morning, and I am still waiting for the rest of the songs (only 4 work) to play. I really hope Amazon figures this out. I reallllly would like to hear the entire album.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Is there an explicit version or only a clean version (a beep replace an f word in the song Government hooker)..... ?    I kinda liked the CD, everything sounds the same but I kinda enjoyed it!    Not as great as The Fame Monster....
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I agree with another reviewer on here that this album is not your typical bubblegum pop that you might be used to with her previous albums. When I hear this album, I feel like I'm watching, or listening, to a musical, and it's so interesting. I think that Gaga's ability to surprise us with whatever she comes out with is so important, especially with music today (pop music) coming out and sounding exactly the same. This album definitely highlights her vocals and the music is stunning. Overall, though, I feel like many people (or common people) might not get it, even those who are already Gaga fans. But that's too bad. It's quite sophisticated.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|So unless Amazon fixes the download issues I'll stick with my 1 star. If you advertise the album for as much as %0.99 while Steve Jobbs offers %9.99, get your download services up and running!!!!!
B001SRC9P8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I saw that one person made a review on the content of this book. Honestly people just need to understand that it is for entertainment purposes only. I feel like it is no different from letting your kids watch tv shows. I think this book gives a real insight into how friends of the \\"popular crowd\\" treat and take advantage of each other. As soon as I finished reading this book I told all of my friends about it.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|It's a good album, and for a dollar you can't beat it! (assuming you are getting this on 5/23/2011 when amazon had it for $0.99).<br /><br />The mp3 process looks to be fixed and I have access to the full album in my cloud drive instantly except for 1 track which I had to refresh my cloud drive before it showed it downloaded it.<br /><br />Great deal amazon, thanks!
B004AKCMD4|4.0|I am a Senior Citizen that loves animated movies and this was not for children. I liked it very much. Beutiful animation. Story of triumph of good over evil. Very well done.
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|The book is not a BAD book. It is not poorly written nor is it eye gaugingly boring. It just wasnt quite as great as all of the other Emily Giffin books. Something Blue tries to carry on the story of Something Borrowed..and as we all know..most sequels arent a hit! I would have better appreciated this story from  a first time author... or someone just getting their feet wet, not an author with as much talent as Emily Giffin, who has written other books that I cant be pryed away from. Again, Def not her best.. but also not the worst of the worst.
B0041T52S6|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For those who have been trying to figure out which media influenced the scenarists of 'Scott Pilgrim', how about MTV, old 80s video games, comic books and Quentin Tarrantino? There's one other that may only occur to the older population watching this film: Batman, the 60s TV show. Remember all the zany titles which would appear whenever something dramatic happened (titles such as \\"Sock!\\", \\"Pow!\\", \\"Bong!\\")? A similar technique is employed here with Scott Pilgrim but the titles are often inserted for a more farcical comic book effect (for example, when a phone rings, the title \\"ring\\" zips across the screen). One or two word titles are also utilized to describe each character (so if the narrator mentions someone is 'clueless', it's also mentioned again as a title description). 'Pilgrim' wins points for its original visual style, featuring nifty camera work and spectacular special effects which often makes one feel as if one is inside of a crazy video game.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Pilgrim's story is as bland as the title character. Michael Cera (playing another geeky role) is awful as a 22 year old garage band musician who first dates a perky high school student (\\"Knives Chau\\") but then dumps her for the more mysterious Ramona Flowers (winningly played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Cera's Pilgrim can do nothing more than act like a love sick puppy dog opposite the much more aggressive Flowers from beginning to end.<br /><br />In real life, the enigmatic Flowers would never go for the wimpy Pilgrim who always seems to be kow-towing to her during their many platonic interactions. Somehow, Flowers decides to give Pilgrim a second chance after he defeats her 7th ex-boyfriend Gideon (Pilgrim's ex-bands' new sponsor) in a long-winded fight scene (Flowers is not really 'attracted' to boyfriend #7; actually, he's planted a micro-chip in her brain causing her to fall for him!).<br /><br />That's basically the crux of the Pilgrim plot--our 'hero' must go toe to toe with all of Flowers' evil exes before he can win back the object of his infatuation. The seven confrontations (which include a woman, one of Ramona's bi-flings) are nothing more than a device to stage a series of silly fight scenes reminiscent of Tarrantino's stylized sword fights in \\"Kill Bill\\". None of it makes any sense, especially when perky and cute Knives attacks Ramona out of jealousy over her relationship with Pilgrim. Should I also mention that Pilgrim is stabbed to death, goes to limbo but discovers he has an \\"extra life\\" that enables him to return to earth so he can do battle with Gideon all over again.<br /><br />None of the supporting players exhibit any charm. Pilgrim's gay roommate, for example, puts Pilgrim down when he advises Knives not to get involved with him during their first meet up. And then there's Pilgrim's drummer and ex-girlfriend Kim Pine; why exactly does she have a dour expression on her face throughout the film? There's also little humor in the film--one attempt (if you can call it that) occurs with Ramona's third ex, Todd; he's stymied when he's stripped of his 'vegan psychic' powers by the 'vegan police' who have discovered that he's been putting half and half (non-vegan milk substitute) in his coffee.<br /><br />In the end, one can only conclude that 'Pilgrim' is a pointless endeavor. Should we regard 'Pilgrim' as an honorable character after he engages in these violent confrontations with a group of one-dimensional, comic book villains? Even worse is how emasculated Pilgrim comes off as he is led around on a leash by a much more hip Ramona. This is a film strictly for teenagers. Its failure to appeal to an older, more sophisticated crowd spelled doom at the box office in the American market.go toe to toe with all of Flowers' evil exes before he can win back the object of his infatuation.

159562015X|1.0|I bought \\"StrengthsFinder 2.0\\" for work as a part of an event I attended. I was told there is a code for an online test in the back of the book so I intended to buy an unused or new book for this purpose. From the seller, I chose a book marked as new. Upon receipt, the book is NOT NEW and the code for the online test was ripped out. I would normally find this is a minor issue, return the book and replace it. The major problem is that no one from this sellers company will return my many emails plus there is no phone number available online. I am upset and out money while holding a book that is useless to me. I am a long time Amazon customer and extremely disappointed.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I've always admired the way Victorian England is used so effectively in British TV series and nowhere is this more evident than in NORTH AND SOUTH, the story of relationships between different classes in British society during the 1850s.<br /><br />The story itself bears a strong resemblance to Charlotte Bronte's work, SHIRLEY, a novel that dealt largely with strikes and mill owners. Since Elizabeth Gaskell was a good friend of Charlotte Bronte, it's no wonder that her story deals with some of the same customs and values as Bronte's work.<br /><br />RICHARD ARMITAGE, whose very image conjurs up remembrance of Laurence Olivier's Heathcliff in \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" has a glowering presence and uses it to portray the hard-working mill owner who has to bear down on his workers when it looks as though his cotton mill is about to face a strike. He makes an unfavorable impression on the heroine of the story, played assuredly by DANIELA DENBY-ASHE, who has come north with her family to relocate in a climate and atmosphere not particularly to her liking.<br /><br />The story delves into the conflicts in many relationships, but keeps the central focus on the intense attraction between the two main characters despite their differences. SINEAD CUSACK as the man's shrewdly possessive mother gives a sharp characterization and TIM PIGOTT-SMITH as the girl's dignified father and BRENDAN COYLE as a rough mill worker are excellent in colorful supporting roles. The entire cast gets into the spirit of the drama and contribute to the uniformly fine quality of the acting.<br /><br />For romantics who pine over Victorian romance, surely this is one of the best of its kind with production values in costumes and settings that cannot be bettered. A viewer is certain to want to see more of Gaskell's work brought to the screen after the successful transition of this full-blooded character study.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I'm no kind of die hard fan but I appreciate the fun and catchiness of Lady Gaga's music.  I'm happy to have a current album at such a bargain.  Thanks Amazon and Lady Gaga.  BTW, I had zero problems downloading and immediately listening to the album.

After I started the phone back up, my 4G didnt work (EVO), it keeps shutting 4G on and off and killing my battery. Now I have to take the phone back to sprint, anyone else had this problem?
0470932139|5.0|As a very amateur food blogger and photographer, I found this book to be outstanding.  Easy to read, easy to understand and very helpful in photographing food for blog or other purposes. Helene has ably simplified the world for photography for us who just don't get it.  I bought extra copies and have shared them with friends.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to hone their photography skills.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I downloaded this album about 20 minutes or so ago, and only 8 songs are available for download. These songs should be available instantly, and its frustrating that i have payed for these songs and i'm not getting them. however i've seen im not the only person with this problem so im hoping it will be fixed.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I have to admit this took a long time to download.  But it is worth it.  99 cents for this amazing album is a deal worth being patient for.  This has been a good lesson in patience for anyone who had to wait more than two seconds.  I waited for nine hours and I am glad I did.  Thank you Amazon for this wonderful deal.  And thank you Lady Gaga for once again sharing your talent with us.  So quit your whining, be patient and be thankful.
0307887960|5.0|After drinking a popular \\"meal\\" drink for years and not losing weight, I decided to try the Dukan Diet.  The first day he says to weigh yourself often, which I didn't do because I didn't want to be disappointed.  I weighed myself the next morning and had lost 3 lbs. immediately! I have been on it for 7 days now and I have lost 7 lbs. I am in the \\"Cruise\\" phase right now. I admit, I didn't have much weight I wanted to lose (10 lbs.) but I tried everything and could not get it off.    In the first 2 days I felt a little dizzy and head-achy. I told myself that if that didn't go away within 2 days, I would stop.  The feeling went away by the third day. I wake up feeling so much better every day!  My sinus problems are virtually gone and I don't wake up all puffy. Bloating has been eliminated and I no longer have stomach aches.    If you plan ahead, cook a lot of meat all at once, you can do it! Also make sure you make the Oat Bran pancake listed in the book.  I added Splenda to make it sweet and it helped with cravings.  I also made my own yogurt for a snack sweetened with Splenda and a splash of vanilla to help with sweet cravings.
B0002XMF62|5.0|When I first heard this album, which was this past week, I couldn't shake the thought that it was really good.  So I listened to it again, thinking o.k., what can I say that's critical; maybe I was just in a good mood the first time.  Alright, now on second listen I actually think it's a little better than at first.  Why haven't I heard better things about this and other Sabbath releases from the 80's?  Here's what the case is for me.<br /><br />For way too long, I was loyal to the Ozzy-fronted Sabbath and refused to listen to anything else.  Years later, after finally realizing that Ozzy was as much to blame for Sabbath's split as Iommi and the others, and after hearing the stellar Devil You Know album by Heaven and Hell(the band), I started listening to Heaven and Hell(the album), Mob Rules, and Dehumanizer.  Naturally, I couldn't get enough, and enjoying those albums as I did, the curiosity for the less popular titles grew.<br /><br />As for the Tony Martin era, I had heard Headless Cross before and thought it was good.  I wasn't ready for The Eternal Idol, though.  Every song has A-quality Iommi riffs and solos.  There isn't one weak track on the whole thing.  The main turn-off for old-school fans is probably that some songs have a bit of the 80's hair metal sound,  but I'd say about 70% or more of the music would fit on Heaven and Hell or Mob Rules, and the same percentage of the vocals remind you more than a little of Dio.  I think most fans of older Sabbath who give this a fair chance will find a lot to like.  I'm into it a lot more than I expected to be.  I'd almost give greatest-hits status to The Shining, Hard Life to Love, Nightmare, and Lost Forever, and the rest of the songs are not far behind.

0767817478|2.0|In 1998, Roland Emmerich directed Godzilla(1998), a Hollywood remake of Gojira(1954). It works as a loud, epic, monster movie, but it lacks the fun and spirit that a real Godzilla film has. In Gojira(1954), Dr. Serizawa sacrifices his life and his diabolical weapon The Oxygen Destroyer to save Japan from Godzilla. Godzilla(1998) has a lot of mayhem and campy humor. Detractors of this film call it \\"Fraudzilla\\" and \\"GINO(Godzilla in Name Only)\\". Dr. Nick Tatopolous(Matthew Broderick) helps the military after a giant mutated lizard has attacked New York City. David Arnold's music score for Godzilla(1998) isn't bad. Adapting Akira Ifukube's Godzilla music could've helped. The film does deliver in production value. A CGI Godzilla destroys buildings, helicopters, and trucks. Cast members from The Simpsons(Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, Harry Shearer) act in Godzilla, for some reason! The film pokes fun of TV film critics Siskel and Ebert, for some reason. A large chunk of the film's budget was spent on advertisements. After seeing this film in 1998, I had to go out and rent some real Godzilla movies from the video store. Cloverfield(2008) was better than Godzilla(1998)!
B001GNWMH4|4.0|I have to openly admit that I am a sucker for pared down acoustic artists and groups that show a penchant for beautifully constructed arrangement and production.  I also had a somewhat narrow focus of the alt-country Americana movement that blossomed out of the SonVolt/Wilco/Uncle Tupleo era of the 80-90's and so on... by pure luck, I stumbled upon these guys almost by accident (Pandora) years ago.  I do not remember what song it was, but I was hooked (at least to this album) immediately.      If there is one word that comes to my mind when describing this album, it would be `harmony'.  The Jayhawks here have fantastic vocal harmonies, and very very well thought out instrumentation that I believe make this album more than the sum of its parts.  I cannot specifically put my finger on it, but there is something simply right and approachable about Gary Louris's gravel-ishly sweet vocal lead and harmony of their entire sound.  Call it maturity, call it kismet, I call it a pretty darn good album.     Try `Save it for a Rainy Day', `Angelyne', or `All the Right Reasons'.    This was their first album that I purchased and I actually wore it out.  It has maintained its spot on my somewhat dynamic 2MB of phone mp3 storage for years.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|There are a few standout tracks, such as Bloody Mary and  Government Hooker. The rest is filler and 80s beat rehashed with self help lyrics.
0425241505|4.0|The things I liked about this story were character related.  The interplay and dialog were good and left me feeling some empathy.  I felt the author had a good sense of humor and understood the interactions.<br />What I didn't care for as much was the lack of depth.  The characters talked and interacted and were somewhat introspective but the limited plot left me wanting more depth.<br />I think this was a good lighthearted romance.  This would be a good book to wile away maybe an hour or two on.<br />I gave this book 4 stars because it is lighthearted fluff.  I enjoyed it.  If you are looking for something with a little more substance it might rate only 2 to 3 stars overall.
1400052173|5.0|This book held my attention and as a person of color I felt the book touched me in several ways.  It was informative with a very personal touch.

I don't understand why the Lacks family did not sue John Hopkins or get some type of compensation for Henrietta's contributions.  It goes to show no matter how things change they stay the same.  Thanks for giving the world a better insite on the HeLa cells.  I want to tell the world.  Good BOOK!!

1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon, the author, was bashed by some sensitive book critics for taking a risk and writing from the perspective of this sick boy. They claimed that he had no idea what it is like to be in that position, and Haddon has no right to try. He disclaim in the book jacket that he is nowhere close to being an expert on the subject, and that he does not claim to be. However, I think that he pulls it off in masterful fashion. The novel is engrossingly convincing to the point where I think that Mark Haddon might actually be autistic. It also shockingly reminds me of my cousin, who shall remain nameless, who has Asperger syndrome. The book also has a humor in the form of a cut-to-the chase fashion, that you have to really look for. Haddon says things in a manor so matter of fact that you almost miss it. I think that this is terrific, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Critics also came around to it, as it won two awards in 2003 and 2004. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a mystery, with a teaspoon of sadness, and I believe that it is a great read.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|Very few of these songs are \\"catchy\\" compared to past albums. I feel this album should be playing in the background at the Salvador Dali Museum.    So many of these tracks are wandering without a clear melody. It's like she had 10,000 ideas and wrote them into one song. Other songs are so repetitive, I want to hit the stop button with a sledge hammer.    $0.99 = fair price.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|First off, I wanted to point out to those that are reviewing the album based off the samples - they're only being played from the beginning of the songs and you won't be able to hear the more exciting stuff in the songs. Best to preview the whole songs on YouTube or listen to the 1:30 minute previews on iTunes rather than here.<br /><br />I've been listening to this album on repeat every since I bought it and I have to say it's a masterpiece with all of the songs together. You'll hear more darker European trance inspirations in a lot of her songs and she does it well. It's nothing like her Fame Era with the fun pop beats but it branches directly from her Fame Monster Era with her darker beats. I think it's a refreshing change, in my opinion.<br /><br />If you're still in doubt about the album, you won't lose much for 99 cents. And as stated before this is the Standard version of Born This Way and does not include the bonus tracks.<br /><br />EDIT: The \\"censored\\" out part in Government Hooker is done on purpose to reflect government censorship. There is no other version of this song.
B004K4AVAG|2.0|This album sounds like it was put together by a Lady Gaga wannabe... I am giving this album 2 stars since I paid only 99 cents for it, but not sure if I am going to play it again in the gym, it is too bland even for my treadmill running. LG, you can do much better than this album, we know this for sure! Please try again.

B004RC8NXI|4.0|Comment: This review is written by an older guy from the \\"free love\\" Emerson Lake and Palmer, Black Sabbath, Yes, and Beatles generation. I don't usually watch \\"chick flicks\\", but i'm a movie collector, so some \\"get through\\". This film is a (hard core) formula movie for this genres (chick flick). I have to say that when this movie started I couldn't help but think how \\"prissy and \\"gay-like\\" (the new generation depicted by this movie...) was looking and acting. As the story started to go... it started to become entertaining. One thing that I just couldn't get past was the casual way people had sex with each other. I mean even back in my day of \\"free love\\" (despite what you may of heard or read) when you were \\"boning a girl\\" you liked, you didn't pass her around like a reefer (as some of the characters were doing). My \\"distilled\\" comment for this movie is that if you strip away all the \\"fluff\\" around the main story it is somewhat entertaining. Is it believable or true to life... not a chance in hell. Please don't \\"flame mail\\" me as some have done in the past. This is a \\"free and open\\" venue for us to express our opinions. Thank You.

B004K4AVAG|1.0|Got hooked by the .99 download offer so I thought I'd try it. Unfortunately, it is NOT the whole album for that price. 3 songs and the digital book. The three songs that they allowed are hopefully not the best ones on the album since they really fell short. So I'm giving this album a one star based on the fact the offer was not good and the 3 songs offered were not that great.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Say what you will about Lady Gaga, but I don't remember any artist in recent memory that created a CD in which each song has a different vibe, melody and feeling. Most artists put out a CD of songs that all blend and sound the same, but when you listen to Gaga's new album, each song has its own voice, melody and feel.     I love the darker songs, and how she incorporates real issues into her tunes. No one else is doing that right now.     I'll continue to support her because although she samples heavily from older music (which I kind of love) she twists it and makes it her own. If I were you, I'd invest in the Deluxe version. The three added songs are great and the remixes are perfect.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|After the first episode, I wasn't sure I would like this.  By the third, I was \\"hooked\\" on Dexter.  The writing is excellent with many well-developed sup-plots. The cast make this show believeable, especially Michael C. Hall.  I would highly recommend.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|A success. That's all you need to really know. Get it, and get ready to hear tracks from it for the next year or more. I'm not out to address Gaga's history, her personality, or influences, whatever. I'm here to talk about the music, so let's dig into the album. And indeed, I use the word 'album' here after some consideration because this an album. This is not, as one often encounters nowadays in mainstream pop, a smattering of singles spread among a bunch of filler songs that really don't matter. This is an album; every song has its place and purpose, and there are actually no songs that I would toss out as superfluous. Contrary to The Fame, this album actually feels like a statement from Gaga, rather than a couple singles and then padding.           What about the songs? Well, let's be realistic. It's Lady Gaga, so you can expect nothing beyond the basic bass-driven, 4/4 perfect-tempo-for-grinding-at-the-club song over and over again; literally almost every song is at the same tempo, has the same song structure, and is driven by very similar beats (with the obvious exception of You and I). But that's Lady Gaga, and if you're expecting something else, walk back out the door right now, and take your pretensions and snobbery with you.           Let's not quibble about religious allusions, or whether Gaga ripped off so-and-so (SERIOUSLY WHO CARES), or whether Lady Gaga is this or that or whatever. We've already established that this is an album full of simple pop songs, but are they good pop songs? Unambiguously yes. Gaga has an ear for hooks and melodies that very few artists have nowadays. Few people seem to appreciate how incredibly rare and difficult this is; chords and songs are easy compared to melodies. Yet here we have an album full of perfect hooks: the pre-chorus of Bloody Mary (\\"dance, dance, dance, with my hands, hands, hands...), the near-wordless chorus of Heavy Metal Lover, even the completely nonsensical \\"German\\" at the beginning of Scheiße (personal note: I speak German, and it is not ANY sort of German I've ever heard. besides the word scheiße). All of it is perfectly conceived to stick in your head, and it will. And this album sees Gaga expanding her musical palette far beyond The Fame. There's nothing drastic (she ain't about to drop a mandolin solo or something), but some delicate and clever instrumentation on each track shows off a much more mature songwriter (as well as some influences from other genres). I also really appreciate her newly found restraint on some songs; The Fame (+TFM) was all about bombastic overblown melodies and choruses, but here Gaga is content to chill a little more on choruses, to much greater effect. As mentioned, the choruses of Bloody Mary and Heavy Metal Lover are perfect examples of this restraint.     One more compliment is in order, and this one is a little less immediate, but touches on (in my mind) the real reason for Gaga's appeal. That reason is this: Gaga writes songs full of beautiful and instantly gratifying chord changes, and that really drives her appeal. Clarification: we could have another pop song in the vein of Pachabel's Canon (see the Axis of Awesome '4 Chords' video), or we can have Bloody Mary, where those chords in the pre-chorus could serve as the basis of a beautiful folk/indie/whatever song if it was stripped of its heavy beat and other pop-isms. The same thing applied to TF/TFM; if you took her chords and used them in a different setting, they would be lovely. They are here as well, but sometimes it's harder to realize that due to the poppy nature of the music. I mean, just look at the title track - the whole track follows the chords of the 'na-na-na' part of Hey Jude exactly (as in, much more exactly than Express Yourself, you time-wasting armchair critics). Born This Way sounds anthemic and triumphant for the same reasons Hey Jude did 40 years ago. She writes good chord changes. That's all I'm saying.           So the good - strong melodies, strong chord changes, playing to her strengths with powerful beats and simple song structures, and a widening of the musical palette, ever so slightly. Let's talk about the bad. First, a general problem: Gaga still can't write major-key, optimistic pop songs. All her biggest hits are minor-key, dark, driving pop songs like Bad Romance, Telephone and (soon enough) Scheiße and Government Hooker. So songs like Fashion of His Love, You and I, Hair, Edge of Glory and (somewhat) Highway Unicorn aren't going to stick like Scheiße and Government Hooker. Well, Edge of Glory might in that 'oh my goodness it's the end of the night and we're all drunk and i love my beautiful friends and i'm gonna sing edge of glory way too loud and poorly with my arms wrapped around friends' sense. Sorta like when Nsync or Backstreet Boys or really any 90s anthem comes on. But I digress. Other things I don't like - Government Hooker is a rather obnoxious \\"sketchy club\\" song with little of the melodic appeal of the rest of the album (but it's going to be a big hit, guarenteed). Judas - Judas literally sounds like someone said to Gaga \\"hey, remember Bad Romance? do that again so we can have a single!\\" So Gaga churned out this totally vapid, bland single that borders on self-parody. Seriously, compare Judas and Bad Romance and their hooks. I wonder if Gaga even likes this song.          Alright, enough. So what am I trying to say here? Well, first off, this is an album, not a collection of singles with crap in between. Well done to Gaga there. Second, her melodies, hooks and beats are strong as ever. Third, she still can't write optimistic ballads. Whatever. So this is a strong album, and not just for pop. It's relentlessly fun, passionate, catchy and almost perfectly conceived as a vision of Gaga's music. No five stars from me personally - she's not changing the game here, and I'd love to see her take her perfect winning formula and see how far she can stretch it. I think she'd do well to push herself a little more outside her comfort zone. But I do give four stars, because this is as good as pop music gets. And pop haters, armchair critics, music snobs - lighten up or get out. I guarentee you aren't snobbier than me when it comes to music, but the difference is I know (rather, we the Lady Gaga fans know) how to lighten up and enjoy simple fun music for what it is. And that's really what music is about, eh? Connecting with people (which Gaga clearly does) and bringing out these simple emotions that reality usually isn't able to provide. So let us dance and scream the words out loud, while you guys sit stuffed up complaining about the state of music nowadays or something. Gaga is dope. Peace.    Favorite tracks: Scheiße, Heavy Metal Lover, Bloody Mary
B003UESJH4|5.0|I often purchase just released DVD's and books on Amazon as they offer some of the least expensive prices for these items, and I am a careful shopper. I had not seen The King's Speech during its general release, but had heard of its quality and excellence, as well as its Academy Award winner status.  All the raves are well deserved and completely justified. It is an extremely well done film. Writing, directing, acting, all excellent. Colin Firth gives a many and varied dimension in his portrayal of King George VI, the reluctant King. Based on a true story, which was revealed after the King's death, it narrates the tremendous speech impediment which threatened his ascension to the throne after his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated. The relationship between \\"Bertie\\" (George VI) and Lionel Logue, a former actor who is determined to cure him, is fascinating in its simplicity and mutual friendship. Logue dares to treat Bertie as a human being and equal, although giving deference to his royal heritage, which defines the support and confidence that Bertie needs to achieve victory. The viewer can understand what has caused the impediment, viewing Bertie's relationship with his father and mother, George V and Queen Mary. Tremendous. The ambiance of the historical era of Hitler's ascent to power and the uncertainty and fear underscores Bertie's shaken confidence in his ability to \\"do the job\\" is all the more worthwhile as he is able to finally give the speech to his people at the onset of war between Germany and England. One rejoices at his victory, in which he finally also realizes that he does indeed possess the the qualities and confidence, which will give him the rightful place in history. His friendship with Logue lasts throughout his lifetime. A wonderful movie about two remarkable men.

B004TJ1H3C|4.0|I have been a big fan of all the Stargate movies and shows over the years.  SGU definitely took the most time getting used to.  The first season was a mixed bag of 1 or 2 star episodes with a few 3 star \\"it has great, potential\\".    I equated it to reading the first Lord of the Rings book, where there was way too much detail and backstory, and not enough action, story twists, humor.    So watch season 1 with a grain of salt.  Instead of 2 or 3 episodes to lay out the story, they stretched it to more like 9 or 10 episodes to introduce the large cast and how they came to be both on the ship and themselves as individuals.  It eventually helps you understand the diversity of the group, as there are a lot more primary players in this series than any other SG cast, but overall they spent way too much time focusing on that alone.      Once you get past all that (and Rush's hate/hate/like/hate? relationship with the crew), the end of Season 1 and all of Season 2 is where you really get into the twists, turns, action and off-handed comedy you are more used to in a Star Gate storyline.  This is when the writers began to really put forth some interesting story arcs.  Some \\"2nd tier\\" actors getting killed or \\"saved\\", tweaking some old-school SG1 story arcs to fit the Destiny's situation like multiple twists on time travel, new enemies and old enemies at every turn, previous cast cameos to tie the various series together.  My guess is that they finally heard the critics (or heard they were getting cancelled) and started writing more SG style to appease the masses.    All in all, I really would have liked to have had a more definitive conclusion to SGU, and at least 1 more season to attempt to wrap everything up.  Unfortunately I doubt there will be a true conclusion.  The same could be said with the other series to an extent, but I don't see a 2 hr movie conclusion to the \\"message from God?\\" storyline.
0670022411|5.0|I do not normally read romances.  I'm more of an epic fantasy (ie. lord of the rings, mistborn trilogy, etc) type of gal.  Additionally, when I read that this book was going to involve vampires, I wanted to skip over this book.  I am SICK of vampires.  The media has over dosed on the vampire concept and I can no longer stand hearing about Twilight, True Blood or any other vampire movie or show in the media any longer.  However, after seeing this book land the #1 spot on the New York Times best seller list for several weeks in a row, I finally decided to give this book a try.    Wow, I was impressed.  The first thing that hooked me to the story was all the back story for the characters.  Pretty much anything that wasn't romance related interested me in this book.  The discussion about how vampires, witches and daemons came about all the way down to DNA and what lies in future for each creature was fascinating.  This is a fresh and original take on the mythology of these creatures.  There is a rather large cast of characters all with their own personality.  Half way through the book, I still wasn't buying the romance but I was loving everything else.  It was just very very interesting.  there is some action in this book but there wasn't a lot but that is okay.  The author does an outstanding job delving into the main character and how she feels and her back story.  Towards the end of the book, I finally got interested in the romance.      The only con of this book is the rather cliche character types of the two main characters, the witch Diana and the vampire Matthew.  Matthew is the typical protective, macho, gentle hearted, caring, handsome muscular guy.  And like most modern stories these days involving women, Diana is the typical headstrong, feminist, act before you think, totally devout and loyal and intelligent woman.  But then again, this is a romance book so these character types are expected and can be found in probably, 80% of all modern romance novels.  I don't normally read romance books so this is just my assumption.    For those of you who are not normally romance readers, I can tell you that there is so much more to this book than the romance.  I highly recommend that you pick up this book.  Don't be put off by \\"oh, just another vampire romance\\" type of thoughts.  I cannot wait until the next book comes out sometime in 2012.

0307887960|4.0|I've enjoyed reading this book and the science behind the weighloss plan.  The plan seems to be fairly easy to follow and I've had significant success with the diet in just 2 weeks.  The book can be read in stages as you progress through your diet while retaining all the knowledge of Dr. Dukan.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|For me downloading this album has taken patience but it is worth it.  Just don't close out the downloader.  Lady GaGa is the modern form of Madonna and she will probably be around for a long time as she keeps putting out the hits.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This is an outstanding novel. It held my interest from beginning to end, reaching a dramatic conclusion that effectively brought several story elements together.<br /><br />The hero is Harry Hole. (That's probably a cool name in Norway.) He's a police detective based in Oslo. Demon Rum is always lurking in his shadows; an old flame, Rakel, still lights his fire. He's slovenly and somewhat misanthropic. Harry is also iron tough, clever, and incredibly resourceful. His sometimes eccentric behavior is trumped by his ability to catch the bad guys.<br /><br />In this novel, Harry is on the trail of a serial killer, possibly Norway's first. This killer builds snowmen which bear little resemblance indeed to the cheerful Frosty of Christmas fame.<br /><br />The plot includes a debilitating hereditary disease, sons who don't know their fathers, and missing digits.<br /><br />I read and reviewed for this site author Jo Nesbo's Redbreast, giving it five stars. This book is much better
B004K4AUZW|5.0|If you come into Born This Way and expect to hear the exact same type of dance-pop that laced The Fame and, to a lesser extent, The Fame Monster, you will likely be a bit disappointed with this album. It isn't bubblegum.     Have you ever looked up videos of a young Gaga on YouTube? Have you watched stripped down performances of her dance-pop singles? If you have then you should realize that at her heart Lady Gaga is a rocker chick who has an instinctive ability to break these songs down to a pop enough core that they connect with a broader audience. However, in Born This Way, Gaga didn't feel the need to break the songs down as far as she did previously.    I think this is smart as it keeps her about 30 paces ahead of the Gaga mimickers who have sprung up during the past two years and the established stars who have transitioned to trying to claim a piece of her thunder (Katy Perry, I love your music too, but your public persona has become more and more Gaga in the past 18 months.)    Gaga really shows off her voice in Born This Way - in a much more clear and resonant manner than she was able to with The Fame. \\"Marry the Night,\\" \\"Electric Chapel,\\" \\"Edge of Glory\\" and \\"You and I\\" are show pieces from this perspective. Electric Chapel and Marry the Night are superb fun to listen to.     In reference to comments in a prior review about \\"Judas\\" and \\"Bloody Mary.\\" The in-your-face parallels in songs like Judas and Bloody Mary are poetic in their power while not getting too broken down in the details of a bad relationship. Judas without the name of Judas as the song would become another cliche about loving someone who always betrays that love. By using the name Judas, it is given from the start that this is betrayal at its most extreme and the song can operate more freely within its dance beat without having to explain this fact throughout 2 verses and an extended bridge cycle. I, personally, don't really understand people who freak out about her writing a song with the name Judas as the title. It was probably chosen simply because Benedict Arnold didn't fit the rhythm as well.     Sorry for the ranting, but really, read some poetry and come back to the imagery in Lady Gaga's songs and let us know if it's still complicated. I'm thinking it will not be.    I think if you are looking for a different but well-crafted Gaga sound, you will find it in Born This Way. The sounds are powerful, the lyrics cleverly crafted and the voice stunning. (Stunning because Gaga lets her songs lead her voice instead of constantly having to show off how well she sings.) If you want pure pop, you will not find it here.    ETA: The bonus tracks definitely add a spark to the CD. I like the dance-esque remixes for work-outs. If you can grab Born This Way for a cheap price the first week of release, do that and then download the special edition tracks separately. After the sale prices end, just splurge on the Special Edition.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|Amazon should've known better and anticipated the download volume when they decided to offer up a mainstream popstar's new album for a buck.  I know the company is trying to get a leg up in the so-called \\"Cloud Wars,\\" but this experience has turned me off entirely to Amazon mp3s.  I'd rather just pay full price on iTunes and avoid the hassle.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|This entire show is an absolute catastrophe. Boring, illogical, characters that no one cares about, and stories that are horrendous at best. To put a \\"Stargate\\" label on this garbage makes a mockery of the franchise.  This show is truly the absolute worst in the \\"Stargate\\" franchise. Heck, I don't even consider this to be part of the real Stargate franchise, since it is a complete Battlestar Galactica rip off. This wouldn't be bad in itself if it were done well, but this show is just atrocious. From bad writing, to bad acting to horrible interaction of characters, this show blows. To slap the \\"Stargate\\" label on it and peddle it as part of the franchise is unforgivable. This show is so bad it wouldn't even be considered science fiction by most fans. For all you true fans of the Stargate universe (the franchise, not the show) stay away, you have been warned.  The show was anything but a \\"Stargate\\" show. This series had absolutely nothing to do with the Stargate Universe other than it had a stargate in it. True fans of the Stargate Universe shudder at the mere mention of this atrocity. Thank God and all that is holy that we have been put out of our misery by its cancellation. The 2 seasons it was on was 2 seasons too many.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|...and frankly, why would it be? \\"The Fame Monster\\" sounded nothing like \\"The Fame\\", and so it makes sense that \\"Born This Way\\" would sound nothing like \\"The Fame Monster\\". She definitely keeps experimenting with sounds, and this is new territory for her - with the exception of Judas (aka - Bad Romance 2.0). There are definitely 80s and 90s vibes from many tracks, as well as a rock/metal theme throughout as well, but she still manages to make everything sound unique and current. Great dance music. An inspirational, \\"love yourself\\" theme from many tracks. Overall, a GREAT album, and for $.99? Heck, buy it even if you're just curious! It's a steal!    Edit: Reviewing the album, not the download difficulties. Downloaded from Gaga's site (digital, physical album, and vinyl) before I saw this deal. My apologies to people having trouble getting the full album downloaded!

0307477479|5.0|When I commenced reading this novel, the interplay and jumping about made me wonder if I would enjoy or be able to remember who was who and what the relationships between the parties were.  For instance, the last chapter deals with a character we really only meet in the beginning, who crosses over when he works with a child of someone we met in the middle, whose mother we learned had  once worked with the old man in the last chapter - but that old man is someone  we meet as  a young man in the first chapter.<br /><br />And, like James Joyce's great work [[ASIN:1936041723 Ulysses]], this author recants the tale in different form - even in a novel and new concept - 40-50 pages of slides are presented near the end which tell the story of a  pre-teen's angst with parents:  a reformed sexaholic kleptomaniac mother and unknowing and less revolutionary father, who really is the savior/mending needed for the mother.<br /><br />But, if slides and interwoven tales are not what you crave, this author can also deliver prose. \\"At the end of that first day, dopey from sun, they'd showered, changed back into their clothes, and sat on a flagstone terrace where a pianist rolled out harmless melodies on a shining upright.\\" Or, \\"Most students' rooms are like hamster burrows padded with scraps and tufts of home - pillows and stuffed doggies and plug-in pots and furry slippers. . . \\"<br /><br />Interestingly, the stories are unique but can be truly depressing.  My favorite character has a cameo in the middle where a has-been actress is given the part of courting a genocidal general to earn PR favor.  The act is wonderful, and how it ends is amazingly decrepit but funny.  One must wonder though, do real life famous movie and television actresses fall prey to such roles when their screen careers fail, and is this all that is given to them when the last curtain has fallen?<br /><br />This won the Pulitzer in 2011 for story and content.  The story is so unique, that it makes many other great novels of these recent years pale in comparison.  And, the sex, drugs, rock and roll theme is something the younger baby-boomers can enjoyably soak up.  The style, especially the utilization of ppt slides and later the texting language of youth, incorporates the modern narrative experienced most often by the children who sit in today's classrooms - schools as well as universities.  In short, she has crossed the line from the elders to the younger generation in one piece of fiction.<br /><br />This is a novel worth reading, even if some of the more modern styles and complex character references were not easy for this baby boomer.rs pale in comparison.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|Americano alone is worth the $.99 if you are hesitant. My new favorite song, destined to be motivating for any project you have going on. Plus Judas...come on. I'd pay full price for just a few of the gems on this.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|when i originally purchased this, Amazon was having technical difficulties so it didn't download. but now every song is there in my cloud player and its all good. i knew Amazon would come through!<br /><br />i don't recall it saying this version was an edited version. i prefer my music uncensored. if the language bothered me then i wouldn't bother buying it. isn't that why we have free speech laws?<br /><br />the music itself is okay. i like born this way. there are good beats. its not ultra deep philosophy its just good rocking stuff.<br /><br />for those who trash it, i say, you cant please everyone all the time.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I am a huge fan of Lady Gaga and was thrilled to see the whole album for 99 cents! I've only gotten 5 of the 15 songs, but I have no doubt that in time Amazon will fix this problem! Great deal!!! I love what I've heard so far! Thanks Amazon!
0374290024|4.0|This is a very scholarly book, which goes back in history some 1.7 million years to earlier \\"humanoids\\" before showing the world-wide spread of Homo sapiens.  Next, Dr. Morris shows how climate and geography caused certain regions to develop faster from hunter-gatherers to farmers, to industrialization, then to technology and globalization.  As the human world becomes more complex and full of conflicts, our problems are likely to become too big for nation states to solve on their own, and geography no longer plays a crucial role.    This long book goes into many details and sidelines that make its thesis harder to follow and grasp than, for example, Jared Diamond's two wonderful books \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" and \\"Collapse\\", but it gives us reason to be concerned that just as the 19th century was dominated by England and the 20th by the USA, the 21st could end up being dominated by China.
B0051QK87S|4.0|I got the .99 version of the album and purchased the 3 songs that aren't on the regular edition. only for those 3 songs not to download! great from the songs i've heard so far though!
B004K4AUZW|1.0|There has been so much hype leading up to the release of Gaga's latest effort, the expectations for her to deliver a great album are paramount. However, from the very beginning with Marry the Night and each song thereafter those expectations and hope for a great album are let down bit by bit. Some call it more sophisticated than The Fame and Fame Monster. Yet, Born This way never really delivers. There are indeed good musical ideas and gaga's vocal performance on songs shows she can really sing but the songs ultimately fall flat and end up more boring than compelling. It's too bad also that Gaga is so set on preaching her message that she failed to really deliver on the musical elements that truly make a song a good song. For those that adore Gaga this will be amazing. She will sell millions but that alone doesn't make this anything other than it is, just a mediocre set of songs.
1400156335|1.0|Buyer beware the Cd's don't like to play. Otherwise the audio for this book is excellent I enjoy the reader and her expression very much. I had to return the Cd's and get the MP3 for this and it works much better.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Great album especially for .99 cents. saw Lady Gaga at Lollapalooza last year and she was just a brilliant performer. still would buy this album even on a regular price. Thanks amazon or Lady Gaga for a great deal which is quite rare these days.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|In every way that one can be born, she's done it, coming through vibrantly and brilliantly, even theatrically, her voice nailing every note.  You couldn't ask more of a musician who truly loves her art and her fans.  Gaga, you shine...or maybe you've outshone yourself here! Born This Way showcases a more mature and discerning artist at an escalating trend of development.  I love The Fame and always will...but this here goes beyond that larval, quite competent Gaga, to a full-blown metamorphosis of revolutionary rebirth. This is a lulu of a Gaga, who channels everyone from Madonna to Siouxie Sioux on her very own terms, surpassing herself, and, in her own way, them.  My 20 year old daughter and I are both fans, and we each bought our own copies!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I work on a site that interviews a different speculative author every month. One of the questions we always ask is: What is your favorite speculative novel? Aside from classics by C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, Ender's Game often comes up as an answer. So I knew I had to add it to my list of books to read. And I finally have.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed it. I found the world well-imagined, the pacing brisk, and the characters believable. The main character, Ender, was especially good. Anyone who has ever felt out-of-place or bullied can easily identify with him and his story.<br /><br />Plus Ender's Game has some depth. It wrestles with individual destiny and how often it is shaped not by the person themselves, but by the people and situations around them. It is a great theme, and perfectly suited for science fiction. I appreciate how the author explored it. I didn't find this book, as Library Journal said, \\"...a scathing indictment of the military mind\\" but rather an honest look at some of the realities and brutality of war, and that it is a game that is best played to win.<br /><br />The only thing I could have used more of from this story was description. Card seems to be from the camp that says leave as much up to the reader's mind as possible. That's a valid way of thinking--I obviously still enjoyed the book. But there were definitely some places where I wanted to say \\"Man, turn on the lights here, because I can't see anything!\\"<br /><br />That said, I'm glad I finally got to read Ender's Game. It was a fun and thought-provoking ride.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|So after over six months of teasing Born This Way, and no less than four singles released before the album itself, Lady Gaga's second full-length album is finally upon us.  And what an album it is!  The woman formerly known as Stefani Germanotta has delivered a record so meticulously-crafted and so sonically energetic, it's really difficult to know where to begin describing it.  Right off the bat, it's important to note that this is NOT The Fame, nor The Fame Monster.  Not by a long shot.  If you're expecting more \\"Poker Face\\" or \\"Telephone\\", you will be sorely disappointed...and I would feel sorry for you for not opening yourself up to this fantastic album.  Born This Way is a magnum opus, a true pop masterpiece the likes of which is rarely seen nowadays.  With this album, Lady Gaga has attempted to become more than what she was, and it shows.  Born This Way is big, it's bold, it's a behemoth of a record that from start to finish pounds the listener with sonic overload.  But rather than being grating, it's strangely alluring.  It's an album in the truest sense of the word, and it's absolutely incredible.    At its core, Born This Way is a pop album.  But as it plays on, it begins to morph into more.  From its strong opener, the pounding \\"Marry the Night\\", the album doesn't slow down.  The first half of this 17-track special edition is an eclectic barrage of dark pop.  The raunchy \\"Government Hooker\\" gyrates and pulses with a sexy and sleazy beat, and it's infectious.  \\"Americano\\", for as out-of-place as it seems with its Flamenco and Mariachi-inspired sound, fits in extremely well with the rest of its collection.  \\"ScheiBe\\" is absolutely flawless, sounding somewhat reminiscent of something from Fame Monster, but so much darker.  Its pulsing beat just screams for a single release.  \\"Bloody Mary\\" slows things down, but is still incredibly haunting and mesmerizing and features some excellent low vocals from Gaga.  And the bright \\"Fashion of his Love\\" stands out as oneof my favorite songs on the album.  Yes, it sounds like a modern-day interpretation of Whitney Houston's \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\\", but I honestly don't care.  This song gives me goose bumps, and makes me seriously want to get up and dance around the room!      From there, the album shifts into and different direction...one dominated by glam rock, 80's arena rock with hints of metal thrown in for good measure.  \\"Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)\\" resonates with a couple of Journey songs mashed together.  While the song has a very irregular pattern, after a while you realize it's working really well.  \\"Electric Chapel\\" begins with raging electric guitars and the fury never lets up.  \\"The Queen\\" is an odd one, melding two completely different rhythms into one song, ending with an 80's electric guitar solo.  \\"You and I\\", which Gaga has performed live for the past few months, sounds more evolved here.  Brian May of Queen joins Gaga in a song that's obviously inspired by that legendary band.  \\"You and I\\" is definitely a highlight of this album.  Finally, the album culminates in the fantastic \\"The Edge of Glory\\", which is one of the finest endings an album could ever hope to get with its Pat Benatar-ish vocals, saxophone solo and its haunting message.    Obviously it goes without saying that Born This Way will be an extremely divisive album.  Lady Gaga began her career (and found enormous success) with your typical pop/dance sound.  The Fame was a great dance record.  It gave listeners something familiar, but at the same time showed an exemplary level of sophistication and charisma.  The Fame Monster took that formula and made it even more unique.  Born This Way is a totally different animal altogether.  Because of this it's prone to being misunderstood.  Gaga has said that the album is more in line of what she's really capable of, which implies that this is the album she's wanted to make, and upon listening to it it's plainly obvious.  The album sounds as though Gaga has overseen every tiny aspect of its creation.  The result is one of the best pop albums to come around in a long time.  Born This Way is just as legendary as it was touted to be.  It is a pop masterpiece, a true listening experience and completely worthy of belonging to the biggest new pop star of the decade!
0739370642|4.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to read this book because of the mixed reviews and length, but two close friends loved it so I got an inexpensive used copy of the abridged audiobook.  Once I got into the story I found myself mesmerized by it.  I loved the two main characters and will do this again for the second title.  I noticed that the abridged and unabridged copies were not read by the same men.  After listening to a short version of the unabridged CD I liked the voice of the reader of the abridged version better.  I hope he does the abridged version of the 2nd story too, but I haven't been able to find that out yet.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Everything mentioned by the other reviewers is true.  This is not an action-packed book like Ender's Game.  Nonetheless, it is spectacular in its own right.  I devoured this book in a few days, sneaking in a few pages at every opportunity.<br /><br />However, I do want to mention an anomaly specific to the Kindle version of this book.  In the Kindle version, it starts with Orson Scott Card's introduction.  Unfortunately, the introduction was written with the assumption that you've already read the book.  My guess is that it was originally included as part of a re-release package, like a DVD with a Director's Commentary.  The problem is that the introduction spoils a few of the major mysteries of the book.  I didn't realize it until too late.  The book was still quite enjoyable, but I think I'd have enjoyed it more without the spoiler.  So, if you're reading the Kindle version, I recommend that you skip ahead to chapter 1.  Read the introduction later.
B004K4AUZW|2.0|I was expecting something really amazing. All the hype about this album didn't help. I am disappointed with the lyrics most of all. They're boring and generic. Every song on this album seems to have been made for shock value. \\"You and I\\", and \\"Bloody Mary\\" are the only songs that I think stand out as creative and well made. I don't want to listen to this album over and over again like I did with Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster.

1594202842|1.0|I did not like this book and really won't recommend it -- except to argue with anyone who agrees with author Chua that she has an imitable or admirable parenting style. Her tone was superior and smug, all the while mostly a \\"brag book\\" about her talented, abused daughters and how SHE made them so successful. I don't understand a husband and father standing by listening to the insults and humiliation, disguised and excused as a fierce maternal love, heaped by his wife onto his precious daughters. No, thank you. I guess I'm of the mind that parenting impressionable children and raising them to be responsible adults is difficult and lacks a fool proof road map, but I would choose a method and style that, though strict in some ways, would not be cruel.<br /><br />I would also like to talk to children who have been raised like this, and also to see if later on, they do likewise to their own. This, to me, is more than mere culture difference. But of course, just my opinion. We are all going to ultimately raise our children in a manner that we deem appropriate. I considered much of what this mother did to be child abuse and wonder if child protective services would have intervened had they been called?!<br /><br />If you must read it, borrow, don't buy.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is a show that I can watch over and over again. I have seen the first season many times, just because I want to show other people how great it is. It has many different stories going on, it does not just deal with Dexter's life. This keeps it interesting, although everything that goes on with Dexter is entrancing. The show is kind of disturbing at times, but it is something that you get used to and adds to the uniqueness of the show. I love it and am a dedicated Dexter fan, no matter what happens.

0887431453|5.0|I've really enjoyed using this workbook with my almost-3-year-old. It's a very thick book with tons of color printed, tear-out pages for your child to work on. My daughter loves coloring in it, but also enjoys sitting down with mom and learning. So far she hasn't made it past the tracing lessons in the beginning of the book, writing letters in the next section has proved to be a little too advanced for her. But I think this book is going to be a great starter textbook for her as she nears the pre-school age. We plan on homeschooling, and while homeschooling technically begins at the beginning of your child's life, this is a great \\"starter\\" work book for the 3 year-old.
0060392886|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, could not put it down. The moment I turned to the acknowledgments, I actually felt my heart sink. I wanted to read more. The book is a fabulous read, from beginning to end. Each chapter written by a different member of the group or one of their many managers. I fell in love with each of them a little more by the end. The book follows the life of Nikki, who starts his life alone, with pretty much no mother or father. This lack of a father plays into his self destructive behavior throughout the book. He goes through women like I go through purses, and treats them the same as well. He simply has no respect for himself, for his band mates, for women, for anything. Then you have Tommy. Oh god he is such a child!! He has it all, women, Playmates, money, mansions, cars, money, and he still can't handle it. He hates being ignored, thats his issue. His parents use to punish him by ignoring him, so he hates being ignored, which leads to his arguments with all his friends, girlfriends, and wives. I love the guy, he is truly talented, but what a giant baby! Mick is still Mick. I still don't really know a thing about him, other than he is a schizo and is older than the other guys. Vince was the most moving of the characters. Now Vince is a total douchebag. Period. I mean, this guy is the definition of spoiled, narcissistic, and just plain arrogant. He knows he's talented, he knows he's gorgeous, plus he's rich, which equals completely annoying. There was one chapter that really got to me, the one where he discusses the death of his daughter Skyler. I read that chapter on the beach, and I lost it, it was absolutely heart wrenching. I cannot imagine what that man must've gone through. Now, after reading this book, and reading all the craziness that Motley Crue is, I was left wanting to read more. What are they doing today, right now? I love the selfish, narcissistic, douchebags! They are truly rock n roll. I recommend this book for anyone that wants to really enjoy a book about a bunch of crazy rock stars that enjoy having sex, doing drugs, and drinking their own pee.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Gaga at the age of 25 has created thought provoking songs and lyrics that in time she is going to design stuff that will put people in AWE! I am excited about her changes with time and age.  I thought the album \\"Born this Way\\" had great scores and changes with fun music with a hint of Rock and Roll.  I love that she acknowledges all artist that have influenced her styles.  Her lyrics are exciting and provoke truth/ raw feelings/ and sharing the \\"hush-hush's\\" in life. She makes no apologies for who she is and expresses her art through her perspective of self and shares with her fans to also be who they are through expression.  There is a sense of belonging and oneness that she instills in her message.  Thank you Gaga for showing all people that no matter what, where and who - they are special!  PS. Thank you Amazon for gifting the album at .99!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|So glad I wasted $1 on the gaga album and got NOTHING! NEVER buy an MP3 from AMAZON as there is no one who cares if you get what you pay for! No one offering money back to all of us who paid for an item we never received. Pushing the excuse that it was too much and just \\"crashed\\" their servers... ummmm, that isn't our problem but I bet they're going to take our stolen money to upgrade those servers!!!
B004KDO2G6|5.0|This is the best classical music video I have ever seen. It was one of those rare occasions where everything went right. These are the finest performances of these great and very familiar works that I've ever heard. Gil Shaham as absolutely amazing in the violin concerto, and Abbado and the orchestra are on top form throughout. The video direction is perfect, the picture is crystal-clear, and, most importantly, the sound quality is the best I've ever heard on a video recording. (Note: the brief travelogue about Palermo, included on the earlier 2005 DVD, is not included here.) This Blu-ray disc is a superb example of what the classical concert experience is all about. Bravo!
0131480057|5.0|I have the paper version of the purple (third edition) of this book.  I also have the green Linux edition of this book.  The purple one was a gold mine of information. I eagerly bought the Linux one, which turned out to be shallow and pretty much useless.     I am happy to report that this new edition is a complete revision of the purple book, with well-rendered integrations of the Linux information, and done in the spirit of the USAH previous editions; in-depth coverage of each topic, each completely and painstakingly updated. It is very clear that a great deal of care and attention was given to every bit of this edition of the book.  I thank Evi and crew for a tremendous job!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Album for $1, can't be be beat.  Lady gaga and amazon are awesome for offering this.  If you're complaining because the servers are a little slow or backed up,...then you suck and get over it.  Oh yeah, apple you suck too.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|It's hard to argue with a 99 cent album, but I can't rate this as more than average.<br /><br />First, note that this version of the album has fewer songs than are included in some of the CD versions (or in the version at iTunes). That's a shame, because the alternative version of \\"Born This Way\\" not included here is worth a listen.<br /><br />Second, there's the music. It's reasonably well-produced and not offensively bad, but for the most part it's derivative \\"dance\\" music that was already old when Madonna did it a decade ago. The best of these tracks is \\"Bloody Mary\\", which sounds like a cross between Madonna and Debbie Harry; at least it made me feel that I'd got my 99 cents worth. \\"Yo&uuml; and I\\" is a departure stylistically, though, and Lady Gaga turns in credible mainstream rock performance.<br /><br />Third--and speaking of \\"Yo&uuml; and I\\"--there's the lyrics. The superfluous umlaut in the title of \\"Yo&uuml; and I\\" is confusing enough, but the phrase itself is also ungrammatical in context. As if to prove that the poor grammar is no accident, the next song (\\"The Edge of Glory\\") includes \\"you and me\\" where \\"you and I\\" would, in fact, be proper. But given rampant illiteracy among pop stars, that's a mere quibble. What's worse is that Lady Gaga seems to be trying so very hard to be \\"deep\\" but comes off instead sounding like legions of college sophomores who discovered the thrills of political engagement and nonconformity during freshman year. Pop music can certainly be poetic, but let's just say that she's no Paul Simon--and, for that matter, she's no Madonna.<br /><br />Lady Gaga is never going to be my favorite artist, but I did find more to like on earlier albums where she stuck to making fun dance music than on this ambitious-but-flawed effort.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I love this CD.  Stevie still has the magic and at 62 she both looks and sounds great.  This CD is quite different from Stevie's usual sound, but it's fantastic.  My favorite sons are 'For What it's Worth' 'Soldier's Angel' and 'In Your Dreams' although I love the entire CD. The music is magic and pure Stevie.
B004EPYZU8|1.0|I have nothing against fun, junk cinema.  But, come on.  This movie was just so hollow.  No real characters, peril or violence with a pulse.  I loved Dawn of the Dead and Watchmen.  So far, Snyder is hit-and-miss with me.  I really wanted to like this one because it looked fun and fun to look at.  Negative.  The visual flare wears out its welcome very quickly, and all you're left with is story, which is preposterous and unfulfilling.  It's just empty trash.  skip it.
0553582461|3.0|I liked this series a whole lot. The Fool, not Fitz kept me reading. I think that the author knew this, that is why the titles were all about the Fool. But, the final book was all about Fitz and his resolution.  Why tempt me with the possibility of Fool and Fitz getting together then having Fitz end up with Molly? I stop caring about Molly once she married Burrish. It is actually kinda icky when you think about how Burrish was like his father figure, and then got his woman, and then he got the woman back when his father figure dies. GROSS.     So I am so disappointed by the ending. More Fool, Less Fitz.  I thought she set us up with the homoerotic theme, then wimped out about at the end.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|By all accounts, \\"The Fame\\" was the perfect debut album for a superstar. It had all kinds of dance music, with crafty beats and tight production. When comparing Gaga's debut against those of Rihanna, Katy Perry, Pink, Britney Spears, Ke$ha, and all her contemporaries, Gaga's album was by far the best of the bunch. There had not been a true debut album by a female pop star that was so excellent probably dating back to Cyndi Lauper's \\"She's So Unusual\\" in 1983, which became the first female debut to ever spawn 5 singles in the top 10. And not since 1988 (Paula Abdul) has a female pop star had multiple number one singles on both the Hot 100 and the dance charts.<br /><br />So, Gaga had much to live up to here, and there is no way possible to please everybody. The attempt to do so can be heard in the overproduction, which has WAY too much reverb, and some of the tracks run too long. But the biggest problem is the quality of the songs. This is a clear example of what happens when an artist is given too much musical freedom too soon, and the songwriters who wrote all of your earlier hits (RedOne) can't come up with songs quite as good the second time around. Witness the high-pitched screeches in \\"Government Hooker\\" in which, after repeating the phrase \\"I am your hooker\\" over and over, she yelps through autotune a long, extended \\"hoooooookaaahhhhhh.\\" And what happened to Gaga's tendency to be Avant-Garde? That has now been replaced with phrases like \\"I'm as free as my hair\\" and \\"It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M.\\" As the album closes, there is a country ballad (\\"You and I) which is a total clunker of a song, and a horrible electro-pop track called \\"Electric Chapel\\" which is more reverb and auto-tune, on a continuous loop.<br /><br />It will be interesting to watch sales for the album during it's second week. \\"Edge of Glory\\" dropped from #3 to #19 on the Billboard chart in one week; a week in which Gaga was on American Idol, The View, and SNL. Not since Michael Jackson's \\"HiStory\\" has a musical album release been this hyped. But unlike Jacko, Gaga got weird too soon, and does not have classic albums like \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\" to fall back on. She is starting to look more like a fading fascination each passing day. Serves her right for trying to \\"reinvent\\" herself before even really establishing herself. Ego will do that I guess.\\"HiStory\\" has a musical album release been this hyped.

031261246X|4.0|Have used the Sysinternals tools since 1999 and having a deep respect for Mark and Bryce, I was looking forward to reading this book.  Malware has increased in sophistication exponentially in recent years, probably because the Russians and Chinese are devoting so much of their technical talent to a nation sponsored effort.  Now, with Stuxnet, it looks like the U.S. and Israel are in the game.  The book certainly highlights the dangers that we face, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  One glitch that I noticed, having worked at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (a GE BWR), was that the control rods on a BWR insert from the bottom of the core using hydraulic differential pressure as opposed to Mark's scenario in the book where the operators cut a cable and allow the rods to \\"fall\\" into the core.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I don't normally review CDs, but I am already in love with this album.  I can actually listen to every song and realize that it is Lady Gaga without listening to monotone tracks and pre-recorded voices.  My musical interests range from Queen to Mew, to Skrillex and Adele.   Gaga just kills this album from start to finish.  Some of the best tracks on the album have not been released, but Edge of Glory and Born this Way are still favs because of the message.
B0013LPS6Q|5.0|I started liking U2 in the winter of 2005 after I heard a small sample song on Mr. Deeds which was \\"The Sweetest Thing in 2002. My favorite songs on Boy is I Will Follow, An Cat Dubh/ Into The Heart, Stories For Boys, The Ocean, A Day Without Me, Another Time, Another Place & Shadows And Tall Trees. I'm glad that I purchased this cd.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Unlike many others, I had no problem buying the album today. I had debated it, because I haven't been amazingly impressed with the early music from it (Born This Way, Judas) and I just didn't know if I wanted to try it. But, for .99, I figured what the heck.    It's okay. That's it. Every song sounds the same. There is nothing spectacular differentiating each song from another. Aside from the oft played Born This Way and the also oft played Judas, there is nothing particularly different-sounding or ground-breaking about the music (though I didn't have any complaints about any one particular song, and \\"Highway Unicorn\\" and \\"The Edge of Glory\\" were kinda catchy at times. Granted, I am not a Lady Gaga fanboy, but I really enjoyed The Fame Monster. I thought the songs were unique, and her talent showed very well.     This, however, feels like she's trying too hard. Okay, I get that she support gays, heterosexuals, transvestites, et. al. I think that's a great message. I get that she has issues with God. I get that she wants everyone to do what's right, and she feels their suffering, and on, and on, and on. But at some point, it feels more like she's saying it for the sake of saying it, because she, in her strange, do-what-you-want way, is trying to be cool for the sake of being cool. Which just makes it come across as trying too hard-which is exactly what she purports to abhor.     Overall, it's not bad. But sorry Little Monsters, it's not great either, and I'm glad I only spent .99 on it.
B00000DFSK|5.0|I got this as a christmas present from a friend & I thought it was really good. Getting a cd like this as a christmas gift was the best ever received christmas present from a friend & I still have it as of today & I still love listening to it with my other U2 cds that I have as a collection.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|For seconds I thought I was listening a Madonna album!  Katy perry, J.Lo and Kylie Minogue latest albums are superior than this \\" born this way\\"    I thank to Lady gaga that she can sing very well in live performance.
B001KVZ6ES|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video of this Blu-Ray is fantastic.  I didn't see any grain at all.  In fact, even when paused, the video is perfect, and without grain.  I give it 10 out of 10.  This movie must have been recorded digitally, instead of on film.  The audio is great also (Dolby TrueHD 5.1), but don't expect a lot of surround sound, since most of the movie is dialog.  The surround speakers do kick in when appropriate.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|Simply put, Amazon dropped the ball. I have stayed away from dealing with Amazon for mp3's, but was swayed by the attractive $.99 deal. I also decided to finally test out their Cloud Player service. What a terrible mistake. I received ONE song for the first 2 hours, then \\"Judas\\" became available at random 20 minutes later. No obvious reason as to why, until I searched Google of course. Then I realize that Amazon is causing this problem for a host of others, and does not support iOS natively for their Cloud Player.           Well...what was the point of me doing this again? I didn't get the album I paid for, and even when I do get the songs, it's a hassle to play them natively on my multiple devices? Regardless of the ability to use CloudPlayer on my iPhone with mobile Safari (which Amazon CLEARLY states will not work), there is no excuse for a lack of an App.        In the end, I can only tell you: Don't bother. Stay away from Amazon, wait for a more put together offering from another company (ie: Apple, Google), and don't let the attractive price convince you that this is a superior deal. After 10 hours I have been given my 14 tracks, which are now somewhat unattractive.       Again, Amazon has seen there final purchase from this customer. iTunes and Google will remain my steady, reliable and more enjoyable sources. Goodbye Amazon.
0553386794|5.0|Like many people, after seeing the first few episodes on HBO I had to get the book. I'm glad I did because this book is full of detail that the TV series leaves out. Definitely worth reading before watching.<br /><br />This world Martin has created seems to be magic-less at least for the time being. Dragons have died off or have been slain, the children are gone, and what lurks beyond the wall seems to stay put. This book is focused on characters and you really get to know them as a reader. You see the world through their eyes and you understand the choices they make (even though they may be foolish or wrong). There is a lot of history behind these major Houses and families with marriages and relationships making everything deliciously more complicated as the story plays out.<br /><br />This book will end with you digging through your pants pocket for that credit card so you can order Clash of Kings.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|It's only May, but I'm calling this the Album of the Year.  I just wish it was longer, but every song on here is great!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|First, I'm not a big fan of lady GaGa. Im not a big fan of \\"pop\\" music at all. But... for $0.99 I'll give anything a try.<br /><br />I see that Lady GaGa is credited with composing one track on the album; is that correct? We should say that producers are the real artists and the performer is merely another instrument at their disposal. That's true of so many pop artists. It's not unique to GaGa by any means.<br /><br />So here you are .... the production value is very good. The loops and beats are flawless. Sadly I didn't really enjoy any of songs but this is matter of personal taste not a reflection of the artist.<br /><br />This album really reminds of Madonna. \\"Born This Way\\" actually borders on plagiarism, It sounds eerily similar to \\"Express Yourself\\". The lack of originality is my biggest complaint.<br /><br />Now: Stop bashing Amazon. Geez you got a new release from a popular artist for less than a buck. I personally had no problems downloading album. On the rare occurrence that a download was sluggish or stalled altogether, Amazon corrected it for me no questions asked.<br /><br />Sure, Amazon learned something about their capacity. I'm confident in the future things will be even better. I don't buy anything from Apple anymore, but I do recall a number of failed downloads; some they comped me for and for others, I was just out of luck.<br /><br />strengths:<br />good production value<br />infectious beats tight groove on most tracks<br />wider subject matter - more variety than previous release<br />Great value at $0.99<br /><br />weakness:<br />totally unoriginal<br />more about shock value than musical credibility<br />album is somewhat of a reflection of a narcissistic personality

1594202710|4.0|In On China, Henry Kissinger provides an extensive study of foreign and domestic Chinese policy. Furthermore, he provides some insightful observations on Chinese mentality and culture mostly in the context of foreign policy and military strategy.<br /><br />In the first few chapter, Mr. Kissinger's provides some background to support his view that China is an ancient civilization proud of her own culture that never felt the need to learn anything from foreign countries. On the contrary, the Chinese assumed that foreign countries should learn from them. This was partially due to the fact that until around mid 19th century, the Chinese economy was responsible for around 30% of the world's GDP and was more developed than most of the Western world. Because of this mind set, China was reluctant to learn from the West and began to fall behind the Western world - economically and military-wise.<br /><br />The chapters following mostly concern Mao Zedong and the important events that occurred during the time he served as Chairman. Mr. Kissinger briefly touches defining events such as the Great Leap Forward and the Culture Revolution, however, he mostly focuses on Mao's foreign policy during the Korean War, Sino-Indian border crisis, and the high tensions between the Soviet Union and China, which almost resulted in an outright war between the two communist giants' countries. The author does not provide a broad review of these events, but rather he focuses on the points he sees to be important in the context of foreign and domestic policy.<br /><br />The really insightful part of the book starts with the establishment of the Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations that Mr. Kissinger was personally involved in. After Mao's era, Mr. Kissinger discusses at length Deng Xiaoping's policies, mostly focusing on the economic reforms and the opening up of China to the world. Kissinger concludes with some advise regarding the future of Sino-U.S. relations.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book isa rather easy read, and is highly recommended for anyone who wishes to expand his knowledge of Chinese history.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|How can i decribe this album,a lack of inspiration really poor melodies,the best songs are plagiate from Madonna's work,music under zero!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Here's the thing...Lady Gaga has always freaked me out. Her crazy fashion sense and erratic behavior can be a major turn-off to many people. However, this is a woman who is totally in control of every aspect of her life. She does whatever she wants to do and doesn't seem to care what other people think...how can you not admire that? And regardless of what you think of Lady Gaga as a person, how can you not appreciate the genius that is her music? Lady Gaga is awesome! She is that perfect mix of pop and dance that is guaranteed to put anyone in a great mood as soon as they start listening to her music. \\"Born This Way\\" is no exception. There isn't a single sub-par track on this CD. Fave songs include \\"Marry the Night,\\" \\"Born This Way,\\" \\"Judas,\\" \\"You and I\\"...the list goes on and on! I just LOVE her...all the weirdness aside! She is probably the most innovative female artist since Madonna, and she deserves mad props. I can't wait to hear what she comes up with next.
B000002MIB|2.0|Just read Sammy Hagar's autobiography and he states in that, that this album is full to the brim with overdubs from Eddie, Alex and subsequently himself. Granted, so have a lot of 'live' albums been notoriously in the past, but few have freely admitted to it. However, it's Hagar's word so clearly it's only one side of the story - but I happen to believe him. This, from a life long David Lee Roth & Van Halen fan.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|The hassle with Amazon's MP3 Downloader were not worth the price. Amazon's tagline that they are building the best customer service in the world should be accompanied by a note stating that it is still under construction.      Downloader didnt work.  Help material hard to find and unhelpful.     Says click here and Amazon will call you. They do call immediately, but it does no good because then they leave you dangling on hold without so much as a time estimate.     Gave up and emailed a help request. Took 15 hours but I eventually got an email response.  It had new instructions and not a word about their server failure. The instructions seem to have worked, but I doubt I'll be back.  Too much headache. Long ways to go in terms of understanding customer needs, server failure or not.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|When you get a highly-anticipated product almost for free, people are going to line up to be first for it.  I'm curious to see how many digital units this incredible deal has sold when the final tally comes in for the 99 cents deal.  It took hours, but I got all 14 tracks + the booklet.  As much as I dislike the idea of the seller (Amazon) editing comments, in this case, they should; let people's reviews of the product stay, but complaints about tech issues/delays should be removed.
B004XWLI4I|3.0|DISCLAIMER:  I did not view this film.  My review is based upon viewing the theatrical trailer, the previews, and reading the Wikipedia synopsis.    After viewing the preview and the trailer, I was 99% interested.  The preview featured a well-shot intro, establishing scene and introducting the main character.  Beautiful location shots, the lead actress looked very credible.  The storyline struck me as comparable to \\"Single White Female\\" with a college student \\"twist.\\"  However, it also seemed to have some interesting, original plot points as well. The soundtrack was also very \\"catchy\\" and appealing.    WARNING SPOILER    Then I read the synopsis and discovered the plotline includes -- Ta-DAH! -- a kitten killing scene (allegedly, the psychotic roommate kills a pet kitten belonging to one of the other characters.)  That was an \\"instant dealbreaker\\" for me. I loathe that particular cliche (psychotic female kills cat or kitten, often in a particularly brutal way.)   END SPOILER    I'm very disappointed.  I might still rent the film, because what I saw looked pretty good in terms of production values.  I'm just tired of that particular scenario.  I'm glad I discovered the spoiler prior to watching because the overall quality made it look like it was above that type of gimmick.  Oh well.
0439023521|5.0|After seeing so much hype for this book I decided to give it a try. I was expecting to really hate it. It is not my usual type of read. The thought of children fighting to the death really disturbed me. As a mother, I thought this concept was completely wrong. Then I read the first chapter. I was completely hooked! Katniss is a young teen who is very strong and independent. She is a fantastic hunter who provides for her mother and younger sister, Prim. When Prim is chosen for The Hunger Games, Katniss steps forward to take her place. Prim is a delicate girl who would have not stood a chance at survival in the games. Katniss could not imagine life without her little sister so she takes her place. Katniss is whisked away along with Peeta, the baker's son to the Capitol to train and ultimately play the game, which is aired on tv much like our reality tv shows. I admired these kids for their bravery. There is a love triangle that seems to be unresolved at the end of this book but then we know there are two more books where I hope the love triangle will eventually be resolved. I appreciated that Katniss is a strong female lead character. The well-written plot is gripping but is also violent and brutal. One word of warning, make sure you have the time to read it because once the games begin you won't want to put the book down! Suzanne Collins does a great job describing postapocalyptic North America without weighing down the storyline. I look forward to reading the next two books in the series and see where the story goes. I highly recommend this book!
B003AO1SVS|3.0|I like their talent and hustle.  A 2 piece band is simple and they have a clean sound.  The start of the album kicks off to the great start and it creates an expectation that the rest of the album will sound like it.  After the 6th track or so, it slows down, and it never picks up.  I'll keep listening to them and perhaps get their old albums, but this one was just OK.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|99 cents? She's practically giving it away as a compensation to make up for the lack of quality. Born This Way is a very disappointing follow up to The Fame Monster. I agree that artists should \\"evolve\\", but she seems to have \\"devolved\\".  I don't know how to put it delicately, it's so bad that the U.S. Government will probably play this record in their interrogations to torture people. Yes this may be the most top selling album out at the moment, but it is still a FLOP in my eyes.  Anyone who gives this album 5 stars is delusional.

0375846735|1.0|It is always a shock when a favorite author seems to drop out on you.<br /><br />I found the first two books of His Dark Materials mesmerizing. The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife created a beautiful and flexible universe, distant enough to be magical but similar enough for us to find a connection to it. Lyra's Oxford and the City of the Specters were beautifully crafted images, resounding with life. The end of the Subtle Knife had me on my seat for a satisfying and suitable conclusion.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass most definitely did not provide this conclusion.<br /><br />I take very little issue with the religious messages that Pullman inserts in his work. I see it as good storytelling, and his universe is easily different enough to distinguish itself from the beliefs of the Christian faithful. The religious messages in this work do not bother me, but the crudeness in how they are executed does.<br />While reading TAS I often felt as though I was reading the work of a different author: an inferior replacement, eager to experiment with bizarre and irrelevant story lines and then wrapping them up into the most dismal deus-ex-machina ending I have ever encountered. His characters transformed from relatable and powerful to overblown and unrealistic. His settings failed to enrapture me: the creative city imagery was gone, and was replaced by grim and hollow vistas of death and overblown fantasy savannas.<br /><br />From the start, Pullman fails to pull off a successful pick up from his cliffhangers in The Subtle Knife. The mysterious characters sent to escort Will at the closing of the Subtle Knife quickly develop into a pair of whining and sarcastic sidekick angels, somehow homosexual despite being incorporeal energy beings, and immediately put a damper on the premise of meeting the wise and powerful Dust Angels we were hoping for. They also put a damper of sorts on the scale of Lord Asriel's conflict - throughout the book, there seem to be no characters or forces capable of much more than shooting a rifle or throwing a spear, even during the final confrontation between the Asriel and the Almighty. Metatron, apparently the most powerful being in the universe, was dragged down into oblivion by an old human hanging off of his leg. The almighty himself ended up as a shriveled and fragile husk hiding behind his followers. I was surprised by this; I expected the fall of the Almighty to be a little more... epic. Somehow. Not a bunch of Asriel's riflemen taking potshots at Russians. If the enemy is so weak and distracted, why is this war being fought in the first place?<br /><br />Pullman also seems to be distracted from his main storyline with a number of irrelevant subplots. I'm not sure the scientist's journey into the land of the truck-people serves any purpose but to give her something to do while waiting for the main characters to find her again. Even the book's namesake, the actual Amber Spyglass, doesn't actually seem to do anything productive or forward the storyline. It feels as though Pullman decided to take a break from his writing and indulge in childlike invention of an alien world - something that is all very well and good on its own, but seems out of place following the streamlined stories of the previous novels.<br /><br />In TAS, Pullman seems determined to leave us with a sad ending, and since the reader has been following these characters for over two books, it is inevitable that he succeeds. But if an author is going to break my heart with deaths and departures, I want him to at least do it with some sincerity. Or at least a little dignity. Pullman makes certain that every couple either dies or is separated, and goes to extraordinary and inventive lengths to patch up the gaping holes in his scenario. For every desperate rationalization that his characters create with remain in contact with each other, Pullman makes an equally desperate invention to keep them apart, none of which are supported by the rest of the series or even the rest of the book. You will feel sad, because it is an emotional ending. But then you will feel cheated, because the sadness so irrational and contrived.<br /><br />My hypothesis: Pullman creates two works of art. The Golden Compass is his first foray into a new universe, and it overflows with life. In fact, it overflows enough that it eases his creation of the Subtle Knife, and he creates a new world filled with beautiful and eerie images of an alternate reality. He plans these books one at a time, and at the end of the Subtle Knife, all the points are aligned. He has a perfect set up, powerful characters, an opportunity to bring the next great fantasy series to a resounding conclusion.<br />And he has no idea what to do, and he blows it. The Amber Spyglass is a mismatched tangle of irrelevant shorelines and desperate attempts to bring all his threads to a knot. The knot is there, but it is stunted and ugly, and it falls apart easily. You will find no closure in this book.<br /><br />More of a shame than anything.he series or even the rest of the book. You will feel sad, because it is an emotional ending.

Yes, the fanservice is a bit over the top and wasn't really needed, yes the new character Mari does seem unneeded, yes the cookoff between Rei and Asuka is a tad bit sexist if you look at everything in a jaded, cynical point of view. But just accept Evangelion with all it's flaws and obscurities, if you can't do that then I have no idea why you'd want to buy this movie. My enjoyment of the movie wasn't affected by any of the things I mentioned above, and if you liked the original series as much as I did then they shouldn't affect you either.   -I didn't care about the fanservice, it doesn't make me any more or less inclined to watch this movie.    -I thought adding a new pilot(Mari) was interesting. I assume they added her in 2.22 to avoid having her look like a last minute add on in 3 or 4. I look forward to seeing her role develop.    -Another reviewer said Rei and Asuka's cookoff was sexist. I admit it can be misinterpreted to be such if you only look at the cooking part, but consider this. Shinji saved Rei in 1.11, and then cooked for her and the others in 2.22. Rei, wanting to return this kindness, wanted to cook for Shinji and the Nerv crew and bring Shinji and his father closer. Asuka, being jealous as usual, must outdo Rei in everything, including cooking. It's not so much that it's sexist, it's just one more thing Asuka must one-up Rei in.    As I said before I'm a big fan of the original series, which I own in addition to 1.11, 2.22, and Death & Rebirth/End of Evangelion.    What I had to do to better understand the Rebuilds was have the prior knowledge of the original series. If you add your knowledge of the characters from the Tv series to the new plot in the Rebuild series then you should see why everything comes out as it has. I was surprised that people were complaining about some scenes being true to the source material. Usually in anime I see people complain about filler and deviation from the original manga/anime. My point being this. Asuka and Rei were both attracted to Shinji in the original series, but neither were able to express it very well. This would obviously not change in the rebuilds as it's one of the most important conflicts between the two. Obviously in a barely 2 hour movie you don't have time to build up a gigantic getting to know you/love you subplot between characters, so the romantic aspect seems rushed, but if you watched the Tv series then you can better understand it.     Also about the Unit 3 test disaster, it differs from the Tv series in that Asuka pilots it instead of Toji. A previous reviewer mentioned this, saying it destroyed a major plot point of the Tv series in that only select individuals can pilot select Eva's. Well I'll be blunt by saying that you're wrong in that regard. Technically speaking, anyone can pilot any Eva as long as the Eva accepts that particular pilot. This is stated in the first episode and others when it's mentioned that Rei can pilot both unit 0 and unit 1 because of her connection to Shinji's mother Yui(which I won't go into because of spoilers). Also, the only reason Toji was Unit 3's pilot in the Tv series was to create the conflict between Shinji and his father, I.E. \\"I hate you dad you made me almost kill my best friend.\\" Where was Toji's special connection to unit 3 hmmm? There wasn't one. If I had to guess the only thing that makes him qualified is his hatred of Eva's and Angels for injuring his sister, and that anger could be useful in a battle where strong willpower is required. Also, Shinji and Asuka are able to jointly pilot Unit 2 when they first meet, further showing other individuals that do not have a special attachment to an Eva can pilot one. In theory, anyone can pilot any Eva, but the Eva's can choose who they accept and who they do not.     ~EDIT~  A previous reviewer mentioned that Shinji's apprehension to kill Asuka while she was trapped in Unit 3 was a dumb plot point because he barely knows her. So your saying that a fourteen year old child not wanting to end another child's life is dumb? He's a scared kid who usually has trouble justifying killing the ANGELS, let alone another human being.     THE SHORT OF IT.  -Yes, a lot of fanservice, if your into that.  -Yes, stunning visuals/sound, good action.  -Yes, a new character with a very, very minor role.  -Yes, a bit of a cookoff between Asuka and Rei that seems rushed but necessarily so.  -Yes, Shinji continues to whine even though he's got every fourteen year old boy's dream. A giant robot and more girls then he knows what to do with.  -Yes it does seem like a lot of plot crammed into 2 hours, but the original series was a mishmash, often in-cohesive, flawed masterpiece as well.    My advice, watch the original series and End of Evangelion before buying the rebuilds, you'll understand them and appreciate them much more then a newcomer to the series would.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Awesome CD. Favorites: Judas, Born This Way, Hair and Edge of Glory.   Thanks Amazon for the .99 deal for students. Amazon made it possible to enjoy great music for almost nothing!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Carole King and James Taylor one of the best muscians and song writers we have known.  Everyone should buy the cd!!!!!
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|When I first watched Haven I was underwhelmed by the acting. I thought Emily Rose's character Audrey was stiff and uncomfortable in her role as an FBI agent with a mysterious background. And let's face it, when Eric Balfour is in the cast, you can almost bet that the show will be a loser. However, I kept watching week after week, and believe it or not, I came to like these guys, even Balfour's black sheep bar owner who has a strange tie to Audrey that we don't see until the end of the season.    I think I became a fan in the episode where we see Audrey reach out and touch her partner Nathan on the arm and we realize that he can actually feel it by the subtlest flash of emotion on his face. This is where the show began to interest me. We begin to see that there is more to Audrey than even we know.    These characters all have some huge secrets and we as viewers aren't going to know them all at once. The strange incidents that happen in Haven are directly tied to whats really going on with our main characters.    By the end of the season I was eager to see more of Haven and all it's odd-ball citizens. SyFy does get some things right. This show is one of them.
0312323867|5.0|I was very skeptical to read this book because I did not like the oh-so shallow Darcy in the least. I decided, though, that Emily Giffin was a fabulous author and would not take this novel in the wrong direction. I am so happy to have read this. Darcy's transformation is very uplifting and sends the message that even under the worst of circumstances, you can change anything about your life. I was bummed that Darcy and Ethan's love didn't take off sooner, but it was still great. I'm very happy with this book. I would recommend it to anyone!
B004K4AUZW|4.0|I'm not a fan of Lady Gaga, but did fork up the whopping 99 cents to purchase this album when it was being sold that way on it's release date. That was probably a good marketing ploy to get non-fans to take a risk and buy this overly hyped artist of the moment without shelving out much money. Who knows maybe new fans can be drawn in.<br /><br />I enjoyed this album. If you have an excellent sound system at home, which I do, the album shines on that. It's got a heavy club sound to it, lots of bass and thumps, techno-dance infused rock anthems abound. If you can even mix all those genres into one. She does. Some finer tracks like \\"Americano\\" which has a flamenco-latin-rock lace to it will no doubt be a big radio hit.  Lady Gaga has an incredible voice that she rarely showcases, but does so in \\"Americano\\".<br /><br />Amidst the deliberate religious messages that abound due to the backlash she receives over her vocally loud approval of gay rights is evident in a very understated and amazing cut called \\"Bloody Mary\\". One wonders if she's attempting to be the deity to the thousands of young people looking to be accepted.  Regardless its one of the best tracks on the album even if there may be some slight homage to Madonna's Like A Prayer era.  She also shows her fun side in tracks such as \\"Hair\\", a tune that will certainly be a gem in the clubs.  In addition, Lady Gaga was clearly a product of the 80's as she pays homage to bands like Journey, Depeche Mode and even Bruce Springsteen.
B004MKM8L8|5.0|Blu-ray is the only way to experience Harry Potter movies at home, and this is no exception.  It sets the stage for the final battle yet to come.  Mostly a \\"road\\" film, it takes place everywhere except for Hogwarts, and with the exception of the somewhat tired plot element of Ron deserting and then returning to Harry's side (just like in Goblet of Fire), the story is gripping and unpredictable.  I can't wait for Part 2 to conclude the saga!
B000FC1MCS|3.0|This book seemed more like a research project with interesting results than a literary gem that many other reviewers seem to refer to it as. Most authors take readers on a journey with a start point and and end. I'm not sure I found the end.   Mr. Haddon does a wonderful job exposing us to a young man and his family as they deal with the issues involved with someone who is within the autism spectrum disorder. The guilty mother, a struggling father and the amazing young man who has great capabilities in some areas, and severe deficits in others. Autism and it's prevelance in our society is a curious thing. Kudos to Mr. Haddon in opening our eyes to a issue that many struggle with everyday.  In my humble opinion a book like \\"The Shack\\" is a literary gem.
B003BWERF8|5.0|I have had a set of bluetooth headphones for use with my phone for some time.  It had never occurred to me that I could use them with my ipod.  Enter the i10s Bluetooth iPod Transmitter.<br /><br />I ordered this not expecting much.  Much to my amazement, the ease of pairing this transmitter with my Motorola headphones was astounding.  I simply plugged the transmitter into the ipod and turned on the headphones.  After a few seconds the rapid blinking of the blue light on the transmitter slowed indicating that it was ready.  As soon as I brought the headphones to my head, I could hear the music loud and clear.<br /><br />The ability to listen to music while doing circuit training or running, completely free of wires is fantastic.  Even better, I have been able to get more than 20 feet from the transmitter while doing circuit training.  Even then, there is no drop in quality at all.<br /><br />If you have ever complained about headphone wires while working out or running, you owe it to yourself to accessorize your iPod with one of these!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is one of the best deals I have seen on Amazon ever and I have been a fan for years!!!  The CD is not all that, but for the price you really con't lose!!!!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Well it's been 12 hours and I only have 2 songs and the digital book. For an artist who cares so much about her fans, I wonder if she knows how Amazon is treating them.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I really looked forward to this release.  I wanted to like it.  I'm not a Gaga hater.  I don't understand how so many people are loving this - to each their own I guess.  If I didn't know what this was and heard it for the first time I would guess that it was by some nobody from the 80's who was never very popular.  It is just .... Cheesy.  She has lost that edgy darkness that made her former hits so unique and memorable.  I'm very sad today.  I guess they all sell out eventually.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Although this film claims it is 'based on a true story', upon looking it up I discovered the real story was quite a bit tamer - a train did get away, pretty much in the same way it is portrayed here, and it was eventually stopped the same way, but it was going at a MUCH slower pace, and the other dramatic attempted rescues portrayed in the film didn't happen. Which makes sense, because much of the film I just couldn't quite suspend disbelief, and kept rolling my eyes going 'no way!'<br /><br />Putting all that aside though, overall I enjoyed the film, mostly because of Denzel Washington. In my opinion, he is just riveting to watch in almost anything, and I enjoyed him here, even though he doesn't get that much to work with dramatically. What he does get, he spins into gold.<br /><br />The movie is also non-stop excitement - like the train, it never stops moving. So Denzel + non-stop action = 4 stars to me, even if the script and story were less than stellar.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|My actual star rating is like 2.5<br /><br />Honestly, I wasn't going to buy the album, I heard half of it over the weekend and wasn't impressed. There are really good songs like Marry The Night, Born This Way, the title track, Edge of Glory, which is really growing on me, and Scheibe. There are songs that will make you think WTF, like Government Hooker, and Americano. But nothing else really stands out for me, most of the other songs fall somewhere between almost good and almost bad.<br /><br />Considering the content, it's not nearly as light, \\"Poppy\\" or commercial as The Fame, or as deep as The Fame Monster. But for .99 I am so down! So amazon made my night. It's worth more than .99 any day, but anything over 7.99 is too much.<br /><br />So I definitely wasn't going to let iTunes get my money.<br /><br />This is the second time amazon provided a great deal on an album I wasn't thinking about purchasing. Also, if you don't get all the tracks the first time just keep hitting retry. It took about 3 tries to complete the album for me, considering the number of people probably trying to download it, I'd say that is pretty decent.<br /><br />Good job amazon!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Lady Gaga, but I'll be honest, for $0.99, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't have any problems downloading the album.     As for the music itself, it's better than I expected.  On some tracks her voice is annoying, but the beat/music is good enough to make up for it.
B004N4HXXQ|5.0|This is indie chart staple that some would and do say has been done to death, but it is ruddy great. Opening track `Wreckin bar rar, ra , ra', is a 90 second homage to The Ramones and what a great way to kick off such a joyous album.<br /><br />All of the tracks could be singles, and sometimes that can be annoying, but they are all so good that it just makes this one album that you don't feel you need to fast forward any tracks at all. The obvious pithy wit, irony and verve that is `Post break up sex' is probably the most stand out track, but only just, a real crowd pleaser and floor filler. Track 5 `Wetsuit'; is slower but still has enough momentum to hook you and take you along for the ride. Personal favourite is `A lack of understanding', as it seems to be about me and I like it when you can instantly empathise with a song. The vocals are great too and are all delivered so clear that a lyric sheet is not needed. I have had this a couple of weeks now and during that time three of my fave bands have brought out new albums; this however has been a constant on my MP3 despite all the other music I have been getting. It just feels like summer, sex, angst and fun all rolled up in a great package that you can dance to (but in my case - not very well).<br /><br />There is a twelfth track `Somebody else's child that is tucked at the end of track 11 and not available on download, this is the slowest and most reflective number and makes the album approach as opposed to download, probably the better option.<br /><br />Also not my typical genre, but for indie rock fans who like their music accessible, upbeat, with great lyrics tight playing and some heartfelt humour, then this is indie heaven.
B003VANOFY|5.0|i had read other reviews that said this headset had issues with cutting out, mic problems, and battery issues, but i dont know what those people are smokin but they need to quit!! this thing performs beautifully on both my laptop and desktop and the 7.1 sound they produce is nothing to scoff at i can hear perfectly when im playing crysis or battlefield if an enemy is coming up behind me.    all in all its the absolute best 7.1 headset you can get for this amount of money in my opinion.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Excellent product. I enjoyed every single moment I spenton it. I would definetly reccommend it to anyone who asked me my opinion!
B004DK5CYM|5.0|The movie was well done. Diane Lane is a tremendous actress.  I believe it is one of the best sports movies ever.
0756404738|4.0|NO SPOILERS.  This book is not as good as NOTW.  However, it is way better than the 1 and 2 star reviews lead you to believe.  Rothfuss spins a good yarn and his writing is wildly entertaining.  It's not William Shakespeare.  But that is not why you pick up a Patrick Rothfuss book.  You are reading to be entertained and this book certainly entertains.      Haters gonna hate....and give the thumbs down ):
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Personally, I found this album to be a work of art. Lady Gaga has expressed a new Gaga, essentially. If you're looking for a sequel to Bad Romance or Pokerface, you won't find it on here. On Born This Way, Gaga goes above and beyond typical artists and provides fans, or in her case Little Monsters, with 14-17 exceptional songs that show how Gaga has matured as an artist. Each song sounds unique and provides a fresh taste to the pop world. Each song sounds nothing like you hear now on mainstream top-40 radio. It is a fresh taste of what is yet to come in the World of Gaga.    Buy: Government Hooker, Judas, The Edge of Glory
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is my favorite game on both my devices (phone and tablet) and all of the Birds games are just great!  LOVE THEM!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|after releasing 3 singles before the cd drops, you think this is the best. Hell NO....there is so much more. I love gaga, and i love this cd. She pulls out all the stops. If your a fan your gonna love it, if your a hater, than thats what you are, case closed. Its all about music , fun, dance...its not gonna take care of the worlds problems, but is any music gonna, No, so lets dance till the world ends, could you think of a better way to end it????? thought not. thanks gaga, love it. you rock my world till the end.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I ordered this movie after reading the book. With the exception of a slight change of characters, the movie is very true to the book, which often if not the case.  I loved the book, and so I loved the movie.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|BTW is without question the best pop album I've heard in many many years. Multiple tracks are single worthy in addition to BTW, Judas and The Edge of Glory including Hair, SheiBe, Heavy Metal Lover and possibly Marry The Night. Bloody Mary gave me chills! The beats are sick. The vocals are stellar. Gaga has songwriting chops in spades!!! I highly recommend this body of work.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Christian Bale & Melissa Leo earned their awards for this movie. They both gave outstanding performances in a gripping tale of family dynamics.  I am not a boxing fan, but for some reason I enjoy movies about boxing and this one does not disappoint.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This is ridiculous... 10 hours since I purchased the CD and still only have 7 songs... give me a break!!!!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Excelente para coleccionistas. No era para m&iacute; por lo que s&oacute;lo puedo opinar de la bell&iacute;sima presentaci&oacute;n en steelbook especial para regalo o para coleccionistas.
B003ELOQD4|4.0|All i have to say is that the grain people are complaining about is intentional.  There are a few shots that come across as a little dark but i assume that's just because they were filmed from a giant telephoto lens from across the rose bowl at night... in those instances id say its pretty acceptable.  Do yourself a favor and if you like U2, get this blu.
0307472841|1.0|Mankell was a guarantee for outstanding crime stories including extraordinarily detailed psychology for me. \\"The Man from Beijing\\" was a huge deception. While the story sets off in a promising way, it suddenly gets sidetracked into political and economical issues about China. Contrary to all his other stories, there is The Evil Person, the judge and numerous secondary characters without any interesting traits. The events are highly improbable and thus unconvincing. Lengthy chapters, an even puerile plot in an Around the world of crime in 80 days way. I had difficulties finishing it... Completely disappointing!
B002VPE1YS|5.0|I purchased one of these simple padded pouches when Amazon featured it as a lightning deal.  And now that I have one, I am considering another one.  This is ideal for transport for a small digital camera, GPS or iPod.  I'm using it as a carrying protector for a small solar battery charger.<br /><br />This comes with a small hook (carabiner) but I wouldn't want this dangling off a belt or backpack because this couldn't provide 100% protection; this is a padded carrying pouch, not a hardshell case.  It's easily washed, packed away or carried in another bag due to its light weight.  And since there's no oversized brand logo on it, it's pretty by itself.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'm pretty amazed at all of the negative reviews based on the downed servers due to the excellent deal Amazon offered on the 0.99 Lady Gaga album yesterday.  Sure, the album is exactly what you'd expect, poppy pop.  Exactly what my girlfriend wants.  But the download worked perfectly well for me (was streaming it on my cell phone a few minutes after purchasing).  This 5 star review is strictly to help counter some of the skewed ratings offered by other customers so far.
0891419063|5.0|A casual perusal of the several introductions reveals what this book is about: two hellish campaigns of a Marine Corps unit in the Pacific War - Peleliu and Okinawa, written not by a general, a journalist, or what have you, but an enlisted man who fought with the front line troops.<br /><br />I wasn't sure the book would be my cup of tea, but one of my daughters had given it to me as a gift so it went on my stack and was eventually read.  That was fortunate, because \\"With the Old Breed\\" conveys the nature, horror, and yet valor of war as poignantly as any I have ever read.  The closest parallel I can think of is the battle scenes in the Iliad.<br /><br />Nicknamed \\"Sledgehammer,\\" the author survived both campaigns without being killed, wounded, or driven beyond the bounds of sanity.  He was one of few that could say that.  The story he tells is gripping, vivid, and fascinating.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The cast of characters includes wonderful officers and dreadful ones, grizzled veterans and replacements who had no idea of what it would be like when the \\"stuff hit the fan\\" (some adapted and survived, others perished quickly).  And the fanatical savagery and ingenuity of the Japanese foes is conveyed as well; clearly, suicide missions are not a new invention.  If only to survive, the U.S. Marines developed their own form of savagery.<br /><br />My maternal grandfather was a Marine Corps officer, and although I don't remember him there was a saying in the family that I absorbed as a child: \\"Don't kid the shock troops.\\"  After reading this book, I can better appreciate what this means.
B004H83IG4|5.0|Ryan Gosling has grown into a very fine adult actor.  This is unusual but not unknown for former child actors. I read about this case some time ago and was quite fascinated about it.  It concerns the very disturbed son of the real estate magnet who owns the sleazy but profitable real estate in Times Square in New York City.  We know something is wrong with the family right from the start by seeing their home movies where the mother walks away from him as a child and then kills herself. Also, the father has virtually no redeeming facets.  He is a sleazy real estate operator who has always been solely out for himself.<br /><br />When the son meets his future wife, played very well by Kirsten Dunst, he seems like he is a handsome, charming, wealthy young man who she is very fortunate to marry.  The accent is on the word seems because at that point he doesn't look anything like the freakish character he will become. By the time we get to his living in Texas and walking around there as a woman and then to his giving testimony at his trial, we know he is one mighty strange guy.<br /><br />But did he kill his wife?  Did he not kill his friend down in Galveston in self defense?  Did his friend kill a woman friend of his in LA at his direction?  No one knows the truth about this guy and you will have to reach your own conclusions. It is fascinating seeing Gosling develop this character from the charming and handsome young man into the total weirdo creep he becomes.  I was as fascinated by watching it as I was reading it years ago.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0048IMZMG|5.0|In my opinion most the songs have the ability to get stuck in your head and she really does step out of her comfort zone in some songs.
B003L77FYS|5.0|What a fantastic...wonderful show...It has everything...Comedy...Drama...Romance...The way that they are treating the romance between Castle and Beckett reminds me of another great show the \\"X-Files\\"...where the relationship between Mulder and Scully was brought along slow...where the longer they were together...the closer they became...\\"Castle\\" is by far my favorite show...I too can hardly wait for the 4th season to begin...
0205313426|5.0|I don't personally know an author who doesn't have a copy of this book tucked directly beside his or her keyboard. William Strunk was a sholarly genius and a grammatical disciplinarian who knew that we authors are a slapstick and shoddy bunch. By giving us a clear, concise and--dare I say it--simple guide, he has kept most of us out of the dunce seat...well, for the most part.<br /><br />In all sincerity, this should be the heart and soul of every desk environment. Buy it, read it and remind Tim of its contents on a regular basis :-)
0307887960|5.0|I've been on the diet for 4 weeks, and have lost about 11 lbs. I receomend this to anyone who has tried and failed at other diets.
0981951252|5.0|I love this CD. If I am in a bad mood or things are not going well I can put this CD in and Darren can make me think different. It is great.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I bought this book because I was at Target looking for a gift and saw the cover of this book. I didn't really know anything about it but I decided I was going to read it. This was such a great decision! Let me tell you I am a sucker for a good girl/bad boy romance. I know that is cheesy but I always think its so romantic. I love how this book was written because you got to experience both sides of everything. I think the characters were intriguing and you didn't have to force yourself to like them like with some books. I could not put this book down and ended up giving up sleep so I could read it. The emotions in this book were real and nothing seemed forced. I will say the Epilogue seemed dumb and a little unnecessary but I've never really cared for most Epilogues I've read. I was very impressed with this book and glad I made this impulse purchase!
B004DMIIOG|5.0|This is one of those special films that really shows the focus on emotional storytelling. This film is one of those rare films that actually made me cry when I watched it. It is that well executed. And not just emotionally. The visuals and animation - for both the real world and digital world - are stunning and the characters are all well developed and likable. All in all, this movie hits almost all the right high notes in all the right times. A definate recommendation for any anime fan.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I first saw this film on late night tv Years ago. I was so moved and shaken, I went thru loss of faith in humanity to complete restoration by movies end. This is a movie to watch when you need to feel again. Im a single parent 34yo male and this movie is clear #1 on my list. I bought mine thru amazon and so happy i did. BUY Buy BUY
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Yes, the album did take slightly longer than expected to download. But it DID download, in probably 30 minutes, and that's to be expected with a deal like this! THANK YOU AMAZON and THANK YOU GAGA for an amazing product at an amazing price!!! Love it!
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I've been a huge Backstreet Boys fan for over 16 years, and even though Kevin is missing, it's still the Backstreet Boys, and their music has evolved as well as they have over the years. There's a lot of great songs on this CD. Definitely a must have for any Backstreet fan! KTBSPA!
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|In \\"Donuts\\", hip-hop's super producer J-Dilla put himself on the front stage -- for the first time.

B00006LPEY|4.0|You can only see this anamated. Imagen watching someone in the rottin sewers of Japan. With almost thier whole body in the water, but only thier eyes to see above the serface and a dead rat carcasis risses up on the serface; with magets oozing out of it. And this thing is but an inch away from the persons face. I wonder if \\"JackAss\\" would have the nerve to do a stunt like that!''''' Anyway, as for the movie. I realy liked the movie half way up intel the antagonist mutated into a demented/gutsy grotesc jiant. That part was definitly cool but, it does leave me with a bit of a jauring fealing afterwards. But thats why I call \\"Akira\\" an anamated hoorrer movie. The bike sceens with the clown gang realy get me pumped. Akira is actualy a really well anamated movie evin for todays standards. Theres nothing rong with the movie, whats in Akira is all good to watch. It has an intrieging plot. Plot twists. Akira is just an aquired taist.
0861714911|5.0|In the Buddha's Words (IBW) is worthy of all the superlative accolades offered up by reviewers here, but...<br /><br />Let's keep in mind that Buddhism means one with an awakened mind, or awakening the mind; and reading all the books in the world on the Buddha's teachings is not going to awaken one's mind. Meditation is the key, and one can awaken the mind through meditation without cracking the cover of a single book.<br /><br />On meditation, IBW devotes two short sections to this most important discipline. They are immensely valuable in that they link meditation to attitudes that all beings should enjoy lasting happiness and the causes of happiness, that they be liberated from discomfort and the causes of discomfort; that they never be separated from happiness that is free from sorrow; and that they rest in equanimity free from attachment and sorrow. (Practitioners will recognize the four immeasurables.)<br /><br />This is all excellent, but if one really wants to understand awakening the mind, a meditation practice is needed. IBW is an excellent complement to even a beginning meditation practice.<br /><br />Meditating first, reading second, is counter to the vast majority of how Americans especially would like to approach awakening the mind. Those wishing to test the waters with their toes tend to request recommendations on books to read. Instead, they should be asking for instruction for meditation, and by the bye, what should I read to supplement my meditation. IBW, in my estimation, would make an excellent complement because it offers a thoughtful sampling of many core teachings directly from the Buddha, but also stripped of much of the repetition associated with what were originally oral teachings, which tend to incorporate much repetition.<br /><br />For practitioners of all the various schools of Buddhism, IBW offers a wide ranging anthology of teachings on karma, impermanence, how to approach the teachings, and how to liberate one's mind. IBW's conciseness is of great value as an alternative to searching through more complete translations of the various Pali texts. But IBW is a complement, not a substitute, for such searching. For instance, the Pali texts have much more to offer on the critical subject of meditation than IBW offers.<br /><br />For lay people, beginners, and other tire kickers, IBW offers a direct exposure to core teachings of the Buddha. The teachings here both introduce and increase exposure to important teachings, which in turn can enhance one's meditation.<br /><br />But make no mistake about it. IBW, nor any other text, is a substitute for meditating. Awakening the mind is based on a disciplined exploration of one's experience based on meditation. IBW is an excellent complement to that practice and can improve it...immeasurably.searching through more complete translations of the various Pali texts.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|this is the steal of the year!!! and the download was FLAWLESS! Seriously, it took about 30 seconds and i had the whole album on my itunes. GET IT NOW...before AMAZON comes to it's senses.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|There are only 3 good songs on the CD, Marry the Night, ScheiBe, Government Hooker, the rest goes from Mediocre to just plain boring. Apparently Gaga is not good at paying attention to detail because The production is so bad and WAY overproduced that the sound on some songs are clipped (just like when you record something and the volume is too loud). The music itself is generic disposable dance music, nothing innovative as I would have expected from a so called innovator the songs are generally just a rehash of Madonna (she does it so much better) house music circa late 80's early 90's and Rock/Pop from the 80's,   Don't bother and waste your money!!!!   Not even worth 0.99 cents.   I now have no doubt that Gaga has failed to deliver the goods musically and is all hype with no real substance she will soon start to fizzle out.

B001UV4XI8|2.0|Two of the worst Blue Ray disk I have ever bought! The voice sync was so bad on both disk you gave up trying to watch it. I sent the first one back and received a replacement, but it was worst than the first one. The plain DVD disk was great and the special was ok. I didn't return second disk, to much of a hassle for me. Enjoyed DVD movie though. Will not preorder again, I will wait and order later.

B0012GMUPO|4.0|After being a Alice Cooper fan for many years this is the one album that I had neglected and never given a listen to. Mainly because the bad rap it's always gotten as being \\"sell out\\" or \\"corparate\\" So now that I finally have all of Alice's albums I figured I would give it a shot. I am listeing to it right now as I write this review and I have to say I like this album...Calling it a sell out is not the best way to describe it, But it is a very trendy album for 1989 Hard Rock and the move to include Desmond Child and Bon Jovi don't help matters much. I call this album his \\"Alice Jovi\\" period. Being the follow up to maybe my favorite Alice album ever \\"Raise Your Fist And Yell\\" it is disapointing, But some of the tunes are some of his best ever \\"Poison\\" \\"This Maniacs In Love With You\\" \\"Trash\\" \\"Hell Is Living Without You\\" are all excellent...But my favorite track on this album is \\"House Of Fire\\" which I think is a perfect Alice Cooper song. The only tune I don't care for is \\"Only My Heart Talkin\\" It doesn't fit Alice at all and could have been a song for any paint by numbers Hard Rock band of 1989, And the riff in \\"Spark In The Dark\\" is a total Bon Jovi rip off (yuck) I think any Alice Cooper fan can find something to dig on this album...Is it his best work ever? Nope but it is a good solid Rockin album...It's worth 5 dollars :)

0553805371|3.0|The way I look at it, this is more or less a condensed edition of previous writings of Stephen Hawking on such subject of universe, i.e. \\"A Brief History of Time\\", \\"The Universe in a Nut Shell\\", adding on recent developments in the science realm. These new developments are not as exciting as those in the twentieth century, I feel. A drawback on this book is: those who have read Stephen's previous books may find background information in early chapters repetitive (except Chapter 3 which is an inspiring philosophical view). On the other hand, those who have not read his previous books, or other books on similar subject, may find the background not sufficently detailed and therefore may not easily appreciate the theme expressed in later chapters. Maybe this is a regretable dilemma.
B004I654WQ|5.0|We were borrowing my mother-in-law's DVD copy of Cars which my 2 year old son absolutely adored!  When his 2nd birthday came around we ordered this Bluray pack and some of the scenes are just head and shoulders above the DVD.  Thank you Disney and thank you Amazon!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|The DVD 'One Night Only:  anniversary edition' is really amazing.  It's  a very nostalgic dream hearing and watching the evergreen songs of this formidable group - BEE GEES.  I really like it very much, and the price was worthed.  I recommend it to all those who like great music.
B002ZG980U|2.0|It doesn't have the quality as it should be. not like a DVD, but more like a video CD. It doesn't even have a digital sound. disappointed.
B0019KC4TU|5.0|This version of Nursery Cryme is simply amazing.<br />All of the instrumentation shines in ways never heard before.<br />It's hard to imagine this was recorded 40 years ago. A must buy for fans new and old!<br />Also (just FYI), this SACD edition works fine in normal CD players.
B002B2RY6I|5.0|This album showcases Paolo's earthy-ness and pure soul that lies in his voice. It's raw, inviting and real. I think this album really shows the range of Paolo's voice. It's creative and catchy but definatley mixes new and old elements to make one great album.
B004K4AVAG|1.0|Well it happened before and it'll happen again I guess. The album wasn't even a dollar. However, every place that sells this album in America needs to make damn sure we know that it is fully censored. You don't get to hear the songs in the way that they were intended. Once again we were duped by a record label who doesn't care about freedom of speech as much as Gaga or any of us do. DO NOT BUY if you wanted to hear the songs in the right way. Instead, wait and get the uncensored version if it's ever released(probably won't be). However, I believe the Australian version of the Album is uncensored like The Fame Monster.    Buy the Australian version. I'm going to give Amazon a call to make sure they have that in the information.
0307454541|2.0|I really can't understand what the big deal is about.  I think half of the book can be cut, and that will help a great deal.  The girl is an interesting but not fully developed character.  The ending also does not make sense.  I am not impressed by this book at all.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I thought that it was going to be awesome; but dont really like it ... too much of the same disturbing sounds.....and I like Lady Gaga!!!! sorry not this one monsters.....I am OUT!!!!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Got this album for 99 cents and I normally don't listen to Gaga but I thought \\"what the hell\\" for 99  cents but I listened to it and I gotta say, It's pretty solid. I'm a big electronic junkie and the album definitely had a great electronic beat to it. I may just be becoming a fan of Lady Gaga. Shh! Don't tell my guy friends. What the hell, who cares, this album is awesome!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Am now listening to it, downloaded to my computer, and still had enough time to read up on DRM (boo on you guys for watermarking the download - I'll be removing that).  Thanks for easy, inexpensive access to a great album!
B0051QJ83S|5.0|It's exactly what I was expecting from lady gaga. Great club music! I'm supposed to be studying for finals but this just makes me want to get up and dance!!     No problem from amazon when I downloaded this on opening day, hope that was fixed for everyone else who gave this a 1 star due to downloading problems!
0312323867|5.0|I did not love Darcy when I read Something Borrowed, so I was hesitant to read this one.  However, she develops into a great character and I ended up liking this book even better than Something Borrowed.  If you like Emily Griffin, I think this one is her best!
0670022411|1.0|Very disappointed with the non-ending. Good buildup, decent character development, mildly interesting story and then nothing. Not even much of a cliff hanger as this could or not be the end of the tale. Left me feeling blank.....nothing. On to the next book.
0552149519|1.0|If you find Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code enthralling, challenging, thrilling, and well written, I have bad news for you: You are stupid. I do not mean this as a mere derogatory epithet, but rather as an ostensible conclusion based on a very telling litmus test; the book itself. First, I must break the news to you that, for anyone with a modicum of education or intelligence, all of the puzzles in this novel are completely obvious. If, however, you don't know enough about math to have been exposed to the Fibonacci series, have never exercised your perceptions by regular reading of mirror writing, and don't even know enough about the history of science to instantly interpret \\"Newton's Orb\\" as a common apple, then you probably think that Robert Langdon is a mental giant and a formidable expert in \\"Symbology\\" which is a non-existent discipline and a non-word to boot. The actual discipline is called semiotics and real semioticians would laugh derisively at any and all of Dr. Langdon's analyses of art or history. The only place the word \\"Symbology\\" is used beyond the confines of Dan Brown's hack fiction is in the movie \\"The Boondock Saints,\\" where FBI SA Smecker derides one of his Boston PD understudies for using the non-word when he really meant to say \\"symbolism.\\" Secondly, the plot is insultingly predictable. There are no surprises, unless you are terribly dull. The whole novel is just a prolonged soapbox for silly, hair-brained reinterpretations of history and mentally challenged versions of philosophy. The interaction between Langdon and his female companion, while purporting to exhibit pro-goddess feminism, is really a condescendingly sexist parody. The female character is continually in awestruck submission to the pompous lecturing of her dominant male counterpart, and also exhibits the type of helpless, frail stereotype one would normally find in other pulpy fiction of low degree. Third, the whole basis for the novel's point is just bad, bad, bad history. Only the most gullible and ill-informed person would take any of the historical assertions in this novel as being anywhere close to correct. There never was any big templar secret or conspiracy, just a lot of trumped up recriminations against them because they held all the big notes on the debts for all the political powers across Europe at one time, since they were the original money lenders in European history, beginning with the crusades. Fourthly, and most ludicrously, the whole point of the novel would be completely irrelevant, even if it were true, which it is not. Who cares about the rightful heir of the French throne? France has been a republic for more than 200 years! The best minds of humanity would be hard pressed to come up with a more trivial issue than the succession of the French monarchy! From a religious perspective, if Jesus was merely human and not the divine Messiah who died to save us from our sins, and who rose from the dead to confirm this truth, it becomes likewise extremely trivial as to whether he got married and had an heir or a line of succession down to the present day. Heir to what? Who would care? If he was not who he claimed to be in the Gospels, who cares who he was besides perhaps silly people who avidly read the National Enquirer and the Star (etc.)?<br /><br />So if you thought this book was a really good mystery/thriller fiction, the sad fact is that this merely proves that you are at the very shallowest end of the gene pool.<br /><br />But if that's so, then you probably are too dull to either figure it out, or to be bothered by it anyway.<br /><br />So congratulations on enjoying your own stupidity.t gullible and ill-informed person would take any of the historical assertions in this novel as being anywhere close to correct.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|not fair to La Gaga for us to give low stars for e-delivery issues on today's special deal.<br />upon download in the early afternoon, i only got two songs and the cover art pdf.<br />by 11pm, Amazon fixed the issue and i now have 14 songs.  love gaga & amazon!
014241543X|5.0|I would give it another star if I could! I thought it was better than the first book, more emotional in a good way. Loved it!
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I must admit I was not a fan of the Lady when she was born. I have to say this upfront I am in the older age bracket not her typical fan age. My son is a true follower and he asked me to give her a chance and just listen to the music and not the person or character singing. I did as he asked and I do have to say that I do like the music.<br /><br />As far as the persona goes I thought about it and realized that she is just this generations Cher, Madonna, Grace Jones or whomever was the out there person of that time. Most of us at one time or another had that one \\"out there\\" celebrity that we idolized and she is this generation's idol. We may not agree with her on some social issues, but she is a person like the rest of us who has the right to speak her mind and support what and whom she wants.<br /><br />Do like I did and give her music a chance, you may not like every song, but I am sure you will find a few that you will pat your foot to.
B00026WU7I|2.0|\\"Shelter from the Storm\\" is great; \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" is a good song. But listening to \\"Idiot Wind\\" or \\"Rosemary, Lilly and the Jack of Hearts\\" is enough to make you want to puncture your eardrums with an ice pick.

1402756399|5.0|I avoided reading this quintessential book for years because I incorrectly assumed it would be as exciting as a graduate student dissertation. So when I found this version with illustrations I (typical American male), thought \\"OH! Pictures! I can handle this!\\". And I could. I have read several books about evolution, from a scientific perspective, from a philosophical perspective, even one book that attempted--and failed--to disprove it. But I had never read THE book about how we came to be the way we are, and it was time. This book, while not exactly a barnburner, is not a difficult read at all, and with the addition of the helpful and often fascinating photographs and illustrations, it was a great and enjoyable read. The only caveat I will issue here is that this is not a book you can toss into your suitcase and take with you on a trip. It is big and bulky (and beautiful, but big and bulky nonetheless). This is a book you will want to keep at home, on your nightstand, to read.<br /><br />Oh...and if you are a religionist/creationist, do NOT buy this book. If you do, God will throw you into the abyss of Hell where you will suffer and burn and choke and scream and be tortured every second from now through eternity. Because he loves you. (This last bit stolen, with gratitude, from George Carlin).
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I wanted this movie so bad because I've seen it before. This movie came finally after 2 weeks and I was so excited. I put it in and when it got to the best part \\"Strawberry Feilds\\" it couldn't read the disc because it was too scratched. I was very mad.
1401324029|5.0|I love watching the TV series Castle and when reading the books I can not only picture the characters the book is based on, I can almost hear their voices. Whoever does the actual writing does a great job and makes the story flow. I'm ready for the next one.

B004NJW96C|5.0|Let me explain the title line...if you have the time...    I first heard Moby circa 1993 when a friend played me his 'Move' EP.  I was diving headlong into the world of the rave culture and Moby was well known in this culture.  I fell in love with his music immediately.  His 'Ambient' disc and 'Everything Is Wrong' were albums in heavy rotation during a period of serious soul searching.  There was something transcendent, ethereal almost, in the way he was able to craft a song.    For those long, dark nights, yet blissful in a melancholy kind of way, his music was the perfect fit.      I smiled as his music became hugely popular and ubiquitous (you know, the 'oh, you're just discovering him' kind of thing).  His amalgam of old gospel songs and catchy electronica was, at the time, cutting edge.  After his '18' release, however, I had moved on to other sounds and dabbled in his music at best, though I found the 'Hotel' album to be a move forward as he added more and more vocals.    Anyhow, when I read the blurb on the late night, isolated insomniac vibe of this album somehow I just knew...    There is a melancholy sound that is a throwback to his early works yet the changes and growth of his later releases are meshed into one here sounding comfortable yet completely fresh.  It feels highly personal and mature, pensive yet peaceful.  He creates beautiful, sometimes sad, sometimes blissful, orchestral electronic music that gets into your headspace and takes you places.    I'll leave out the details but I had an epiphany of sorts while listening to this album and as the epiphany deepened (at 70+ mph on the highway, mind you) as 'Lacrimae' played it felt like a religious experience.  Deep, deep bliss.    The album is best absorbed as a whole, as an experience, headphones or long drives late at night highly recommended.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|the latest update keeps stopung to re-buffer. didn't have this problem with the previous version. otherwise it was a great streaming radio app. lots of stations local and across country. on top of that there are themed channels, like 80's music. yeah!  for noe please update and fix the streaming and buffering. for now going to a previous version.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I feel like I'm getting away with something that I'm not suppose to....99 cents for a whole album from a mega artist and free cloud space!! C'mon, this is a real no brainer!!  Great promotion for the new album and a great way to introduce new users to cloud based storage....oh yeah, for FREE! The other thing that's cool is this is being promoted kind of on the down low which gives it an \\"in the know\\" feel from the Amazon user underground!  Awesome job to Lady GaGa and Amazon!
B003TU15KM|5.0|TEVA sandals have been around for a while, but don't get better and better. (It's impossible to improve on perfection !!) For use in tropical climates, they are unparalleled. They stick to your feet like proverbial mud to a blanket: they don't flip about, move or slid. When the 3 velcro straps are tightened, the sandal becomes so 'attached' that you can run in them - and climb rocks, trees, steep embankments or the most broken dilapidated asian back-street in safety. They are comfortable too, a contoured platform moulds to your feet when worn. And hygienic - plenty of air circulation, no build-up of bacteria to make smell, wash them in any convenient puddle whilst still attached, and mould doesn't grow on them in a dark cupboard. They last for years and are worth every cent - Ho Chi Minh would have killed for them !
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Lady Gaga, id a great musician, and delivers a solid, energetic, fully dancable album, and combines with amazon, so that you can get it for pennies. Class move, and great album!
B000001ELP|4.0|If you ever heard the vinyl release of this album you realize how dynamic musically Kiss can be and what an underated drummer Eric Carr was. For instance, on \\"The Oath\\" Carr carries the talent of this composition. Without the awesome drum riffs Kiss would have sounded like the garage band they were. However, to be positive on several other tracks the writing is phenomenal and not as expected. Some of Frehleys solos are inspired despite his distaste with the project. Some tracks Erzin chooses to silence Carr in favor of his lush orchestrations which is a pity. I am willing to bet without Erzins heavy hand this project may have gone in an entirely different direction. Kiss could have kept on this path and gained a new progressive rock fan base but instead opted for the kids and the money. No insult to business man Simmons but isn't the music supposed to come first for a musician? Anyhow, Get this if you never cared for Kiss you will like this album for it's sit down and listen qualities.
B001NERPHS|5.0|Being a fan of both Bob Dylan and The Band, I thought what could be better than having an historic recording of these talents playing together all those years ago. I was pleasantly surprised by the calibre of the songs and the quality production of the entire package. It's a great addition to my collection and a must have for anyone who enjoys listening to Bob Dylan and The Band. I rate it up there with the best.
B004GYY714|3.0|the day after I downloaded tunein radio, they offered the full pro version for free.  Tried to uninstall, but Amazon keeps telling me to install it.  Not Tunein's fault, but irritating just the same
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Well it is 8:15 eastern time zone, May 23rd 2011 and the album downloaded for me in less than 8 minutes perfectly.  Excellent album also...a little different from her last one but some great club beats are in there.  Government Hooker is my fav. so far.  Thank you amazon for my 99 cent purchase!!
B0051E9JNE|5.0|Talk about a cult classic. The only original story I've ever really heard of that deals with the idea of immortality. If you've never seen this movie then you have to know what kinda film your in for. The film was made in 86' so don't expect any high-end special effects or cgi, this is all old school movie magic. The action isn't as intense as the original tv series but the story is what carries this movie on. The lonesome hero Conner MacLeod played by Christopher Lambert with his dry wit and trademark laugh. The big, evil, bad guy, The Kurgan played by Clancy Brown. The mentor of he hero played by Sean Connery and the love interest played by Roxanne Hart. I'd tell you the story but it's nothing that can't be read from the description above. Basically if you don't mind somewhat cheesy but awesome movies like The Outlander, Pathfinder and Conan then this one's for you.

Many thanks for giving me my life back!!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I was ready to love this album but it only took listening through one time to realize that this album is a bust.  She's trying too hard... saying the syllable of a word over and over again for every song gets redundant, boring and expected. A-A-A-A-America, Gaga-a-a-a-a, Juda-a-a-a-a, La La La La La, blahhhh blahhhh.  I do like the Edge of Glory so that $.99 was worth paying for that one song.  Beware- the album is not worth paying full price!!!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Simply a great album. Unlike many 'pop' artist, Lady Gaga has a powerful and beautiful voice. Born this Way does not disappointed. Her growth as an artist from The Fame to Born this Way is remarkable.
B004K4AVAG|3.0|I'm not a hater. Lady Gaga can play all she wants. But this album is not edgy, nor groundbreaking, nor pushing boundries much, nor taking chances, nor hardcore, nor great dance music. Beyond the singles Gaga pretty much just follows the same formula. Imitate some 90s techno synths, water them down, add some generic beats (for being a dance artist, her beats are mostly oddly bland), and finish the song in an overproduced dense style with 80s pop style structure. Repeat over and over.    Where is her evidence that she is a real singer songwriter like she claims, not just a pop tart? Where is the groundbreaking or changing the pop lexicon? Lady Gaga doesn't take this opportunity to push herself or pop music. I suppose occasional gay culture references are supposed to be the edgy part. The \\"Bad Romance\\"-ish \\"Judas\\" is probably the hardest thing here. Lady Gaga's beats are just boring. The cover of the Gaga motorcycle transformer is great thou.
