B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is an amazing and entertaining game for all ages. The  steering works great, no gliches, and it is really really fun! The best part is the island and the different cars you get to upgrade to. This game is definitely worth the price. They definitely don't try to cheat you out of your money. I would recommend this to anybody.

B0078ZTWP4|4.0|I recently purchased the [[ASIN:B0018S4XIS Rayovac Sportsman LED Lantern (SE3DLN)]] and the [[ASIN:B0078ZTWP4 Lighting EVER LED Lantern, Ultra Bright 300lm, Home, Garden and Camping Lanterns]] and I must say that I really like the both of them. I tested them both using fresh alkaline D-cell batteries. Both are ruggedly constructed and both feel like they are built with quality materials plus they both diffuse the light pretty evenly. The only differences are: -The Rayovac Lantern has a rubber grip handle whereas, the Lighting Ever Lantern does not  -The light diffuser on the Rayovac has a snapping or clicking sound when fully screwed into place and locks into place, the Lighting Ever does not but, it feels that it will not come loose while jiggling it around and will stay put  -The plastic light diffuser on the Rayovac Lantern is noticeably thicker than the Lighting Ever Lantern thus, appearing to be able to take a little more abuse than the Lighting Ever's plastic light diffuser  -The protective LED globe(or cap)within the light diffuser of the Rayovac Lantern is frosted so it's easier on the eyes, the Lighting Ever Lantern does not have a frosted LED cap thus, it is harsher on the eyes  -The Rayovac has 3 LED lights vs the Lighting Ever's 1 LED light (the single Lighting Ever LED bulb is larger than any one of the 3 Rayovac's LED bulbs  -The Lighting Ever IS slightly brighter than than the Rayovac.  Rayovac's claimed specs on label: 240 lumens/ 40hrs run time on high (15 meter beam distance)/ 90hrs run time on low at 100 lumens (10 meter beam distance).  Lighting Ever's claimed specs on the box: 300 lumens/ 72hrs run time on high/ 144hrs run time on low at 150 lumens/ 240hrs run time on strobe mode. My final conclusion is that both lanterns are great but if I had to choose one, it'll be the the Lighting Ever lantern because it is brighter than the Rayovac, it seems to be more efficient than the Rayovac since its single larger LED bulbs draws less energy than the Rayovac's slightly smaller three LED bulbs, the Lighting Ever Lantern came in a box protected in a bubble wrap bag (the Rayovac didn't) and, it costs less than the Rayovac Lantern. One thing I noticed though is that the Lighting Ever Lantern emitted a very slight high pitched keening hum. You can hear it when your close to it but, it is barely noticeable nor bothersome. Nevertheless, the [[ASIN:B0078ZTWP4 Lighting EVER LED Lantern, Ultra Bright 300lm, Home, Garden and Camping Lanterns]] is a WIN WIN!ayovac's slightly smaller three LED bulbs, the Lighting Ever Lantern came in a box protected in a bubble wrap bag (the Rayovac didn't) and, it costs less than the Rayovac Lantern.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The writing is in easy but descriptive prose. It is not heavy reading. You feel as if you are part the action. The author develops the characters enough to give you an understanding of the trials and tribulations faced by both the main characters. thumbs up! Love the genre.

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Everyone forgets that instrumental doesn't have to mean classical, but Lindsey Stirling makes fresh, exciting new music that I can't stop listening to!  Her collaborations with other artists are phenomenal as well (check out her &#34;Radioactive&#34; collaboration on her YouTube channel) and her videos are beautiful and haunting in turn.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is a wonderful film.  Not only did my grandchildren enjoy it (reason for purchase), but I thought it was a great production also.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|it didn't do much with out &#34;upgrading&#34;. It was very limited. I thought i was getting a free product. But there wasn't much i could do with it as it is.
B007HYV56U|5.0|Still good after all these years. A young James Garner, the way we like to remember him. Cameras fastened to cars going 180 miles an hour.
B0085OELXK|4.0|The music and the characters are excellent. Although the ending is a little wired, it's a good movie that I 've watched recently.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I loved the beginning of this book, but the rest was definitely not as entertaining as I would've hoped.  It becomes very repetitive.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I found the first book incredibly compelling - 5 stars! The second book was ok, and this third book we finally find some answers. It was a long time coming.
B002NANLCE|4.0|I ordered this book because I found the tv series interesting and was disapointed when it was canncelled. Though it has its differences from the series it was interesting and an easy read.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|I thought this was a really great, and exciting, movie!  Though I'm not a die hard &#34;Trekkie&#34;, the story was easy to follow/understand.

B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Amazon is awesome. I forgot to watch my episode of the Following but Amazon makes it so convenient to fix that. Just went onto my account and picked the episode!

B00C5W3SBE|2.0|We all love Disney but for the first time Disney is releasing OZ in 3-D only with out the bluray & dvd included.So they expect me to by both movies paying TWICE as much to get all the versions!<br />I'm going to send Disney a MESSAGE and NOT BUY OZ at all.Also I was going to buy ALL FOUR ANIMATION BLYRAY RELEASES ( Atlantis etc.) BUT I WON'T BUY ANY OF THEM! 2013 is a GOOD YEAR NOT TO BUY DISNEY PRODUCT AT ALL.Read the other reviews of other Disney loyalist that have had it with Disney greed.OZ will be in bargain bins this Christmas,if you must buy it buy in December!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I started this book because my daughter was reading it. For me it was a slow start but I persevered and then I found that I could not put it down, just wanted to know what would finally happen but did not want to skip ahead. The plot was well done and the story for me just flowed. To anyone else I would say that this is a good read,put aside the temptations to peek ahead. Ask yourselves the questions but do not jump ahead, you will be glad that you did.  I will recommend this book to anyone who really loves to read.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|After hearing all the rave reviews surrounding the movie...I expected more. It moved at a slower pace then expected and almost fell asleep in some parts.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. Vaelin is a protagonist in a welcome heroic vein. He's not perfect, but he has a good heart, which is something missing in the latest trend of dark and gritty fantasy. The plot is framed not unlike Patrick Rothfuss' novels, where Vaelin is telling his story to a scribe and then we jump to his third-person limited point of view, and while there's a certain similarity in the tone, this novel stands as a story perhaps influenced by those books, but definitely not a cheap imitation.<br /><br />The only reason I couldn't give this five stars was the completely random use and non-use of commas, and too many instances of the wrong words (discrete vs discreet, yolk vs yoke, etc). It speaks to the strength of the story that I kept reading, but it was very annoying. A good proofreader and corrected edition is sorely needed. If you can tolerate errors like this, you'll enjoy the book. Otherwise, I suppose you best wait for a corrected edition. I hope the second book in the series has better editing.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The health and care bars take to long to fill up.<br />And too much of the stuff costs real money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series, what's not to like. It keeps you interested and is just the bomb. How about coming to America?
B008ROGJ2Y|3.0|Back to the 80s this one is not a big budget but still a classic movie more than just one short story and remember never yell at your kids you never know watch the movie to find out why
B009OYTAL8|5.0|It's been an enjoyable first season for the series. I particularly enjoy the frequent flashbacks to his island past. I still don't like Starling City though. It just sounds stupid.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Bought this movie just by the cover for my granson's second birthday....Not only did he and his four year old sister enjoy it, but I enjoyed it immensely....I am very satisfied and think it is a Excellent story, I intent to but the second story...Keep up the good work!!
B0081GWXPA|5.0|This story is something else, it is just so amazing. This is a truly timeless tale, please, dont go up to this book and say \\"Oh its some stupid childrens book\\" PLEAASE dont, this book has so much symbolism, heart, and thought that everyone can enjoy this one. I just cant explain why it is so good, it is something you have to experience for yourself.
B0031RS64G|3.0|If you like very in depth plots with lots of characters, then this may interest you. It is becoming a long read and is sometimes frustratingly tedious, may be more than I can digest.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I buy the game it goes to downloading and then it says error I repeat this over 5times till I finally quit any help
B009O07NDY|5.0|It's from Howard Shore. It's based on Sir Peter's film. Need I say more? Do you need to know more?<br /><br />Just as a few good lines make good poetry, a few good bars makes good music. Shore gives us more than just a few, but if you're interested, the few bars that did it for me are on the second disk, Over Hill.<br /><br />I think you'll enjoy it, and listen to it enough to make it work buying.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really challenging game.  It is very interesting and the challenges make you want to keep playing it.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Another &#34;Kathy Reichs&#34; original that keeps you wondering the whole time & up way too late at night because you will read &#34;just one more chapter.&#34;
B008JFUNYG|2.0|I was a HUGE fan of the original \\"Evil Dead.\\"  In fact, it scared the crap outta' me!!  I had not seen such an intense movie since I saw the original \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" way back when.  From the opening shot of that moving camera--which was hand-held by the way--to the completely over the top carnage which took place inside that cabin, the original knocked the socks off most of the critics and made Sam Raimi a household name.<br /><br />And then came the remake.  First, let me say what I liked about the 2013 version.  The makeup and special effects were simply astonishing.  I understand that not a bit of CGI was used in the remake, which is simply unheard of these days.  You can tell a lot of hours were put into the makeup, the effects, and even the acting was not that bad.  Kuddos for that.  However, what made this movie unlikeable (at least for me) was the fact there was no protagonist here; no one to root for.  We had Ash in the first movie, and Bruce Campbell went on to make his career by hanging onto the coat tails of the original ED.  There were tons of black comedy in the first one; the remake settled for just over-the-top gore.  Plus, if you really want to irritate me, advertise your movie as a \\"remake\\" and then tell a completely different story.  The only thing remotely similar to the two movies were you had \\"teenagers\\" put in a remote cabin and then you literally threw the kitchen sink at all of them.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of remakes because, face it, the originals are usually ALWAYS better.  Such is the case for \\"Evil Dead 2013.\\"  I can only imagine what they're going to do to \\"Carrie.\\"  The movie is rated R for intense violence, gore, and language.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|It's obvious the writers wanted to shift the focus from the imminent threat of the zonbies to that of Woodbury and the complicated Governor.  Thankfully they provided a smidgen of zombie blood in each episode.  Losing main characters dating all the way back to season 1 may keep things real, but is a major irritation for fans like myself who get attached.  It's the same reason House lost popularity.  Thanks to this critical mistake on the part of the writers, don't expect this series to last close to that long
B000B5XOYI|5.0|My boyfriend absolutely loves Batman! He loved getting this as a valentine's day gift.  To all the girls out there with batman enthusiasts like mine, this is an awesome gift.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such a great show. So glad my friend told me about it. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great story, hard to put the book down.  Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer. This is the second book I've completed. and enjoyed them both.

B000FA675C|3.0|The story was hard to follow as well as it seemed to go on and on before getting to the point.  I almost quit reading it several times but thought with it being Brown's book it would get better. I was disappointed.  Mulege_Billye
B001ILFUDM|5.0|I read all the reviews here before purchasing and was worried that I would get some foreign no play in North America zone Blu Ray. What I received was excellent and had no issues at all, 100% genuine Zone A plays in all players in North America. It came very quickly and was in mint condition. It is a great disc with all the perks and in high quality stunning crystal clear on the screen and sound! Order this disc now...and do not worry you will not have any issues.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app. Very good info. Easy to use. Always up to the minute. Like the forecasting and the maps.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|While most people focus on the fact that this does not live up to the Bourne series or that it doesn't star Matt Damon, I feel that Jeremy Renner did a fantastic job and the plot was great. Sure it is not as great as the original three, but that doesn't change the fact that it was still worth 5/5.
B009LDD54K|5.0|I love this series and so do many others. I found series 3 to offer surprises and depth of the actors. The characters have evolved and you just never know what they will be up to next.  As soon as season 3 is available for purchase, I plan to buy it. I am impatiently awaiting season 4.

B00AWE9TCE|5.0|I'm a big fan of LEGO-Chima . I bought this product yesterday. I had seenvideo- reviews of this on the net and so I bought this. But when I finished assembling it..I looked WAY better than I thought it would!! I am IMMENSELY happy with this! This set is simply Beautiful...maybe one of the best CHIMA sets (currently).<br />I'll start with the minifigs. This set contains two Eagle tribe minifigs (Eglor and Equila) and one wolf tribe minifig (Wilhurt). Eglor, from the Eagle tribe, is currently exclusive to this set.Equila is I guess the most common Eagle minifig in Chima.  The eagle minifigs are just..Awesome! The details and markings on them are lovely. The headpiece (of both Eglor and Equila) are amazing! Eglor is only eagle tribe member who's blue in color, others are white. But his wings are white though.  Eglor carries a spear and Equila carries one assembled-weapon which looks cool. It is a combination of a sword and a light-saber piece.<br />(Eglor has a greenish beak but on the box and in the instruction manual, it's shown as yellow! So one minor goof-up from LEGO there.)<br />Wilhurt is the only wolf-tribe member to be in black color (others are grey). He looks great..only thing is, his headpiece  doesn't have any markings like the other wolf headpiece  but it's no big deal...as the minifig looks amazing anyway! Wilhurt carries a cool-looking black axe.<br />Now coming to the star attraction, the Ultra-striker. As I said, looks Fantastic.  A very creative design. Two big treads in the front (one on each side) and one big wheel on the back. The front portion of the vehicle looks just like an eagle's head. This \\"head\\" is detachable and can be used as a small flying vehicle in itself, which is cool.  The vehicle has two \\"arms\\" which can move up and down a bit. There are two talons in the front which make the vehicle lok more remarkable. A few feather/wing  pieces on the vehicle provide a nice effect. The vehicle has two technic cannons which is nice.<br />One small complaint I have is that in order to fit Equila into the driving-section, you have to remove his wings! Why would anyone want to remove a bird's wings, when it's a part of it's body?? I feel LEGO should have designed in such a way that you could fit an Eagle minfig into the vehicle without having to remove it's wings. Hope in the future, LEGO designs eagle-vehicles like that!<br />Another complaint I have is....stickers! I hate stickers...The smaller the stickers, the more difficult it is to get them positioned correctly in the first attempt...and the more attempts you make, the more smudged the stickers get , at the edges. I wish LEGO would permanently do away with stickers and use only printed bricks. Moreover, printed bricks look WAY better than stickers.<br />In the end, I would say that it's a no-brainer. This is one of the BEST looking sets from LEGO. Kids, adults everyone is gonna love it!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is challenging, yet very relaxing. Each stage presents new obstacles and new possibilities for solutions. It's also fun to play stages again to beat a previous score.

B00AU15HPC|4.0|there is some really good stuff here, but if you're desperate for a new moody blues &#34;fix&#34;, you're going to have to just keep on waiting and hoping.  i don't know why justin seems to be &#34;hell-bent&#34; on not sounding like the moody blues in his solo efforts, but i'm kinda-like &#34;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&#34;.  i have been very biased in my views on haywards' music since i'm such a die-hard moodies fan... i've seen them a half-dozen times over the years , own all their albums at least twice now, and would probably travel 150 miles to see them again if when they tour this season.  and yet, when a recent reviewer referred to justin's solo work as being &#34;inconsistent&#34;, i had to agree.  this latest offering by justin is far better than 1980's &#34;night flight&#34; or 1996's &#34;a view from the hill&#34;,  so, by all means, check it out!  (but be prepared: he get's lucky once in a while on his own with some really great music, but if you want consistently awesome... stick with the moody blues.)

0385349947|4.0|I thought it was a little too long in some places.  The antidotes are interesting and bring home the points being made but could be shortened.  However, I really bought this book for my granddaughter who is a college freshman, and I think it is a book every young woman with a career ahead should read.  Self awareness is an asset and we do not need to learn everything from our own experiences.  We can learn from Ms. Sandberg's.

B00B5ARKDE|4.0|I like this movie.  Its funny, witty, full of action, just a little too short.<br /><br />To start off my review, let me clear up that this film is NOT the cutscenes from Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes.  This film is based on that game, but the entire film has been re-animated from the cutscenes and great action scenes replace gameplay.<br /><br />Now that the cutscene controversy is cleared up, let me tell you about the film itself.<br /><br />Firstly, the animation is brilliant.  LEGO did a great job on animating this film, especially in HD.  If you have a Blu-ray player, then buy this on Blu-ray for sure.<br /><br />Secondly, the voice acting is very good.<br /><br />Lastly, the story.  Based on the video game, the story for LEGO Batman is funny, witty, full of action and flows quickly.  Just a little too quickly.  At 71 minutes, this movie is barely a feature-length film.  Just when I was getting to this film, it was almost over.  LEGO should have made this film at least 90 minutes.  Then, my review would be five out of five for sure.<br /><br />My other problem with this film is that it is not theatrically released.  This film is too good for a direct-to-DVD/Blu-ray release.  This film would have been great in 3D.<br /><br />In conclusion, LEGO Batman: The Movie DC Superheroes Unite is a film well worth seeing.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.

B00C7JG0KG|3.0|I'm very disappointed that this doesn't come with a regular blu-ray and DVD copy.  I watch them in 3D only 1/3 of the time.  If I'm re-watching it I might be doing so while working on something and can't wear 3D glasses.  The digital copy is usually not HD, and with blu-ray not really taking off I feel safe only investing that kind of $$$ if it comes with a DVD version as a back up too.  While i LOVE Digital copies, there's no replacing being able to quickly pop in a disc.  I really want to see this in 3D though so it sucks they don't offer an option that's for me.  They should have the 3D HD on one side of the disk and 2D HD on the other.
B00CBXV96I|4.0|Hannibal Lecter is a great villain. For a villain to really be great, in my opinion, they have to be clever. Movies like \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" always have annoyed me because the villains are, well, morons. They trip over their own feet and somehow manage to get some much more intelligent good guy at their mercy, and they decide to kill them (because they're stupid, not for any deliberate reason). It's like watching Baby Huey on a murder spree. It's not really entertaining, it's just sad and a little laughable.<br />  On the other hand, I have to say, the idea of neurotic or self-indulgent people going to see a psychiatrist who patiently listens to his patients' problems, offers insightful advice, and then may or may not eat them later isn't just good, it's like a scary fairy tale, like Baba Yaga, or Hansel and Gretel, or something.<br />  If there's a flaw to the character, it's that Thomas Harris eventually gave him another glossed-over rationale for wanting to kill and eat people. He had to have some scarring episode in his childhood that made him crazy. This, in my opinion, made him actually less easy to identify with. Most of the people the writer describes as interacting with Lecter are bad enough or weak enough on their own (like the tabloid reporter in this episode) for me, the viewer, to understand why someone with his abilities might want to convert the parasitic reporter into something more dignified (like pate). It would have been a lot more interesting, if they (on their own) had been enough to provoke him into becoming a serial killer. The trauma does explain why he's a psychiatrist, however, and would deliberately seek out people he believes are morally weak or perverse.<br />  But anyway, the series (so far) sticks to what I like about this villain. He doesn't look down on even the most disgusting people in any overt way. He talks to them in a very calm, civilized fashion, and this somehow never fails to creep me out-it's like hearing the Jaws theme. You really want even the most repulsive characters to at least try to get away.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book was quite helpful in covering the steps required to format a manuscript.  It also covered converting your work into an acceptable file type prior to uploading it to kindle.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games and this is it in spades! You CAN spend real money in this so probably not a great choice for little ones but,  I don't mind having the option to purchase stuff in a game that keeps expanding. Thanks Game Insight  for something more than the average point, click done.
B009CVELHG|2.0|I think I'm about a quarter of the way through this movie & not sure I can finish it.<br /><br />I am such a fan of &#34;old Hollywood&#34; glam, quality pictures (storylines) but I am having a hard time with this one.  Having trouble following the dialogue, and ANY storyline.<br /><br />Guess it's just not my cup of tea.<br /><br />It was delivered in good time & in good condition so there are no complaints about that.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game. Having hours of fun with this. Watch out though it.s very very addictive.There are various different options.[[ASIN:B007AL48UK Summer Mahjong]]
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|OK, so it doesn't quite follow everything in the book. That doesn't matter. It is a fast moving and very enjoyable movie. Very pleased with their choice for Bilbo Bagginses. Now if only Amazon had better servers that didn't cut out in the middle of movies that I have bought. We have excellent internet service so it isn't at our end. Also wish I could transfer the movie I purchased to a Blue-Ray so I could watch it on the TV that doesn't hook to the internet. Now I have to buy another one on disk. :o( Still the movie is great so I won't decrease the stars because of poor service by Amazon.<br /><br />Update on the amazon prime. We had issues with our vizio TVs playing the amazon prime movies. They would cut out. So apparently, it was related to issues with the vizio not upgrading their system to play amazon prime well. When played through the PS3 and the ROKU over wifi the movies work well. Haven't had any playback issues with those. Will not rely on vizio TVs over wifi for playing the amazon prime movies.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's &#34;The Way of Kings&#34; is utterly engaging in an enigmatic way that develops across the pages of the story and reveals an array of characters that are unique, well developed and a masterpiece of human complexity. I can only hope the next in the series comes quickly!

B00198X0VS|5.0|great movie works fin. what else can I say about a blue ray. . . . . . . . .
B001BPJJ9G|2.0|While I have to say the cinematography is excellent, and clearly they had a huge budget this movie is mostly just fluff and eye-candy it's way too long and drawn out and ends as a melodrama with a very feeble plot. We saw the high ratings on IMDB and here and figured it would be a good movie - wrong ! We watched it all the way through hoping it would get better - it didn't ! If you like story-telling movies like Big fish and great Labowski this might be your cuppa tea, but otherwise I'd say just watch the trailer, it pretty much contains everything you'd want to see all conveniently condensed into a few minutes, then with the time you've saved find something that has real acting and a decent plot !
B00004XPPK|5.0|There's not much to say about this movie. It really speaks for itself! Its Rita at her best and one of her many roles where she played opposite Glenn Ford. Its a movie that is just fun to watch , even if the story is slightly confusing at first. It really is a classic.
0345803507|4.0|Very well written.  These books keep you on edge and guessing what is next.  They were all very hard to put down.

B0040QYROK|5.0|This is probably the best of the best version of Metropolis we will ever get! Kino has done a wonderful job on the dvd and blu ray versions of the film, from translation, to menu features, its clean, to the point and classic! If you love silent movies, or just movies in general, this is a must own! One of the most recognized of all silent films and one that has been around for nearly one hundred years!

B009FRG8IW|5.0|This should go down as one of the all-time best themed albums in the electronic / dance genre, in other words &#34;consecutive play start to finish&#34;.  In fact, it is almost a shame if you ever need to pause or (heaven forbid) stop mid-track.  Whether you are driving for hours, working out (great spin music), or simply imagine chilling on a Jamaican beach with your best headphones on and a tall, frozen beverage staring out over a white sand beach as the sun slowly sets in the evening, you will lose all sense of time...ah, er...what was I saying...ah yes, just get this version (deluxe) and enjoy it.
B00004TH6O|3.0|The main reason I gave it 3 stars is because there are only about 3 songs on it that are really strong. I have heard other songs from QOTSA and I can honest,y say that this album, while ok, is definitely a product of its time and not aged well. Is it worth a buy? Yes, if you are a QOTSA fan or alternative rock fan, but its still not their best.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show.  The characters are developed so well.  And there's even a little bit of history thrown in.  I just wish I could see season 3 before season 4 begins!!
B008JFUTT0|3.0|Of course by the time I watched this documentary I already knew, more or less, what it was about. However, apart from what I heard in brief review clips, I hadn't heard any of Rodriguez' music. Which I guess would be the case for most people outside South Africa. Early in the film we hear from various figures associated with his recording career, all of whom relate enthusiastically how they had immediately recognised the singer/songwriter as an outstanding talent: Bob Dylan is mentioned in the same breath. The comparison doesn't flatter Rodriguez although it is in some ways appropriate.<br /><br />I'll be frank about my reaction to hearing the songs in the film. They're awful; poorly crafted, poorly sung sub-Dylan-esque and naively, embarrassingly, \\"deep\\". That's probably the reason this guy didn't do much in the USA - which had such a profusion of vastly more talented songwriter/singers at the time. In the benighted, rigidly censored, South Africa of that period the choices were much sparser, making it easier to understand why his music caught on there.<br /><br />There are some oddities raised in the film that were never cleared up. One of the South Africans who \\"rediscovered\\" Rodriguez pointed out that the credits on the albums included \\"Jesus Rodriguez\\" and other named individuals. Who was (or is) Jesus Rodriguez? Is This Sixto Rodriguez' birth name or a pseudonym? Who are or were the other named individuals? If they really did contribute to the song writing - however one feels about its quality - then we need to hear more about their contribution.<br /><br />One thing that came as a complete surprise to me was the fact that Rodriguez' triumphant first appearance on stage in S. Africa occurred in 1998! I'd assumed, from the publicity campaign that this was a recent rediscovery, which makes me wonder why it's taken so long for the story to emerge. All the above probably reads as if I disliked the film, which I didn't. It's a fascinating story irrespective of Rodriguez' talent or lack of it. This is an interesting man who, if the character of his utterly charming daughters is anything to go by, is an admirable example of how to adjust to the unpredictability of life. But I couldn't escape the feeling, throughout the film, that I was seeing something of an idealised illusion.
B005USZML4|5.0|I was thinking of getting this book for my grandsons but decided to read it first......what a pleasure!....Theo was a very special 13 yr. old boy!  It was a great story and yes, I'm planning on buying it for my grandsons...5 star (and I'm 75 yrs. old)
1608871517|5.0|It adds a personal touch to the mighty entertainer we often see on screen, makes me understand him as an ordinary human being, the story behind every garments he had, and on top of everything, his creativity and forward-thinking.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Ah yes!  This is a great program.  I've watched only two episodes but love it already.  This show is cerebral.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I like that it is longer that the charger that comes with the Kindle fire.  I also like that when I hook it up to the quick charging unit, it charges my devices alot faster than the normal charger that came with the kindle fire.
B007Y36K46|1.0|This is the first time we ordered a movie that cost over $2.99.  This movie was $14.99.<br />About 15 minutes into the movie (when John Carter realized that he could &#34;jump&#34; on Mars) it fast forwarded on its own about 10 minutes and we could not retrieve that content.  We were very disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is excellent plz create more world tours. Could fix the bugs though. Congrats for the time spent on the product
0060839872|4.0|It's nice to read a book that helps you like yourself. It's not a popular topic in these &#34;it's all about me&#34; days.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Boring, it doesn't keep my interest at all.  You need to do something to make it more appealing to the players.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's my second time through the Downton Abbey series. I find it just as riveting as the first time I watched.
B0028O34SG|4.0|I watched Figaro after viewing Cosi at Glyndebourne last night. Both are on blu-ray. I liked Cosi so much that I found Figaro to be a bit disappointing. I plan to watch Die Zauberflote from Covent Garden on blu-ray tonight and have ordered two more Mozart operas. I hope that my reviews will be more helpful after viewing more Mozart operas.
B0011UF792|4.0|I love, love, love this man! This is one of Smiths best work. Great acting, Great Laughs and the some interesting questions for the audience. A must see for Smith fans!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I do like good Sci-Fi stories, I started reading them in the 50s and so far the Hunger Games is one of the best I ever read.  The set up is very intriguing but quite plausible which to me determines the essential quality that makes a good Science Fiction story ( with the emphasis on Science) stand out. However, the narrative, especially when it comes to the description of the characters and their social environment, is not as convincing and the inhumanly repressive regime the people are forced to live under seems to be invented more for shock effect than as a plausible social aberration - but although the story is very sad, it is also very powerful.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show. Really depicts the period accurately. Let's me travel to another time and almost another world. Can't wait for season 4.
B002BZOVLG|5.0|This is only my third Mozart opera on blu-ray. I was impressed by the production, which looked great. The performance by the entire cast was flawless. You can't go wrong with this Cosi.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|Alright watch this with your best mates because it's funny as hell! Bruce Campbell at his finest! This is a great drunken night with your flat mates!
0385349947|5.0|As the first female high school Principal in my school's 121 year history, I will never forget the day two men approached me at my first Open House and asked me if I had the 'balls' to make hard choices.  At the time, I unknowingly took Sheryl's advice and in a very sweet and ladylike manner replied, ' Gentlemen, I may not have male parts,  but I sure know how to remove them if the need arises.&#34;  With this response I was attempting to thwart the 'damned if I do, damned if I don't,' expectation' Sheryl writes about.  If I claimed to have actual 'male-like autonomy' I would be seen as a cold and heartless bitch.  If I were to deny this same 'male autonomy,'I would be seen as weak and ineffective.  Instinctively, I tried to hit the middle ground with my response, and thankfully, it was well-received with a laugh.<br /><br />After reading 'Lean-In,' I recognized myself in many of the pages.  I especially appreciated Sheryl's commentary on the art of female negotiation describing it as, &#34;trying to cross a minefield backward in high heels.&#34;  This book captures the very real differences which exist between male and female leadership experiences...and gently encourages us to examine both internal and external conflicts which might hold talented women back from sitting at the table.  I found the arguments to be hope-filled...and that new opportunities continue to be available for all of us.  Sheryl is to commended for acknowledging that, sometimes, these opportunities are either not appealing to women or too demanding for women who are torn between the family and work balancing act.  It's time for all of us to peel back the complicated structure that makes up a woman's real life and bring in supportive frameworks which allow talented females to live up to their leadership potential.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  Honest and fearless dialogue around gender realities is rare in today's marketplace.  Sheryl is someone I'd enjoy having a cup of coffee with-not because she is some liberal minded feminist (I'm a fairly conservative woman), but because I felt both her leadership intelligence AND her female heart in this book.<br /><br />And as far as I'm concerned, that's a brilliant combination for any human soul...regardless of anatomy.
B00006GO99|5.0|This CD has become my computer accompaniment ever since it arrived.  I absolutely love it with Bright Mississippi (Take 1) being my favorite track.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As the characters continue to develop and learn to adapt to their new world, the suspense mounts ever higher.  This show keeps me on the edge of my seat, wanting more.  I highly recommend it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent story with excellent acting. I don't usually like these kinds of movies but the story really sucked me in.
B005DJGMQE|3.0|We watched this a few months ago and liked the \\"Lincoln\\" movie better. It was a nice perspective but it was harder to watch after such a great movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Seamless access to all my notes, I love this app on my Kindle Fire HD!  I use Evermore on all my mobile devices but this app is one of the best versions.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Very engaging book. Although the details of the camps was not graphically explained, the book helps the reader understand what those prisoners had to experience.<br /><br />Amazing.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I love the look of these films, got it for my boys but ended up enjoying it myself.  A little morbid for some kids they main character does afterall speak to the dead but a cute film.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was looking forward to this show since I saw the previews last summer.  Unfortunately, my DVR did not record (user error?) and I missed the first episode.  I did not want to watch any of the episodes until I saw the first one.  Finally saw it the other night and I am hooked.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Could be a fun and challenging game if I could read the tiny writing for the instructions, quest, and strategies.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My 8 year-old and I both loved it! Before it was even over, he asked if there was a &#34;Rise of the Guardians 2.&#34; There should be. The characters and their environments (Santa's North Pole, the Easter Bunny's lair) were so imaginative - like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Wonderful message of hope, friendship, and the power of believing - similar to Polar Express. The graphics were like nothing I've seen, GORGEOUS!! A lot of laugh-out-loud humor and oh-my-gosh! surprises. I have a feeling that we'll be watching this again and again and again. . .
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Rented this for my boys and they loved it.  I didn't watch it myself although I initially wanted to but both of my boys have been asking for this one over and over again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is creative and totally awesome.  If I could choose any horse for free I would. Love this game.
B006M6GPMS|5.0|If you're a fan of the genius Gilbert O'Sullivan this remastered cd is a must have. His familiar 70's hits are included with new work that we don't get to hear on radio here in the states. I wasn't aware until recently that this man has never stopped producing albums but for the most part they are only distrubuted in Europe and Japan.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is one awesome series. I hope to extend my collection with the next season. Great characters, great actors, and great plot
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|David Spade is the main character and he is very expressive and hilarious.  I have seen this one more than a few times but the kids are still entertained by it.  We rent it every now and again.
B00190N4E4|4.0|I remember watching this  movie when I was a little boy thinking when is it going to end, and who is this little bald Indian man.  I appreciate it more today then when I was little because I can understand more, Gandhi G is still one of my heros from when I was a little boy.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|I was surprised to see some professional critics remark that the film was nothing but a dry historical lesson. When I went to the theater, I found myself fully immersed in the film for all of its 150 minutes. Like any great movie, it tells a story very much worth telling in a fashion that's completely absorbing and gripping even if we know the outcome. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is as terrific and deserving of all the awards he won for the part. He creates a performance that feels so lived in and real that he completely embodies our 16th President for all of the film's running time. His Lincoln is a sort mischievous storyteller who has both a folksy charm and a commanding presence, and it's easy to see why the nation loved him. Supporting performances are equally strong, and include Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones as abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, David Strathairn as Lincoln's secretary of state, and Joseph Gordon Levitt as Robert Todd Lincoln. The cast is filled with one remarkable performer after another. Scene stealers include Lee Pace, Michael Stuhlbarg, Walton Goggins, and of course, James Spader who creates a remarkably funny character. Spielberg doesn't get enough credit for his masterful direction and Tony Kushner's screenplay is a fascinatingly well constructed work. I could go on discussing the wonderful jobs by all of the film's crew but I won't. Needless to say, each of the film's 12 Academy Award nominations were well deserved and the film deserved more wins that it had on Oscar night.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks amazing, as should any recent production. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is perfectly replicated on this Blu-ray disc which is sharp, detailed, and very film-like. The film's soundtrack is equally well replicated in 7.1-channel DTS-HD Master Audio.<br /><br />As you can probably tell, I loved the film enough to spring for the pricier 4-disc edition which includes a bonus disc of special features. In total, they run about80-minutes. As always, the supplements on Spielberg's films are well produced, but I was disappointed there wasn't more. For a film dealing with such great historical significance and what I imagine was a huge production, the extras could and probably should've gone on for another two hours. They could have explored the real life Lincoln and passing of the 13th Amendment, and taken a more detailed approach to documenting the film's production. But what we get is great stuff and worth the purchase for fans of the film.<br /><br />In summation, an excellent film. One of the very finest of 2012 and an excellent Blu-ray.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, Timberlake and Kunis are great in this movie, very entertaining and funny and I am glad that I purchased it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Got this one for my son who is obsessed with angry birds.  Its easy enough for him to play and a great reward for a job well done when he's been good
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|If you want to watch a couple fight for 2 Hours and 17 minutes then this is the movie for you. The funny stuff fits in the preview trailer for this movie.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|There are better movies out there, but few are as awesome as John Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\". Growing up a fan of Arthurian legend, I remember watching this for the first time and and being a little put off by its 1980s bombasticity. At first, Nicol Williamson's performance as Merlin seemed strange and Nigel Terry as Arthur didn't feel quite right for a film's hero. But getting deeper into its story of Pagan magic, gleaming armor, epic chivalry, and trippy visuals, it was easy to be absorbed by it all. I was captivated by its sheer epicness, it's timeless story, and I was in awe by the time the credits rolled. Since then, the movie has only gotten better. Nicol Williamson, perhaps one of the most underrated actors in history delivers a monumental performance as Merlin. It only took growing up for me to realize that. It'd be so easy for an actor today like Ben Kingsley or Liam Neeson to come in and sleepwalk through the role of Merlin, or even ham it up for a paycheck. Nicol Williamson does something else. He brings it. His performance is remarkably varied. It's both big and subtle. He can play funny, threatening, and warm all at once, and it's thrilling to watch. Nigel Terry is also wonderful as Arthur. His work early in the film seems strange because it's not how we usually think of King Arthur. But by the film's end, he fully embodies the nobility, age, and weariness of this great character. Terry convincingly portrays the growth of Arthur from a 15-year-old boy to a 50 year old man. Other lead performers include Cherie Lunghi as Guenevere, Nicholas Clay as Lancelot, and of course Helen Mirren as the villainous Morgana. The rest of the cast is rounded out by a veritable who's who of future acting greats - Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Ciarin Hinds, Gabirel Byrne and more, all in what were their first big movie roles. The movie features a brilliant soundtrack of powerful classics music by Wagner and Orff. Is there anything more awesome than 50 knights in full armor riding into battle scored to Carl Orff's \\"O Fortuna\\" from \\"Carmina Burana\\"? Not really. Did I mention the movie is also rated R? Any remake made today would most certainly neuter the film's sex and violence to secure a PG-13 rating. I have no doubt that this film will endure as the definitive King Arthur movie.<br /><br />The Blu-ray features a very good transfer. It doesn't look like it was made yesterday, but nor should it. The film was often shot with filters to achieve a diffuse, dreamy look and the video transfer accurately reflects this. So don't expect razor sharp images. Otherwise, it's clean and film-like. There's a touch of controversy regarding the film's framing. Some sources claim it was shot at 1.66:1. I'm unsure what ratio is was exhibited at in the UK. I would've thought 1.85:1 was the norm by 1981. Regardless, it screened at 1.85:1 in US theaters and has been framed at 1.85:1 (or more accurately 1.78:1) since at least DVD. If the filmmakers had an issue with this, I imagine they would have spoken up by now. Regardless, it looks good. I have no problems with the Blu-ray's DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, but I admit I'm not as discerning when it comes to audio.<br /><br />As for extras, this disc includes a very good but old commentary by Director John Boorman. His comments are insightful and it makes for a good listen. Also included is the film's theatrical trailer in SD. That Warner Home Video has not given this film the special edition treatment yet is a cause for great shame. Such a landmark film deserves more. Recently, there was some movement on a fan-funded documentary which interviewed Boorman and members of the film's cast. Hopefully Warner will pick it up and release a proper special edition. Is that too much to ask for?
B009EANE3M|4.0|The Script may very well be my new favorite band.  The first 4 tracks of this CD are flat out great.  It's nice to hear adult perspective in music and The Script just feels a lot more grown up than a lot of other music out there.<br /><br />That being said, the album is pretty consistent with a couple of simply great songs but is about 2 very good tracks away from being a 5-star.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|So, overall this book is pretty interesting. It takes a little while to get super interesting though. And the characters are kind of hard to keep track of - there are a gajillion names that you don't necessarily know anything about. A lot of the characters aren't likeable either, which makes reading it a little less fun. BUT, it is hard to put down at times, and other times all too easy. Overall I think it's an okay book. More like a 3.5 rating.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Just when you think you start to see the end game, another twist, another intrigue, another murder... The next book can't come fast enough!
B0017O1MIM|5.0|\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is one of my top 3 favorite movies. It's an epic cinematic goldmine featuring one of the greatest screenplays ever written, excellent performances by a terrific cast led by Peter O'Toole, and superb direction from the masterful David Lean.<br /><br />The first time I saw \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" was a pan & scanned airing on HBO or Cinemax one Thanksgiving morning back in the 90s. I spent another decade watching it on fairly weak DVDs. For the film's 50th Anniversary restoration, Sony has remastered the film at 4K and I was lucky to see the film projected at 4K in cinemas. The experience was mind blowing. The new remaster is a technical marvel and the film was just as entertaining and engrossing as it's always been.<br /><br />While other large format films including \\"Ben-Hur\\", \\"The Sound of Music\\", and \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" have received high quality Blu-ray remasters, I think \\"Lawrence\\"'s bests them all, in large part due to the film's aesthetics. Shot by legendary cinematographer Freddie Young, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is, for my money, the most beautifully photographed film ever made. Every shot is breathtaking, with its epic desert landscapes and deep blue skies. Sony is to be commended for the hard work and money they put into restoring this amazing film. The nearly 4-hour movie has been presented all on one Blu-ray disc. Those concerned about compression issues needn't worry. The Blu-ray is absolutely stunning and brilliantly reproduces Sony's restoration work at 1080p.<br /><br />The Blu-ray's DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 presents a faithful and immersive sonic experience. Maurice Jarre's monumental score is tremendous on this Blu-ray. It should be noted that some of the film's dialogue had to be re-recorded for the 1989 restoration. It's usually integrated quite seamlessly, but there's a scene between the Alec Guinness and Arthur Kennedy characters immediately following the film's intermission where the quality of the dialogue notably varied.<br /><br />If you love \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and have the money to spare, I'd recommend purchasing this limited edition box set. In addition to the bonus disc featured on the standard 2-disc release (featuring a new interview with Peter O'Toole, an older 60-minute documentary, a chat with Steven Spielberg, and archival featurettes), this set includes a second bonus disc. For \\"Lawrence\\" fans, the biggest treasure will be the legendary deleted balcony scene. This was noted by screenwriter Robert Bolt to be the finest scene he'd ever written. It was to be included in the 1989 restoration but they couldn't find a suitable voice actor to dub Jack Hawkins' dialogue. It's a great scene, and it's a bit of a shame it hasn't been restored to the movie. But here it is, presented in standard definition with an intro by editor Anne V. Coates (probably recorded in 1989). The disc also includes an interview with the ever-enlightening Martin Scorsese (in HD), a featurette on the 50th Anniversary remaster (in HD), an 80-minute tour of locations from 2000 by the film's location and property manager Eddie Fowlie (in SD), vintage featurettes, and some older AFI interviews with various directors (probably conducted for their 100 Years... shows). Last but not least, the film's theatrical trailers are included in full HD (another great reason for fans to pick up this version).<br /><br />In addition to the Blu-ray discs, this set includes a limited mounted 70mm film frame, an 88-page hardcover book and a CD of Maurice Jarre's score. Anyway, a great set that'll please any fan of the film.
0679805273|5.0|In the Amazon Listing for \\"Oh, the Places You'll Go\\", the book is recommended for readers ages 4-8.  Let's get serious.<br /><br />This book is for adults or people who have graduated from some sort of secondary school, on their way to growing into adulthood.<br /><br />I first received it when I left my position of 13 years to be transferred and promoted to another part of the country.  It came from my staff.  It was their way of acknowledging how far we'd all been together, and how much more I was going to be able to do with my heightened job status.  They were right.  Since that time, I think I've purchased the book 10-12 times that I can count, and all for people who were leaving from my career or home location, and off to see how they could grow and change.  It's always a popular gift.... particularly, (gasp) if you annotate it with notes throughout, tying in Seuss predictions for an exciting future, to their own plans for a successful future.<br /><br />An awesome gift... I keep my now 23 year old copy at my desk.  Oh, the places I've gone.<br /><br />Thought this might be a welcome hint before graduation season.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I can't share the enthusiasm of the other reviewers. Without giving away the story, the continual plot device of building up characters (very well done) is offset by the disappointing and ultimately predictable demise of anyone of interest at the end of each chapter (or book). This is the problem of many science fiction and &#34;after the fall&#34; novels. The evocation of the world and its inhabitants is excellent, but he can't finish in a satisfying way. I deleted this from my Kindle immediately after finishing it. I'll read the next one by Howey, but with trepidation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the graphics! My younger nieces love it, and it teaches them responsibility. They are always like &quot;gotta clean my horsey!&quot;
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I went into this film without having seen the musical. Ultimately, what I found was a strong, very moving motion picture with some terrific songs. Performances are strong, especially from Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe (I thought his singing was fine).<br /><br />The biggest quibbles I have of the film are over its direction and constant singing. Nearly the entire movie is sung through, which can make for a trying experience, especially during the film's slow spots. As mentioned constantly in the film's press and marketing, the film had the actors singing live on set as the cameras rolled. This works to underlie the emotions of the characters during the big musical numbers, but it works less well for when the actors have to sing their dialogue. It's often tuneless and flat, even from a great singer like Jackman! The film's director Tom Hooper likes to shoot his movies with fish-eye lenses and unconventional framing. Personally, I felt these were often distracting and distasteful, again, especially during the slow moments of the story. As things get going though, they're less of an issue.<br /><br />The movie presents a deeply moving story of one man's journey of redemption, which unfortunately gets sidelined during the second half for a thin and predictable love story. Still, it comes together quite nicely. The last hour or so is terrifically stirring and many of the big musical numbers are well done.<br /><br />Picture quality is solid and the the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio is very dynamic. Both accurately reproduce the theatrical experience. Extras aren't plentiful but solid. There's a good hour-long documentary, an additional featurette on Hugo's original novel, and a commentary from the director which I chose not to listen to. The Blu-ray set includes a DVD and digital copies (iTunes and Ultraviolet).
B00908DDZM|5.0|What a fantastic album, the words of the songs are so meaningful and well writing. I am so a pleasantly surprised by this album.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|It very good would get a book again from her. Its exciting and it would keep you thinking the whole way through the book.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show. I only wish I wouild have watched it when it started on TV.  I also love the idea of watching it on my Kindle Fire the picture is great.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Ang Lee's film \\"Life of Pi\\" is a technological marvel, perfectly blending 3D and state of the art digital effects with a great adventure story which is also remarkably spiritual. It all comes together for a deeply moving motion picture experience.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is stellar as well. The film features some of the best usage of 3D since James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" and Martin Scorsese's \\"Hugo\\". It's perfectly replicated on this 3-disc collector's edition. This set also includes a standard 2D version of the film which also looks amazing. Audio is fully immersive and perfectly replicates the film's sonic power.<br /><br />The extras are spread over the 2D and 3D Blu-ray discs. These include deleted scenes, a detailed hour-long \\"making of\\" documentary, and additional features which explore the film's Oscar-winning visual effects. Also included in this version is a DVD copy of the film and digital copies (iTunes & Ultraviolet). Overall, a great value and a great Blu-ray package!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|MUST READ TRUE SF. HARD TO PUT DOWN. THE PRICE MAKES THIS CLASSIC A STEAL. ANY REAL FAN MUST OWN THIS

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very good show. It brings in historicle events that impact the characters lives. The only thing I had against it was that it can be very dramatic at points. Other than that its funny and an afflicting series to watch.
B00B671W6W|5.0|This is for fans of anthrax as well as fans of classic Rock! 6 classic tracks of some of the best covers ever done, From AC/DC 's T'N'T to thin Lizzy's jailbreak to Journey's keep on runnin to cheap trick's Big eye's to Boston's Smokin to Rush's Anthem and of course a new Anthrax track Crawl plus a remix of Crawl excellant covers on this release!

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Watch arrived in three days, faster tan expected.  Great quality for such a low price!  Gains but 3 seconds per day.  Bests my Omega!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie!  It never fails to cheer me up and is hilarious, entertaining, and full of talented young singers/actors!
0440237688|5.0|These are some of the best books I have ever read. Young adult fiction, magical realism... they explore the depths of what it means to be human. Themes of color, music, memory and love run throughout the set.<br /><br />I found myself referring back to them in my mind relating to things going on in my life. For exmaple, Kira, the main character of 'Gathering Blue' is physically flawed--she has born with a limp. But when offered the chance to fix it(in the third book), she refuses. Today with physical scars on my body from extensive surgery, I'm tempted to start hating my body for letting me down, but I am reminded that I am so much more than my body.<br /><br />This review could go on and on, but I'll comment here on the depiction of 'evil' in the four books The implication throughout is that evil has eventually metamorphosed into both the 'clinical' society of book one and the savage, kill-or-be-killed society of book two.<br /><br />In book three we meet the 'perfect balance' society, and ominously, evil, personified as a character, pays occasional visits to the village to disrupt things. Then in book four there is a harry-potter-like showdown with this character, but much more tastefully done. I have no issues with this depiction of evil (after all the epitome of an evil uncaring deed is what drives the first novel, then most of the characters of book two can be considered 'uncaring and evil') It's just too much of an optimistic outlook I think. Evil is then something that is put upon mankind and can just as easily be banished. My personal opinion is that human evil is just that--human and will be around as long.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is her 'evil' isn't the black-and-white kind you see everywhere. Matt, the main character of the third book, was raised in utter squalor in the poor part of the poor part of town, by savage, uncaring, almost sub-human people and he, if anyone, should turn out to be pure evil. Yet, he still manages to find kindness andlove deep within--mostly with the help of his dog.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Extremely fun and highly addictive. I installed to get more bongo chips for the bongo beach game, and low and behold I found another guilty pleasure.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I'm old enough to tell you that this is a great show.  I'm probably too old to be watching but I'm completely hooked!
0375851569|5.0|I ordered this set to share with my youngsters and it was a great value with timely shipping.  All of the books are hardback, durable, and in good condition.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Good game for older adults do to the colors and helps with giving something to do. They like the colors change and movement to help to keep exercising their minds.
B009J2VQSK|5.0|This was a gift for someone who wasn't able to get to the theater when it was showing.  David O. Russell did an incredible job, and we've loved seeing the interviews with the principals, especially the one with Katie Couric.  So happy to be able to share the beauty with family.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love Mcpe but it dose not have all the stuff in Mcpc Also it should have more updates on it on the date
B003JTHXOK|5.0|sparks greatness with a little twist of suspense more than most of his stories. really did enjoy his safe haven
B000JSI7BM|5.0|One af Meryl Streep's best performances! Anne Hathaway is adorable too. I've watched this many many times! Never get tired of it.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I also watched the TV series based on the book which was excellent.  The book and TV series should be a required class for every historry teacher.  Many Americans have little idea about the downside of American foreign policy after WWI, nor do our politicians, which is a shame because they are continuing the same policies.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great follow for to the first. Excited for the next one!<br />I loved how they brought all the characters back together.
0321885112|5.0|I stumbled on sketchnotes while researching mind maps and similar methods of note taking. I have to say that this book is pure inspiration. It feels like some hybrid of Buzan's The Mindmap Book and Loomis Fun With A Pencil. Both brilliant classics that will have a new shelf companion in the sketchnote handbook. Even after reading this entertaining book and watching the videos I still find myself picking this book up and browsing through it for inspiration and reference. While we are on the subject, do yourself a favor and get the video edition of this book. They really compliment one another and help solidify the principles and lessons. I couldn't imagine having only one or the other. Do yourself a favor, buy this book. You will not regret it.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I would recommend this mini-series to anyone who enjoys period films. Very good dialog. While I preferred the acting of the leading man more, the leading woman's acting improved over the episodes. She started out a little deadpan.
B0089XH38M|3.0|Every time I turn on the tablet tthe AVG wants to up date and after about 20 minutes it wants to do it again. I'm kind of concerned about it sending out what I'm doing on it to some other database collection info.  Seems kind of stupid to update every 20 minutes
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is the best game ever! It is even better than Temple Run! Wait? Why are you just reading this review when you can play this awesome game for yourself? Everyone, play Temple Run 2!
B00005JOA0|5.0|Oh boy oh boy!  Is this ever a good film!  This is the best one so far that I have seen from the BBC.  But let me tell you, there is no virtue in being a coward and an unwilling masochist!  The very first time my husband pulled any of the stunts that I have seen here, all hell would have broken loose!  I kid you not!  And if you don't believe me...just ask him!  This is definitely a love, hate, film.  So full of emotion it sticks like a lump in your throat.  Intolerable cruelty is not something we have to live with and we don't as a rule in this day and age.  How those people lived back then is beyond me!  500 stars for this one!
B00BHMF578|5.0|What a fantastic job by Ben Afleck all the way around! Amazing story, good suspense. Pity our current leadership couldn't or wouldn't pull this type of feat off for the poor souls in Benghazi!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|It's diffinitely defferant. I like it. It has a jazz and blues tempo to it,then comes that Jimi Hendrix guitar-rif that sends your mind flying into a supersonic rethem.
B0041D843M|5.0|Recently, through a real friend from the time I was still an adolescent, I came across this book.<br />The message of this book is very clear.<br />But I'm afraid not everybody wants to listen to it.<br />Because it is much easier not to change your eating habits and your lifestyle.<br />The &#34;slimming industry&#34;, the pharmaceutical industry and a good deal of the medical profession, focused on fighting symptoms when it is already too late, will not be happy when you follow the &#34;wake-up call&#34; of this book.<br /><br />Campbell is a real friend. You better listen to what he has to tell.
B0064QNS62|3.0|The game was fun but it was very difficult for me to use the controls. Playing on kindle fire had to try to hold it up while using both hands to work controls. Couldn't do anything with it laying flat. May have just not been coordinated enough. The game itself I liked.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|Just finished Lovely Bones this morning.  It was a little hard to read - I found myself having to read certain things a couple of times due the stilted writing and LONG sentences throughout.  But I did enjoy the story - maybe because I'd like to think that's what Heaven is like regardless of Who or What is in charge of the place.  In my mind Suzie's murder was secondary - dealing with life after a loved one is gone was the primary focus.  I take comfort in thinking my mom is sometimes in a room with me or holding her hand over my mouth to keep me from shooting it off when I shouldn't.  LOL. Because people believe in different things, it's probably not a book that's easily recommended.  But I did like it and thought it was worth the time invested in reading it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|great flick.  Really loved it.  The themes were both for children and adults alike.  The video game references were perfect.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Although maybe a tad too long, the story was complex and suspenseful enough to keep me engaged.  I am envious of the writing.
0061124958|5.0|This book is a gem, if you love to read, this is a must have. I believe from the age of 4, a child can take this challenge and read and enjoy this gem. My only dislike was that it was not the glossy hardcover, that i knew it to have as a child, but its whats inside that counts.  Happy reading.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|If I had never read this book I believe I would be a divorcee still wondering what we did wrong!
0385349947|5.0|This book really hit home-I think she has lived my life.  I am a female medical doctor who trained in the land of \\"good ole boys\\"-and still work in much of it.  From enduring the sexist (medical?) jokes, demeaning condescending attitudes, having to take abusive situations to the medical school Dean....this list goes on and on.  It started with my medical school interview-good thing my husband had a good job so he could support me...how can you go back to school and \\"abandon your children(?)\\"...to medical school attendings stating that women needed to be home with their kids (that surgeon's wife worked)-and it didn't matter my husband was more nurturing and stayed home with the kids..the list goes on and on.  The first week of residency a local physician told two of us (women) that his clinic doesn't hire women as they don't want to work as hard (!).  Four years later one of my female cohorts joined them-and they worked her to death while they went skiing, etc.  Even though I have been in medicine for over 20 years and you would think society's views would progress, if it has, it is at a snail's pace.  My in-law's couldn't get the concept for two years that I was going back to school to be a doctor, not a nurse.  And we still get mail addressed to Dr. and Mrs.-instead of Dr.and Mr.  I bought copies of this book for both my twenty-some year old daughters-as one is an accountant with an international firm-and she is still having to learn how to be assertive and not a \\"bitch\\"-as changing societal perception is difficult.  I talked with one of my male colleagues about this book-and he didn't \\"get it\\".  I guess just as I wouldn't understand the feeling of having prostate cancer.  Perhaps this book will help.
B008393Q2O|4.0|This app is nice. IG could be better if there was a widget to show notes on a home screen.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Ok, I admit this book was hard to put down and I couldn't wait to see how it ended. That being said, this was the epitome of a dysfunctional relationship. A controlling, immature boy with a wishy-washy, insecure girl. At points in the book, I was certain it was going to end with someone's death. By the end, I kept thinking I hope to God this is not being read by teenage girls who think that marriage is the answer to your relationship woes. Ok, I just gave away the ending, but it was pretty predictable the whole way through. I guess in retrospect, I hated it more than I loved it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|so addictive. Greatest time passer since angry birds. wish it wouldn't freeze my Samsung tab, would get a 5. but other than that grea game.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|I can't proceed if I did not put a review .I don't what's inside the book..I think I would rate after done reading.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I  originally read this book as a young teenager. I thanked my Mother for suggesting it. I saw someone reading it lately and decided to read it again as an old lady. It was fabulous this time too. Great insight into life in New York during World War I.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The 3D Blu-Ray disc is spectacular. The special effects and the color photography are knock-outs. I never thought having a 3D TV would be so enjoyable, but believe me, it is well worth having. I had friends over who had never seen the movie and they were floored. If possible, get this Blu-Ray in the 3D version.
B0066NA8CU|1.0|ok I am bored - I have heard all the hype of this tv show -- so I sit and watch this show finally  first let me say  I was so dis appointed !  first it is predictable --  this plot has worn thin  --  it is so over done -  the wife doesn't live up to the hype  -- I can't get passed a couple of episodes -- you just lose interest --  this is boring tv --  it could be something  - it has some great actors in it -- but that doesn't make a hit  --  don't waste your time
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A short but very complete story of how we seem to struggle with time.<br />Elegantly written the essence to humanity is capture in this story.
0316017930|5.0|I gave this to my daughter for christmas and she told me that she wanted her husband to read it so she would have someone to discuss the book with her. She loved it! I told her to pass it on to me when they're done. Sounded good to me.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Much more interesting than the first.  I wasn't a hugh fan of the first book, but this one made up for it.  I'm excited for the next in the series.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Having read this book about thirty years ago I still enjoyed reading it again. Some of these old books are so well written.
B0055JPM6I|1.0|I would like to have the part of my brain that remembers this horror surgically removed.  NOTHING redeeming about it.
B0065AO94W|5.0|Johnny Depp in two of his best movies. Enchanting, funny and artistically off center, both of these movies will please the romantic cravings of the lonely heart odd balls out there. You know who we are. ;)
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|For young and old - sure to please. My 5 year old loves to quote the movie, especially Vanelope's lines...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great story line. Love the way no one is a sacred cow. Can't wait for the new shows. Totally addicted.
B007WPM7SO|5.0|I was captured by this love story.  The story is told during world war II so it is a history story as well.  Wonderful acting.
B00005J9PB|4.0|This movie does a great job of feeling as if it came from a comic book. If you like that kind of thing (I do) and are attracted to kind of crazy, off kilter females (I am) then I can recommend this one for your viewing enjoyment. It is very stylized and will take you on a fun and completely unbelievable adventure.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  All my fave characters and their fave oneliners.  The micro transactions can get you in trouble fast though.  Especially when the game thinks you hit the buy button twice.  All that said I wish this game was available on the PC then I could have some friends join me.  Needing hearts to purchase things is impossible without them.  Ah well rest of the game makes up for it
B00BF11STU|1.0|Some of the worst acting and directing I've ever seen.  There's nothing good about it.  The actors spoke way too fast, appeared to be merely spitting out lines without any attempt to show emotion.  Way too unrealistic and obvious lack of research to prepare a movie with even the slightest bit of accuracy relative to 9/11, how military and other federal personnel operate, etc.<br /><br />I know that I, as even an amateur, would have done a significantly better job and made the movie worth watching.
1612680011|5.0|Many other reviews complain that there isn't enough in this book to get you going. This book is far too short to have all of the answers! Read it and let your mind wander, do some research and buy other books that are more focused on what you're interested in learning. This book should just get your creative juices flowing and make you hungry for more knowledge.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|This is Ridley Scott, right? That's pretty much all you need to know. Other that Michael Fassbender (X-men First Class) and Charlize Theron (Snow White and the Huntsman), it's a cast of relative unknown's. It starts off beautifully, with a lot of unknows but after 30 minutes you start to get that &#34;I've seen this before&#34; feeling. It took me two sittings just to get through it. The first viewing was cut short because I believed I knew what was coming. The second viewing was to confirm what I believe was coming. ... and it was. :-(  It's a prequal folks, clear and simple !!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's all the genres rolled into one. What is not to enjoy! I can not wait for season 4 to be released.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Why did you update something that was awesome? It is now confusing clutterd and over all NOT USABLE! it was a 5  star app before the update now it is not even a single star. I wish I could go back and get the old version. YUCK!
B008JFUO36|5.0|It has been quite some time since I have had the pleasure to see such a fantastic Sci Fi - Thriller. The story is smart and engaging, the film is incredibly detailed and stylistically mindblowing. It has been incredibly photographed and superbly edited. The actors are great as well. The soundtrack is pulse-pounding and atmospheric. So, I guess most of the professional reviewers who give this movie bad grades obviously have quite strange ideas what makes a film great and what doesn't, as far as I'm concerned I couldn't be happier with how Oblivion turned out. Great imagery is not contrary to good storytelling, in fact good movies tell aspects of the story through their visuals as is the case with Oblivion. I believe Joseph Kosinski is definitely the most interesting and talented director starting his career in the last few years for sure. I give this film my highest recommendation, and I am really diappointed that even a piece of work and art such as this mostly gets bashed by people who would probably never come up with anything like it themselves...
B007REV4T8|5.0|Well, Daniel Craig actually.<br />After years of the Bond franchise looking for it's footing in the 21st century. Ms Broccoli has struck gold with Daniel Craig as James Bond. At last, a Bond that has flaws and issues!! And the character still has a lot of the baggage from the previous efforts, but Craig's take on Bond brings a whole new \\"Edginess\\". Sadly, we loose one of Bonds closest at the end of the film; but it is a re-launch of the institution - isn't it??<br />We have a brand new Q (Quartermaster). The character is now fully fleshed out and no longer the long suffering foil to James Bond. Along with this is a fresh take on the Moneypenny character; no longer just a pretty face behind a desk.<br />Great Score, amazing visuals and probably the creepiest villan to come along in a long while.<br />This adventure marks the third installment of Daniel Craig's James Bond. It's high adventure at it's best and well worth the look !!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Watched all four seasons of this show.  Was impressed with the talent that had been assembled to produce this series.  Exceptional wardrobe and sensational set design and filming locations.  King Henry was played beautifully as someone you have to love but just hated. What a story and very well done! Excellent!
B000002OTL|4.0|The music is fantastic. However, the movie dialogue included was cute the first couple of times, but becomes tiresome after repeated listening.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game it's so much fun and it feels real because you feed them and treat them and can even do competitions. :D
B007PS0X0W|3.0|Put Kate Beckinsale in black Leather with those pale blue contact lenses and I'd follow her anywhere; yes, even to watch this movie. Her husband / writter should have known better. This came across as a final effort to milk the franchise for every last drop of blood (money) they could. Kate should have stood her ground and insisted that Scott Speedman reprise Michael Corvins' character. Trying to hold continuity by \\"Micheal's on the roof\\" just doesn't make it. They had a golden opportunity with the story line offered in Underworld Evolution. It would have made a great Beckinsale / Speedman trilogy. Too bad. Even Selene can't pull this one off.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is turning out to be one of my favorite CD's.  The combination of songs and style make this a very enjoyable listening experience. I have been playing it almost exclusively in my car and in my quiet times at home. I find myself humming some of the tunes from the CD while working. Can you tell I really like it?  I hope The Piano Guys make more of the same....soon!
B003BVK36Q|3.0|I was curious to see how Le Carre adapted to the post Cold War era.  Would there be enough intrigue and double-dealing to feed a novel?  Would the old cold warrior have sufficient knowledge of and connection to the new world to write about it?<br /><br />Not to worry -- Le Carre writes an intricate and witty novel set in Germany involving all the various players in the \\"war on terror.\\"  The most effective element of the novel is Le Carre's ability to show the extent to which, in the modern world, all of us are pawns in some larger game and not truly in control of our own destinies.<br /><br />While I like the characters of the English banker and German lawyer and German spooks, and while the plot twists are worthy of a Le Carre novel, the book suffers from slow moving dialogue that accomplishes little.  It is almost as if Le Carre is stalling for time.  The book should have been pared down to a short story or a novella.
B0052REUW0|5.0|Pinker outlines the case that contrary to what fearmongers would have us believe, violence is in decline both in raw numbers and as a proportion of the population. The former measure is critical as an index of needless suffering inflicted and the latter as an index of relative safety. We have come a long way from the days of total warfare in which &#34;collateral damage&#34; was the rule rather than the exception and sadistic Inquisitors and pious Crusaders executed the will of their wrathful, fictitious God. Humanistic values of compassion and reason worked in tandem to bring about changes in attitudes toward violence and a reduction in violence itself.
0545405777|5.0|I had some reservation about this story in the beginning because the plot reminded too much of \\"The Lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, however, is a great story and it's easy to follow. The plot is similar to Shirley Jackson's the lottery that is based on the escape goat syndrome. Suzanne Collins manages to add some spice to the subject in a very interesting manner.<br /><br />Her characters development throughout the story is based on (first-person) her lead character Katniss Everdeen opinion about the people in her surroundings. It's difficult to like the lead character and the author should be applauded for this fact. After all Katniss is only 16 years old and have been raised under very hard circumstances. She has developed a protected wall around her. Even though she is very stubborn she does change her opinion about people as she learns more about them, and slowly the reader will start liking Katniss more and more.<br /><br />The setting and scene description lacks details and the \\"reader\\" has to use his/hers own imagination a lot. I prefer a more detailed scene description.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILER - The ending in the book is much better than it was in the movie. As of a matter of fact the film producers really made a mess of this one. (The film did follow the book unusually well except for the ending part of the \\"game.\\")<br /><br />In the book version Collins allow for all the players that have lost in the game (died) to get some payback - revenge, and it was written very well. It was a great ending of the game part of the story and it was completely over looked and ruined in the film.<br /><br />This book can be read by anyone, young or old.

B00B8M4IMK|4.0|.<br />Good features and function, full-speed charging for phones and many (not all) tablets.<br /><br />- - - Speed Matters - - -<br /><br />Sometimes you need to charge in a hurry. Even if a charger \\"works with your device\\" it may be painfully slow. Get one that will charge your devices at full speed (like the charger that came with your device).<br /><br />For starters, the \\"Amps\\" need to be high enough. That's usually 1 Amp for smartphones, about 2 Amps for large tablets. (A higher amp charger is always OK.) Some chargers are only 1/2 Amp (500mA).<br /><br />Problem is, Apple devices use their own rules to decide charging speed. A designed-for-Apple charger may be slow to charge non-Apple devices, and vice versa, even if its Amp rating is high enough.<br /><br />Anker gets it right by optimizing one port for Apple products (including iPad) and the second port for non-Apple products. The two ports make it versatile, even if you never charge two devices at once.

B00B2DSIAI|4.0|This was fun from beginning to end. This movie brings back fun from my youth,as I see many gaming characters.  I with they had more licensing agreement to use historical characters more in this movie, but it was fun none the less. If you know Sarah Silverman's sarcastic sense of humor, it fit so well with her character.
0446554995|5.0|Don't read these books but it was good, I suppose. I apologize. The gift worked out well enough I do believe
B007R108WA|5.0|The movie really stands up to the book in its beauty and utter creepyness. Not scary movie creepy, but &#34;This movie makes me identify with a killer, and now I feel bad about myself,&#34; creepy.
0143113100|5.0|The book arrived very quickly and in good condition, and I was glad I purchased it. Very interesting read and I would recommend it to anyone!
B008YI91HS|4.0|When this movie first came out, I though it was awesome. It was at the infancy of computer animation and showed a lot of things never seen in a movie.  Now that we've seen it all before, the story line could be updated somewhat but go with when it was made.<br />With dna cloning a lot closer to reality today than ever, it might be time for a sequal, but please not like number three
B005DI97S0|5.0|Memnoch was a touching, sad story to me. I felt so bad for Lestat at the end.. &#60;3 Lestat with all my heart. He is a wonderful Magnificent Being that is truly someone I can relate to.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Playback is great, story is awesome...my wife and I saw Phantom on our first date, and re-watch this Blu-Ray every year on that date to celebrate.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app works great I really like it and it is easier than writing something on paper because u could lose it. I also like it because u can title it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I loved this movie. I have watched just about every version there is of this story including taking it in at the theatre.  The movie did its job representing this this story.  At first, I was a little put off by the two male leads, they did not feel strong enough in voice for the part. I think Hugh Jackman eventually became believable and I enjoyed his character.  I not sure Russel Crowe quite pulled off the singing, but he is a great actor that can do anything so I can't complain, even for a pro, that role must have been hard.<br /><br />Anne Hathoway, omg, what she put herself through and pulled off was nothing short of amazing.  I wonder how long it takes to let(get) that character out of your system when all is complete.  Fan of hers forever.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|The Sequel that is just as touching and heartwarming as the first. I always thought she should end up with the Phantom.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was recommended to me by a close friend. The book instantly grabbed me. The story is wonderful with a few unexpected twists. I felt like I was taken on a wonderful journey. Would definitely recommend to others.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|awesome movie even better in 3d if you don't get a headache from the 3d  great price for the movie
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|I really enjoyed this watching this movie with my kids, they (and admittedly me) were enthralled with the character potrayals in this movie. The characters were a little \\"darker\\" than I expected but this work. Great story line which flowed easily for kids to follow. Enough there for a yearly comback
B0083SBMBM|5.0|HULK SMASH! Its fantastic. Gave this as a gift but Still it was wonderful! Would suggest it for anyone! Awesome film
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was more of a story than I thought it would be, I was pleasantly surprised. Quite the love story that was definitely leaving me wanting more at the end.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had no expectations upon opening this book, as I had never read one of Mr. Card's books before, but what a pleasant surprise from start to finish.  A great journey!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|The Civil War (War of Northern Aggression) was fought to PRESERVE STATES RIGHTS not for the welfare of the African race.  The movie preoccupation with the 13th amendment is another intrusion by Hollywood to rewrite a politically correct U.S. history.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I love the Phantom. Personally I am a Sarah B. {as Christine} Fan but Sienna was great too! Great Movie for anyone!

B00BHMETKC|2.0|I was excited to see it being it won so many awards but I realized through it that the only reason they received so many awards was the connection with Hollywood and government. The only thing I found interesting was that it is a true story.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Pros<br />+Sturdy<br />+Great fun to play with<br />+Clear instructions<br />+Pieces are well sorted<br /><br />Cons<br />-Hefty price tag<br /><br />My daughter and her boyfriend saved for this set for a couple of months, and they think this is well worth the price. They bought it over spring break from our local lego store, and it took them about 2 or 3 total days. They're in college, and both have played with legos their entire lives. Good thing too, because the set is enormous!<br /><br />You start off building it floor by floor. The instructions were very clear, and lego did a great job with sorting out the pieces. There are 4 boxes inside that big one, and each of those have numbered bags. You open each number when the instructions indicate, which keeps things moving smoothly. I know sometimes sets have missing pieces, but this one didn't have any. I've just called lego before, and they sent me the pieces for free, so don't worry too much about that.<br /><br />This set is pretty sturdy when finished. I have the impression that I could throw it at my granite counter and the counter would take damage. The amount of thought and engineering that went into this set is incredible! The trash compactor has moving walls, and extra pieces to put in there so your lego figures can wedge it. The emperor's room has a rigged platform that falls when Darth Vader and Luke fight, and the chair swivels. The prisoners cell is very cleverly designed as well-it not only leads into the cell, but a trapdoor leads to the trash compactor. The TIE fighter has its own swiveling stand, and there are a couple of elevators in the set. I cannot say enough how impressed I am with the attention to detail in this set.<br /><br />Although I didn't buy it, I must say had this been available when my daughter was a kid, I would have bought it for her. It's a really fun set to play with, even for adults, and with all the mini-figures, you can really have some cool scenarios!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Many people like Cut the Rope  and this game is by the same company it is a attractive game and its pretty easy to level up<br /><br />If you want to buy this game you should and its free!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hooked on episode one-Season 1. Entertainment that does not need vulgar language or nudity to be a good show.  Oh such a wait for Season 4!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This was a nice read for those with an interest in ancient Egypt. The plot has a good amount of historical / archaeological truth built in which adds to the integrity of  the book. There's good character development and an interesting was of telling the story - using the two main characters as back-and-forth narrators. Overall a good job for the first book of this trilogy.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Good read a real page Turner I spent my whole day with my face in the book.  William Landry knows Boston
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I laughed when the dictionary had my name and  my brother's name in the dictionary it also has a lot of words
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's nice to see true talent, both in story and in characters. Go back to wherever you came from reality TV! Truly a shame that there isn't any other shows like this. God bless America.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love having multiple locations, maps, radar and more. I can stay in touch with all my locations. Will be very helpful this Summer on the bike.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm sad this is over. I didn't expect such a love story out of something that could have been all sex and submission. I couldn't stop reading. I need more!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This shows how a Great artist is eternal and never loses their Zeal! Awesome Album and whats hard to be leave is these are studio test tracts !!!
B0064QNS62|1.0|Terrible controls.  The virtual buttons are very unresponsive so that even a simple level becomes a study in frustration.  Fortunately I acquired this game as a Free App of the Day.  Even so, I feel I was overcharged.
B0031TZ8TU|2.0|This book is a slow read . It is a real  story and probably well researched but it much different<br />Then Ken's normal stories
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|If you are a Twihard it is immaterial what reviews you read for anyi Twilight topic just takes hold and you may not like it but you seem to always love it.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Great swordplay, sex, and intrigue in this period piece of Roman Empire history played out through the eyes of gladiators and their House masters. This show makes you glad you don't live in those days. Brutal life and short ones at that.
B00C0NFMKI|3.0|After a long wait for the new album it has finally arrived.  I was curious to hear the direction Paramore would be heading on their latest effort.  While it may not have the impact of their previous work, it still is a decent record.  This latest album may be missing some of the alternative rock sound and replaced it with pop-rock. I would rate the music around a b- and the lyrics around a c-, although Hayley's voice and vocal patterns make up for some of the imperfections.  It feels very polished and produced almost too much, which seems stale at times. For the fans who are expecting \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" or \\"Riot\\" type records I think you will be a little disappointed.  Those who appreciate an album redefining the idea of what Paramore's music means. This will be an alright record to check out.  Personally I feel this album will be worth playing for a month or two but won't be replayed very frequently after.  \\"Fast In My Car\\", \\"Now\\", \\"Ain't It Fun\\", and \\"Still In To You\\" are the highlights of the album.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Fascinating story and excellent writing. You feel as if you are living in this mediaeval world and know the characters personally.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|I have always admired Katy Perry after watching her in Part of Me, I now love and worship Katy Perry!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir does a fabulous job keeping his character alive in this novel of Martian exploration. I really enjoy how he explains the mechanics of what his main character is doing to stay alive and well while the Earth launches a rescue mission. About the only real gripe i found was his ending, which I thought was weak and abrupt. He could have done a re-write of the last 20 pages to end the book properly. Other than that. I had a great time reading it.
B00A4FOWYQ|3.0|Let me start by saying, I'm a long time Tegan and Sara fan. It would be fair to say that Heartthrob is my least favorite of their albums to date. I have no issues against their choice to go from indie alternative to electro-pop rock. I quite enjoy an artist who is willing to pursue various genre of music. \\"Heartthrob\\" falls short for me on track 4,5,6 and the first single \\"closer\\" didn't do it for me. On the positive side, \\"I was a fool\\" and \\"I couldn't be your friend\\" are the best songs on the album. \\"Goodbye, Goodbye\\" and \\"Love they Say\\" are worth highlighting as well.  \\"I was a fool\\" very easily would make my top 10 best Tegan and Sara track playlist.  I feel the album is missing some of the key elements that I love from a T & S record. I would rate the music around a b-, the lyrics a c+, the vocal elements b+. The best way I can say it is this album doesn't excite me the way previous releases have. The album sounds very over-produced, the tracks blend together and are a little dull. The biggest problem I have had with this album is wanting to be in love with it and not being able to. I have nothing but great admiration, respect and support for Tegan and Sara as artists and musicians.  In no way does this album change the way I feel about them. I would still be thrilled to go see them play live. I really would love to hear them convert these songs to an acoustic set.  Still looking forward to all the great things to come from this band.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|really dark and demonic, but reaaaaly scary.  it would be a 5 if i didn't dislike the demonic element .
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It is always captivating to be able to watch from someone teaching you how to install a part to someone tripping or singing horribly so this apps is much appreciated while waiting patiently to board a plane, doctor's office or being in the car with your teen son.

B005EGXTL2|5.0|Enjoyed all three books.  It is a reminder how our greed and its companion war can destroy life as we know it
B0057R5XRG|4.0|not sure if the blu ray is all that much better than DVD.  the movie is pretty old, so the special effects are more &#34;fake&#34; looking with the detail of the blue ray
B004PGO25O|4.0|Pressfield nails it. He puts a finger and a period on the foils and triumphs of effectively facing and overcoming &#34;resistance.&#34; He fluently verbalizes why so few persist when faced with the obstacles that inevitably arise when we aspire to reach our dreams. But what's more, he demonstrates what we can do about it. Kudos Pressfield!
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Delta Machine<br /><br />When I think of this title, I think of wonderful years of driving through the Mississippi Delta (think Fly on The Windscreen with sweat dripping down the face) and listening to these unique Englishmen who make music through machines. That's my own personal way of interpreting the new work: an inspired collection of songs influenced by American blues, and country, transmuted through elaborate looking, and sounding, electronic devices for your endless listening pleasure.<br /><br />Like the divine convergence of blues and electronic on Recoil's Subhuman, or much of Nick Cave's spiritual striving oeuvre, the mystical, and divine, seem to emanate from such impressive collaboration within creativity. And DM always takes it to new heights.<br /><br />The rapturous songs on this work expand across your soul's landscape to evolve into a symphony of power, and intrigue, that leave the listener brimming with excitement. While this highly impressive work does not grab hold of my attention from start to finish like Music for the Masses, or Black Celebration, the great heights it achieves demonstrate that DM can mine very familiar territory, and themes, in the realm of lyricism; and manage to successfully find new directions through which to fly. \\"Heaven\\" is as beautiful as \\"Wrong\\" was haunting; these two songs representing just some of the incredible highlights of recent work by this enduring band. There is so much to love here...<br /><br />Alan Wilder brought a cohesion to DM works that now strangely seems missing, though DM continues to create majestic and profound music together. They have discovered fascinating new avenues in his absence...<br /><br />I am endlessly excited by our own Personal Jesus in the form of this enduring and unparalleled band...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's actually better than the headline would suggest - it's a first-rate novel - but the headline is accurate. It's voice is unique, the story is not predictable and yet is not outside the realm of an \\"ordinary\\" - and yet not - locale and and community. I loved it and would most certainly recommend it to my son who is 15. A terrific book.
B000JCQCW4|4.0|Very interesting movie. It really shows the downward spiral of the life of drugs. These people had all the opportunities in the world and blew it. I am definitely recommending this movie to some of my friends. As I said earlier too, very nice soundtrack!
B003U53GK8|5.0|Season six was not a let down. It was non stop action and the ending was brilliant!  You will not be disappointed!
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|a stunning and majestic album that takes several listens to truly appreciate and love. Once it sinks in, though, it stays with you; and you want to return to its paradise again, and again. To me, this one is on par with the greatness of Heathen, and Outside; where it becomes quite a world unto itself and riddled with pleasurable nuances that consistently emerge and appreciate delightfully with time. Bowie seems to mine great audible gems unseen by the average mortal, then offers each one up for your listening enjoyment. You get a glimpse of that sense of being out of time and part of infinity, a mystical inclination that transcends work by so many other artists.<br /><br />To those of you who are just now savoring the glorious Bowie, welcome...to all of you who have been here for so many years, and have once again returned: welcome back!
B00AE2I4B6|5.0|Great add to my step up collection tried finding this at Walmart never had in stock so next stop amazon never fails if I can't get it when I want it I go to amazon love it

B0049J0CTM|5.0|Never a dull moment! I used to watch this with the kids I babysat. It's really cute and I still enjoying watching it at 20 yrs old :)
B007R6X9IK|5.0|a profoundly gorgeous album that is one of the most emotionally stirring, and powerful, works I have ever heard. Blending technology with the natural human voice and \\"regular instruments\\" played wonderfully, then mixing in deeply poetic lyrics, is always an amazing feat; and herein it is done so effectively as to leave the listener in an enduring state of awe...you gotta get this one and treasure it...
B00BI73CVI|3.0|too much singing.  movie stars no matter how many lessons they take to sing can never match the quality of a broadway singer.  i enjoyed liam neelsons version better because less singing.  russell crowe although a great actor just wouldnt make it as a singer if there were auditions like in NY.
B00015T7O4|5.0|JOY DIVISION SUBSTANCE 1977-1980 is a 1992 Warner Music record and is a singles compilation released by Joy Division between 1977 and 1980 and has a Post-punk sound. Here we get to hear such great tracks as Leders of Men, These Days and Love Will Tear Us Apart. A great recording that I really enjoyed listening to. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|this chapter was well worth the wait.... and I can't wait for the next one... I've always love  this fantasy like movies.
B004BSFC46|4.0|I think these are such a great idea! I put these on my daughter as soon as she &#34;noticed&#34; her hands. She's now 4 months old, and I still bust these out, probably once a week. They fit just fine around her chubby wrists, but she really doesn't have any interest in them. Once she fell asleep with them on and they kept waking her up. She's more interested in them when they aren't attached to her. So basically, you don't know until you try. But the contrasting colors and rattle noise definitely catch her attention, just not while they're attached to her.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Frankenstein based movie written primarily for children.  I really enjoyed it.  Great animation.  Very much in the style of Tim burton.
B00B19GKI0|4.0|Kurt Russel saving the president from crazies. It's always nice to take a look back and EFNY is a decent moment of escapism.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book provided a great, realistic feeling look into a blue collar home and famiy coping with a member who's mentally ill. This story was, at first, a little hard to follow or relate to. After reading on a short bit, the story and characters are very easy to fall in love with, and become someone you want to know more about.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so addictive, but so hard to gain coins. Also, game should update automatically instead of continuously asking to redownload.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|It was a hit with the adults and kids. I would recommend it to any one with young kids. Good story line.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I read this as information to support my feeling that Gluten,Grains and Starches were not doing me any good. In this book, I found a lot of supporting information to confirm my suspicions and I am successfully managing to not eat glutens, grains and starchy vegetables. I have lost weight and waist diameter slowly and will continue to monitor my health as time goes on. This was an interesting, informative body of work!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the characters, the storyline and the movement of the book. The story makes you root for Pat Peoples. I couldn't put this book down because I desperately wanted to know if Pat ever found his \\"silver lining\\".  I laughed out loud several times especially during the football scenes. As an avid Cowboy fan I've experienced games at The Vet and The Linc; and those Eagles fans are exactly how the author describes.  I appreciated the story because it gave you a somewhat quirky glimpse into mental illness. Life is hard and you never know which situations or circumstances in life that could alter your mind.  I'm glad that I read the book first, now I can see the movie.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This book was great in the beginning then about 25% into it things just got stranger and stranger. I felt obligated to finish it and while it did get better in the last two chapters I don't think I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love the Good Wife!  Not much more to say, but I look forward to watching it every week.  Since I missed a couple episodes & they didn't get recorded, I had to rent them so I didn't miss anything.
B006964E8S|4.0|If you like David Baldacci's previous novels, you won't be disappointed. The hero is very much like Jack Reacher (Lee Child's hero) and if you enjoy his books, this is in a similar vein, but different enough not to be a clone.

1250006341|5.0|I love being able to read about the characters & seeing the pictures from the first couple seasons. I plan on looking for a book for the following seasons. It keeps the series fresh while I wait for the next season to begin
B008673ZAQ|5.0|At times I hated how hot and cold they were, but overall the book was amazing and had me in tears! Can't wait for the third!!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've been using this gameboard for about a year now, and  I honestly don't know how I ever lived without it. To me,  it's more comfortable than the Belkin (though the stick on the Belkin is more comfortable), and the number of options is great. Very easy to use,  set up,  and customize. I use it with all my games now, and actually find a keyboard clumsy and imprecise since I've been using it.  Definitely a must have for any PC gamer.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I am a very picky reader. If my interest isn't piqued by the end of the first 15 or so pages I'm done. The real test is if I'm thinking about the characters while I'm doing the dishes or driving. This book passes both those tests with flying colors.<br />Having said that I didn't give the book five stars becuase the writing itself was a bit lacking. I couldn't tell if the narrating voice was an American or a Brit. The colloquialisms seemed to shift back and forth. There were a couple glaring plot issues (apparently this women possesses the only to cellphones in the world that do not need to be recharged).<br />Please don't misunderstand, I'm all for the use of profanity when needed, but the somewhat unneccessary placements of the f-word were actually jarring. It interrupted the pace by making me wonder why it was used. Stephen King has pointed out that that goal is to make the reader forget that they are reading.<br />This is a beach day read. It is fast paced and you can wait to see where the author is taking us. And I do recommend it.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Didn't catch this show while it was on television. I like it better than Lost. Not sure why it didn't have a bigger following.
B004HYDL1K|4.0|High action movie with subtle humor. Bloody as mâch&eacute; might imply, but makes fun of action movies. Focus on immigration and Mexican gang.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent final sequel, and i absolutely loved it. I recommend it to all of my big- readers! Read read read
B00136NUG6|5.0|the elements never grow old to me.  i added this to my collections of great music and at a great price
B009R659L8|4.0|This rather unusual (for MHC) book has some issues that make it hard to read and hard to like.  First, it had a large cast, divided into three groups; two that are each connected with a murder (or probable murder) victim and a third that has to do with what is loosely the main story line.  I say loosely because all three are important story lines, but the other two are in the past.  I had a lot of trouble keeping the various characters and their names straight in my mind and I was a little annoyed that the woman whom I believed would be the central character at the first turned out to be only one of several central characters.  I figured out the \\"surprise ending\\" before any character in the book even got suspicious (except Kate, of course) and had worked out most of the rest of the plot before it was revealed, which is unusual for me.  The only really MHC-ish things about the book were that the characters were well-developed as usual and dear old Jimmy Neary and his pub showed up, which gave a feeling of familiarity.  Definitely worth reading (and I'll probably read it again, later) because I don' think MHC can write a really BAD book, but not quite as good as some of her other books.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Bought one CD for myself and one for my daughter.  Josh Groban can sure hit<br />notes with his mellow and cool voice.  I enjoy listening to this cd and my<br />daughter definitely loves hers.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the Kindle for Android. I can have access to my books at all times without carrying another device.  It is great to be able to download the app without purchasing a Kindle device.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I read the book before watching the movie and I loved it. There were somne differences in the movie compared to the book but I loved both. The actors Josh and Julianne had alot of chemistry between them and the children were adorable. Especially 'Lexie\\". Josh Duhamel seems to get better looking each time I see him and he is such a talented charismatic natural actor. I can't wait to buy the DVD or Blu ray. It is so worth watching. Everyone that I know who has seen it has loved it, even two men I work with. GREAT MOVIE.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|She reminds me a bit of Billie Holiday at times, and never disappoints.  She stepped out on this one with choices like Born to Lose, Gentle On My Mind, and You Don't Know Me was really a special addition.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This kicks my butt. After the first day I couldn't walk for a week! I recommend this because it's simple and easy, and it works.
1577314808|5.0|This is a must read for individuals who have a hard time turing off their brains and who are victims of their past experiences.  Eckart says &#34;thinking is a disease.&#34;
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Riveting story from start to finish. In today's world where so much violence is being committed by children, this book surely makes a statement.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I have never been considered a Beetles fan but wanted to take a chance on this one by Paul after hearing a cut on XM.  I'm not disappointed at all and it provides some easy listening.  He sings like a happy, contented man which I am sure he is.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Sitchin and Daniken are the two people to purchase when researching our ancient history. This is a must buy book!
0547564651|5.0|Well written, very interesting book.<br />Not only informative- it tells a story.<br />One of the best books I ever bought!
B0076DELIG|3.0|Too much going on. Didn't keep my interest. Not up to his other books that I have read. Harry Bosch is getting old!
0062014536|4.0|Ok, I loved the book. But the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the ending was disappointing. The book left a lot of questions unanswered. The first book was addicting then the second book stressed me out. We all knew Alex wasn't  really dead. I mean, seriously? Then I thought the third book was going to be about Alex and Lena but no. More stress. I think she chose him in the end but not sure. So many questions unanswered and there is no epilogue. I was disappointed and left me hanging. So 4 stars.
B001615LO2|5.0|He is super deformed and it is hilarious. Seller was decent with shipping etc too. If you're looking for a gag geek gift, you can't go wrong with deformed Chewie!
B008EKOO46|3.0|There is a lot of great material in this book, and it helped me understand more about how our Western civilization and it political systems evolved.  And it helped me understand the necessity of our current systems, warts and all (although the ubiquitous corruption is not a necessary element -- but I digress!).  However, there is much repetitive material, and even some unnecessary, maybe even useless, material.  For example, Diamond tells a detailed story about how he and some comrades nearly died after being stranded in the water after a boating accident.  The story goes on and on for many pages, before it gets to the point/purpose of why it is in the book.  It could have been dealt with in one paragraph.  There are other examples of this content inflation.  If the book was about half its current size, it would be a much better read. As is, it is still an excellent read for anyone interested in the subject.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Why do they cancel the best shows? This show had a great cast and good writing and it was just starting to cook. Shirley Manson as the liquid metallic terminator was absolute brilliance.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Obviously a adult glee. Great plot, acting, and musically compelling. Pretty darn accurate about what it is like to get a Broadway show to completion. The talent of the cast is endless
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's great to have a calculator at my fingertips. I haven't used it yet, but know I'm going to enjoy having it.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|great music as always from bon jovi they  neve disappoint and i look forward to the next cd hope its soon
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Gosh, words can't describe how much I love this book!!!!! Amazing writing by Suzanne Collins. Much praise to Katniss and Peeta. Their love in hopeless place keeps me motivated. Thanks Suzanne
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would recommend this show for any adult. There is a little of everything in this show, not just for zombie lovers.  This season is the best yet but you will still want to watch the first two season.
086571701X|5.0|Has all the information you'll need to start an aquaponic gardening system. Alot more helpful than just watching YouTube videos
B001974DG0|5.0|Dang, dang, dang...<br /><br />WHAT a book.  WHAT a story.<br /><br />I almost never give 5 stars to anyone for any book, movie OR product unless it's absolutely amazing and this was.<br /><br />Stupid, stupid humans, in labs, doing dumb ridiculous things they really don't have any right doing unless it's to stop disease in it's tracks.  Not even close.<br /><br />I'm glad I don't know where all of my tax dollars go, because if I EVER found out they went to help create something like the \\"outsider\\" I'd be doing quite a bit about it I can assure you; (which makes my title of needing me an Einstein puppy contradictory to being upset with lab techs messing with experiments, doesn't it?)<br /><br />Even as evil and awful as he was, I cared about him in the end and I know that Dean wanted us to.  He wanted the readers to know it wasn't the outsiders fault for how he was created and why...just that he was and he had no choice in the matter.<br /><br />In the end, he was vulnerable and sad and that made you ticked off at the lab techs and doctors that did this to him in the first place and...uh... if we're being completely honest here, I didn't even care that they were all dead.<br /><br />Start messin' around with this stuff and you end up dead.  Good!  Serves you right, (which makes my title of needing me an Einstein puppy contradictory to being upset with lab techs messing with experiments, doesn't it?)<br /><br />You just gotta love Nora and Travis.  The two separate stories bringing them together with Einstein all wrapped up in the middle of things makes it a beautiful and endearing story.<br /><br />Heck, I didn't even mind that the technology was dated.  Nope.  Not even for a second.<br /><br />I had done a quick search for what readers had thought were Dean's top ten books and Watchers kept showing up in the top three on a few of the lists so that's the reason why I chose to read this.<br /><br />Everyone needs to read this book.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife is an action packed law and order type drama that has real life drama interwoven into its story line.  I enjoy the confrontational friction between husband and wife and the behind the scenes action of the criminal law firm that Alicia works for.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Faster charging, saves the USB oort from potential damage,<br />should have been included with the tablet.  Google take hint please
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|If you are a Blake Shelton fan this CD you will love. There is not a bad or dull track on the CD. 'BOYS ROUND HERE\\" is my favorite track and \\"YOUED BE MINE\\" is another great track. All in all this is a must buy CD.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie overall. I don't feel very qualified to critique all aspects of acting, directing and scriptwriting, but I know when a movie is entertaining and engaging to my satisfaction. I have not seen similar movies to compare it to in my review. It did not leave me asking a lot of questions as some really awful movies do. I didn't take classes on how to write a good movie script; I have never been an actor/actress; and I do not know how to direct a movie, but I know when a movie is bad. I thought Charlize and Chris did a good job with their roles (as did the other actors). I never really have gotten into Kristen's acting--it seemed very typically unemotional (her facial expressions and voice), but it was not awful to me. I still think I have seen movies much worse than this one. I could watch it again and not feel as though I am suffering through it.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I always like John Grisham books.  This one isn't as much of a nail biter as some but a great read nonetheless.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect when I bought this album but, it is a goody. It includes two discs of strange and entrancing music. Midnight City has got to be one of the catchiest tunes I have ever heard.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I enjoy historyso this movie was a favorite  because showed the moral vs political struggle, private life vs public life and the humanity of the president.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I like the fact that Alicia writes and performs many different styles as well as the fact that she plays the piano<br />classically.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is an epic novel that will take you on a ride that you won't want to end.  As soon as I was finished, I looked for any other books this writer had but there are none!  I am hoping he is working on one now.......
0783226063|5.0|This is the original Dune Movie and one of my favorites-It would help if you have read the books and know some of the inside information, but, still a favorite of mine.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I have been writing new songs so finding new words is awesome for me and my friends so thank you
B000FA675C|5.0|Love the novel and movie.  To me it all makes sense and sheds light on history about religions and their respective histories.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book vs movie debate unnerves me, because the two are their own beasts. You can't compare. I saw the show before I read the book, and I have to say...the book helped me understand much better what is going on in the show. I am an avid TV fan and critic and even though I love(d?) the show, I realize just how undeveloped the plot is and some of the characters are after reading this. The book is phenomenal.  I emphatically recommend, especially to fans of the show. You will have a much better understanding of the motivations and the personalities of the characters.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app-I use this all the time so I can keep track of the power available, a must have app for free-I also allows you to gauge how fast your charger is working!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is a great app for telling if your Kindle Fire HD is really charging. It color codes certain temp levels so you know when it needs to cool off. My charge doesn't last all day if I am constantly using the Kindle but that's expected. Main point I think it is worth having.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I did not want this book to end. It caught me up from the beginning and from the first page I was lost in this amazing, terrifying world. A good quick King read that is not so much horror but a journey to find oneself.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I have the Weber Smokey Joe Jumbo. If you fill this to the very top it starts 40 pieces of charcoal, perfect for grill. Also perfect for smoking w/ Minnon method for smoker. You fill charcoal  pan w/ charcoal and then put lighted coals in the middle, as coals burn down it spreads the fire and maintains temp.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I guess I didn't realize that this was a multi-part movie again like Lord of the Rings.  The movie was good overall but definitely not as good as Lord of the Rings.  At least not so far.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Bought this for my father's birthday, he really enjoys the music and it didn't take as long as we first thought as far as the delievery time.

B008I34ZUM|5.0|This album is just phenomenal.  It has great humor, musicianship and just has a certain something that cannot be described.  If I had to recommend a FZ cd i would have to say this is it.  If you like this, get You Can't Do this on Stage Volume 2.<br /><br />aarf!
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|Already owned it in old tapes and reel to reel but needed to have it on my itunes. Actually one of the best Alan Parsons album.
B003TQKVGU|2.0|Good...couldn't say great, but if you're &#34;into&#34; the psychology of the mind and how it works (and I thought I was) by all means, read it.  Guess I'm just disappointed that it didn't change my life.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|l love being able to get my facebook on my Kendle Fire. lt is so easy to keep my friends and family close!!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book's storytelling was very detail oriented and thorough, even when you didn't want it to be.  It was a little graphic in its descriptions of some of the violence that occurs, not just between animals, but between people as well.  It is an extremely original storyline with some of the greatest animal and human interaction writing I have read in some time.  More than anything I love the delicate balance that Pi Patel plays with his belief in three different religions.  He believes in God and all he wants is to be closer to God, no matter what the religion.  This is, above anything else, an amazing story of the human spirit's desire to live and the unparalleled lengths you will go to in order to survive.  I would truly give it a five star rating if the story was told a little smoother and with a little less lingering on the bluntness of some of its violent parts.  Overall, a great book that I plan to read again in the future.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I have used this product for several months now and I really enjoy the durability, the look, and the feel of this Kindle Fire cover. I have no major issues with it at all. It lacks a stand, but the cover itself can be folded over and used as a stand on most surfaces.

0345529057|5.0|This series of books covers a whole lot more than what the cable tv series does but gives you more insight to each character which was fantastic. A very excellent read

B001DM1VXE|1.0|I stop watching after 20 minutes.  The writer failed to grab my attention.  The story was very slow to take off.
0307887960|5.0|My husband and I are middle aged and slowly put on and extra 40+ pounds each over the years.  We've both tried other diets and failed to keep the weight off.  I had the yo-yo effect and could not even lose 1 pound over a 4 month period of following Weight Watchers faithfully.  I'm not knocking WW as I know many who have success with it, only that my body would not give up the extra fat when WW allowed me to eat &#34;anything&#34; I wanted as long as I kept within my point range.  For me, it's not just about calories in but what I eat and how the food reacts in my body.  We began Dukan on 8/27/12 and by the following December had reached our desired weight which is the weight Dukan's website suggested.  Although I'd like to be 5-10 pounds lighter, Dr. Dukan explains in the book why this would not be wise.  We will be through the 3rd phase which is consolidation in a few weeks then onto stabilization.  We have found the recipes using oat bran a life saver in getting us through the diet.  Recipes such as oat bran pancakes, brownies, and bread have helped us through the cravings of Paula Deen style goodies we previously ate daily.  We are now allowed to eat some of these things occasionally while staying within Dr. Dukan's guidelines and have been successful keeping the weight off.  I am aware it's still too soon to celebrate and won't truly think we've succeeded until we've kept it off at least two years.    This diet has helped lower both blood sugar levels and blood pressure. It helps tremendously with water retention and bloating, as explained in the book.  I will also add that while my husband is a meat lover, I am not but surprisingly I've enjoyed the food more and more as we've gone along because I know how much better I feel. We were both amazed at how quickly the weight came off which motivates us to stick with it.  I had previously tried Atkins and found it impossible to stick with over the long term.  I understand from talking to a friend, that Dr. Atkin's diet has changed and is more like the Dukan plan.  Why not stick with the one who figured this out years ago?  I know there are many critics to this way of eating but it is the only thing that is working for us.  Let me say too, that our energy level is better than it has been in years. There are many websites that offer success stories and recipes that have been helpful to us. We did not pay or participate on Dr. Dukan's site due to costs but did use his calculator there to determine our ideal weight.  I can't say enough good things about how grateful we are to have found Dr. Dukan's book after hearing about it from a family member.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It's a awesome book  and you should get it ,and if you like myths y'all love this book<br />It's beast
B008602KQI|4.0|Although it would be quite unbelievable there was a good story line.  I felt a kinship with the actors characters.  The starlet was quite attractive in a realistic way.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to watch science fiction.  It is a refreshing break from rocket ships, faster than light travel, and high powered death rays.  The scenery was well done and I felt like I was part of the scene.
0307476073|5.0|I loved this book! It was well written and inspiring. I started hiking because of it. It is well worth reading.

B00BRYDKM8|5.0|I have read my fair share of books about presentation skills but I was excited to read this one firstly because it was written by Akash Karia but also because it was looking at TED talks.<br /><br />Some of the things that he covers are;<br /><br />How to find your core message<br />How to create your Power Phrase<br />Rhetorical techniques to make your Power Phrase memorable<br />The simple ABC-C structure for presentations<br />Three opening mistakes to avoid<br />Five Opening Gambits to create an attention-grabbing opening<br />There are other areas covered too but you should read the book to find out what they are.<br /><br />Why is this book different?<br /><br />Easy to digest and implement<br />Great techniques and strategies for an amazing presentation<br />Examples and expert opinion<br />You can also tell that this book was written by someone who knows what they talking about. As a professional presenter I can see the value in this book and \\"yes\\" I also learnt a few things myself.<br /><br />If you want to deliver a great presentation then you need to add this book to your shelf.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0385528752|5.0|The promise in the title simply reflects in the content...<br />This book really helps, it brings you in the problems and brings you out everytime with a clear and tested solution.<br />It doesn't tell you how to solve YOUR problems, it walks you through problems of others which found a solution.<br />In each of those problems there is a piece of your.<br />Before the end of the book you will have solved at least one of your problems BY YOURSELF, but much faster than without the book, leaving more space for other problems and limiting the space for misunderstandings and unpleasant side-problems.
B00371V6SE|5.0|Another good read by Nicholas Sparks - never lets you down. Recommended, when you want a well-written story, credible characters and a bit of romance.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|After seeing the movie twice I decided to read the book.  The first time I saw the movie I was pretty shaken by it.  I am a public defender and Pat reminded me so much of my mentally ill clients.  But I was sad because their lives never go that well.  But I loved the movie, so I saw it again.  The second time was easier. I just enjoyed the fun of it, although I still know that mental illness is way harder in real life.  The book is so much better than the movie. I couldn't put it down.  I cried a lot.  I didn't cry in the movie until the end.  It is a different story.  The movie is based so loosely on the book.  I would love to see a movie that is actually based on the book.  If you haven't already seen the movie be sure to see it before you read the book so you don't get really pissed off when you see it.  If you've seen the movie, I think you will like the book.  You won't get bored because it is not the same story. It is a different story about the same people.  I think it is a better story.  Not as funny.  I still wish my mentally ill clients had any hope of ever having a life as nice as Pat's.

B009GEOLM4|5.0|This was an excellent version of the Frank Miller graphic novel.  The voice acting was great and the story well done and paced just right.  Overall one of the better animated Batman movies.  The introduction of Carrie Kelly as Robin was done well and the character giving just enough to like her but not to know her yet.<br /><br />The references to the last Robin and Batman's guilt around the death of Jason Todd also played well in the storyline and with a new Robin and a resurgent Joker part II of this story will be fun.  Even though the world is different and they point that out throughout the story Batman's moral compass still prevent's him from murder even when anyone else would not think twice in some of the instances.  The Batman's battle with his past as well as his future and the role the Batman plays in the lives of Gotham citizens is front and center.[[ASIN:B009GEAPYW Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1]]

1476715904|5.0|I know I love a book when I'm barely into it and I have to go find out if it's a series and if so how many books are there and are they out yet. Slammed was one of those books for me. I was a tad apprehensive after the last book I read because I was afraid Slammed wasn't going to be as good as other people said it was, but within a couple of pages I was hooked and then within a chapter I was at Goodreads looking to see if there were more books featuring Will and Lake.<br /><br />There was something so absolutely breathtaking about Will and Lake from the moment they met. I was taken on an emotional rollercoaster with them, not just in what was between them, but with everything going on in their lives. I don't know if we necessarily need to have more books to tell their story, but I'm going to read them. I want to see more of them and their little brothers Caulder and Kel. And I want to see more of Eddie and Gavin...in fact a novella with Eddie telling the story would be great. She's such a fun, fresh character.<br /><br />In case it wasn't clear, I loved this book and I will definitely be adding it to my list of books to re-read over and over and over again. I can't wait to move on to the next book in the series to get more great story telling and I'm sure more of an emotional rollercoaster.<br /><br />ARC provided by Netgalley

B007SXB498|3.0|This was my first read of Jane Austen's. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed the novel from an historical account and giggled at Austen's mild poke's.

B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero was Nirvana's last studio recording, and it's a great one. This is the album that seperates Nirvana's followers from the true fans. It is raw, unflinching, and at times painful to listen to. Kurt Cobain, while writing this album, intended parts of it to split Nirvana's bandwagoners, that hopped on after Nevermind was released, from the true fans. All of Kurt's anguish is poured 110% into this album, and the record company releasing it, DGC, claimed it may not release the album in it's original state for it would not be commercially viable, and called the album \\"Unlistenable\\". Was the record company justified in saying this? Or were they just too harsh? Let's take a look.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Serve the Servants\\", and this may just be my favorite track on the album. Kurt takes an introspective look at Nevermind, with the first lines of the song, and album, being \\"Teenage Angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and Old\\". The song has a raw, disjointed feeling to it, especially the guitar chords. This is one of the reasons I love this song so much. It has a very low-fi sound, and just rocks. The next song is Scentless Apprentice, which is one of the songs that'll definitely seperate the fans from the bandwagoners. The song is very hard hitting, and most of it is Kurt screaming. At times he flies into a full out wail yelling \\"GO AWAAAAYYYY\\". It's a good song, but definitely will be tough to listen to the first few times you hear it. Next, we have the classic Heart-Shaped Box. Pretty much everybody who's been into rock music at some point knows this song, and it's easily one of the darkest songs to ever get heavy rotation on the radio. With lyrics like \\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\" and \\"Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back\\", it's surprising this was released as a single at all. I especially love the *bum bum* \\"HEY\\" *bum bum* \\"WAIT\\", \\"I've got a new complaint!\\" chorus. Now, we jump over to the controversial \\"Rape Me\\". You can't help wondering that Kurt wrote the song to be as catchy as Smells like Teen Spirit, and trust me, it's as catchy if not more catchy, only to put shocking lyrics over it. The lyrics are perceived to have two different meanings: How Kurt feels that he and his image are raped by the media, or someone who is actually being raped, saying \\"Rape me again, karma will come and get you\\", as Kurt had a strong belief in Karma. The 5th track is \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\\", which is another one of my favorites off the album. It's a great rock song, and Kurt's battle with depression definitely shows here, with a chorus line saying \\"I miss the comfort in being sad\\". Next we have a track on the album which is believed to be about how Kurt felt about himself, \\"I think I'm Dumb/Maybe Just Happy\\". It's one of the slower songs Nirvana did, and has a cello during the chorus. It's a great song. Next we have the little rocker \\"Very Ape\\", and while it's quite short, clocking in at 1:56, it's an excellent song that should please the fans of Nirvana's punk roots. Moving on, we have Milk It. The song follows the quiet/loud style of rock Nirvana popularized, and during the verses Kurt is barely audible. When the rock kicks in, it is blistering. Next is \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", which is a straight forward rock track, and another favorite of mine on the album. Following is \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\", which is another punk rock sounding song, with lots of feedback. It's good, but not one of my favorites on the album. The 11th track on the album is the quick, blistering, extremely raw \\"Tourette's\\", which Kurt literally screams the lyrics to. The last song on the album is \\"All Apologies\\", which is another of Nirvana's well known songs. It is a beautifully depressing song, ending with the lines \\"All in all is all we are\\". It also contains one of my favorite song lines of all time, \\"What else should I say/ Everyone is gay\\". It is a great way to close Nirvana's last studio album.<br /><br />The album clocks in at a total of 41:11, with 12 songs. Overall, it's a great album. Real fans of Nirvana and grunge rock will love it, people who really only like Nirvana's singles should proceed with caution. I give this album a 9.5 out of 10, and whole-heartily recommend it to any rock fan and anyone who wants to dig deeper into Nirvana's library. The only reason the album does not get a 10 is sometimes it is truly hard to listen to, like the song \\"Tourette's\\". If you find you like this album and want to seek out some more of Kurt Cobain and crew's genius work, check out the compilation album Incesticide, their first album Bleach, and their MTV Unplugged album, which is stunning and beautiful. Enjoy!ast studio album.<br /><br />The album clocks in at a total of 41:11, with 12 songs. Overall, it's a great album.

B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I tried really, really hard to like this book. Looking at it from different angles. There's too much I dislike to overcome what I did like. The book read like they were in high school (even though they were in college). Abby needed some serious medication; her mood swings were driving me nuts. Travis' temper tantrums were... interesting. I genuinely felt sorry for him because he really needed professional help. The majority of the book took place in the cafeteria...<yawn>. There were numerous one-liners and scenes that were very reminiscent of the Twilight series (subtle, but they're there). on page this book has a happy ending - in the real world? Not so much. Travis is an abusive individual that should either be in jail or receiving heavy therapy. And Abby is co-dependent,19-going-on-12... Could be I'm just too old for this book. I think it's geared for teens. I just read an article that the rights were purchased to turn this book into a movie - Hopefully the director can put a more mature spin on it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book is well written, although I find the story idea a little sickening. As a parent, it's scary to imagine this kind of thing. But I couldn't stop reading it either.  :)

0385349947|1.0|Excellent points with reminders of what both genders could do to move our American society to a different place; a society in which women are recognized as leaders with differing, but equal, complementary leadership skills, knowledge, and abilities of equal monetary value.  I completed my doctoral dissertation on gender issues in 1984. I appreciate the support of my own thinking and the mention of other psychological barriers to women in the workplace.  I appreciate the risk that Sandberg, one of the few female CEOs, is taking on other women's behalf.  I like the opportunity to further discuss the topics she has presented and others via the internet.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|Really fun survival scifi story. Lot's of detail in scientific and engineering inventions required for Martian survival. Got me hooked.
B008R14YBK|4.0|I purchased this album after hearing \\"Ready or Not\\" on the radio and being impressed by Mendler's jazzy vocals.  Vocally, this album is outstanding and Mendler has vocal control way beyond what most 20 year old pop stars could even dream of.  She reminds me of a cross between Natasha Bedingfield and Nelly Furtado, and I love it.<br /><br />Artistically, this album has its ups and downs.  The single off this album, \\"Ready or Not\\" is a jazz-pop hybrid stylistically reminiscent of early Michael Buble.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, 5:15 is another standout, with an r and b rhythm that could have belonged to Amy Winehouse.  \\"Hurricane\\" and \\"City Lights\\" were also favorites of mine.  \\"Blonde\\" was another great track, because it showed a sense of humor and not taking herself too seriously, two qualities important in a young artist.<br /><br />The rest of the album was hit or miss in my opinion.  Keep in mind I hadn't heard of her before the radio, so I know nothing of her Disney Channel days or prior musical background, and I can't really call myself a fan of hers before this album.  \\"Rocks at My Window\\" was awkward, and felt like it was trying to be \\"D.I.N.O.S.A.U.R\\" by Kesha. The slower ballad songs were skippable in my opinion.<br /><br />However, five great songs out of twelve is pretty impressive for a debut album these days.  Her unique voice and style is a treat, and if she keeps developing on that style and niche, she's definitely an artist to watch out for.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The story was great, acting remarkable, directing and everything great. But for me, I was astounded at the political undercurrents. Since we learn about Lincoln in school as a heroic figure, it is easy not to see the time and person in adult terms. This is what I would use to teach about Lincoln and the political process to adolescents and adults.
B001N09F7U|5.0|Its premise is simple: little girl lost in the woods (literally).  It goes on for 219 pages--219 pages of Trisha wandering through the woods, eating berries, sloughing through a swamp, wondering at the stupidity of her recently separated parents, and occasionally listening to Red Sox baseball on her trusty walkman radio.<br /><br />And for 219 pages, I read...and read...and read.  There is no doubt about it--King is the master.  Anyone who can hold the reader's attention for that many pages when the greatest conflict present is the one going on inside Trisha's incredibly active imagination deserves to be, well, \\"King\\".  The reader can't help but root for this 9 year old to make it out of the woods.  She is smart, determined, and devoted to both her splintered family and Tom Gordon, the dreamy closer for the Red Sox.<br /><br />This is not a horror novel, but it is cleverly written.  Each chapter plays out like an inning in a baseball game.  Full of suspense and tension (again, most of it created in the mind of a child), the reader feels for Trisha.  One of the best things about this story was the way Trisha never lost her innocence.  Rather than jading his protagnist, King let his 9 year old stay 9 years old.  She does come to face her fears and the possiblity of her fate with an emotional maturity that blossoms only after one has endured a traumatic event, but even during the final climax, the reader is very much aware of Trisha's vulnerability.  The question of whether or not she gets the save in her own game will keep the reader turning pages through all nine innings.  Should you buy some peanuts and settle in?  Yeah, baby.

B000FA675C|5.0|I have read this multiple times and it seems like a new experience every time.  I love a well-put-together mystery/thriller novel and this story definitely doesn't disappoint. It's a great, thought-out, seemingly heavily researched with a unique twist to it that first-time readers may or may not see coming.  I don't know how he does it, but Dan Brown seems to always have a good novel I can't seen to put down, and this one is no different.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good time and remotely interested in religious-toned themes.

B0042JTAI8|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, though did not find it as good as previous reads by Kate Morton (The House at Riverton), which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The book has an original theme and the characters are well drawn.  My curiosity was aroused early on in the read and kept me interested throughout.  However, at times I was reading waiting to find out what had happened rather than enjoying the read itself.  The book moves back and forth between different time periods.  I have a preference for books which follow a chronological sequence.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|the graphics are great, set up for a what I figured to be a fantastic sci fi thriller, however the plot is poorly written and slow.  The trailer shows it too be nothing like it really is, kind of like one of those movies where they show you all the best parts of a movie in a 3 minute trailer.<br /><br />I would say cruise does a descent job with it but as i said poorly written and maybe poorly directed even?<br />they set you up to think the ending will really shock you or something but it's not even close to what I think they were expecting.<br /><br />There is really not enough contact with the humans on the planet and more trying to impress people with CGI graphics.<br /><br />The ending was not super bad but also very predictable.<br /><br />I won't be buying this one that's for sure....
B0064MGU98|5.0|fantastic acting  a lot of different stars on some of the shows very entertaining as well as enlightenting as to the world of the law firm.
0425263916|5.0|This book was just as good as the first one! It kept the story line going and can't wait for the next book to come out!
1616890835|5.0|The authors of this book should be commended for bringing to light a profession that, I for one, had never stopped to consider. Each chapter presents an oral history of a specific painter with beautifully reproduced examples of their work. This was a fascinating read from beginning to end and has caused me to view the city around me through a much more appreciative lens. Even though the industry as a whole has been in decline for a number of years, some of the artists in this book indicate that a renewed focus on hand-drawn sign painting has been slowly occurring. Let's hope they're right.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The Amazon Instant Video \\"Lincoln\\" was a nice way of learning more about how something came about that we will never be able to know the behind the scenes workings towards something like the 13th Amendment.<br />Lots of interaction and how people interacted when faced with such a monumental decision and how the leaders of our nation at that time, dealt with something that was such a dramatic occurrence and how it affected them at that time.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Since finishing the Game of Thrones I've started two other epic collections but felt something was missing. I was very happy to find the First Law series. Well written and very entertaining.

0061122416|5.0|\\"No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.\\"<br /><br />For years, friends have been telling me about \\"The Alchemist\\", saying that they not only enjoyed the book, but that it was one of the best they'd ever read. It took me a long time to finally read it, but I'm inclined to agree with them. Though it's very short (my paperback is 167 pages), it's deeply profound, touching, and beautiful.<br /><br />The story is that of a shepherd boy named Santiago who lives in southern Spain. After he has a dream of a treasure to be found in the Pyramids of Egypt, he is visited by a king who persuades him to sell his sheep in order to fulfill his dream. The boy sails to Algeria, where he faces many setbacks on the way to Egypt, before finally arriving, only to find out that his dream is, in fact, slightly different than what he had originally imagined.<br /><br />While the plot sounds simple, this is a story where the journey is truly more important than the destination. Along the way, the boy meets many people who help him achieve his dream, who persuade him, rob him, help him, and teach him. Each one of them plays a vital role, and without any one of them, his story may have turned out much more different.<br /><br />Like so many profound stories, this is about more than the tale on the page. It's about our fears, our dreams, the choices we make, and the consequences of our actions. It is about how each object in the world is connected, and how everyone we meet helps us learn a lesson we could not have learned in any other way. Even translated from the original Portuguese, Paulo Coelho's prose is simply gorgeous, and this book is one everyone should read.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Update: Had to return mouse due to scrolling wheeling feeling \\"stuck\\" and not working well after using for less than a year. Great mouse besides that but considering scrolling is a main mouse function had to return. Not sure about the Anker brand now. I went to Logitech and saw they have gaming mouses too. About the same price and not as good of a cord but the mouse itself very customizable but more importantly feels durable.<br /><br />At least this company still makes wired mice<br /><br />This mouse works, has great customization. Doesn't really seem to make hand sweat like some other users said, maybe they are gaming too hard? Comfortable and high quality at a fair price.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I have enjoyed every installment of this series. The plots are interesting and suspenseful, yes, but the real star is the atmosphere. Selleck's character is noble and intelligent but also damaged, sad and lost. He lives in a distant cabin, far from other human beings; the musical score is melancholy, fitting the mood nicely.<br /> We get to watch Jesse struggle toward redemption and self-forgiveness as the series continues, which is the best reason to watch it in order.<br />The stories are well developed and the supporting actors are perfectly cast.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|This is a genuine in the box Apple product designed for the Macbook Air thunderbolt adaptor slot.  I've had no issues with it and yeah, considering a standard network jack is bigger/thicker than the Macbook Air, it makes since that it has to be an add-on product/adapter.  The Thunderbolt port means that your going to be able to transfer more faster than if it was a USB port.  I can't imagine not having this for the cases when you need to backup your Macbook Air, you need to connect to an intranet, or wireless isn't available or secure.  When it's not needed, it is small enough that it stores easily in my briefcase accessory pocket.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It sends a good message to children.  It also reminded me of my childhood afternoons in the game room trying to get the high score on the newest game.
0439023491|5.0|What I felt was strong about this book was how the author makes me feel like I can \\"see\\" exactly what Katniss sees. I also loved how it was a \\"must-read-more\\" type of book. It was pretty hard to put down. What I felt was not as strong about the book was how during the first 150 pages, the romance still hadn't stopped. For example, Katniss pretends to be in love with her teammate from the Games, Peeta, but she secretly loves Gale, a childhood friend, too. I personally got bored with the whole love triangle that was going on with Gale, Peeta, and Katniss. In the first book, Katniss sees Gale as a friend, not someone she would love, but now she does love him. I feel that this book targets young teenagers because it dabbles in some love, and also action between the districts and The Capitol. This review sounds more negative than I intended. It was entertaining and I liked it a lot, and I definitely plan to see the movie, and read then next book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|totally enjoyed this book...real to life...would love a follow up in the future...also read Bared to You, which was enjoyable

B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game. my children love it. not to much goes into it but they love taking care of their horses.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|We enjoyed this movie and it turned out to be learning experience for the viewers in our home who didn't get to take American History.  You'd be surprised what some people think the Emancipation Proclamation really was as opposed to the Constitutional Amendments, I felt like the teacher for at least 90 minutes!  Well acted and my only complaint was the &#34;dark filming&#34; but that would be in keeping with lamp lighted rooms of the time so I suppose the appearance was true to the period so I won't mark off points for that
B001RP1G0U|2.0|Too dumb to watch didnt like it..  Don't bother. Wasn't very good acting either.. But the story could have been funny..just wasnt
B00992CF6W|4.0|Got this for my kids they love it , lot of fun and I ind myself playing it all the time now.
B007SGM084|5.0|Reading sexy, erotic, or graphic intimate accounts is great, but this series also has two amazing main characters.  I fell in love with both characters instantly.
0762445262|5.0|Got this for a birthday gift for our grandson. He loves it. it's akin to a flashlight that displays the batman logo and that's about it. Not too bright, but great for taking to bed as a nightlight sort of thing. The book that came with it he could've cared less about though. haha!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is so fun. We get to play with like acoule pets. I love it so if u want some thing to do buy this.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I grew up watching all of the John Hughes' movies but Perks is the first movie I have seen since those that was able to articulate a young man's life into a story with humor and emotion while addressing serious issues at times as well...Watch this movie plus the soundtrack is from my generation of quality music..I.e Bowie, The Smiths, New Order etc
B00C6BB2JE|4.0|This Is a Great tribute to the old cheesy plot lines of the old Universal Monster Mash series. Of those movies Frankenstein meets the Wolfman was the best of them However the series plotline dipped in quality with House of Dracula and House of Frankenstein. The only time the formula for all three monsters mashing upon the masses successfully was the great Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein...And so does Van Helsing, Kind of. You see Why I prefer this movie to the unscary Indy knock off the Mummy is because it has two great leads doing their jobs extremely well instead of only just Brendan Frasier who is Awesome. this movie is really cheesy and I am totally a fan of Cheesy movies and this one Has all my favorite Universal Monsters. This movie is pure moviemaking cheesefest, which is exactly not only what Stephen Sommers does well But has done in virtually all of his movies. However this movie has one more redeeming quality to it The Director formulates an intricate plot far beyond what they did in the The House of Dracula/Frankenstein series. This Plot which involves all the monsters and is quite impressive Unites the Main Hero And Heroine Into the heart of Darkness. What is great is the Acting is completely serious in this Cheesefest. You have to respect actors who can do that. While the Movie technically is not exactly good, it isn't bad either. It gets really good if you enjoy cheesy movies like I do. The monster Mash continues in classic Mashed up style.
B008US25FW|4.0|I was very excited to discover that C&eacute;line Dion was releasing another French album. I liked most of the songs on the album, but I didn't care too much for the others. I also bought the wrong CD (this one only has 14 tracks). I wanted the CD with the bonus tracks.
1455508977|2.0|I bought this for my wife since she has always loved Nicholas Sparks but it now sits unfinished on the bookshelf because she said it wasn't that good.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I really love this movie and I love that it is very close to the book!  A well done movie!
B0091REZMW|2.0|Does not work very well on the Kindle Fire HD.  It works great on our Ipad.  The Kindle version is difficult to see, when you click on various items it doesn't read your clicks correctly.  It also crashes frequently and takes three or four tries to open the application.  Fun game; but until they improve the interface with Kindle, I'll keep playing it on my other devices.
B004SB60OC|1.0|Case had a long crack and also the inner seal was missing. I thought I was buying from Amazon.  This CD was advertised as new. I don't think it is. Very disappointed.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It's better than twilight. Good for drinking games.  Just take a shot anytime someone says \\"katness\\". I likes the book better the first time when it was called \\"the lottery\\" .  The movie has good CGI. Like we haven't seen that in EVERYTHING
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Worth money fellow Daria fans!!! Every episode of all 5 seasons including special features, plus 2 movies \\"Is It Fall Yet?\\" & \\"Is It College Yet?\\" Licensed music had to be removed for obvious cost reason. New scores blend in well with this circa you wont even notice really and dvd comes with note from creator to fans! buy!! buy!! buy!!
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Purchased this after watching &#34;Cranford&#34; because I couldn't wait to see how it ends. I have the books on my Kindle and will read them.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Really fun. I just wish it was longer. I liked the way the hint button recharged so quickly. I would would play it again.
B007V4530A|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, because I love TED! I have heard the most amazing talks over the years, and thought &#34;If only I could do that&#34;. This book seemed to offer that coaching, and although I have tended to steer clear of self-coaching books, because this one had the TED name on it, I thought I would put aside my fears and develop my potential. I already do a lot of public speaking and presentations, by the way, so I am not new to the field.<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed. This would have been great if it had more precise skills, if it had taken several talks and broken them down and shown the skills. Yes, it did do some of that, but I found nothing in here that I would not have found in a Presentation Skills seminar or course. I was looking for new; I found old - semi-revamped, but old.<br /><br />TED presentations, by the whole, are exciting and fun. This would not be my description of this book, no matter how hard I tried to make it so. Average reading, average skills, average advice, just - average!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It was a good read because it was told through the afflicted, but it was hard to read because it is a sad debilitating disease. I am still glad I read this book because it helped me to understand more of how a person that is going through Alzheimer's might feel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm obsessed with this show. I love the historical elements and the plot is very riveting. Maggie Smith has the best one liners!
0307719774|5.0|This shipped really quickly and I've been using it ever since I received it in the mail. It's as described and shown in the photo!
B002HL3PN4|5.0|I let my kids read the book and then let them watch the movie. They loved it. It was close to the book and it got them interested in the next book.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Using this with my Samsung Galaxy S3, it is handy office product for android.. Useful for on the go editing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer!!!!! It's different.....I unlocked every character....and its never boring...but the only thing i would say is that it need too customize its own character
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a show about people and the troubles they come across living in a dangerous world where you can't trust anyone and there are zombies lurking around every corner.  It's suspenseful and you never know when someone is to be killed off or what road they will travel.  It's full of surprises and very addicting. Remember, it's about people, not zombies. The zombies are only a part ifthe story and not the whole story.  Very addicting!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|There are a wide range of sounds, even for it to be the free version.<br /><br /> You can make your own sort of lullabies by overlapping the sounds (you can adjust the volume of each individual sound within the mix), you can set a timer for it to shut off, and it works perfectly for me. There is also an option to have binaural beats.  It's very soothing!  I use it every night.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Sure the app is free, but you will reach a point where you can't collect more pets without blings. The blings are very expensive. You get 2000 for $100, but one pet can cost you 1200 blings. It's quite outrageous to charge that much for a cyber pet. There is a lot you need blings for besides purchasing pets. You can win blings, but not enough to really get new homes and pets. So for parents letting their children play. Be sure to block in app purchasing or you will be spending hundreds of dollars to build and keep up a cyber pet world. It's a great game but the fact that these people want so much money for cyber pets is quite unsettling.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Due to rather negative reviews regarding the editing style of the film (e.g., too jumpy, moves every 3 seconds, and so forth) I was predisposed to be annoyed with the style. It is rather unique - but so are Zep! The editing in no way detracts from the enjoyment of a very rare concert, indeed! A final note, the DTS Master Audio improves substantially if you set your receiver to Music (I prefer DTS- Neon:16- THX audio on my Onkyo. Plants vocals, and sound separation are enhanced well beyond any Movie/ Film setting the receiver may have. Amazing concert - great film - and, hey - it's what we have. I'm not going to split hairs over very respectable - unique editing!
B00BKEMX28|4.0|I really wanted to like HTDA when they first came out.  However, upon listening to the first EP, the final verdict was that the good songs sounded like they were written by Trent, and simply sung by his wife.  I also regretted that they didn't do a club mix of the singles.<br />Fast-forward to Welcome to Oblivion.<br />This is the CD I was expecting when I first came across them three years ago.  From beginning to end, we are taken on a journey that (in NIN terms) is part YEAR ZERO and part THE SLIP.  This is done without ripping the previous releases off, but rather expanding on the audio soundscape. Mariqueen's vocals match the music better than on previous releases, and the flow of the CD drips like liquid candy.<br />This purchase was a MUCH better decision than the new Depeche Mode.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hesitant at first, as I've never found a good book from a self-published writer, but the many good reviews and the low price swayed me to give it a try.  I am very pleased to say that my fears were unfounded, as this was absolutely the best self-published novel I've ever read.  While it doesn't quite rank with my favorite SF authors (Alastair Reynolds, Larry Niven, Stephen Baxter, etc.), it is very, very close.  The character development is very good (not great), and the story is quite good.  I especially like how he kept revealing more and more layers.  I am very much looking forward to reading more about the silos.<br /><br />This is worth your while to check out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Sad to finish the last book!  Wonderful story.  Couldn't put it down! Even if you heard Fifty Shades referred to as &#34;mommy porn&#34;, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting
B00BI745AA|1.0|I was not at all impressed with this movie.  It was terribly long and dragged out. Not at all what I was hoping for as a musical.<br />I do not recommend this movie.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Once you start listening you can't stop.<br />She has a beautiful voice...the songs are meaningful and soulful.<br />This a must buy.
B005BZQS1E|4.0|If you enjoy a little camp once in a while, and you are in a mood, then I would recommend this.  The absurdity of it all should have made me hate it but I took a drink and found myself enjoying it.  Mindless, yes, stupid, yes, dumb yes, still enjoyable, yes.  So have a drink too and enjoy some lighter fair.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|They're perfect. Almost everything I need, minus tongs and a metal whisk, and the knob on the back that allows you to sit them on the counter without touching is something you don't know you need until you get it.<br /><br />The ladle is large, the spaghetti fork is perfect, the pink spoon is fantastic for just about everything...<br /><br />I think my only complaint is of the flipper. It's a bit thick and gets egg absolutely stuck to the end. I need to remember to scrub it right after flipping my over easy eggs, otherwise getting the egg off of there is a real hassle. It's also simply not flexible enough for many tasks, so I have an extra metal flipper that I use for just about everything. But... the plastic flipper is great for non-stick, as you aren't to use metal in non-stick pans.<br /><br />Worth the money, I think.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The plot became somewhat predictable and contrived, so that it was hard to believe in the characters, and the extremes of the wife's plotting everything down to the last detail.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|As the movie kept on rolling, I couldn't help but smile and laugh. This movie is indeed funny and fun to watch. Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it its the best game in the world, but when you coppy someones world you olny get half of it, it  needs updating.
B006WPWH4E|1.0|It is impossible to quit a game that you did not win.  The buttons do not show at the bottom of the screen to either &#34;end game&#34; or &#34;restart game&#34;, or &#34;new game&#34;.  I have communicated with the developer of this game and they can not give me an explanation as to why it does not work.
B0046UGSNS|3.0|The ending of the movie gave me the strong sense that something was missing. While the movie was interesting and the portrayal of the characters realistic, I felt that we should be told what happened with Marc. Usually I'm ok with open endings, but this somehow felt wrong...
B00A8ECU24|3.0|First off... why do the ponies do the WORM that's right the WORM. WHY?!! Also why do the ponies cost so much hearts and gems? I mean seriously 70 gems for 1 pony. 30 hearts for another? But the creators of this game need to realize that not everyone has a Facebook or game loft account. I certainly don't. But at least the game is fun and easy to play. So 3 stars is my rating
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|Saw this in the theaters when it was first released, and then bought the vhs and then the dvd when they came out.  Now I have the digital version via Amazon.  Excellent movie, amazing casting.  I cry every time I watch it.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Tom Selleck is a good actor who performs as the character in a number of movies-The plots are interesting-He's a person trying to manage his use of alcohol, but not very successfully-still, he presents as a very likable person who does his job well & the movies are very entertaining
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This entire book, with the exception of the very end, is extremely action packed and a combination of every great part of all the previous books.  It is virtually all action.  Unfortunately, by setting the tempo so high there was no way the ending could live up to it.  It left many story lines open but did close the driving threads from the series.  I'm not sure if all of the previous bits of prophecy and foretelling were wrapped up.  It will take another reading or two to see.  I was a little disappointed by the conclusion of the story arc of Perrin and Slayer.  Regardless, it doesn't prevent me from giving it 5 stars and recommending it to anyone who enjoys fantasy.
B005DJREGQ|2.0|Is sex funny? Misunderstood, misunderstanding attempted suicide, is that amusing?  How many teen movies/shows are out there that portray an outcast teen trying to fit in and not just with the \\"in crowd,\\" but within their own heads? Being misunderstood is a way of life, especially when you're a teenager, but it's anything but funny or even amusing. This show is neither either if those. It's common, it's dull and it's all been done before. If you want quality along these lines watch, \\"My So Called Life.\\"
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|There were very funny parts in this movie, but also very boring parts. All in all, it was ok. I wouldn't watch it again but don't regret seeing it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I wanted to see if the author's experience, as a physician, was anything like the near death experience I had after a head on auto accident .... & it was, only his was more extensive.  It has been difficult for me to express in words, but I saw the BRIGHT light, heard music like I have never heard before, & had the feeling of total love & peace. Dr. Alexander described it as well as I suppose it can be.  I know that I truly believe that heaven is just one breath away.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the book....was much better than some of the reviews given.  It still had enough supense to keep you guessing about the characters' actions.
0385528752|4.0|In short - great book. I highly recommend it. The Heath brothers are well aware that change is hard and takes time, and they do a good job of conveying that without making change seem impossible.<br /><br />I read this book for a class, so having a motivating teacher helps as well. I give it 4 stars because that teacher was the 5th star for me - he made this book more actionable than it already is. If someone doesn't WANT to change, that person WON'T change, so until they figure that part out, 4 stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best app you can EVER get!!!! You can play for hours and hours and not get bored! TOTALLY worth the money!! (I wish I could give it more stars!)<br /><br />  An update would be nice though :/
B003VPWXRO|4.0|This was a great book with a good insight into the mind of an anorexic/bulimic who was in the public eye for most of her life. We all know the reasons for becoming anorexic vary substantially from person to person but her reasons seem to be less behavioral and psychological and more due to pressure from the industry  to fit in certain sizes. I've read about this disease a lot and found there are so many deep and underlying reasons for falling into this disease; the deepest psychological causes are the fear of disappointing and the constant guilt over everything, regardless of fault. However, Ms. DeRossi made it sound like she was just trying to get a job. Her lack of self confidence is obvious and like most anorexics, shines through as a strong contributor to her affliction and is a common underlying factor. This was a very good book, I read it quickly and was sad when I finished it. She was candid, straight forward and didn't have to try very hard to make this an interesting read. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about the disease and the showbiz industry to gain insight into the mind of an anorexic.
B00174TKGI|5.0|I love this movie.  I have watched it several times and it is always good. Would definietly recommend this movie to others.
B00BWU2EMO|5.0|Lots and lots of action, a little sex and Sean Penn without limits! Supporting actors all give excellent performances, they take you back in time, back to the days of illegal booze, broads and gangsters' machine guns blasting hot lead at each other!
B000FA675C|5.0|I read the Da Vinci Code in its early hard-cover edition and could not put it down.  For me, the movie was a great disappointment. Sometimes an actor just can not do the character justice.  Tom Hanks was just going through the motions so far as I was concerned, and the great detail that author Dan Brown brought to the novel could not fit into the limitations of movie script.  Movies depend so much on action to keep audiences involved, whereas a novel allows us the leisure to create our images and prolong the story as we wish.  If you have only seen the movie, I highly recommend reading the book.  This is true of Angels and Demons as well.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|The whole family loves this GAME especially when the girls are taking a break from doing their homework. THIS GAME is a real stress reliever.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I have read several of the Pendergast novels and enjoyed the earlier ones much more than the last two or three.  I am probably done with this series.  I think the author(s) have just used up all the story lines that they have kept connected for so long.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I love this story and being based on a true story is even better. All i can say is that it make you relise that some people do care about others
B008FPOIT6|4.0|One has to really enjoy reading a slow-moving story about old books, cyphers and codes to stay with this story long enough to get into the juicier story.  I am one of those kind of people and I eventually came to really enjoy the final endgame and conclusion of the story.  Take your time with this.  Not as good as Shadow of the Wind (Zafron) but in some ways similar.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book this is a great book I've read the whole series and very time they are better love this series
B002RSDW80|4.0|I love cooking and baking. This movie is great to pop in after an afternoon of cooking or baking, or just because if you're in one of those moods. Meryl Streep and Anna Adams deliver an excellent show.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|This is a terrific album, er, CD.  I like every song on this disc. If you are a Beatles fan, or just like some of the Beatles songs, you will love this album as I did.  I would recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Right up till the end of the book, I didn't know one of the most important parts of the story.  Wonderful story of healing, and learning to trust and love again.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|If you live in San Francisco, Cambridge, or Greenwich Village; if you enjoy beat poetry and adore late night coffee shops, this will be THE BEST MOVIE EVER!<br /><br />If you live in the suburbs, eat red meat and thought Titanic was an epic classic, this will be THE WORSE MOVIE EVER!
B000VSYDRM|5.0|I read the book a few years ago and could not imagine how anyone would be able to put it in a movie format. It is really well done!
030758836X|5.0|This was my vacation pool read, and I went thru it SO fast.  I loved it.  Could identify with the marital issues (to a point!) and the book totally keeps you guessing.  I would definitely recommend this one.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I held off on this one for a few months because several reviewers complained about a drop in quality. But I wasn't disappointed. Another great Reacher novel.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|A fantastic book that addresses some of the cultural reasons women are held back in the workforce. Meticulously researched, some of the scientific data Sandberg cites made my jaw drop. Take for instance the Heidi / Howard study, done at Harvard Business School. Students were asked to read a case about the accomplishments of Heidi Roizen, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. However, half of the students read a version of the text where the name &#34;Heidi&#34; had been changed to &#34;Howard.&#34; Although the students judged the two as equally competent, the ones who read the &#34;Heidi&#34; text reported thinking of her as unlikeable. This was not the perception of the students who read about Howard. A study like this reveals that there is still an unconscious bias against women in the workforce.<br /><br />As a woman working in a creative industry, I can see how Sandberg's work can apply to men as well as women working in creative fields. Artists are often subjected to the same negative stereotypes as women. We are seen as overly emotional, irrational, moody, and as having low self-esteem and little business-sense. Artists are frequently asked to work for less compensation than they deserve, because we should be grateful for &#34;the exposure.&#34; (If you need an example of the damage that this does to our economy, take a look at what is happening in the Visual Effects industry, where highly skilled and trained artists are routinely under-compensated).  Sandberg discusses how women are more likely than men to feel &#34;fraudulent&#34; in positions of power; they question their accomplishments and attribute their success to luck. This &#34;feeling of being a fraud&#34; is something I have heard repeated by my artist peers. Additionally, I have heard it from some of the most accomplished artists in the gallery talks and lectures I have attended, regardless of the gender of the speaker.<br /><br /> Perhaps the people who can benefit the most from Sandberg's bookare women in the arts. Scientific studies have shown that jurors are less likely to pick work submitted by women artists when they know the gender of the submitter, but when gender isn't known, the works selected near 50/50. Sandberg empowers her female readers with knowledge of what they are up against, as well as presenting ways to overcome said obstacles. I hope that her writing leads not only to more women in corporate power, but in galleries and museums as well. It is estimated that only 5% of the work displayed in museums in the the USA was made by women artists. Certainly, at a time when the student body of art colleges is around 75% women, we can do better.
B00005YU1O|1.0|Having viewed the trailer, I was transfixed by the unique animation style and the theme of exploring the dream and waking states, and anxiously awaited the DVD's arrival. But upon viewing, I was utterly disappointed by the story line... to the extent that there was one - it's really more like a series of vignettes with random people pontificating meaninglessly about whatever seems to be on their mind. We actually only made it through the first 45 minutes or so; by that point it became clear that there wasn't going to be any payoff.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is the cinematic equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes; I can imagine all the Smart People pointing out how much they're seeing until a young boy shouts out \\"The Emperor is naked!\\", after which they all admit that there's really nothing there at all. Its been a while since I've been a young boy, but perhaps I can fill that role.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I enjoyed this by Nicholas Sparks but found myself already knowing how the story would end from the time I began reading it... IZ have read better books by this author.
B00785P2QC|1.0|I never leave reviews but this game sucks so bad I had to. I started off ok but after 20 min I realized it costs more than 8000 just to upgrade something. Besides that almost every goal requires investment points which u nvr have. So if you actually want to get somewhere in the game u have to buy them which is a complete waste. DONT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO THROW AWAY!
B000VI6T6U|4.0|Overall, this is a very good dvd of the late/great Jimi Hendrix, along with \\"The Experience\\". This is very good historical footage. If you are a Jimi Hendrix fan, I'm sure you'll find this dvd to be very enjoyable. Jimi was definitely one of the greatest guitar players ever. Plus, he was highly influencial to many, many other blues rock guitarists.<br /><br />However, I was a little disappointed in Jimi's live performance in this dvd. After all, I have read about how great he was, & how \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine duded him, the Greatest Guitar Player ever. I was expecting a better live performance, than Jimi's performance on this dvd. In all due respect, Jimi did put on a very good performance, but I was expecting better. The main highlight for me was at the end of his performance, he poured lighter fluid on his guitar and set it on fire. This was reminescent of Jerry Lee Lewis, pouring lighter fluid on this pianos and setting them on fire, when he'd end his show, while playing \\"Great Balls of Fire\\".<br /><br />Also, I've been reading the book, \\"My Cross to Bear\\", the memiors of Gregg Allman. In this book, Gregg mentions that he got to see Jimi perform live, and that he too, was disappointed in Jimi's live performance. He also was expecting a better performance from Jimi, than what he saw live. Apparently Jimi was a lot better in a recording studio, because he recorded some of the best blues rock records ever.<br /><br />However, I have a lot of respect for Jimi Hendrix, because he wrote some dang good, blues rock songs. Plus, he was a great influence on many future blues rock guitarists. The Jimi Hendrix Classic \\"Voodoo Chile\\", has been carried on by many other blues rock guitarists. The late/great Stevie Ray Vaughan was greatly influenced by Jimi, and SRV included the song \\"Voodoo Chile\\" in his regular song sets, that he performed at concerts. Plus, he even recorded a studio version of it. Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top has also commented that he was highly influenced by Jimi Hendrix. Also, Kenny Wayne Sheperd, Eric Johnson, along with many, many other blues guitarists state they were greatly influenced by Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />This dvd is packed full of Bonus Material, mostly documentary in nature. Thanks, and I hope this review has been helpful.

B004Z2TUGE|3.0|It was okay.  There were some plot holes - like why did they have to be killed in a specific order?  Acting was passable, but not great.  It was entertaining, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game in my free time and when I'm bored in class lectures. I would recomemd for any horse crazy people out there.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|I liked it.  It was funny and entertaining.  It had a good cast and some pretty funny scenes.  Not a kids movie, but some of the humor seemed to be aimed at adolescents.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled across the Wool Omnibus via a review on SFSignal of the Shift Saga. It sounded mildly interesting and was cheap so I figured, why not? Wow! Awesome read, I couldn't put it down and now I'm spreading the word about this hidden gem.

B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved this book, because it had so many interesting characters in it.  It is a book about life and the journeys we all take and share. Well written and thought provoking.
0307744434|5.0|The detailed visual imagery and sensory descriptions make you feel as if you are in this magical world. It is a tad difficult to follow if you don't pay close attention to the dates and locations of the overlapping storylines and timelines. I look forward to reading it again and picking up on the little details that come to be important later in the story.
B004OZZ624|5.0|I liked it quite a bit. The plot seems really disjointed at first, but it all comes together at the end. My only complaint is that I don't think she said \\"thank you\\" at any point in time. Seriously.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|a rare piece of art. thank God someone still can do such a movie in this world!!! I just love it!!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Sees quite a lot around you. Lots of graphs and charts. Helps you find just the right wireless system you're looking for.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Totally worth 5 stars. I love the show and my teacher says the book is ALWAYS better, so I red the first one, and now I'm gonna read the entire series! I can't wait to read them<br /><br />  It's isn't a horror but an intense comic like drama. What I don't like is that there are no Merle or Daryl Dixon. This is something u should read if u like books that have drama, intensity, and awesomeness.
B003V5CFV8|1.0|Couldn't finish this abortion - Hollywood Jewish types (Coen brothers) inform their worldview by stereotypes handed down to them by other Hollywood Jewish types. Apparently the Coen brothers thought it would be fun to pitch three protagonists into the deep South and cut them loose, so that they could act out comically in what Hollywood Jewish types believe the American South is actually like - a world defined by ignorance, racism, hypocritical Christianity, grits, hog wallers, and Bill Clinton. Oooops, scratch the latter - somehow the hillbilly South managed to produced a Rhodes Scholar Hollywood-liberal icon and if we admit that, it threatens all the stereotypes this film depends on. Forget I mentioned Bill Clinton; just blot it out.

B0095VPAVE|4.0|WARNING: This review is very Linux-centric. If you're using Windows, This processor is A-OK. Buy it.<br /><br />TL:DR: The Linux Video Driver sucked. It doesn't now. Buy it.<br /><br />What I like: The price is right. You get decent 3D graphics and a workable CPU for a (relative) small amount of money. The chip does do some mild overclocking. I gave the gpu a +40mhz boost to round it to a cool 800mhz, which made a difference in some 3D accelerated Linux apps: No problems or complications doing that (but that depends on your motherboard). The CPU performance is fine. I used this to replace an aging Intel C2D 7300 and it does handle the workload thrown at it efficiently. I'm able to do XBMC HD playback all while file serving and running other daemon processes in the background with no noticeable issues. Plus the chip is power friendly at idle and doesn't often break past 15-35% CPU on day to day usage.<br /><br />What I don't like: AMD really needs to make some improvements to their video drivers, Linux in particular. Steam for Linux is problematic on their current release video driver and requires (as of 4/14/2013) a beta driver to work normally. Plus you have to do some console commands to force permanent overscan correction, even though the AMD Catalyst Command Module for Linux allows you to dial in your setting there. It SHOULD save... but doesn't. That, as the kids are saying, is ratchet. I have an AMD A10 that I use for a Windows 8 light gaming box, so I can vouch for the Windows video drivers being better. So MOST of you won't have a problem with this (98.83% of you, to be exact). However it is annoying. Plus don't get me started on the issues AMD has with Crossfire, if you do plan on pairing the APU's iGPU with a discrete GPU for better gaming performance. Also it would be nice to see more software take advantage of the OpenCL capabilities of the iGPU to really leverage the iGPU's power. This isn't really a problem with the chip per se. But when you do use OpenCL apps, this processor does shine really well along with every other chip in the AMD Virgo family. It makes a difference when using video transcoding apps like Handbrake and (eventually) the Adobe Software Suite.<br /><br />What I can't talk about: The stock cooler. I actually used a closed loop water cooler on this thing. Overkill? Probably. So I can't vouch for how good or bad it is. If you ever get the option to buy this thing OEM (w/no cooling fan) for $10 cheaper, that's the route to go.<br /><br />Overall: I actually do recommend this processor, linux driver issues aside, if you're looking to build a modest PC that has enough oomph to do basic tasks without limiting yourself too much with a \\"dual core\\" A6 or A4. The iGPU on the A8 isn't too far behind the A10's in performance benchmarks if you do have a desire to game on it. Same is to be said about straight CPU performance as well. I guess it boils down to your budget and if you want to pony up more cash for a few more FPS. The biggest place you get gimped on this chip is shader count in comparison to the A10, but it doesn't make that much of a difference. So if you're not gaming, this is a solid processor to buy.<br /><br />UPDATE: 7/11/2013 - AMD Catalyst Linux drivers have been updated. Steam for Linux works properly. Dialing in the overscan correction from Linux Catalyst Control Center works properly.<br /><br />Side note - I highly advise downloading the video driver directly from AMD and installing via command line rather than use any linux driver installer. Just throwing that out there..nCL apps, this processor does shine really well along with every other chip in the AMD Virgo family.

B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Paul Thomas Anderson is a hit or miss director for me.  I loved There Will Be Blood, didn't care much for Magnolia.  I liked Punch-Drunk Love, Boogie Nights was a little below my expectations.  This one I put in the same category as Magnolia and Boogie Nights.  Phoenix was really good in it and deserved his nomination of an oscar, but Hoffman's and Adams' oscar nominated performances were as overrated as this film.  I expected more from Anderson, especially since his last movie, \\"There Will Be Blood\\", is one of my favorites.
B007R21JJK|3.0|What I like: The PCIe slot placement is really good on this board. The overall build quality seems solid, considering it's not a &#34;enthusiast grade&#34; product. Using Q-Flash to update your BIOS is super easy! The Dual BIOS mode is nice, albeit it DID cause some complications to my issue below.<br /><br />What I'm on the fence about: Not sure what to make of the VIA integrated audio chipset. I've had some weird quirks with it. It constantly wants to default to HDMI audio, even though I'm using mm audio jacks to stereo speakers. I had to go as far as disabling the HDMI audio after attempting multiple times to force the mm audio as the default output in Windows 8. That seems to have &#34;shut it up&#34;... but it's still annoying.<br /><br />What I was talking about in the subject: When I started my initial Windows 8 Install, I was having the hardest time getting my video card (AMD 6950 - reference design + 6970 bios hack) to initialize. I had to use the integrated video of my i7-2600k CPU just to get  the install done. When it came time to install the AMD driver, it couldn't detect that I had a video card installed. I tried disabling the integrated video, forcing discrete video, resetting the bios - all accomplishing nada. I tried the alternate bios which added a different set of problems I'm not even going to rant about right now. So I googled the issue and dug through the gigabyte support forums and read similar strings detailing the issue I was having, but with no clear fix. There was one thread I found that suggested flashing the bios to the most current version then RMAing. So I looked to see what BIOS I had. Lo and Behold, I had the most current BIOS version already. So for BMs and giggles, I tried flashing my bios to the same version anyway. That ended up solving my problem. Now the dGPU works fine, Virtu works fine, QuickSync works fine (for the 1 app I have that uses it :-/ ), and SSD caching works fine. Thankfully, I didn't have to RMA the board. If I needed too, I may have dropped this thing like a hot rock.<br /><br />Overall: Not a bad board. I actually do like it. I'm just really miffed that I had to do a BIOS flash from the start for the same BIOS I already had. I wasted so much time trying to figure out something I shouldn't have right from the start. And this is probably an internet first when I say &#34;I actually want Realtek integrated audio&#34;. WTH, Gigabyte? I know this is a value performance board, but c'mon! At least make sure these things are leaving the factory with a proper flash! I buy ALOT of Gigabyte boards for their consistent level of quality (that I'VE experienced, anyway. YMMV) and this is an honest-to-god first.<br /><br />So assuming you don't have the same issues I did, you should be fine with this board. If you DO have issues getting a dGPU working, take my advice and prepare to flash the BIOS. Or better yet... just preemptively flash the board to the most current version. If there is ONE thing I can say that's 100% positive, QFlash does work really well and the Dual BIOS pretty much makes it so that you can't fry this board from a bad flash or borked setting.eeded too, I may have dropped this thing like a hot rock.<br /><br />Overall: Not a bad board.

B003HARV3Y|4.0|the movie itself was great...didn't really follow the book very well but what books to movies ever really do...can't wait to watch again
B000FCK65W|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's about the struggles, failures and victories of a poor Irish family in early 20th century Brooklyn. It is not a plot-driven action sort of book. Instead, its appeal rests entirely on the central character, Francie O'Neil who reminds us of the strengths of a brave generation.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|the cuts didn't come out too well and the hot to cold dipping process took much longer than expected...will give it another test run..maybe it takes practice
0385349947|5.0|A guide to success. and well-written by a successful woman.  Women need to accept responsibility for success and stop blaming external forces.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|loved all of the songs...keep my jamming going down the road and the digital booklet was a great addition as well
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a beautiful book that illustrates and humanizes the struggle of foster youth aging out of the system in a story as beautiful as the floral imagery the story evoked. I cringed so many times, yet sympathized with Victoria's maternal struggles.
B00B935SUY|4.0|Fun and thorough history of the recording studio and the recording board used by so many great bands. Last portion is recording new material with artists of Sound City at Dave Grohl's studio 606 on the board.
B000001GXE|1.0|Several reviewers have pointed out that there is something relentless, cold, mechanical and aggressive about this recording. I would agree. Moreover the tight, un-Viennese sound of the orchestra exacerbates the problem. I have heard on the grapevine that the orchestra hated to have to play Schubert - one of their favourite sons - in this hard-driven manner. I can sympathise with this attitude. Altogether I would characterise this issue as a category mistake by the conductor. Kleiber wanted to say something new, but ended up treading in Klemperer's footsteps with only half the conviction brought to the task by the grand old man.<br />So the question you must ask yourself is not only: Do I like or dislike this performance on first hearing? But rather more circumspectly: Will I like or dislike this recording in 10 or 20 years' time? Could I live with it as a treasure of Schubert's music?<br />My personal reaction after hearing it perhaps 8 to 10 times over the last couple of years is this: I never ever want to hear it again.<br />That's not the reaction anyone should have to Schubert's symphony, in any performance, even with an amateur band.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Hooked after only a few minutes playing. Ads minimal until you play for a while then they pop up more frequently. But still worth it. Easy to clear them and keep playing.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie.  Magic Mike is a &#34;life&#34; story (versus the sensationalized evil smarter-than-everyone-else bad-guy versus the victimized good guy) with the feel of Saturday Night Live, though the stories are starkly different. Some sexy dance scenes.
B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|I loved this game and i played it for half an hour then  i tried to play another game and everything went heywire and the logo kept popping up
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Powerful female roles that come across electric and pull you into the series. Good stories that relate to us all. Will be watching for a long time.
B001OKQ7BG|5.0|We watched bits and pieces of this movie on the shuttle between Sun Records, Graceland and the Rock & Soul Museum and couldn't wait to get back home and watch it all.  Worth the watch
B000ID3KU6|5.0|Academy Award winning actor Henry Fonda in the darkest, most believable cold blooded & evil villain he ever played, this movie is directed by Sergio Leone the Director of Clint Eastwood's famous Trilogy of \\"The Man with no Name\\" (A fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good, The Bad & the Ugly) fame.<br />This movie is filmed in the American southwest and involves the mysterious murders of a whole family except for the new wife who arrives in town after the murders. She is a New Orleans whore who has married a dreamer who tells her they will be rich after she moves to their desert ranch.<br />The hero is played by Charles Bronson who Leone called the greatest actor he ever directed, Bronson's plays a young man stalking  Fonda for the murder of his older brother. The plot is well written, the scenery is awesome, the storyline is fully developed and I recommend it highly to anyone who loves movies that are well written and directed with believable characters.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|Really like this app and particularly like the configurability. Very user friendly and I recommend it. All in all it does what it says on the tin.
B0009FTXGI|5.0|Perfect low cost replacement for the original! Make sure you buy a &#34;dedicated Lens hood&#34; and NOT a &#34;TULIP FLOWER LENS HOOD&#34;. From what I have seen TULIP FLOWER LENS HOODs&#34; screw into the filter threads so you can not use filters.<br />&#34;dedicated Lens hoods&#34; fit the same as the originals.

B005LAIIGC|5.0|Shipped on-time.  I gave it to my 6 year old son right before Easter and we have watched it quite a few times!  Great buy!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Other reviewers have said it more eloquently, but I wanted to add my \\"huzza\\" to how well this was done.  Great movie, beautifully and expressively animated, with some intense edge-of-chair scenes.  If one were to use this movie to open up a conversation with (say) young people about the value of nature, the only caveat I would express would be that there is a clear \\"bad guy\\" in the movie -- and he is BAD, there is just nothing likable about him at all.  While that might make the story easier and more fun to tell, of course it isn't really true that some evil guy (or guys) is responsible for all the devastation we have seen.  Then again, we do have a more compassionate view of the guy who started the whole mess, which is refreshing!  So The Lorax is a great jumping off point for a conversation about that, and how human interaction with the natural world has changed...and how we can each keep changing for the better.
B00942G4UA|2.0|I found this boring and not of much value. Better do some research and find a more authoritive media from a better defined source.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game. It is a hidden objects game with a story line. I love hidden object games but this one definitely keeps me intrigued. I do not want the fun to stop but I can not stop playing either. Started off with the free version and ended up purchasing the full version. Gotta try it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome wastes time and is really entertaining its also fun to play. I think every one who has submitted a reveiw has written the same thing
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Amazon Cloud Drive is a easy, fast, and secure storage solution for my photographs, which take up a lot of space as Jpeg, Tiff, and Png files often do. Try it...you'll love it too!!!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Stieg Larsson has created one of the most memorable characters in modern-day storytelling in Lisbeth Salander.  Many a late night I spent completely unable to stop reading.  These are favorites I have come back to read multiple times.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob kept me on edge!  Had to put the book down now and then and try to recover my nerves!
1582701709|5.0|I loved this book it opened up  my mind to alternate ways of thinking and how my present ways were affecting my life.  In my opinion you have to be a person who is receptive to what The Secret has to offer.  It most certainly works for me.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Initially, this didn't present any information I didn't already suspect or know, and I agreed with its presentation, but thought it was a slight bit melodramatic. However, as it progressed, I began to really appreciate every part of it. I've always been against the subsidization of corn and soybeans, but I had no idea how much the large corporations are embedded into our government. It's sickening, but for sure worth knowing. I always preferred organic food for the sake of cleaner, healthier food, but I didn't realize how important it is to keep consistently supporting organic, local food for the sake of fixing our food system. Every purchase is a vote for how we want our food to be made. It's a horrifying documentary, but it also has an empowering message that I, and probably everyone, needed to hear.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I've been pleasantly surprised with this app. The last Facebook app that I had kept crashing and was difficult to maneuver.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I can hardly wait until the price drops on the rest of the series.... I just can not get enough.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I avoided reading this book for many years due to what I thought was a depressing plot. However, I was drawn to it because of the publicity and how often it is quoted by others. I watched one of the movies on it and am hooked on the story and characters. I have gotten through four chapters and wish I had read the book before watching the movie as the movie leaves out so much. So little is shown of the Bishop in the movie I saw when I realize from reading the book that it is the Bishop that change Jean ValJean's and ultimately other peoples lives through Jean ValJean's selfless acts of service.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I can hardly wait until the price drops on the rest of the series.... I just can not get enough.  It is best to own this series
B000FGGE68|5.0|Milla is great in very movie has played THE GREAT GETAWAY, RESIDENT EVIL and the other movies also. She is a great actress I love all her movies.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|After reading the first I jumped at the chance to get the whole series as a boxed set.  I enjoyed the characters and the humor.  The alternative world is one I'd love to visit. A strong female protagonist is someone I always look for in my reading.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Really funny, and the later books aren't as graphic in the S&M stuff...more of a love story/thriller.  Was really hard to put down.
0465068367|5.0|I have read many books about serial killers (all from Amazon, actually), and my mind couldn't grasp their gratuitous cruelty. Now, I read about a whole japanese division gang-raping, impaling and disemboweling a whole chinese city. Never was this mentioned on school, on history books, on Discovery Channel... why does the western world ignore this episode? More intriguing yet: why is the writer considered a lunatic after writing this book, sent to an asylum for recovery, and then misteriously dies? Suicide, said the official records. The same records that denied the Rape of Nanking...
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A great book, watched the show first, don't regret my order as lots of folks say to read the books first but I was ignorant of them before the show, The book greatly expands upon the motives and personalities that i had grown to love and hate in the show.
B007VWEEQQ|4.0|This product works well, though Audi designed a horrible connection. The cable is way to short. Would recommend buying for an extension connection::<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008DWGLA0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_31
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. It was so exiting and it wraps up the siries very nicely. It didn't have as much action as the other ones but I still loved it. I wouldn't suggest it if you haven't read the first 2, you may not understand it very well. Overall it was a great book.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I had not been interested in this for some time but I was bored so I figured why not. The movie was pretty good. The end not so much though. Seemed like they ran out of storyline and said boom you are all dead the end
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I really like this car charger.  First, it charges both Apple and Android devices.  Secondly, for those of us that are visual users, it is actually marked on the charger which port is for which device.  It is one charger for two systems meaning you don't have to have two chargers in your car.  And, finally, there are no cords running from the charger itself; small and compact is exactly what you need when you are mobile.<br /><br />What more could you ask for in a car charger?  Mine is white in color and that will make it easy to find in my car's console storage area as the white will show up against the grey interior of this area.<br /><br />It comes with an 18 month warranty card and a fan-fold instruction card that fully explains the difference between the Apple and Android charging ports and the speeds at which it will recharge your devices.  This is one great product.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|funniest show on tv now big time talented actors and writers it's a fantastic show Jim Parsons is a fabulous actor
B00AO7HQ06|2.0|So, I guess I'll be the dissenting voice here. Duane Allman is one my musical heroes. More than 40 years gone and I still listen to his playing almost every day. Needless to say, I was drooling with anticipation at the prospect of a career retrospective that would promote his genius and unearth treasures. While a lavish box set in and of itself may achieve that, I'm not sure the music here does. First of all, what is the purpose of this box? Obviously, it's not for Duane-completist collectors like me. For instance, Duane solos on, I think, six of the tracks on Herbie Mann's \\"Push Push,\\" but there only three tracks from that album here, so we'd still need to buy the whole album, making this redundant. It's not a greatest-hits collection, so what's the point of including two versions of \\"Blue Sky\\" and another two of \\"Dreams,\\" as well as entire disc of juvenilia on which Duane can barely be heard, not to mention four irritating tracks from Lulu when one would suffice? Indeed, that's an ongoing issue with a collection that frequently features the admittedly brilliant playing of a session musician: because a huge chunk of the collection is devoted to Duane's playing on others' recordings, one often must work hard to find him, either because he's buried in the mix as a sideman or because he just plays the occasional killer lick. Speaking of the recordings, a lot of this box doesn't sound very good. Although some tracks, like the Cowboy entry and Duane's three solo tracks, have never sounded better, a lot of the Atlantic session work is badly distorted (I need to go back to the LPs to determine if this is a mastering error here or the way it was recorded at the time). Finally, if the point was to show Duane's development as a musician over his too-short career -- a point I'm not sure can be made, since he seemed to go from a teen to a full-blown genius over the course of a few weeks -- his legacy would have been better served by a more concise, less expensive and better annotated collection. Instead of a sticker, a guitar pick and cheap disc sleeves (two of mine are already torn), I'd have preferred that the money be spent on hiring someone to do a track-by-track commentary that directed listeners to Duane's contributions and what they added. If there's any good news here, it's that there do still seem to be gems to be found. For instance, although traders have had the live Delaney & Bonnie stuff for years, it would be wonderful to have an official release of the full D&B radio broadcast. But the bottom line is, if you're looking for a place to start with Duane Allman, for less than $50 (i.e. less than half the price of this box), you can get the Allmans' \\"Fillmore Concerts\\" and D&D's \\"Layla,\\" with money left over for assorted ABB releases. And if you're already worshipping at the temple of Duane Allman, the Charlie Parker of the blues guitar, someone who never played the same solo twice and whose slide playing was as vocally expressive as any singer, head to eBay and start collecting. Just don't outbid me on the \\"Duane Allman Dialogs\\" LP, ok?
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I watched this a few times and still didn't get bored, this is such a great movie, the 3D is so beautiful like it's real. The story is also very interesting and touching. Love this movie so much.
B00BSBXA98|2.0|I gave up an went back to work on the computer. It's just like all the others.The element of surprise is gone. How many old olmpians go to work at Circque?
B00BHMETKC|4.0|My brother and wife really enjoyed this but I thought it was just okay.  In the real story the Canadian ambassador was more active.  Also I was delighted to discover that the fake movie script was based on a story by one of my favorite science fiction authors:  Roger Zelazny.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game keeps your mind ticking and forces you to use stragedy to win the battle. It is highly addictive and shows signs of expansion. It misnaming well thought out take with loads of characters to choose from. Get this game!!!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Awesome book. Looking forward to read the next one! I highly recommend, especially for The Walking Dead TV show fans.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I am a true fan of fantasy books. This fills my menu! The first book was captivating.  Through the whole thing I kept envisioniing who would play the on screen parts when it comes to the big screen (but not sure when). Although I am still reading it, I feel like it is the very next chapter in the 1st book.....
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|the acting is excellent and renders a vivid account what can happen to a human body swept away by a torrent of water and anything else in it's way.  character development is strong and in the end a 'feel good' movie
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A great read. Much history details that will be good for all school children. Would recommend to all, especially those that love Greek mythology and history.
B000L212HC|5.0|Another very entertaining movie from the director of Batman.  Not sure if you can call this underrated, but It truly is amazing.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I am a 50 year old mom and not much of a gamer, but even this old dog has learned new tricks and had a great time with this fun and addictive game.  I could figure it out easily -- eat most everything in sight and live!!  Got my 12 year old son and husband &#34;hooked&#34; too and now we have on all our devices.  Fun, Fun, Fun Free Game!!!  What can you loose (except maybe an arm or a leg)?
B00BESM14U|5.0|Spectacular movie, pitch perfect. Splendid on so many levels. Well-acted, crisp dialogue. Even though my high school days are decades ago, the writers have a finger on the pulse of what it has always felt like as a young person to try and find one's place - and a place for loss - and what are those rare moments that grab one and leave an imprint, the crystalized moments of \\"I feel infinite.\\"
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I absolutely adored this book and didn't want it to end! The author creates such beautiful imagery! You fall in love with the characters and can taste the candied apples.  I haven't come  across a book so beautifully written in a long time! Please send me a ticket to the night circus!

B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Did you see the movie 2001?  This is a wonderful writer, one of the greats, this is one of his best books and shows his towering talent.  If you haven't read it yet, do your brain a favor and read it now.

B00633W614|5.0|complicated; compelling; completely satisfying. archer's usual word craft; careful plotting; interconnected generational and personal characters. marvelous. can't wait until the next installment.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I liked the movie, and it provided an aspect to the start of the Mid East struggles.  I didn't think it was very political, but having lived through those days in our history, it did make me take an inside look at the &#34;why&#34; we're here, now.<br /><br />I love the Amazon Prime 2 day shipping, I don't even have to shop for the best price at the Target, Wal-Mart, Sam's, Costco, and burn up gas (which in California, is HUGE) running around.  Everyone competes on the first week of release, the first day prices are really nice, when the movies come out on DVD.  Amazon puts those prices to shame.  I got (not only) Argo but also The Hobbit, and it cost me less than buying just The Hobbit at any of the stores in my area.  Love my Amazon.
B00139XSBA|4.0|I learned a lot about the space program I didn't know. I remember watching  the flights on TV during my high school years . I found out what want on behind the a scenes. Enjoyed reading this

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I thought this was an awesome game.  It was much better than others that I've played, thank you very much!
B00499NHLC|5.0|in the tradition of Poirot and other great British Crime series, Sherlock will be a timeless classic that will live on. The clever approach of this show is that there is NO evocation of a time period, but rather the playful homages, subversion, and puns on the original novels and short stories. If you got the joke about the blog entry dealing with &#34;The Speckled Blonde,&#34; then you will enjoy watching for other tips of the hat to Sir Conan Doyle.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never read a book that was heartbreaking and absolutely beautiful at the same time!! I couldn't put it down. So incredibly written! Fell in love with Sky and Holder over and over again while also crying for them over and over again! I promise you.. This book will not let you down!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|this is a good series... different from 50 shades but similar as well.  gideon is delicious & so is eva.  it's a fun read & worth it.  if you liked 50 shades - you'll like this.  you can't go wrong.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|You just can't go wrong with Pride and Prejudice. One of Jane Austen's best. Read it every year or so. A must have for my library.
B00846REIS|5.0|gideon & eva are fantastically written characters.  i love their depth & the issues of their pasts.  these are great books & i'm highly anticipating the release of the 3rd novel.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I took a gamble on the first book and liked it so much I purchased the whole series (1-5).  It has a very good and surprising story line.  There is good character development even for those that don't last very long.  It kept me reading and I will be getting the next set shortly.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I love the movie and the music so when I saw this, I got it for those stressful days.  It makes me feel like I am there in the islands without being bored.  If you love the movie, you can't help but love the music to it.

B00338QENI|4.0|As a nurse, I was intrigued when I stumbled across this book in an online search.  I had heard of HeLa cells, but had no knowledge of the connection until I read this fascinating book. The book is medical non-fiction, but yet the author becomes a part of the story of the Lack family.  The importance of Henrietta's cells is paramount and learning of their beginning is riveting.  This text is much bigger than just the scientific story of this important piece of medicine and technology.  It also includes topics such as ethics, minority rights, cell biology, family dynamics, cultural society, and more. The beginning is much stronger than the ending due to the intriguing tell of the family.  Some have complained about the science, but for me this was just as interesting and the reader needs to realize this is a non-fiction piece on medicine not a novel.  I gave it four stars because it did wax and wane at times.  Personally I give the author Rebecca Skloot 10 stars!  I can't imagine having invested so many years, time, money, etc. into writing this book.  Kudos!  One should purchase this book if for no other reason than to reward Ms. Skloot's overwhelming desire to tell this story....one that needed to be told.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I simply could not put #TheLitigator down... Nor the other two books I've read in the last two days, #CalicoJoe and #TheRackateer.  All books were great reading on my Kindle reader!!  If a back injury and multiple surgeries had not sidelined my dreams of going to law school Grisham's books are now my way of somewhat living my lost dreams. You will GREATLY enjoy this phenomenal book!! I'm going to be a very busy girl in the coming days...  I'm so impressed with the three titles above I'm now off to purchase 20+ years of Grisham's other titles!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love how you can text to your friends when ever you want<br /> I use this app like all day long. I have a devise that you can't text on....but with this I can text. I only dislike this app because you can't text in a no internet zone. This sucks. That is the only part I dislike but, I LOBE all the rest
0307744434|5.0|Wow. When I finished this book that was all I could think. But I'm sure you're going to want more in a review, so here it goes:<br /><br />The Night Circus is the story of a mysterious circus that is only open at night and comes and goes from a location without warning. But the circus is only a backdrop for a much more serious event: a magical competition between Celia and Marco, who were drafted into this fight as children without their consent because of their abilities to control time and space. Over time, it becomes clear that their competition involves not only the two of them and their masters, but the whole circus and the fate of everyone in it.<br /><br />This is Erin Morgenstern's first novel, which is so hard to believe because she writes with the skill of someone who's been honing her craft for 30 years. It's a lush, romantic, suspenseful tale worthy of the hype it has received. Morgenstern truly makes magic real through her prose. The descriptions are so vivid, so evocative in their creativity that you feel like you're in a dream in the whole time - one you can't wait to get back to. From the searing pain of a binding spell to the lofty heights of a circus tent meant to emulate walking the clouds, you'll feel like you've lived it all by the end of the book. The plot is well paced and will leave you breathless at certain points, while wishing you could freeze the story on a particularly beautiful scene at others. The characters are strong and unique, about as far from stock as you get. Thanks to the author's masterful storytelling, you form a relationship with them as you read that makes them all feel like family, even the ones you despise.<br /><br />If I had one criticism of the book, it would be that the ending fell a little flat for me. The book is so grandiose that I was expecting a bang at the end, when it really just quietly came to a conclusion. What happens makes sense, but it's a little bit disappointing that there wasn't one more dramatic revelation. It's like being on a roller coaster and going up that last hill, but instead of the final sharp descent, you just travel on an even track until the ride stops. But that's not enough for me to take anything away from my 5-star rating of the book.<br /><br />I listened to this as an audio book and I have to say it was a little difficult to follow the jumps in time since I couldn't just flip back a few pages to see the order of things. But the narrator, Jim Dale, once again proves why he's the best in the business. I highly recommend this format.<br /><br />In short, this is an incredible book that I will read over and over again, if only to escape from reality and hopefully learn to be a stronger writer from Morgenstern's enviable talent. I can't wait to see what she writes next.<br /><br />PS - This is the only book written in present tense I've ever read where I didn't notice it (and I HATE present tense books). I actually felt it was the only way the story could have been told. Bravo to the author for showing how this emerging trend can actually be useful.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a good fun game but I think that it should be easier to get coins and it's really entertaining
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great headset,read some people had issues with theirs but I have zero problem after two months of use. The item arrived well packaged and fast from the vendor. Highly recommend these headsets to anyone who want to play computer games or music at night without waking up the whole family.
B003VANOFY|1.0|These headsets have many disconnection and buzzing problems. There are threads, one with 18 pages of replies with customers having same problem on the official Logitech forum and not one response from a Logitech rep (while they frequently reply to other threads) - see for yourself: [...].  Problem happens on 2 different desktop PCs & 2 laptops.  Other wireless headset works perfectly for me (Razer Chimaera).    I bought these about a month and a half ago.  Gave them a quick test run, sounded fine.  Hadn't had chance to use them til a few days ago. Of course, past the 30 day return window, so now I'm stuck with these steaming pile of crap headphones.  I really which they worked well because they are comfortable and look cool.    -Constant buzzing/beeping.  -Sound distortions.  -Disconnections.    Also, for troubleshooting, I've tried:  -Re-installing the software.  -Making sure there are no other wireless devices nearby.  The closest one is a roku remote about 100 ft away in the living room.  -Tried on 2 different desktops, and 2 laptops.  Same thing.  -Tried my son's Razer Chimaeras wireless headset and they work perfectly (Spend the extra $ to buy these, you won't regret it).    I'm not going to waste time going through an RMA with this horrible company as I've read many others who have wasted their time RMA'ing this ended up with a new headset that did the same exact thing.  While a lot of people use these with no problem at all, many people do and Logitech does not provide the support it should for such an expensive headset.  My guess is, there's a lot of faulty g930's in circulation and the chances of you getting one are much higher than any other similar headset.    STAY AWAY FROM THESE!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is so AWESOME. I love it with the new version of this game. Get it!!!!!!!!! Please get this game. It will blow your mind.
B0090XJJTQ|5.0|This might not be the best thing to watch if you have a preconceived idea of Holmes and Watson from the books or the classic \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1939) with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. You do not want to besmirch the image.<br /><br />Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) in this presentation is just as observant as usual but is better informed of different disciplines that the original. He uses wily disguises and beautiful women to accomplish his goal of detecting and foiling the cunning bad guys. This looks like the pilot for a series or at least the beginning of a film series.<br /><br />Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is more of second Holms but a different set of bad habits. He saves Holmes' bacon several times. However, Watson wants to go his own way and settle down with his newfound love Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams.)<br /><br />This looks like the pilot for a series or at least the beginning of a film series.  Holmes is bantering with the insidious Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has recently risen from the dead and is determined to create a new world order.  Little does he know that they are all pawns in a larger scheme by \\"you know who.\\"  Oh, all right I will say it Professor Moriarty.<br /><br />This looks like the pilot for a series or at least the beginning of a film series.<br /><br />Keep watching as the final credits role by. It is nice to see that they tie the names of the character and the actors together with pictures of the characters. I cannot stand disembodies names scrolling by.

B00C6B9H46|4.0|You do not want to know too much about this movie ahead of time as the few places that are not predictable is all that it has. Here is all the standards, space rocks break ship, crashing decisions, survival of the ditziest. Throw in a few bugs-bats, other obscure toothy critters, and stick your head in a hole. To make this movie unique and give it a name you throw in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; darkness caused by (watch the movie and find out.).<br /><br />Not to sound snide, you can tell that a lot of time and money went into the project. They had to pick exotic Australian locations for the planet scene (thank goodness it was not Mars again). Those Vin Diesel eyes were experimental designed metal contacts. The orrery was a cute touch mixed with the otherwise hi-tech atmosphere. There is lots of action and even the obligatory waiting to be surprised did not drag out.<br /><br />If this is a shoot-um-up movie and an &quot;and then there were none&quot; movie, it is done well. If it was supposed to be a sci-fi movie, which should have a moral to it, then it was lost in the shoot-um-up scenes.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|this book held my interest to the point that i just had to get #2 after i finished this one
B00AQ5QB0W|5.0|The story is of a myth being fulfilled in a strange but seemingly familiar land. A land that was split asunder with the shattering of a great crystal. The reason for this is revealed in time. However we are concerned with a Gelffling that was charged with either healing the world or letting it live in evil for all time.<br /><br />This is a classic movie that can almost be placed in the cult class. I have watched several media versions and can say this is one film that is actually enhanced by the Blu-ray treatment.  True the acting is the same and the story is the same. But the visuals and music, which are equal partners with the rest of the characters, are more intense.<br /><br />Watching the Blu-ray extras, the voice over by conceptual designer Brian Froud, who also did the voice over for &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, we find that the title of this film might have been &quot;Dark Chrysalis&quot; as it is a movie about change.<br /><br />Take hart that they did not place a lot of coming attractions at the front of the DVD and that the Blu-ray extras sill do not get in the way of the film as some do.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005MEVQ Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth]]<br />[[ASIN:B000R8YC1S Labyrinth (Anniversary Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000EU1Q5E Jim Henson's the Storyteller - The Definitive Collection]]<br />[[ASIN:B000GFRI5E Jim Henson's Fantasy Film Collection - (Labyrinth / MirrorMask / The Dark Crystal)]]
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is totally awesome. I think that you people who can't download this game onto your kindle fire have an older, first generation Kindle Fire. That's the problem, all the new games are optimized for the Kindle Fires that were released on September 14, 2012. Also, I have a fire HD and it didn't take that long to download. Of course it's going to take a while because it's 180 megabytes, but not  10 hours. It took maybe 10 minutes at most for me. Also, the first gen Fire might need to be updated to a higher version so you can play the newer games. And for the person that got stuck at 91%, You might not have any space left.<br />Hope this helped.
B00C6F60TC|5.0|Ten years after the movie they have gone and done it. We now know how the genetic make-up of human beings. Some Job descriptions even say without consideration of age, race, religion or genetics. We also have electric cars and wrist radios. This is no longer sci-fi; it is speculative fiction. Or at least it is speculative. Anyway I have a friend that had a back problem in his youth. They left some dye in him and it was spotted during a job interview physical for a desk job; you guessed it.<br /><br />Anyway this is a spectacular film. The sound track helped support the movie. They did a good job of picking the actors. The characters were believable. Uma did not even have to show her Thurman's. Ethan did a convincing transformation and Jude was good enough that you almost thought the film was about him. The scenes were breath taking. I was most impressed with the sunrise on the solar panels and the swim competition.<br /><br />Two points to look for on your second viewing are:<br />1. Several times the brothers compete physically and logically. Even with his handicapped origin Ethan Hawke&quot; Vincent Freeman&quot; surpasses his brother Loren Dean  &quot;Anton.&quot;<br />2. Jude Law &quot;Jerome Eugene Morrow&quot; Was not without ambition.

B009AMANBA|1.0|I think they called this movie \\"Lincoln\\" to sell it. That is not what this is about. It's about the battle to pass the 13th Amendment and end the Civil War. Lincoln is just one of the players in that drama.<br /><br />I was told this wasn't a political movie. Not a political movie? That's EXACTLY what this is. It's about the politics then and politics now. If you'd rather avoid that, avoid this. It's revisionist history at its worst.<br /><br />The outdoor settings are LOVELY. The clothes and settings give it an authentic feel. I would have liked to have seen more of that. The acting is good, but it's forgetable. The actors aren't given much to do.<br /><br />I think the research for this movie was either very poorly done or so highly selective that it distorts so much. Day-Lewis does an awesome job of becoming Lincoln, but the lines and direction he was given is not a reflection of first-hand sources. If the main character is distorted, can the movie have much meaning? I mean Attorney Samuel C. Parks wrote \\"that for a man who was for the quarter of a century both a lawyer & a politician he was the most honest man I ever knew. He was not only morally honest but intellectually so - he could not reason falsely - if he attempted it he failed.\\" Jacob Bunn wrote, \\"Lincoln may have kept many things to himself, and in many matters it may be said he was secretive, but, whenever he did speak, he said what he really thought. He never dealt in double meanings or used language for the purpose of concealing his opinions\\" yet this movie depicts Lincoln as duplicitous, scheming, and conniving. I am frankly offended by that.<br /><br />The worst offense, however, is that the movie is just boring. It's two and half hours of blah, blah, blah. It doesn't move with any speed or interest.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen a movie about Lincoln. His life is a fascinating story. There is tragedy, success, heartbreak, the Civil War and assassination. Most of that is missing here.Even his death is very poorly done. It was as if they wanted to NOT focus on what happened or the loss that so many felt. Really big mistake. This is a wreck of a movie. I am glad I didn't buy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun because it doesn't have any locked items so you don't need to buy anything. I like it because you can have as many horses as you want. If you want a friend put in 20krux or kacie. Hope you enjoy it because I do.

B000E5N6LG|5.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some brief thoughts on Wyatt Earp...<br /><br />Wyatt Earp (1994) is a Western that stars Kevin Costner and always gets compared to Tombstone (1993).  Kevin Costner was supposed to be involved in Tombstone, but ended up not being involved due to creative differences, basically.  He then set out to make his own Wyatt Earp-based movie.  Tombstone came out six months before Wyatt Earp.  As a result, by the time Wyatt Earp was released in theaters, audiences didn't really want to see a movie with basically the same story as Tombstone, so Wyatt Earp tanked at the box office.  While Tombstone is a little over two hours long, Wyatt Earp is over three hours long.  A typical Costner movie - looooonnnnnggggg.  This, however, doesn't detract from the movie necessarily.  The pacing is well done.  The movie has some boring parts for the first 30-45 minutes, but the action does pick up later on in the movie.  While Tombstone is arguably more entertaining and Hollywood-esque, Wyatt Earp is more serious and darker all around, yet still holds my interest.  Wyatt Earp focuses on the life story of Wyatt Earp from the beginning, whereas Tombstone does not.  Dennis Quaid plays the role of Doc Holliday in Wyatt Earp in a gritty, serious way and does a great job.  Val Kilmer plays Holliday in Tombstone and also does a great job, but his take was lighter and more humorous.  I like both interpretations.  Kevin Costner plays the Wyatt Earp role, while Kurt Russell plays the role in Tombstone.  Both actors did a great job.  Gene Hackman has a role in Wyatt Earp as well and does a great job.<br /><br />What it all comes down to is personal taste.  I reviewed Tombstone and gave it 5 stars.  Here I'm reviewing Wyatt Earp and giving it 5 stars as well.  Two movies that are different from one another.  If I'm in the mood for a certain version of the Wyatt Earp/Doc Holliday story, I'll just watch the movie I'm in the mood for.  Both are great movies.<br /><br />The strengths of Wyatt Earp are the beautiful scenery, the musical score, the quality of the acting, the action sequences, the epic feel to it, and the overall cinematography.<br /><br />Wyatt Earp is one of those movies that got buried at the box office when it was released but has gained in stature and is much more appreciated with the passage of time.  In my opinion, this is a criminally underrated movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend Wyatt Earp.strengths of Wyatt Earp are the beautiful scenery, the musical score, the quality of the acting, the action sequences, the epic feel to it, and the overall cinematography.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is perfect for me: weird stuff, well acted, humanity, comedy, and good production value and writing. Anna Torv is definitely a discovery; whether she's doing Olivia, Fauxlivia, or Belly, she's a consummate performer. John Noble and Josh Jackson had to be the best comedy team on television during their run. Walter always has me in stitches. Lance Reddick is always an imposing presence. Jasika Nicole is a great foil for all that goes on in the plot.

B005DJREJS|5.0|We are soooo addicted it's silly.  What a cute series!  We highly recommend it. Interestingly -- as a 68-year old sociologist looking at this series, what jumps out is that the school will tolerate the protagonist's verbal behavior.  This is an example of how tolerated unruly behavior raises the U.S. school system's acceptance of behavior that it would not have accepted in earlier decades.

B000GY729M|3.0|Sam's Town is the killers weakest albums. You have to get used to it and listen to it multiple times for you to get used to it and even like some of the songs. It takes a different direction then Hot Fuss there isn't much of the dance pop rock that Hot Fuss had instead we get more of a rock album. The only reason i give it 3 stars is because i had to listen to this album multiple times to get used to it and once you do your still not very satisfied.

On Battle Born The Killers do sound a little different then any of their previous albums and we can all face it they will never be another \\"Hot Fuzz\\" album. The killers have always sounded different in all their albums which is always in my opinion a good thing to do as a band. In Battle Born the killers sound mature and still deliver some catchy tunes and is one thing i love about this band.

B000009HF2|5.0|The immense commercial success of Frampton Comes Alive (1976), the top selling album of 1976, came as a complete surprise to many.  In a decade where artists who toiled in relative obscurity often unexpectedly found quick success, Peter Frampton meteoric rise to stardom, might be the most remarkable, although he did not go on to have the career he might have had.<br /><br />Originally released on vinyl as a double album, Frampton Comes Alive captures the energy of Peter Frampton's music live, in a set that features the guitarist devoting significant time to playing both electric and acoustic guitar.  Powered by the single \\"Show Me the Way\\" with Frampton's distinctive \\"talk box\\" guitar, and the dreamy \\"Baby I Love Your Way\\", Frampton invaded AM airwaves.  While on the FM band \\"(I'll Give You) Money\\", and the tour de force \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\", also got significant play.<br /><br />Prior to this release, the Frampton had produced four solo records, that earned him a solid fan base, but the ex-Humble Pie guitarist was nowhere near stardom.  In 1975 Kiss made a similar breakout, with their live album [[ASIN:B000001EL1 Kiss Alive]], where the songs were played at a faster tempo than the studio records, injecting a whole new energy into the band's music.  Frampton's albums had some similar issues, where the energy of the music, was not being adequately captured in the studio.<br /><br />Those issues were mostly resolved in the concert environment, as before an audience, Frampton's music did actually \\"come alive\\", as the tempo picked up, and his guitar playing, became more of a focus.  The tone of Frampton's Les Paul guitar wasn't exactly overpowering, but the album is a showcase for his improvisational skills.  Frampton displays his hard rocking side on songs like \\"Money\\", and \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\".  His interpretation of the Stones' \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" reaches its full realization, when performed live, in a way the studio version never did.  The acoustic and mid-tempo numbers provide balance, and affirm Frampton's talents as a melodic songwriter.<br /><br />Along with musicians Bob Mayo, John Siomos, and Stanley Sheldon, Frampton Comes Alive stands as a shining example of 70's hard rock.  With Mayo switching between playing keyboards and guitar, the music has a very full sound, with just the four musicians.  The album consists of tracks recorded at various venues, and like many live albums from back in the vinyl days, the tracks were rearranged to fit on the sides on a record.  The album still seems to flow smoothly, and sounds like a cohesive performance, building momentum after the acoustic section, and finishing strongly with the 14 minute opus, \\"Do You Feel Like We Do?\\".<br /><br />Although Frampton became a megastar with what was mostly a hard rocking album, that kind of music apparently wasn't where his heart was.  A talented songwriter, Frampton's singing voice was adequate, but wasn't really suited to heavy rock.  His eventual follow up album, [[ASIN:B00004VW2P I'm In You]] (1977), pretty much retained his same old studio sound, and featured slowly paced songs that lacked energy.  While the album sold well, it furthered the opinion held by some, that Frampton was a mediocre talent, who just got very lucky.<br /><br />Tempered by some bad fortune, and questionable career moves, notably the movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Peter Frampton may not have become what he could have been, but Frampton Comes Alive still stands as a high point in his musical career.  In 1976, Frampton's bare chest and flowing locks were a factor in his appeal, however the music definitely had substance, and has stood the test of time quite well.

When it arrived at my house I put it in the DVD rack, shortly after Xmas I found the time to finally watch it again, and when I tried to play the movie it did not play AT ALL it was a black screen. The dvd itself was not right it didnt have a label or anything. It did have some sound but very poor quality it was all scratchy and would cut in and out. There was no menu or anything. I am VERY disappointed by this purchase. I am really upset I paid for a new DVD and they sent me a burned copy of crap!

B0012HRJEA|1.0|The director of this film, Baz Luhrmann, imagined how Shakespeare himself might have directed Romeo and Juliet as a movie, based on the idea that plays in Shakespeare's time competed against coarse entertainments such as bear baiting and prostitution.  The thought was provocative, but the result was a film that is, in my opinion, a mess.<br /><br />The first problem, revealed fairly quickly, is that the film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  The opening sequence in which the \\"Montague Boys\\" meet the \\"Capulet Boys\\" at the gas station might as well be a comic book.  It's shot very much like a music video, and takes the film in a definite slapstick, comic direction that is almost immediately reversed as the film progresses.  There's a good deal of humor in the play, but to go as far over the top as Luhrmann did was counterproductive.<br /><br />The second, and ultimately greater, problem is the actors' inability to handle the language. There are fine actors in this cast who have done excellent work elsewhere, but in this film many of them seem to do the equivalent of speaking a foreign language phonetically without actually knowing what they are saying.  John Leguizamo, Leonardo di Caprio, Claire Danes, and Harold Perrineau all suffer from this, or at least are the cast members who are most conspicuous.  This is a problem for audience members who do understand the language, as the way the lines are spoken will drive such audience members crazy.  It creates a different problem for audience members not familiar with Shakespeare, as they won't understand what is being said any more than the cast members who are saying it.<br /><br />The only two actors whose command of the language stands out are Pete Postlethwaite as \\"Father\\" Lawrence, and Miriam Margolyes as the Nurse.  To indicate the difference in training between the U.S. and Britain, Ms. Margolyes is an English actress who absolutely convinces as a Hispanic maid.<br /><br />All of these problems come to a head in the most important scene in the film, in which Mercutio is killed by Tybalt, who is in turn killed by Romeo.  Blow this scene, and you pretty much blow the whole play.  This movie really blew this scene, and that was that.<br /><br />Good idea by Mr. Luhrmann, but it didn't work.  It really missed the mark.
B007F5S1B8|5.0|This album is packed with hits. Like any album, you've got to hear it more than once to get the full grasp of its meaning. Songs like &#34;The Boy With the Thorn in his side&#34; and &#34;Frankly Mr. Shankly&#34; make the album exciting. This album 'll get you pumped in the morning. Morissey's voice and and the melodies created with the guitar are incredible. I definitely recommend this album.
0307279189|5.0|A friend recommended this when I came down with shin splints a few months after running.<br /><br />I'm not a runner, I'm a guy who runs.  In this case to train for a mud run.  But I also love to read.<br /><br />Born to Run is a great story and will please both runners and those just looking for a great story with some truth to it.<br /><br />Reading the book didn't change the technical aspect of my running (other than freeing me from feeling guilty about not wanting to spend alot on expensive running shoes).<br /><br />It did tremendously change my philosophy about running and really helped support me enjoying my runs rather than just treating them like a challenge to overcome.<br /><br />I've given it as a gift to friends and they've enjoyed it as well -- its worth every penny.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The story of The Life of Pi is relatively simple and yet, rather profound as well.  The basic story revolves around Pi, the main character, relating his story to a writer, about his experiences relating to a journey taken in a lifeboat with his &#34;friends&#34; after a storm destroyed the ship he was on with his family while journeying to America.  Since describing this film with too much detail in a review would rob another of the opportunity to simply experience this movie, I don't really want to say much more here.  Besides, if you really want to know, simply go to one of the movie review sites.  I just want to give my own general impressions here without the detail.<br /><br />There are many who have found The Life of Pi either tedious and over-long or else object to the over-emphasis on &#34;religion&#34; and spirituality.  While I never found it tedious or dull, I did not buy into the &#34;spiritual&#34; bent of the movie either.  But you don't have to &#34;buy-in&#34; to that aspect of the movie in order to enjoy it.  After all, you are an observer and a fellow traveler with Pi and his &#34;boat-mate(s)&#34;. Again, it is the experience that counts here; not that you have to agree with the beliefs of the main character.<br /><br />Let me just say here that I am a wannabe 3D artist.  The 3D CG work in this film surpasses anything I have seen to date, including Avatar which I also loved.  I've enjoyed many other 3D works such as Toy Story, etc, but The Life of Pi is, as they say, in a league all it's own when it comes to the CG work.  I simply would not have believed this depth of realism was even possible and I'm directly involved in it!  It is this very sense of realism that brings this film to life and puts you in the boat and elsewhere with Pi.  Absolutely masterful work.<br /><br />The Life of Pi is rated PG.  I have raised 5 kids and I don't think I would want to bring younger kids to this movie.  It is simply too intense for most younger children, in my opinion.  I really think that PG13 would have probably been more appropriate.  That, of course, depends on the maturity of each child.  Some younger kids could handle it just fine.  Like all such things, you've just got to know your kids.  Just be warned before plunking one of your little ones down in front of this.<br /><br />The Life of Pi is not a perfect film and certainly has it's flaws.  I found the ending particularly confusing and even a bit frustrating. I won't tell you why because that would give too much away.  But for me, at least, that was it's greatest and most serious flaw.  Yes, the religious mumbo jumbo was a little much sometimes.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It provided me with a movie-going experience that I will never forget.  I can't say that about too many films any more.opinion.  I really think that PG13 would have probably been more appropriate.  That, of course, depends on the maturity of each child.

B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I would've given this five stars and wish I still could but half naughty the game it asked me to pay to continue. Uh... no...I.had already ready  paid for what the advertised as the full game.  When you tap the already paid option...it just takes you to the same payment screen.  This sucks cause it seemed pretty cool.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I don't know how theses book could ever be made into a movie but I have enjoyed reading them. I think some books are better left to your mind's eye and not put on the big screen.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's List is based on a true story that occurred during the Holocaust.  Leading up to and during World War II Jews living within Nazi occupied areas that were not sent to concentration camps were often forced to work as slave labor in many military and non-military capacities.<br />This story is about the approximately 1100 Jews that were sent as forced labor to work in a factory owned by Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic and greedy Czechoslovakian businessman and a member of the Nazi party.  Unlike the majority of Nazi party members Schindler did not have a particular animosity toward the Jews.  Schindler's interest was in being a powerful and wealthy businessman.  Being a member of the Nazi party and using Jewish slave labor was a means to an end for him.  Schindler's lack of humanity was due in part to the prevalent feelings of anti-semitism that were widespread in Europe prior to World War II (as in other times) and also due to Schindler's lack of personal contact with the Jews that were being persecuted.  It was this personal contact during their internment as his labor force that broadened Schindler's view of the Jews and of the reality of Nazi propaganda, and their final solution to exterminate the Jewish race.  Even though Schindler's eyes opened to the evils of the Nazis, there was little he could do under the Nazi rule to change the fate of the 1100 Jews who would ultimately be sent to the concentration camp, Auschwitz, and exterminated.  Now with a new moral compass and using the same business acumen that had brought him his wealth, Schindler arranges to buy the Jews in his factory from the Germans in order to save them from death.  Under the guise of wanting to move them to a factory in his hometown, Schindler uses his personal fortune to purchase as many Jews as he can afford.  This subterfuge is not easy and he must use all his wits to save a group of Jewish women and children that are accidentally sent to Auschwitz.<br />Even though this storyis told through a single individual's view of the Holocaust, it represents the mindset of the time throughout much of the world.  Prior to the Holocaust anti-semitism and prejudice towards Jews was common and widespread but in most places the violence against Jews was sporadic and killing Jews was not systematic.  Jews had been used as scapegoats throughout their history.<br />Most people were unaware of the events of the Holocaust until after the war was over.  For those that did hear about the enslavement and mass killings of millions during the war years, most could not believe that it was possible.<br />The final realization of the Holocaust lead Jews in the pursuit to gain their own homeland, Israel, and to becoming much less likely to let anti-semitism stand without challenge.

Please dont think its a Xmas movie, its a movie for all seasons and you can watch it any time. Absolutely amazing movie!!!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Either mine disintergrated like everyone else talks about, or the cat chewed on it in one spot. To be truthful, I can't tell. I don't see little bite marks, but it kinda looks 'chewed'.  So, I didn't feel right to say it was faulty since it was a couple of years old. I spent the 9 bucks and bought the replacement.<br /><br />It's been fine for the month I've had it so far.

B0095XPZBC|5.0|ThoughI have TNG on DVD, the transfomration and hard work put to have the show upgraded to 1080p is fantastic. The colors and the details especially for FX models/planet shots are sharp and very in your face loo how great it looks now.  I highly recommend getting the blu-rays. The 30 minute special on how they transformed TNG helps you appreciate the efforts to make a great product.
0140067477|5.0|A good introduction to Taoism made easily accessible through the Winnie the Pooh we all know and love. Definitely a recommended read to anyone interested in seeing the world a little bit more clearly; the follow up Te of Piglet is also a useful extension/companion to this.

B00B8WXFWE|3.0|I never liked NKOTB when I was a kid and they were huge.  I did not get into pop music like that until I was in my mid to late 20's--weird, I know.  So, back in the day when my friends had NKOTB sheets, lunch pails, etc, I was not into it.  I always thought Jordan Knight was cute but beyond that I didn't care one way or the other about them or their music although their talent was not something that could be denied.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2008 with the release of The Block and 30-yr-old me who now likes pop music.  I heard one single and thought it was kind of catchy so I figured I would take a chance and buy the album.  I bought the deluxe version and it blew my damn skirt up Marilyn Monroe style, it was so good.  I then decided to go see the concert when they came through L.A. and I am not going to lie, it was easily one of the absolute best shows I had ever seen and I have been to many, many concerts in my time.  Completely blew me away and at that point I was a fan.<br /><br />Since that day I have been desperately waiting for them to tour again and it has finally come around with the release of the new album \\"10.\\"  Unfortunately the best thing about the new album is the fact that we are getting a tour out of it.<br /><br />The Block was a stellar album.  Every song was distinct, none of it sounded the same, each song could easily be distinguished from the next, it was an overall tight, well-produced piece of work and they showcased their talent with a lot of harmonizing--even after all these years the guys can still hit those high notes and work well off of one other.  The only criticism I can even think of would be that The Block was all about the sex--which, by the way, was fine by me, but it bothered some reviewers.<br /><br />So now we have 10, which is all about the love, insecurity, heartbreak and breaking up.  Seems like it would be more inspired and deep than the previous album which was all about the sex, but it's not.  Sadly the album 10, for me anyway, has that \\"blurred\\" feel in which all of the songs sound kind of similar and although I have listened to the album at least ten times or more there are only three songs that stand out to me in any way: \\"We Own Tonight\\" (which I can't seem to listen to enough), \\"Miss You More\\" (although Donnie's little rap segment is kind of humorous and should have been left out) and \\"Jealous (Blue)\\" which I find to be an interesting song that touches on feelings I think a lot of people have in the beginning of a relationship whether they admit it or not--pretty relatable.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are just a haze of the same thing over and over and covered in a light cheesecloth--tunes that are somewhere between being ballads and...not-quite-ballads, with only one song being downright bad (The Whisper--blech) and one semi-dance song being half awful and half great (Crash) and one dancey song about an ugly duckling-turned swan which is fun and different than the rest.  I need to mention as well that I am not sure why there is such an utter lack of harmonizing here when these guys are so great at it.  If you have talent it seems it should be put out there but in this case it's not.  A couple of segments in The Block give me goosebumps on my left leg when I hear them...nothing like that here, folks.<br /><br />Overall 10 is harmless but I did not want something harmless, I wanted more than that.  At least we are getting a tour out of it, so I guess even if I find 10 to be mediocre I am still glad it's here.nyway, has that \\"blurred\\" feel in which all of the songs sound kind of similar and although I have listened to the album at least ten times or more there are only three songs that stand out to me in any way: \\"We Own Tonight\\" (which I can't seem to listen to enough), \\"Miss You More\\" (although Donnie's little rap segment is kind of humorous and should have been left out) and \\"Jealous (Blue)\\" which I find to be an interesting song that touches on feelings I think a lot of people have in the beginning of a relationship whether they admit it or not--pretty relatable.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are just a haze of the same thing over and over and covered in a light cheesecloth--tunes that are somewhere between being ballads and...not-quite-ballads, with only one song being downright bad (The Whisper--blech) and one semi-dance song being half awful and half great (Crash) and one dancey song about an ugly duckling-turned swan which is fun and different than the rest.

0143122916|4.0|This book is about the extraordinary life of Shin Dong-hyuk, who was born and raised inside a camp for political prisoners in the mountains of North Korea. He was serving a life sentence because of the sins of his parents. He did not know what his mother had done to deserve such a sentence, but his father had committed the unforgivable crime of having two brothers who had defected to South Korea. He was brought up a slave in a world where rape, the brutalization and killing of prisoners including children is the norm. He knew nothing about love, friendship or family bonds and his desire to escape was fueled by two short lived friendships with two political prisoners. One he met when he was thirteen the other at the time of his escape. The story also covers his time in China, South Korea and America. This is more than an escape story, it is the tale of the brutalization of a child and his battle to come to terms with his past and his attempt to adapt to the western way of life.<br />Although the number of North Koreans defecting is growing and our media is reporting more and more about the human rights abuses in the country, Shin Dong-hyuk is thought to be the first person to escape from one of these camps.  It is estimated there are two hundred thousand people living as slaves in camps like this in North Korea in unimaginable conditions and this is the only book to my knowledge that covers these camps. On one level this is a book about the worst aspects of human nature, but it is also a book about an emotionally scarred man who is trying to rise above the dehumanization of his childhood to become a caring human being and help others who have been traumatized in North Korea. In that sense, it is a book about the triumph of the spirit.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I was browsing through the directory when I came across this.  Something caught my attention and I decided to watch.  I would highly recommend.  This is a great movie.  Very well done.

B008XCM18Q|5.0|If you have never seen the movie then you will love this book. The beginning of it all and how the training comes back to Jason as events unfold that puts you on the edge of your seat. Tricks of the trade begin to come together to protect him while getting him out of tight spots. Don't start reading this book if you have to go to work soon or you will be late.

B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|French electronic artist M83 contributing a musical score to a somber &#34;dead Earth&#34; storyline sounds like perfection to me. After visionary director Joseph Kosinski's collaboration with Daft Punk (yet another brilliant French electronic musical duo) on his previous film &#34;Tron: Legacy&#34;, he proved himself as being equally concerned with the soundtrack as the visuals. A &#34;good&#34; soundtrack services all necessary requirements of the film it is designed for, but a BRILLIANT soundtrack can stand on its own when listened to independently from the film. I believe M83's &#34;Oblivion&#34; score does the latter quite brilliantly!

B00BCOGM78|5.0|While I love everything Clutch puts out, every 3rd or 4th album they re-invent themselves (or un-invent themselves, however you look at it). Earth Rocker is pure hard rock. Neil's vocals and lyrics are phenomenal and almost make you forget the incredible music that's going on behind him until you notice.... All in all every track makes me feel, and what more can you ask from an album. My hat is off to you Clutch, keep doing what you do.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the best romantic trilogy I've ever read.  I'm glad that at the end you included  Christain's thoughts when he first met Anatasia.  It was obvious that he was attracted to her, but what was he thinking?  So, I was glad you included that at the end of the triology.  Love your writing E.L. James.

0316228532|5.0|I'm writing this several months after reading it, so my memory won't allow me to make a very detailed review.<br /><br />This book was simply deafening in its relevance and captivating in its style. Jo's description of the problems of wider society and the human heart were dead on, and the descriptions she used to share this with her audience punctuated that accuracy with even more force. Her skill in this takes my breath away.<br /><br />It is a very dark novel, and those who have trouble with those kinds of stories probably won't enjoy reading it, but they will have to admit Jo's unstoppable talent nonetheless. However, if you are able to find the value in a book that poignantly and truthfully describes our would as the horrific dwelling it truly is, then you will adore this tragedy.<br /><br />This is very, very different from Harry Potter, but since it was never intended to be like it, it is unfair to disparage Jo simply because you want more of Harry - or something like him - and you didn't get it. Instead, judge the novel for what it is and what it tries to do. Also, you may not say it is bad because it is depressing. You may say you didn't like it, but believe something is bad simply because it is bleak. Stories with devastating endings can be good if they are done right. This one was.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|Yes, it's hollywood, but it's based on a true story and it's a good movie.  The clips at the climax of the story of Mavericks are incredible.  You have to be a bit nuts to go out in that, but the photography is very well done.  It's not a Great movie, but it's a very good movie.
1400069289|5.0|I'm not done with the book but I've learned a lot of very good information about how habits work, how to form new ones and replace bad ones, and identifying cues of bad habits in order to avoid them or prepare to respond differently when they're encountered. I don't know if there's anything revolutionary or ground breaking here but it helped me see it all in a different light and realize how much habits affect my life.

B00A2JTEHY|1.0|This 40 CD box was supposed to be a serious contender among the Wagner bicentenary box offerings, but the contents as a whole are a disgrace. I suppose as one of the world's largest classical music distributors, Sony had to offer SOMETHING, but this box should have never seen the light of day. To be fair, as current keepers of the old Columbia and RCA Victor vaults, Sony inherited catalogues painfully light on Wagner, and in the case of Columbia, with little or no opera at all from the decades of the '50's and '60's. But it is misleading and unethical to call what they present here \\"Great Recordings.\\" Let me state unequivocally and for the record that NONE of the 8 operas presented here can by any stretch of the imagination be called \\"great\\"! Indeed, most have serious flaws. What really provoked my ire  and finally pushed me out of my listening chair long enough to write this was the very recent announcement of their Verdi box. It is clear from these two dreadful offerings that the people at Sony have little or no understanding of the operatic catalogues at their disposal.<br /><br />How can you hope to honor Wagner's accomplishment with this box as it doesn't even contain all 10 operas from his mature canon? TANNHAEUSER is missing. But their inability to find a TRISTAN as well should have stopped this effort in its tracks. DG in their superlative box went through the trouble and expense of licensing no fewer than three recordings from outside sources in order to present Wagner's entire output. Sony just simply scraped together anything with the name \\"Wagner\\" on it and dumped it on unsuspecting buyers. THIRTEEN of the CD's are filled with little more than snips and bits. \\"Great Recordings\\" indeed!<br /><br />The DUTCHMAN in this box is one of James Levine's least successful Wagner readings. It is slow, heavy-handed and with a fatal casting flaw. Although still early Wagner, DUTCHMAN makes serious demands of both leading roles and neither is optimally handled here. The best singers for the title role have all been (not surprisingly) Wotan's, and Adam, Bailey, Hale, Hotter and London all come to mind. So, Morris should have been a good Dutchman, but instead we listen to him maneuvering his voice around the notes, sometimes uncomfortably and with unattractive results. \\"wie aus der Ferne\\" in Act 2 is almost painful. The rest of the cast isn't awful, but between Levine and Morris this isn't something one wants to repeat very often.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, there is no TANNHAEUSER in this box. LOHENGRIN is, I believe, the one sole Wagner opera RCA recorded by itself (twice) the first time--and at great expense--with the BSO and Leinsdorf. (The second recording, conducted by the late Sir Colin Davis, is only worth mentioning for Ben Heppner's fine Lohengrin.) The cast was to have included Leontyne Price as Elsa, but she dropped out. Her replacement was Lucine Amara, best recalled as Beecham's Musetta in his classic BOHEME. In reviewing this LOHENGRIN for HIGH FIDELITY, C.L.O. said that Amara sounded like \\"Micaela got lost and found herself in Antwerp!\\" The voice was small, hard and very focused, but with little if any distinction. Konya was a solid Lohengrin. I saw him (with Crespin as Elsa) at the Old MET in early '64, about a year before this recording was made. He was a good Parsifal as well. My only problem with him was his tendency to punctuate phrases with little glottal \\"gasps\\" which seemed more appropriate to the Italian repertoire. You can hear him in much better company in the '59 Bayreuth set on Orfeo. After giving us a fiery Amneris and a regal Fricka, Rita Gorr should have been a superb Ortrud (as indeed she was on the Bayreuth set I just mentioned) but her work here is poor. It's like witnessing a disaster hearing her hurl her voice at \\"fahr Heim\\" in Act 3. William Dooley as Telramund was WAY out of his league.<br /><br />The MEISTERSINGER in this box is one of my favorites, if not among the greatest. It enshrines the best pair of lovers in Jess Thomas and Claire Watson that I have heard. Thomas was my Heldentenor of choice in the '60's-'70's and his Stolzing, Parsifal and Lohengrin were without peer. Indeed, it was my very great joy to be in the audience at the Old MET on December 11, 1962 when Thomas made his debut there as Stolzing. The American soprano Claire Watson graced absolutely everything she ever did, and that includes this warm, lovely, feminine Eva. If you want something more \\"girlish\\" then there's Schwarzkopf, Gueden and Donath. But Watson is my one and only, true Eva, with Elisabeth Gruemmer, a very similar voice, not far behind in the Kempe set. The rest of the cast is mixed. Foremost is Benno Kusche's classic Beckmesser, but he's heard at his best in that fine Kempe set I just mentioned from '56 which EMI should restore to their catalogue. Hotter is a bit wooly as Pogner, but the real drawback for many will be Otto Wiener's Sachs. I saw Wiener on stage at least twice and he had a fine presence, handsome, kindly and humane. Alas, this cannot translate into what we have in aural terms and his voice will be a problem for many. Keilberth does a fine job, and the sound is superb. A dreadful pity that neither Eurodisc nor Sony has been able to fit the entirety of Act 1 on a single CD as it's technically possible.<br /><br />There is no TRISTAN in this box, and before a few (brief!) comments on THE RING I have to deal with this horrible PARSIFAL. Many of the rather vocal proponents of this set seem blissfully unaware that the first 25 minutes or so are acutally from an entirely different performance! Others have caught on, but no one seems to care! What you are hearing at first is an extract from the '59 Bayreuth Festival, and the voices are those of Jerome Hines, Martha Moedl and Eberhard Waechter. Moedl's last words are \\"fort, fort, ins Bad\\" and Hoengen takes up with \\"sind die Tiere hier\\". This alone should have excluded this set from being issued, but there's more. Hoengen is way past her prime, and is just terrible. And it was sheer lunacy to split Kundry between Hoengen and Ludwig in the first place. If you want Hotter's Gurnemanz, then simply go to the '62 Philips set. (And, for another treat, get the '54 Bayreuth set where Hotter sings Amfortas. He's a revelation!) Here he's terribly overmiked and we can hear that he's being very audibly prompted. Hans Beirer sang Parsifal at Bayreuth in 1960, but I think that Uhl was a better choice here even if his light voice isn't up to the role's demands. Now we come to the ONLY reason to ever listen to this set, Ludwig's Kundry in the second scene of Act 2. She may have been the greatest Kundry ever. But why, in God's name, not simply get the Solti set where she sings the role gloriously, with Kollo a fine partner in the confrontation of Act 2, bathed in Decca's magnificent VPO??? Berry and Waechter are fine. But, as a whole, this set is a mess. I guess the magic name of \\"Karajan\\" was enough to rope in a few buyers. I have it just as another PARSIFAL in my collection.<br /><br />The Janowski/Eurodisc RING in this box is all the rage now, and priced at, what, a little more than $20, I can see why. This is neither great nor poor Wagner conducting: it's professional and efficient with no \\"interpretive\\" axes to grind, beautifully played by one of Germany's finest orchestras and very well recorded. Now, there are 34 roles in THE RING and it's unreasonable to assume that all of them will be well sung in any single set. Indeed, the only RING I can recall which is consistently well sung throughout is the '55 Bayreuth set from Testament. And, that says as much for the kind of voices that were easily available at that time as it does for the ability of the Wagner grandsons to employ them. Here, there are the usual pros and cons. But, we have Adam's Wotan, here more mature and in darker voice than he was with Boehm. He's maybe a bit less secure on top, but in the final analysis, more imposing. Rene Kollo was just beginning his foray into the Wagner heavies of Tristan and Siegfried. Now I know there are a lot of people who have never liked Kollo. I have always liked him, and his Siegfried is one of my favorites. He sounds young and the voice is seldom strained. The one big problem I have always had with this RING is Altmeyer's Bruennhilde. Mind you, this is NOT a question of \\"poor\\" singing. On the contrary, the voice itself is often lovely and intelligently used. What is at fault here is the absence of vocal weight. Compare, if you will, Altmeyer's work side by side with that of Nilsson or Varnay and the best way to describe Altmeyer is almost grotesque. A sheer \\"command\\" of the music is almost completely missing. And if you already have this RING listen to the opening scene with Ruth Falcon singing the Third Norn. Now THAT is a Bruennhilde!<br /><br />If you've managed all this to the end, here's my final take on this box. As an ENTITY it's simply a bad deal. You can buy separately the two elements that I think are reasonably worthwhile (MEISTERSINGER and THE RING) for something like $40. Why pay twice that and get little else of value? If you do want all of Wagner's mature output plus RIENZI, then there's the EMI set with a lot of really good things in it. I purchased it for $47 including shipping from AMAZON.UK. I don't know how many of these boxes Sony has produced. If they were wise, not many. If it's discontinued and can be had for $40-45 the choice is yours. But you'll have to think long and hard about what value this box in toto represents.<br /><br />UPDATE. Just a few words, and I am at fault for not updating sooner as I knew about this correction as soon as I purchased this box myself. SONY has indeed corrected the beginning of PARSIFAL, and in the only possible way they could: from a private radio taping of the broadcast, as the original ORF tape was damaged (erased, I am told!) However, it should be clear from my comments that I do NOTthink this is a worthwhile PARSIFAL: Hotter is heard better elsewhere, Uhl isn't a terribly good Parsifal even if the voice is basically pleasing, and giving Kundry to 2 singers was sheer foolishness. If for some reason you haven't yet heard Ludwig \\"in toto\\" PLEASE get a hold of the Solti set.<br /><br />Finally, when this box was new SONY was asking nearly $100 for it. I said that if the price was lowered, it might be attractive to some purchasers. The price has indeed lowered, A LOT. I paid $45 for it and a few reputable sellers on AMAZON are letting it go for $25, which gives you everything else here for the price of the Janowski RING alone. It also means that the box is being WITHDRAWN, so for $25, if you are so inclined, you'd better act fast.
B006Z1XY7E|4.0|Gotye caught my attention at the Grammy's and does not disappoint on this album even though it is not going to appeal to everyone. I would give it a trial first and see if your type of music.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This was a beautiful movie with stunning effects. It didn't exactly follow the book so if you are a stickler for that you might be a tad disappointed. However, the movie is worth watching and I highly recommend. We were happy we watched it.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This group is a real sleeper but excellent on the vocals and arrangements. The Grammy's just confirmed the talent that I had already appreciated through their earlier releases.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I expected much from the author who was asked to fill the large shoes Robert Jordan left behind and I was not disappointed. The Way of the Kings is a gripping novel, filled with a world and characters that blossom in front of you. As war rages outside the characters search to find their place and bearing in the uncertainty surrounding them. I found the characters compelling and endearing. Within a few short pages, I wanted to find out more about them. I encourage anyone who enjoys a good epic fantasy to give this a try.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is definitely the best book I've ever read, it has a great hook at the end of each chapter and is so descriptive! Although it is a very good book it is also violent and I suggest that more mature people should read it. The Hunger Games is a must-read!
B0053F03MM|5.0|Interesting concept, like Matt Damon's Adjustment Bureau and Tom Cruises' Minority Report.  All deal with the manipulation of time.  Makes one wonder about our knowledge of reality.  Excellent film.

B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have watched this series for years and the story lines keep getting better. I love how the team interacts with each other.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|I liked the app the first time I used it.  However, I didn't know is that it is a one use only before you are forced to pay for it.  I'm pretty sure that I am going to pay for the full app but a warning would have been nice.<br /><br />Overall it was what I was looking for in a daily fitness app, it has a nice variety of exercises and is straightforward to use.  One thing I would improve is the description of the proper form for each exercise, but that is a minor critique.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I was a bit concerned because I did buy these as a used set. I use them almost every day for transporting my videos off my contour.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The chapters were creatively written. It doesn't take long to get an idea of the purpose of the book, but the telling and weaving of the story surpasses this. The characters fit into the story believably.
B0091QS88K|4.0|As a fourteen year old girl, I can easily say that I play Dr.panda's games more than my younger siblings. Definitely worth the download.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I saw the movie first and then read the book.  I enjoyed both, but thought the book was better.  The movie helped me visualize the book better, so it helped.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is a fun game that could end up costing you more than just a little time.  Yes, they give you the first 40 coins in a carnival like game similar to the type that they actually use.  However, once the trial coins are used up.... you then are given the option to purchase more coins and this could lead to addiction for some people. If you are patient you can obtain coins one at a time after the time on the clock expires (anywhere from 6-20 seconds).  However, it is hard to be patient and if you are like me you want more coins in a hurry.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Great movie. My husband has watched it 1-2 times every weekend since we got it. Yesterday he was doing chores and I heard the music from the beginning fire up and I was like &#34;SERIOUSLY?&#34; but it is a great movie to watch and great as background.

B005LAII80|5.0|This film, while an adaptation, gets the character 100%; it's probably the most faithful translation of a comic character into live-action - on a par with Jackie Earle Haley's Rorshach.<br /><br />Unfortunately the dire shadow of the 1995 film could not be expelled - its tarnishing of the brand back in the 90's and in the interim due to its continual rotation on cable and video, damaged the current film's box-office potential with a wider audience last year but, it's become apparent that due to the constant retail sales that have out-sold its box-office numbers and the overwhelmingly favourable reviews among fans and non-fans, that this film is in no regard a flop nor an artistic failure, it's a triumph.<br /><br />I highly recommend it and to quote Judge Dredd's original co-creator and writer: \\"There's nothing in the film that isn't Judge Dredd\\".
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover is well designed, moderately priced and does an excellent job of protecting the tablet. I find the strap particularly useful for one-handed support.

B005LAIGSM|2.0|This movie is nothing like the book.  The main message was missing.  That message, the families strong faith in God.  AND this TRUE story was nothing short of a miracle<br />There was NO reference to God in the movie.  At least I don't think there was....I didn't even finish watching the very end, it was so disappointing
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This author keeps you flipping pages as you desperately try to figure out where he's going with his plot.  He ever disappoints.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the thrilling ending of the trilogy. I'm sad that they have ended and wish there were more. You start to feel like they are real and you know the people intimately. Wonderful books.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Great love story for people to enjoy  of all ages.  I watched again last night.  Nicholson and Keaton are just fun to watch.

B00985E3UG|5.0|This gives the facts and science behind the industry of the American/world processed food industry.  As a person born in the 1950's it is a history of my lifetime chronicled by the development of the food I grew up with.  It is captivating to read and very easy to follow with the book organization.  A must read for anyone who is interested in taking control of their eating habits and is concerned about living a healthy long life.
B000JMKNV0|2.0|story line is boring and not at all interesting.  It's a crazy story about a bunch of crazies on an island.
B005LAIH9A|3.0|I realize American Reunion is supposed to be part of the American Pie series, but those movies strike me as a lot funnier and just overall better from a storyline perspective.  Perhaps it's due to the fact the cast is now in their 30's and still trying to act like really young, immature sex-obsessed teenagers.  Of course this is pretty much what *has* to happen in order to sell the movie.  The American Pie series has a reputation to live up to after all.  The tradeoff is that whenever the characters *do* act like adults, it comes across as rather silly because we realize they're clearly not fit for marriage and especially not children.<br /><br />We're supposed to overlook the immaturity of these characters and focus on the endless parade of sex jokes.  Well the good news is that many of the sex jokes are in fact funny despite the awkwardness of grown ups making them, but we then have to factor in the storytelling and believe me, it's quite dry.  WAY too many party scenes that accomplish very little, and certainly don't fit the category of being interesting.<br /><br />Seriously, the segments that are actually funny to me are the ones that involve the 18-year old neighbor girl (who Jason Biggs used to babysit but is now an incredibly hot young lady).  When she rips her clothes off and tries to hit on the character of Jason Biggs during a late night drive, and afterwards when the choas ensues involving the same naked girl being taken to her bedroom without the parents realizing several men are walking upstairs and secretly trying to hide in her room are both worthy of movie writing.  Also, the part involving Seann William Scott taking a dump in a cooler that belongs to a few guys at the beach he happens to dislike, leading to Seann and his buddies taking the joke WAY too far by eventually smashing their jet skies between two trees during a car ride is another memorable one.<br /><br />Other than these scenes (oh and of course the intro where the character of Jason Biggs is caught in his bedroom looking at porn by his youngest son, leading to the father trying to quickly hide it and one crazy set of circumstances after another occurring afterwards) the film just misses the mark on too many occasions.  Alyson Hannigan is also growing older and though still quite attractive, it's obvious by now that she's simply too old for this series.  Tara Reid has remained incredibly hot though.  Eugene Levy is probably a high point too- the relationship he has with a big-breated woman is funny (especially the hilarious popcorn bucket part at the end).  Still, the storyline is unappealingly dry and a 3-star rating is what I'm giving the movie.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|While different from the Broadway show, I thought this film was excellent! The actor's voices were not superior, but lent a great deal of credibility to this film.
B004U8VUUC|4.0|Great realism and depth.<br />A bit slow in some moments.<br />Movie had great story, and good transitions on some scenes.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is an excellently written book. It's the same idea as Fifty Shades of Grey, but I thought it was way better. The characters are much stronger and the story is more intriguing. I give it five stars.<br />Now, on to the second book!
B0077EBWVI|3.0|The film was average, because the personas in the film did not really sell the characters they were playing.<br />Modern adaptation on a classic, with modern music and modern style dancing.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Still excellent dialogues and characters, but I was a bit disappointed that there was not much real detection in terms of logical reasoning. The final solution comes as a result of hunches and intuition.
B00BQ1DAHC|3.0|I'd rather give 2 1/2 stars than 3 really but here we go. I can remember the first time I heard Volbeat. It was Guitar Gangsters and I was asleep in the back of the car coming back from a long trip. It woke me right up and I was hooked ever since. Every album they have with the exception of their first (not a huge fan) hit me right off the bat and had me hooked. After their last album which I absolutely loved but also had my suspicions that they would probably be taking a more commercial route in the future and I guess I was right. Maybe it's the fact that they introduced a new (American) guitarist who's name will go unmentioned.haha! But something just isn't right. The metal is hardly there and neither is the rockabilly sound. There's a few songs that had me singing along and I'm not saying that this is a bad album but it definitely didn't live up to expectations. I guess all I can hope for now is that they can somehow redeem themselves on their next effort. I'd still love to see them live before the corporate monsters of the music industry have them playing huge venues and playing nothing but their radio hits for fans who have no appreciation for the root sound of this band and would rather have their tunes completly sugar coated with bland pop rock music. With all that being said,I still love these guys and continue to support them but you missed the mark on this one fellas. If you're new to this band I would recommend checking out some older stuff and if you're not new to this band and you consider this their best album to date then you need to start questioning your good taste.lol! Even the song with King Diamond was somewhat of a letdown.

B00C7KXUOE|4.0|I like the movie and the cleverness of this serial killer. This show is well written and the acting is top notch in my opinion. It's a bit gory, but it is suspenseful.
B00BWU0S3Q|5.0|This takes a bit to get rolling, but once it does (not too long, mind you), it doesn't stop. It has a similar feel to The Untouchables, but from a different angle. I don't do spoilers; look at some of my other reviews and you will get an idea of my tastes. I really can't imagine not enjoying this if you are even slightly interested in this type of movie. A great watch!

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|The product was shipped quickly and nicely packaged.  I needed something for my Lenovo Yoga 13 as a safety measure and figured I'd give this one a try.  Since the Yoga doesn't have a optical drive, I skipped the CD install and just went to Anker's website to download the latest drivers.  The install was quick and very intuitive, running this on Windows 8 (64-bit).<br /><br />I had a chance to try this out last week while I was onsite with a customer. Didn't feel like bugging the receptionist for a wifi password and the ethernet cable, so I plugged everything in and it worked like a champ.  Connected at 1Gbs and was fast.<br /><br />If you're looking for a USB ethernet adapter for your Ultrabook, this one is priced right and functions great.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This book was an easy read. It just makes sense! It's changed my way of thinking about food and real hunger. I've been doing it for a month and I feel great. It's very easy to incorporate into my lifestyle or any lifestyle for that matter.
B003XU02QG|3.0|Not great, worth watching. Provincia Britannia is still a bit unique time/place for movies.<br /><br />Modern film makers just can't help but put today's outlook into their movies. Had to laugh when a fight scene had Olga Kurylenko (all 110 pounds of her) standing toe-to-toe, trading full-on punches with a 200-pound, very athletic guy. Apparently the laws of physics don't apply.
1250012570|3.0|The first 70% of the book was about 2 stars, the last 30% was 4 stars so I'm giving this a 3 stars (a 2.75 in all honesty).<br /><br />I was really excited to read this book when I got it. I was really disappointed after I finished it. The first 70% has essentially no conflict and no substance It's very empty prose about two misfit children falling in love. There isn't much character development and the personalities of the characters don't exactly \\"shine through\\" them. Most of the time spent describing the characters is to focus on how \\"chubby\\" Eleanor is or how Asian Park is.<br /><br />The side characters aren't great either. They seem like they are included because having a story with only two characters wouldn't be very enjoyable. That said, I did like Park's parents. I probably liked them more than I liked Park and Eleanor.<br /><br />Basically, all of the characters are forgettable. The plot is nonexistent for most of the book. And the book doesn't have anything of value that makes it special. It's not a book that will change you or make you feel a lot of things. It's not that entertaining either.<br /><br />I'm sorry I've been kind of harsh to this book. This is a book that I wouldn't recommend to a person, but I wouldn't tell them *not* to read it, either.
B004TB6GQI|5.0|If I put this CD in my CD player it will be on repeat for weeks without stopping. She has a really amazing, unique voice and such a talent for songwriting. I had bought her EP before this one and this was a long awaited CD. It didn't disappoint. I love every song on this CD (VERY rare for me with a CD). I really recommend this CD
B000FC1MCS|4.0|An interesting plot.  I first learned of this novel when observing a student teacher using it as a required reading in Sophomore English.  Its sparks some good discussion about family relationships and learning disabilities.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|He finished Prarie Angel, with a Place Called Freedom  The whole album is worth it.<br /><br />Starting with Loch Lamond is awesome.  Wonderful work.  You can expect the same in one of his concerts
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Outstanding board and great price. My only complaint is that it was a bit complicated to figure out how to install an OS ( as there are so many options and functions that have to be altered).... but, that would be a &#34;ME&#34; issue. This board has all the &#34;bells and whistles&#34;... and more.
B00BFUC8RC|1.0|fun game. bought it for my kid but find myself playing more than he does. great app. would recommend. to all ages.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Nothing made sense. Phoenix was thoroughly intensely awful. Why the nudity? Going back and forth in time added to the confusion
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think the game is great but it is too much like temple run and I like to eat crape after it catches on fire
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best free weather app I have found yet. Always up to date when I need it. Easy to use as well..
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|I'm new to Phosphorescent.  What an engaging voice.  I feel like some of the effects sound a little cheesy but I'm not bothered by them at all.  The production is excellent.  Song for Zula is top-notch, reaching into Wilco territory.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I don't really have anything negative to say about this app. it does what's is advertised has a great U.I. with lots of useful information.
B002DQHQQU|5.0|If you like later Wilco, this is an awesome and refined production.  If you missed this one (as I had), pick it up.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A great book for introverts who want to understand themselves and extroverts who have introverts in their family, social circles, or underneath them at work.<br /><br />Cain not only explains introverts and why they're important to humanity and its progress, but levels well-supported criticisms at the more recent developments in education methods—group-based everything, collaboration this, collaboration that.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to see the movie.  A true silver lining. Don't miss it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved that the main characters were teenagers, yet the dialogue and subject matter remained quite mature. I cried quite a bit through the last several chapters, but despite  the momentary depression I thoroughly enjoyed  this book.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Love this app, easy to use, challenging, good for games on the road and fun to challenge friends.  My 8 year old loves it ....his go too app for chess.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|The premise is interesting, actors did a good job. They were somewhat believable and entertaining. I would recommend it to others
B009WJ14FA|5.0|Vintage Trouble is a very &#34;retro&#34; band who embrace elements of &#34;Old School&#34; Rock and Soul.  Every track is a standout, especially  &#34;Nancy Lee,&#34; &#34;Nobody Told Me,&#34; and &#34;Pelvis Pusher.&#34;  Ty Taylor is an outstanding singer, who truly emulates the raw vocals of someone who grew up listening to the sounds of Otis Redding and other soul/blues sounds of the 60's era.  Naile Colt's guitar playing is pretty amazing.  As a 4 piece band, their sound is incredibly full.  I believe we will be hearing a great deal about Vintage Trouble in the future.  Check it out.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|I did not know about this South American history; it opened a new interest about the history of South America.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I like to read these books I read the whole series so I say a 4 star is good enough
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|VERY cool, wish there was more maps to make it more fun but it is still really fun and the best first person shooter available to kindle fire
0446554995|5.0|Exciting and interesting concept wiht great characters so reminiscent of Wilkie Collins style. Fast paced stories with just enough complexity with all the twists and unexpected happenings that mean one's second guesses are happily wrong. Has the romantic gothic atmosphere of the Sherlock Holmes style and plotted with serial care to keep you page turning. Pendergast is one of the most outstanding lead characters of a series
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Best movie I have seen in some time. Great story and spot on acting. Highly recommended for Lord of the rings fans.
B00008J2PG|5.0|True or based-on-true account of a priest during the Nazi regime and how he did not simply preach but acted Christian principles during such inhumane tyranny.  In the course of time, one of the major Nazi leaders becomes a Christian!  This movie is good for acting, script-writing, theme, and all such theatrical measurements of quality.  It would be enjoyed by any history buff.  It is also good for all professing Christian people to watch; and be motivated and challenged by issues of true Christianity in periods of severe persecution, as opposed to feel-good-Christianity or when-I-get-around-to -it Christianity in North America.
B007HXL1V0|4.0|It gave some good ideas of things and I'm glad I read it as it came highly recommended. I wish it would've had some ideas of dealing with multiples.
B005X5MXM0|5.0|I've recently become acquainted with the music of Ian Hunter within the last 2 years, as I've delved into Mott the Hoople's remastered catalogue from the early years up through to Hunter's solo career, and I'm of the feeling that he is ridiculously underrated and overlooked as an artist/songwriter/performer and this live document from 1980 in Germany is yet another ample piece of proof that the chemistry between Hunter and former Bowie cohort, Mick Ronson was an amazing coupling of talent and excellent musical quality. Most of the material on hand is from his solo work up until '80 Welcome to the Club release with a few Mott numbers(Dudes, Wish I Was Your Mother) and a few Ronno tunes(Slaughter on 10th Ave, FBI). If your a Mott/Hunter fan or if you love good classic rock and roll, I highly recommend this wonderful live dvd document, you won't be sorry!
B00B935SUY|5.0|This film is about where all your favorite records were made.  Want to see how it's done?  Watch this movie now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It captures you up into another world. You view everyday life and trials of the time period. The charactors are very vully developed and believable.  Very real! Love the show.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|While some of the locations made it difficult for this American to have a reference point it was a good mystery with lots of twists and turns in the plot.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Story telling and plot progression supurb. Wouldn't miss it. A friend mentioned it and now I have many friends watching
B001QJUX24|5.0|This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies as well as being an all time classic!  I absolutely love it!
B004EBZX6W|4.0|If you like a graphical representation of nearby WiFi sources that broadcast an SSID, then you'll like this free app.  Just understand that the data appears to update about once every 10 seconds or so, so you won't see real-time or instantaneous changes to received signal strength.  That may be a bit inconvenient if coverage is marginal and you want to place your smartphone/tablet/laptop at the exact spot with the best RSL.  Integrating data over 10 second periods isn't a show-stopper, but you won't be able to see the instantaneous changes that result from multipath or from moving objects -- like people walking by or even movements of your own body or changing the position of the device.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Loved the clarity of writing and story was fast paced - enjoyed every minute of the book.  Is there a sequel in there somewhere and certainly a  movie.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Series was well produced and it made me want to read the book.  I watched this while I exercised and it motivated me to go back the gym every other day.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|I don't think I have to rate Blade Runner, it's one of the best movies evar. The stream was pretty solid, good quality the whole time except for occasional screen tearing, like it needed vertical sync. This was on a PC. Otherwise DVD quality.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|very fun. was sad when I finished. will go play again try the tournament. or free play. ready for number 2 to get here.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I am a fan of Thomas Harris' books and every time there was a movie based on his book, I was always left feeling very disappointed with how the film makes depicted Harris' stories. When I heard that Hannibal is going to be made into a TV series, I was skeptical, thinking that they would ruin a good story again. I watched this and to my surprise, I wasn't disappointed. I thought the way Mr. Slade filmed this was very artistic, tasteful, and poetic. I definitely recommend this!
B003RUX2VE|5.0|I also own this movie on DVD, and I watch it a lot! The plot is awesome and the characters are portrayed awesomely by great actors.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I own many of studio Gibli's works, and recently had my nieces over. This is the one they wanted to watch over and over again, I got played about a dozen times in a four day span. Each time they were enthralled.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Bradley Cooper is a great actor and was definitely the best choice for this movie. I have since bought this movie on DVD to make sure I have a lot of chances to rewatch, because the action, plot, and characters make for an awesome movie night.
0385344228|4.0|Overall, it was very interesting.  The concept was brilliantly put together.  The plot, with a combination of crime, mystery and family relationships provided excitement, thrills, surprises, doubts and fear throughout the book.  There were a lot of elements that were unanswered, leaving room for imagination as well as some question marks, including some characters; I could not quite grasp both Andy and Jacob's personalities for instance. The surprise twist at the end was great.  The writing was soft, smooth and very easy to follow.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|I love this band and this new album is another great work of artistry that I will continue to enjoy for years to come.
B009FZFONO|3.0|Something dreadful is gnawing at your ham-bone in the middle of the night, and yes, I just might be talking about every Cinemax-castoff actor involved in this ghoulish undertaking. 16 shambling, goofy, horrifyingly-racist episodes await you, if you've got the guts to invest that kind of time into what ultimately amounts to an incomplete saga. Best advice: read the Walking Dead Compendium Vol.1 (or any paperback or hardcover collections containing material from the Walking Dead comic series #1-48) for a much more satisfying Walking Dead experience than the medium of television could ever possibly deliver. The comic is by no means less racist than the tv show, in case you were wondering. Newly-converted fans of David Morrissey should seek out BLACKPOOL, a BBC singalong comedy mini-series from a few years back which cast Morrissey in the musical role of a hedonistic casino tycoon. Priceless stuff, governor.
B008Y73940|5.0|Great movie!  Matthew McConaughey is awesome.  (as usual)  Ryan Phillipe is also great in his usual pretty-boy psycho roll.  Go ahead and watch it.  You won't regret it...
B000FS9FCG|4.0|A good attempt to maintain the message and flavor of graphic novel. Worth your time and energy to watch.<br />Remember the 5th of November.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The dvd arrived promptly in great condition.  Only<br />problem I really have is that the movie deviates from<br />the book.  I loved the book; I like the movie.
B006UV8DJS|1.0|It is not easy painting by fingers....I thought you could touch and it would fill in color where you wanted it :(
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Tubemate is awesome. I can download &amp; watch my favorite youtube videos and I haven't seen the infamous pornography ads. Ossim
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Sky stole my heart with her courage and vulnerability. Holder is every woman's desire as he is passionate, painfully honest and loves with every part of his being. I couldn't put this book down.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|suspenseful, enjoyable, and fascinating.  i thoroughly enjoyed it.  I read it in bed, while on the exercise bike and treadmill.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I don't usually read romance books but this a one I really enjoyed. I even passed it on to my friends to read. i hope you enjoy it too.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Amazing visually, written and directed very well.  Full of suspense with strong character development is excellent.  A story of tragedy, hope, and unity.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved the reconnection to my childhood &#34;guardians&#34; and the funny updated characters!  It's great for kids now, and for us who are heading for our &#34;second childhood&#34;!!
B004TI5N38|3.0|Baldacci is usually one of my favorite authors. This book was good but certainly not his best although I did read it to the end.  While somewhat predictable, the only surprise was that...well, I won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />It was worth the 1.99.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I really like this character, who is older, crusty, and doesn't suffer fools or follow all the rules. If you like England's Inspector Frost series, you will probably like this series set in Scotland.
