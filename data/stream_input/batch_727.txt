B000WCBPOG|4.0|Always hesitant about 'remakes' of great Beatles songs, but this CD delivers on some fresh perspectives and arrangements of familiar (iconic) material.  Nice to have the alternative and see the admiration for the originals that has gone into this.
8590379825|5.0|Good examples, suggestions, and notes. Is a must have for any one looking to program in Lua.
B000T2PRF2|5.0|Love the CD/DVD combo edition - \\"Look of Love\\" is the nicest version I have heard of that song.  Very tasteful arrangements and her solo piano work is never over done.  Reminds me of a great local artist in the LA area, Kate Reid (vocal and piano) that we enjoy live.    Keep up the great work - looking forward to the 'Best of - Part 2\\"
0440178002|5.0|The culture clash of East vs. West mixed with the political intrigue and mental chess games make this an incredible book.  I'll skip on the summary since it's done in other reviews.  I don't usually tackle books this long as they can't maintain my interest but I couldn't put this book down.  I'm a bit of a Japanofile, which may have contributed to my enjoyment of this book.  For anyone who likes historical fiction and compelling politically-driven plots, this will be a great read.
B000VSBX34|4.0|I remember this film when it came out originally - we were excited to see it in color!  This remastering looks amazing and the care with filters that director, Richard Lester and DP put into it is more obvious - eye candy and lots of fun.  The songs are great and sound really clear and pristine.  Extras are here (not as many as the over-priced, collector's edition),  not too plentiful, but fun to see the cut scene story and behind the scenes documentary.
1878424505|5.0|This is one of a very few books that I, as a therapist, recommend to patients. The book may be short, but it is right to the point.
0143038583|4.0|This book is an interesting and factual account about the American food system.  It is about the prevalence of corn in every thing that we eat.  The author's first hand experience gives the book credibility. The book was extremely captivating, I could not put it down.
0571202284|5.0|This is an awesome book.  Richard Williams truly pulled all the stops with this publication.  It presents information for animators in such a straightforward and concise manner that you find yourself constantly going back to this book for reference.  Within the explanations of different animation conventions he interjects his experiences in the industry.  Definitely a MUST-HAVE for any serious animator.

B000UZ4EP2|5.0|Moya was a new artist to me and I approached this album with a bit of trepidation.  Once I heard it, however, it rose to the top of the \\"to be played today\\" list. Despite playing it over and over, I have yet to tire of it.      If you like Celtic music, this is a \\"must have.\\"
B000RG1FMO|2.0|I have always enjoyed Kanye West. Since hip-hop has strayed away from relevant lyricists Kanye was like a breath of fresh air. When College Drop Out and Late Registration dropped it reminded me of hip hop legends like Del the Funky Homosapien and The Pharcyde. His delivery has never been that great, but his beats were always on point and there was definite substance to his rhymes. So when Graduation came out I picked it up as soon as possible. And while his production skills are still at the top of the game, Kanye has succumbed to the hip hop mentality of braggadocios rhymes. The heart just isn't in it anymore. We always knew that Kanye was his own #1 fan, but now that's all he is. He's saying a lot without saying anything at all.
0805079831|5.0|If you want to understand the difference between democracy and capitalism, read this book.  If you want to know why the world's problems never seem to get solved, read this book.  I had never read a book on economics before, but this one is riveting.  The book of Revelation describes the United States as appearing like a lamb, but having the voice of a dragon.  The Shock Doctrine details the fulfillment of that prophecy made 2000 years ago.  After you read this book, study Revelation to prepare for everything else that is about to happen.
B000066C1N|5.0|This CD has saved me many times on long trips.  My daughter and son love singing along to the CD.  The CD includes all the songs from the movie and mixes both songs with and without words.  There is also a lyrics insert to help the parents learn the songs or help a child that doesn't know a word.  A must for any child that loves the Spirit movie.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This sequel to Wizard of Oz takes a very Serious and dramatic turn for a dark movie really not made for children but teens.  There are no musicals or sing alongs we remember back in the old wizard of oz, this is a very dark movie that leaves a more memorable feeling like watching neverending story as a child.  The scary images and odd story embarks watchers into an Oz made  more or so from Tim Burton's perspective.  Its a great movie but not what you'd expect from the original bright and happy wizard of oz.  The story is excellent and different from the original and they are linked very solidly although its a completely different take on the genre.  I can see why Walt Disney decided to shelve this movie rather than re-release it, its not really suitable for a young audience.
1401300529|4.0|It's been seventeen years since James Brady's memoir, [[ASIN:0312265115 The Coldest War: A Memoir of Korea]].  This is not that type of book.  This is also not a Rick Atkinson's [[ASIN:0805087249 An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942-1943, Volume One of the Liberation Trilogy (The Liberation Trilogy)]] or [[ASIN:0805062890 The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944 (The Liberation Trilogy)]] type of slug-by slug war history.  Mr. Halberstam writes at least as much about the Cold War politics, motivations, and characters of Mao, MacArthur, Truman, Stalin, Kim Il Sung, Acheson, Bradley, Marshall, Chiang Kai-shek, Henry Luce, Ned Almond, and Ridgway (Eisenhower and Rhee get slighted) as he does of Pusan, Inchon, Chongchon, Unsan, Kunuri, Chosin, McGee Hill, Chipyongni, Twin Tunnels, and Pork Chop. Therefore, this is a great book, much needed to bring context and sense to this 'forgotten war' - a journalist's book, not a memoir.  A more careful reading of the sub-title's \\"and\\" might have tipped us off.  Perhaps Mr. Halberstam's re-use of Brady's \\"coldest\\" in the title is his personal pun on what \\"cold\\" really meant in 1950.<br /><br />One small warning: in a book about the first war fought by the newly minted U.S. Air Force, they don't appear. OK, A-bombs and strategic bombing were politically impossible, but the Air Force was there.  It doubled in size during the war and squabbled with the Army, Navy, and Pentagon, but it was there and significantly.  No mention of the first jet dogfights, not the Soviet pilots in their MiG's, not complete air-control throughout the war, no [[ASIN:1591149339 Sabres over MiG Alley: The F-86 and the Battle for Air Superiority in Korea]].  There are a few exciting sentences about ground cover saving the day at Twin Tunnels, but they were Marines in WW II Corsairs.<br /><br />In summary, this is another Halberstam masterpiece: thoroughly researched, perfectly organized, reasonably balanced, and, of course, clearly written.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|The opening montage alone is enough to intrigue, disturb and wildly entertain. Black and white headless bodies, technicolour dazzle,human acting rabbits in a distintly unfunny sitcom and we're not even past the ten minute mark. Laura Dern doesn't even feature in this spectacular overture but the film is all hers, it's her Inland Empire we peer into and by the end she's watching, literally, with us. Every frame of this film is vital and with more in common with music than convential cinema, demands that we watch, and I mean really look, at what's being projected to us and then re watch again and again. Laura Dern's character talks of men revealing themselves over time, eventually exposing their true nature and that is what this masterpiece does also. In time you feel you understand what you're watching, that you feel your way to a conclusion and it really is a very beautiful thing.

B0002DRDBE|5.0|\\"Clerks\\" might have been famous just for being the first film without any nudity, sex or violence to be given an NC-17 rating. The rating was appealed and the film was released as an R, without any cuts being made.<br /><br />I say \\"might have been.\\" As it happens, \\"Clerks\\" turned out to be an impressively funny film that warrants a place in our memories for artistic reasons, not backstage controversies. Now that time has passed, everyone knows \\"Clerks,\\" but most have forgotten the rating debate that almost overshadowed it.<br /><br />\\"Clerks\\" was made cheap, and it shows. The film stock is inexpensive, and most of the actors aren't actors. Some of them play multiple roles with little attempt to change their appearance. The performances are amateurish, though the two leads are passable. One is amazed that such unprofessionalism could make it to the silver screen, until one hears Kevin Smith's wonderful dialogue. His characters are among the funniest, most intelligent speakers in the film world, mixing terms like \\"managerial control\\" and \\"insubordinate\\" with every profanity you can name.<br /><br />The film covers a day in the life of Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), an uninspired convenience store clerk who is called in on his day off and must work the entire day, from open to close. (\\"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\\" becomes his mantra after each mishap.) Dante has little regard for the general public, but he maintains a semi-polite (if not altogether professional) demeanor. At one point, he lies on the floor behind the counter to talk to his girlfriend, but leaves a sign up instructing customers to pay for the purchases on the honor system (which they do, because they think they're being watched).<br /><br />This is in contrast to his best friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who works at the tiny video store across the street. Randal has the best lines in the movie, thanks to his wise misanthropy and blatant cynicism toward every stranger he encounters. \\"I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class,\\" he says. \\"Especially since I rule.\\"<br /><br />The driving plot point is Dante's discovery that his ex-girlfriend Caitlin (Lisa Spoonhauer) is getting married, while his current flame Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) is pressuring him to quit the convenience store and go to college. There are other problems, too, like a funeral everyone's supposed to go to, and a street hockey game that Dante's supposed to play in. Randal has no problem closing the video store for a couple hours, but Dante has that nagging work ethic to deal with.<br /><br />Kevin Smith grew as a writer and a director as time went on. \\"Clerks,\\" while featuring fine dialogue, has some problems. Two major events are both said to have happened at 4 p.m., for example, and Veronica has college classes despite it being a Saturday. The film, while only 90 minutes or so, runs the risk of getting old before it's finished; no matter how pithy the dialogue may be, a movie with nothing but talking is still just a movie with nothing but talking.<br /><br />But you overlook that because of what's here. There are wonderful jabs at retail jobs, with Randal and Dante each describing the typical morons they have to deal with (like the guy who comes into the video store and says, \\"Do you have that one with that guy who is in that movie last year?,\\" or the woman who looks through every gallon of milk in search of the one with an expiration date in the next century). As such, \\"Clerks\\" has become a particular favorite among young, semi-ambitious kids stuck in dead-end jobs like these.<br /><br />When a customer asks what the store's pet cat is called, and Randal says she's named \\"Annoying Customer,\\" I don't think I'm overstating it to suggest he's saying what everyone in America would LIKE to say.sophy of a ruling class,\\" he says. \\"Especially since I rule.\\"    The driving plot point is Dante's discovery that his ex-girlfriend Caitlin (Lisa Spoonhauer) is getting married, while his current flame Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) is pressuring him to quit the convenience store and go to college.

B000PKG6TE|4.0|I literally was introduced to QOTSA in May 2007 when my coworker let me borrow Songs For The Deaf.  I was immediately hooked!  After about two or so months straight of listening to that album.  I bought Rated R and Era Vulgaris.  Initially I was not thrilled with either of them.  I felt that they both lacked the punch of \\"Songs\\" (probably due to the Epic Drumming of Dave Grohl), but they grew on me bigtime.  I really enjoy Era Vulgaris.  After reading other reviews, it amazes me that two people could like the same band and differ so completely on the songs they like and the reasons.  How could anyone pick Turnin on the Screw as their favorite song?  Also, I am amazed that people could give this album one star.  One star is for Mambo #5 not QOTSA.<br />Here are my tops on this album<br /> I'm Designer<br /> Into the Hollow<br /> Battery Acid<br /> Misfit Love<br /> 3's and 7's<br /> Run Pig Run<br />Here are the Duds<br /> Turnin' on the Screw<br /> Make it wit chu<br /><br />My favorite QOTSA album is Lullabies (A+) followed by Songs (A) then Rated R (B+) and Era Vulgaris (B+)<br /><br />I cannot complain about one thing about this group.  Solid Rock and Roll from start to finish.  They are now my third favorite band of all time and the only band that allowed me to stop listening to SOAD.
B000MGBRHC|5.0|Volbeat is some of the most unique metal you will ever hear. Think Elvis meets Metal. Incredible. So different and so good. It was seriously such a fresh breath in the metal world. Seriously incredible. And the sound is pulled off flawlessly. CHECK IT OUT
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This movie is about the struggle to end the slave trade in late 18th century England.  What attracted me to this movie was the cast(Ioan Griffud, Albert Finney, and Michael Gambon).  The movie shows the parliamentary machinations and the persistence of Wilberforce to abolish the slave trade in Great Britain.  This is despite personal and health problems.    The film is a personal inspiration showing that determination and patience will yield positive, long term, change. The film was cast well from the lead characters to secondary characters.  Rufus Sewell did well as Clarkson, serving as the Devil's Advocate for revolution.  Toby Hughes, as the Duke of Clarence, portrayed the old guard.     The film switched back and forth between two time periods.  Sometimes, this was confusing.  I would have liked to see more of Albert Finney as John Newton.    The final scene with the bagpipes and Guards palying \\"Amazing Grace\\" was moving.  Overall, this is an enlightening historical movie.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This is Michael Moore's best documentary by far. He paints a very disturbing view of our health care delivery system in the U.S. It is both funny and heartbreaking at the same time. After watching it, one can only help that whomever takes over the oval office in 2009, health care reform will be a major priority. Moore does a beautiful job in letting his subjects do his talking for him. He gently probes them to open up about their experiences with HMO's. He also interview HMO insiders who were willing to go on record about HMO abuses - two that come to mind are the medical director of Humana who described how she and other directors were pitted against each other to deny the most claims. Those who denied the most were given big bonuses. Then there was the background checker whose job it was to find any discrepancies in the original application for coverage and then to deny coverage for the most minor of omissions in the application. Before Moore started filming he asked for e-mails to be sent to him describing experiences with HMO's. He received over 25,000 e-mails. This is a film that will get you thinking about how we ever put up with such an inefficient wasteful system that delivers such poor health care. By any measure and Moore shows a lot of statistics, the U.S. if way behind other industrialized countries who have universal health care. What was interesting is his interview with his Canadian relative who buy health insurance coverage for their visits to the U.S. since they don't want to get sick in this country and have to pay our exhorbitant rates. I thought Moore went over the top only in his depiction of Cuba's health care system. That didn't quite ring true but it doesn't detract from the overall theme of the movie that our health care system is broken and needs fixing. Every American should watch this film.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|This movie is really sweet in the best way possible-IF you promise not to try to figure out the logistics on all the time travel issues.    What makes this movie work is Sandy and Keanu-they have such a great chemistry that during one part at a certain party(trying not to give too much up), I was actually yelling at Keanu to do what his face was only hinting at what he wanted to!    The ending pitters out a bit, some of the dialogue is cheesy, but dang, these two are cute as a button together and really likeable. Viva la Bullock/Reeves confection!
0143038419|2.0|Having heard so many positive reviews of this book, I really, really wanted to like it.  I have been struggling through every page of her narcisistic babble and have finally decided I can't go on.  I made my decision upon reading last night that she had decided to stay another 3 months in India.  I think my exact words were, \\"Oh dear God, you've got to be kidding me.\\"  I can't do another 3 months in India with her...I think I'll lose my mind.    The ONLY reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the Italian portion of the story piqued my interest enough that I am now more interested in learning more about the Italian language and making Italy my next travel destination.
B000VBP38C|5.0|I must say, Pride and Prejudice surprised me. It has a quick pace, wonderful cinematography and the ensemble acting is incredible. A fantastic adaptation, that is both enjoyable, comical and romantic. The HD DVD version is crystal clear and at times breathtaking, I heartily recommend this version...the English countryside has never looked more beautiful, nor has Keira Knightley! A fantastic movie, and the HD DVD is very well done. Buy it or upgrade now!

B0009KA7BS|4.0|If you like battles against ultimate evil, religious overtones, and special effects - with a twist, rent Constantine. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief. Yes, you have to accept somewhat two-dimensional personalities. But if you get past that, you get a nicely shot, tense, supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters. Most folks will have never heard of Constantine or Hellblazer, on which the movie is loosely based, but it's fine if you haven't. The movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|we all know the stories of friends, and it is unnecessary to state the obvious here.  However, there are some inconsistencies in the DVDs.  For example, some episodes have subtitles in languages other than English, Spanish and French, but most do not.    Also, starting from season 9, they stopped displaying the title of the episode as subtitles at the beginning theme.    Still a timeless sit-com.
0525457585|5.0|Excellent story.  Wonderfully imaginative, pertains to situations kids face in real life.  The story does get a bit intense about halfway through, but the excitement builds wonderful suspense and anticipation.  Great for kids of all ages who can handle suspenseful situations, and adults too.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I could barely understand the lyrics, that's why the ablum get 3 stars.  I would actually like to give it 2 1/2 stars but I love her voice despite not understanding a word.

B000KEG94C|5.0|I'm going to guess that most of the people thinking about buying this blu-ray movie, and thus reading this review, had already seen this movie, liked it and want a copy on blu-ray (IF the picture quality (PQ) is worth it).  So I will not review the movie but just mention that the pq is spectacular and you won't regret it.
0143038419|5.0|What an interesting title I thought when my aunt recommended this book to me. I just had to buy it and I'm glad I had. Not only does Gilbert take you through a story of growth, love and food, but she opens herself up to the reader and isn't afraid to share all her highs and painful lows. This is a book you want to read forever relishing each small chapter. The story takes you on a spiritual journey (despite of your faith or lack of it) and causes you to reflect on your own life. Not to mention the urge to take off for a year and visit the world! I enjoyed it and recommend it to all women (and a few men). Read it!
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Straight up... this is the best Blu-Ray movie out there... If you wish to test out your PS3 and 1080P HD TV then you have to buy this film and sit back and enjoy. Disney has done it again... HD-DVD Owners would cry if they knew how much better this was than anything on HD.

B000NA1Z1A|4.0|--Rehab*******1/2 Overplayed to the high Heavens and is one of the worst tracks here. However, love the line: \\"Ooo/I just need a friend!\\" 7.5/10<br /><br />--You Know I'm No Good********** One of the, if not the best tracks on the entire thing! Like the video. But love the lyrics! 10/10<br /><br />--Me & Mr. Jones********1/2 This is the first time I've heard this one. I like it, it's superior to Rehab in almost every way (save for my favorite line) and I think it's one of my favorites. 8.5/10<br /><br />--Just Friends**********1/2 Love this one now! 10.5/10<br /><br />--Back to Black*********1/2 Loving the lyrics. The symphony, violins and the piano. And the atmosphere it creates. Definitely my third favorite song here. \\"You go back to Her/And I go back to Black.\\" \m/ 9.5/10<br /><br />--Love is a Losing Game********* Love this one. Heard it before. It was my favorite but I think that You Know I'm No Good takes it by a hair. This track is much more laid-back though. 9/10<br /><br />--Tears Dry on their Own*******1/2 I like this one. Not a favorite, but it's OK. 7.5/10<br /><br />--Wake Up Alone*********** I am obsessed with the title. I feel the same about the song. The lyrics are real and somewhat gritty. The production sounds like something extremely dreary and seems as if someone will commit suicide quite soon. I LOVE it!! Guess this is my new favorite!!!!!!!!!!! 11/10<br /><br />--Some Unholy War***** Bored me to tears. The only track that is terrible and I don't understand how it made the cut. Glad it's shorter than 2 1/2 minutes. 5/10<br /><br />--He Can Only Hold Her*******3/4 Again, I love the title. Decent closer and the lyrics are decent as well. However, the highlight is actually the beat; Upbeat and lovely. That's where it's at! 7.75/10<br /><br />86.25 ÷ 10 = 8.625<br /><br />8.63 = 4.32<br /><br />4.32 stars.
B000QZZGTY|3.0|Finally watched the notorious 'Salo'. I was suprised. I read reviews about how no one under 25 or even 30 should even think about seeing this film because it will change your life. This is known to be one of the most disturbing dangerous films of all time. It was sick but I think the effect has worn off somewhat over the years... Either that or i've seen too many disturbing films already.     The plot of Salo's simple. It's about a group of power hungry fascist leaders who take these teens as their prisoners. They are basically sentenced to die. Some parts were hard to take seriously such as the lady giving her speeches- that was cheesy. The only part that got to me was the last scene when the leaders are looking through the binoculars at their captives fate. I think the effect may have worn off a little over the years. I give it 3 stars because it shows what fascist people with too much power are capable of...The darkside of humanity.

B000002KB8|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! Debut album by the first kings of heavy metal. This is my second favorite album by this group. But why is Ozzie's voice deeper here than on later albums; I suspect the master tapes were slowed while transferring. This album peaked at #23 which wasn't bad for a debut.    There isn't a large song selection but what's here is very impressive. The opening song, \\"Black Sabbath\\" was a harbinger of the direction this group's direction musically & lyrically. Sabbath has been accused more than once of being satanists but that's a bad rap, how many satanists scream out, \\"God, please help me!\\" \\"The Wizard\\" is riff heavy & certainly one of their better ones. \\"Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Basically/N.I.B.\\" comes next. These songs segue one into the next, excellent all. \\"Basically\\" is a short bass instrumental & followed by one of Sabbath's most popular songs \\"N.I.B.\\" (Nativity in Black). What follows is the grand finale, \\"A Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning\\". \\"Sleeping Village is a slower song where the band lays down a moody piece, there follows \\"Warning\\" where Tony Iommi treats us to some of his best lead riffs. Like a lot of songs on this effort, many of Iommi's leads are double-tracked.    This is a grand ride from the first kings of heavy metal; never a dull moment & highly recommended!

B00005JPFH|5.0|As much as the first two Spider-Man films took moviegoing audiences by storm, it seemed like the third installment in the trilogy would have to work hard for the series to top itself.  I have to say, Spider-Man 3 does exactly that, and no more:  it doesn't try to overwhelm you with too much depth, it keeps just the right emphasis on people to make you care about the characters, and you'll find yourself on the edge of you seat with the action and special effects.<br />  As far as this package, it's got a good price here, compared to the retail shopping I did.  Amazon's price is actually lower for the special edition than the regular edition is selling for in my local stores.  For the money, you get the movie in widescreen, with the basic little extras (such as bloopers/outtakes), then a second disc crammed full of more bonus material, for the Spider-Savvy.  I don't buy as many movies as I used to, and the prices have made that problem worse.  This one I don't regret buying at all--I feel I got my money's worth in the 2-Disc Special Edition.

B000002N2Z|3.0|I thought this album would be a good idea, but the truth of the matter is that Deftones seem to go best in small doses.  Laid-back and spacy, yet angry and screaming, the odd combination wears thin after more than two tracks of the exact same sound.  I realize they are trying to be unique, and there are some standout tunes here, but as a whole the album just doesn't grab me--it seems to be angry at the world, but too tired and apathetic to do anything about it.
B000000W94|5.0|this is my favorite gary moore album.he really gets \\"that sound\\" and plays with feeling.if you dont get this cd,its your loss.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Believe me, I wanted this album to be bad.  I think Britney Spears is an absolute piece of trash, and she has gotten everything she's deserved with this Elvis-like collapse.  However, she's going to end up redeeming herself with this album.  Granted, it's not a GREAT album by any means.  But it is 100x better than I thought it would be, and in fact, boasts some pretty damn good songs.  \\"Radar\\" is a standout song on the album, and is as catchy as ANY song she's ever done.  \\"Break the Ice\\" is also a top notch song.<br /><br />As many reviewers are saying, she's still going to be a trainwreck most likely, but she still remembers how to make some decent music.  Sure, her voice is layered so heavily, she almost seems robotic, but the music is enjoyable to listen to, and that's all that matters.
B000089770|5.0|Slice o' life. Not too heavy, not too light. Absolutely believable. Very moving, but doesn't pander to cheap emotionalism. Even the dialogue is recognizable as something you might actually hear in real life. Substitutes a story for the usual violence, sex and high-decibel action. Acting, character presentation superb. For those not too cynical to enjoy a great, yet realistic feel-good movie, this is a good one. I use other high-rating picks of Amazon Five-Star reviewers of this movie as a rough guide for evaluating movies I haven't seen.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Very motivational and well directed.  Acting is fantastic but the plot really drives the movie to another level.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KANYE AND 50. LOOK FOR ME IM ON BOTH SIDES, BOTH OF THEM ARE AWESOME. BUT I CAN SEE THE REASON WHY KANY BEAT 50. LOOK 50'S MUSIC IS COOL ITS TIGHT ITS REALLY NICE AND KANYE ALSO. BUT KANYE'S MUSIC IS DIFFERENT ITS UNIQUE SOMETHING YOU DONT EXPECT BUT ITS NOT BAD ITS GOOD. FOR 50 YOU CAN EXPECT THE SAME THING 1 SONG AFTER ANOTHER COMES LIKE A SIMILIAR BEAT WHICH YEAH IS GOOD. KANYE'S ALBUM HAS NEW BEATS AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC THAN ANYBODY ELSE. SO OVERALL KANYE JUST TOOK IT.  I LIKE BOTH OF THEM IN MY OPINION. BOTH DID A GREAT ALBUM. GOOD JOB GUYS!!!

You'll find it on the bookshelf of every astronomer alive (and I'm only marginally exaggerating here!). Five stars - there is no better Galactic Dynamics text.     Note, however, that this is *not* an introductory-level book, and is intended for graduate level astronomers and higher.
B000UFAURI|5.0|i purchased this album the day it hit the shelves. Dave Grohl just keeps getting better. After last years acoustic release the Foo Fighters took a break for the holidays and began the follow up. Gil Norton who produced the Foo Fighters masterpiece 'The Colour and the Shape' is back on board and does a great job as usual. What they did in my opinion here is they took elements of there acoustic stuff and the full on rock tracks and brought everything together and it works. There is a little bit of something for everyone. Straight up rockers like 'The Pretender' to the pop sounds of the great 'Statues'. Every track is top notch with what just may very well be the best Foo Fighters song to date, Long Road to Ruin. Long Road has a great hook and a chorus you will find stuck in your head through out the day, my five year old even loves it. Another great thing is the addition of piano, and no surprise who plays it , yes Dave Grohl. Dave is turning out to be one of the best song writters this decade and of course one of the best all around musicians in rock history. Do yourself a favor and pick this up, it just fits this time of year, it just has a very fall like vibe about it. I give 5 stars plus, hands down the best release of 2007.
0743298039|5.0|This is an outstanding work of Gothic fiction that transports the reader into a voyeur.  The language and flow are exquisite.  The characters and setting are both beautiful and disturbing simulataneously.  The writer draws you in to the story so completely, it's impossible to close the book before reaching the end.  It's intriguing, fascinating, disturbing, and a clever weave of family relationships and the shaping of individuals.  It's a must read!
B000XPOB0M|4.0|This movie definitely had its points where I was scared simply because I was surprised.  While I wouldn't give this movie a perfect rating, I do give it four out of five stars for being different, visually stimulating, and good for those who love movies with a supernatural and/or religious twist.
B000VNMMR0|1.0|At every step, unless you are under the age of 12 and have no conception of anything, DH4 has a conceit that says \\"our audiences are so dumb, we can sell them anything.\\" Attempting to play upon the non-technical majority in the seats, the viewer will be asked to buy into such stupidity as West Virgina becoming the nexus of the US power grid, or that natural gas can be directed like a detonation train through US pipelines. This would be more surprising if you didn't realize that this mess was directed by Len Wiseman, gaining a well deserved rep as the new Uwe Boll. Save your time and money, and skip this mess!
B000UGGS82|2.0|Who would have thunk it?  The tragic suicide of Kurt Cobain was supposed to be the death knell for grunge music let alone Nirvana and yet out of the ashes Dave Grohl the drummer decides to form the Foo Fighters and after a decent first effort goes on to show with this the follow-up that the Foo Fighters is no fluke in what would be an even better album.  Grohl shows he learned a lot from Cobain's compositions as the same \\"formula\\" of alternating loud and soft dynamics is used on track after track.  Grohl as did Cobain knew that to make songs sound interesting you can't just have non-stop loud or soft music going on throughout and that alternating hard with tender spots in songs makes them much more interesting for the human ear to behold and just like Cobain, Grohl has a very good ear for melody.  The standout tracks here are \\"Everlong\\", \\"My Hero\\" and \\"Monkey Wrench\\" although the rest of the tracks in no way even closely resemble album filler and have their own merits.<br /><br />This version of the album though is extremely expensive despite coming in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) format which is poorly assembled with very thin and poor quality cardboard.  Two 12-page booklets are included which have the lyrics in both English and Japanese and there is a bonus track included as well: \\"Dear Lover\\".  The sound quality is very good which is a redeeming factor although it's not remastered.  This means that you can get the same cd a lot cheaper albeit without the poor quality mlps design sleeve.  Although the content of the album is blameless and represents the Foo Fighters at their best it is hard to justify the very high price you have to pay for this version though.  Get this album by all means but just not this extremely expensive version.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|For anyone familiar with the whacky ways of Coen brothers (\\"Raising Arizona,\\" \\"Barton Fink,\\" \\"Fargo\\"), The Big Lebowski represents the sibling filmmaking duo at their whacky best! They do here what they have done in all their best films: take a familiar genre (the gangster genre in \\"Miller's Crossing,\\" for instance) and insert their own odd-ball comic spin, always with an eye for the irony and absurdity of the genre. This film is essentially a spin off of the noir/detective film where the hero gets caught up in a complex web of seedy characters and situations -- usually involving money, the femme fatale, and a murder or two. Of course, when it's the Coen brothers, it can never be as serious as all that. In this case, the noir detective -- as it were -- is in fact not the suave, Bogart type at all. He is the Dude; a lazy, overweight, pothead who is content just spending his days at the bowling lane. A plot is put in motion, however, when two toughs, mistaking the Dude for a millionare named Jeff Lebowski (which is of course the Dude's name), come looking for money owed by the Big Lebowski's -- the millionare's -- reckless young wife. This leads the Dude on a quest to replace a rug that was, well, soiled; a rug that really tied the room together. When the millionare's wife is kidnapped, the Dude is caught up in the noir plot involving a ransom and some suspicious Russian nihilists.     If this all seems a little silly, than the film is a success. And this is only straching the surface of the lunacy; for in this web of characters we have a crazed Vietnam vet, a Latino transvestite who likes to fondle little boys, a feminist artist who likes to swing nude -- except for paint -- onto a large canvas, an adult video mogul, a wandering cowboy, a ninth grader who may or may not have stolen a million dollars, a severed toe, a camera inside a bowling ball, and -- oh yeah -- a brief cameo by Sadam Hussein (not played by himself). All of these ingredients, mixed a healthy dose of vodka and Kahlua (the Dude's favorite drink), makes for a nonstop riot fest. And, in case that weren't enough, there is a fantasy sequence involving nude women on trampolines, magic carpets, vikings dancing with bowling balls, a guy with an enormous pair of scissors, and endless pairs of ugly bowling shoes. The film is great fun, even for non-bowlers, non-pot smokers, and non-White Russian drinkers; the classic quotes are endless. Here are just a few:    \\"Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.\\"  \\"Were you listening to the Dude's story, Donnie?\\"  \\"Shut the f--k up, Donnie.\\" (Repeated on numerous occasions)  \\"I'm not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude; so that's what you call me. That or Duder, His Dudeness, El Duderino.\\"  \\"Who's got your underwear, Walter?\\"  \\"Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.\\"  \\"F--k it, dude. Let's go bowling.\\"  \\"You want a toe? I can get you a toe. There are ways, Dude. You don't even want to know.\\"  \\"You see what happens, Larry? You see what happens? Do you see what happens, Larry, when you f--k a stranger in the a--?\\"  \\"You're being very undude.\\"  \\"Well I guess we can close the file on that one!\\"    And so on.... The funniest moment, for me, is when the Chief of Police of Malibu wings a coffee mug at the Dude's head. I just lose it every time I see that. I don't know what it is; the timing or what. It just comes out of no where, a total curveball response in that situation. Classic Coen brothers all the way. Can't wait to see their newest: No Country For Old Men. \\"The Dude abides.\\" Cheers!
1416523359|2.0|What can I say that hasn't been said? Meandering smucking book! I wasn't sure what was happening some of the time, it was WAY too long for the story...could have been told in less than half the pages! The only thing I can say is that it offered a nice diversion and helped me go to sleep at night! Not a real plus for a suspense writer. Pick one of the Dark Tower books, and you will be glad you did!! Leave thison the shelf as a last choice read.....    That being said, Stepehn King is one of the greatest writers of all time, and my opinion of this books doesn't change my opinion about him!
B000HL09SA|4.0|A very good heartwarming movie. It's about real life so it does pull on the heart strings a little but worth your time to watch

B000L9IUPM|5.0|The Eagles perform a great collection of songs - and not just Eagles songs; there are a few Don Henley and Joe Walsh songs in here too.  They play their major hits.  Eagles hits such as \\"The Long Run\\", \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" and many more are here, as well as Don Henley hits (\\"The Boys Of Summer\\", \\"Dirty Laundry\\", and more) and Joe Walsh hits (\\"Rocky Mountain Way\\", \\"Life's Been Good\\", and more).  They put on a good show, and they're fun to watch.    Video & camera work: The video is very clear and crisp.  The focus is mainly on the band, as I think it should be, with occasional views of the enthusiastic crowd.  Occasional close-ups of individual band members from various angles are also included, and is done very well.  Overall, the video and camera work is excellent.    The sound is good, too.  I only have a stereo sound setup, but I have no complaints on the sound.    This is one of the best concert videos I have seen.  The overall combination of a great set of songs, along with the camera work and video quality, makes this a great choice if you're an Eagles/Don Henley/Joe Walsh fan.
B000PTYP7U|4.0|Besides for the strength of a couple of singles, the lyrics aren't all that outstanding.  The hooks are good but on most songs, not all the innovative.    The lead singer has great energy and an amazing voice.  And on the bright side, if they learn how to adapt their sound into something that's truly original, there's a lot of room for this band to grow.  There's a lot of upside for this band.
0307341550|5.0|Let me preface this with the fact that I've been a longtime Entertainment Weekly subscriber and a reader of Gillian Flynn's TV reviews. (I'm also a Chicagoan and fan of dark, offbeat mysteries.) This said, although this book started off slightly choppy (er, contrived), by the end I was mesmerized by its dysfunctional story and the mystery itself. The writing was snappy (I wouldn't have expected less)... there were a few red herrings (though I kind of/partially suspected the who)... but by the end I found it both dark and disturbing, yet with a sense of jaded humor. In short, I loved it... and hope her next novel has similar tones (and, hopefully, stays in the mystery genre).

B000002JSR|3.0|(The following review is written by Karyn's husband, Ted)     Zeppelin's CODA marked a milestone in the phenonmenal career of the world's biggest band at that time. Widely regarded as their weakest   album, it has grown a bad reputation over the years since its release:  (1982)-Two years after the untimely death of John Bonham, probably the world's greatest rock 'n roll drummer, it marks the end of an era of excess which has never been seen since. Zeppelin is still legendary in the power of what they did onstage as well as off-stage. Private jets, destroyed hotel rooms,underage girls, and baked-bean orgies are only some of the indulgences that can be mentioned here. Most infamous is probably the 'Shark Incident' which involved a real shark and a real girl! Anyway, that was the 70's and back then  Zep set the standard in debauchery. Their music never suffered, and I think CODA isn't as bad as people have been led to believe.'Wearing and Tearing' is the finest track on the CD and yes, overall, CODA is a mashed up helping of leftovers. However, these leftovers still taste great. 'Ozone Baby' is my favorite track and 'Darlene', even though it sounds like they never finished the lyrics, is a great song.In 1980, Bonham was furious that Zep was expected to go back on the road to the USA and tour. They had finished a European Tour at that time ( Bonham collapsed during a show in Germany and the concert was cut short) and he clearly needed some time off. Bonham unfortunately drowned his anger in booze and it's been said he slammed 40 shots of Vodka the night he died. The surviving members of Zeppelin agreed to call it quits, choosing not to replace the legendary drummer. CODA literally means 'The End' and it's a fitting title to the end of an amazing roller-coaster ride of popularity that the band enjoyed all over the world. Let's hope for a Live CD/DVD of their 'Reunion' show in London coming up soon with Jason Bonhamm on drums.
B000VAHR00|5.0|I remember that Logan's Run is the first science fiction movie that I ever watched, which probably has some bearing on how I've rated it.    This movie is based upon the best selling book Logan's Run by William Nolan.  The movie does take some artistic license but nothing too drastic as to completely disown it from the book, such as that horrid movie, Starship Troopers.  The effect is that more people are better able to relate to the characters...also probably because they couldn't find actors young enough to match the book.    Another unfortunate is that after the movie had been edited, the cut tape littering the floor was disposed of rather than saved for posterity purposes.  One of the cut scenes that I wished could have been saved is where Box creates the ice statue of Logan and Jessica.    Many people like to disregard this movie as too cheesy and/or campy; however, you have to put the movie into context as to when it was filmed and released.  The advancement of special effects as seen in Star Wars (released the year after Logan's Run) wasn't available to other studios at the time.  Using miniatures was still considered cutting edge in addition to some of the 3D holograms that were used in the computer room.    I'd highly recommend watching this movie as it's a wonderful return to the mid-70's world of science fiction.
B00004TA41|4.0|I know I say this a lot about Coltrane's work, but this right here is pure insanity. Trane jettisoned his entire band except for Rashied Ali for this release, and didn't bother hiring a new bassist or pianist. Instead, he opts to duet with the drummer throughout the record, which is extremely avant-garde: the \\"songs\\" have nothing that hints at harmony and only sketchy melodies - the second half of that title sure is right, the arrangements have a lot of space. Naturally, Coltrane loses his mind on most of these songs: sometimes it's rewarding (\\"Mars\\"), others it's just annoying (\\"Jupiter\\").So if you gave up on Coltrane around the release of Sun Ship or Ascension, this probably won't win you back. If you're still interested, then you just might find something of substance in Interstellar Space. I don't find this grabs me like some of Coltrane's better material, interesting as it is: it doesn't have the emotional variety of A Love Supreme, and the fact is there's only so much you can do with two instruments. And it's definitely not in the same zip code as Trane's very best releases. Hardcore fans, though, should get it simply for \\"Venus\\", a stunning, transcendent composition that is in the same zip code as Coltrane's best work.
B00000DGUY|5.0|After buying this CD, another version with a great bonus CD came out.  You should buy it instead: [[ASIN:B00000I2GY Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits]] (same title, but check it out).  The 2nd disc contains live concert recording with extended versions and solos.<br /><br />Anyway, I bought this CD to listen to on long drives and it was the most affordable compilation.  Also, my interest at the time was just in the more well-known songs \\"Sultans of Swing\\", \\"So far away\\", \\"Walk of Life\\", etc.  Since then, I find myself listening more to the rest of the CD!  I did not realize what a great musician and lyricist Mark Knopfler is.  His latest release [[ASIN:B000TUXL2A Kill to Get Crimson]] is currently getting a lot of radio play.
B00000I8UK|5.0|An utterly inaccessible but extremely worthwhile jazz masterpiece. There's no piano here - Dolphy plays a variety of woodwinds (bass clarinet on \\"Hat and Beard\\" and \\"Something Sweet, Something Tender\\"; flute on \\"Gazzelloni\\"; alto sax on the title cut and \\"Straight Up and Down\\"); and the band includes other famous jazz figures such as Tony Williams (soon to join Miles Davis and form his own group, Tony Williams Lifetime) on drums and Freddie Hubbard (also of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, Herbie Hancock's Maiden Voyage-era band, and the Coltrane group that made Ascension) playing trumpet. But the real star of the show is Dolphy, merging Monk's innovations in odd chord progression, Coleman's love of atypical harmonies, and Mingus' experiments with song structure - often, the themes are played in odd measures, giving them a tremendously off-kilter feel (the nervy \\"Straight Up and Down\\"; Monk tribute \\"Hat and Beard\\", with an insane vibraphone part from Bobby Hutcherson). The sole ballad of the set, \\"Something Sweet, Something Tender\\", mainly a duet between Dolph and bassist Ron Davis, is beautiful in a weird way, much like some of Coltrane's very last recordings. There's also a strange pseudo-classical experiment (\\"Gazzelloni\\") that's absolutely brilliant, because there is nothing else like it. And I do mean nothing - listen to Dolph's flute. It will dispel all notions of the instrument having a pleasant, easy-on-the-ears sound. It also will dispel all notions of vibes being pleasant and easy-on-the-ears, for those looking to see notions dispelled. It's an insane piece, which is precisely why I love it. That, and it has a bass solo. Those are always good. The amazing title track is probably the worst song here, but it would've been the best on any other album - again, the bass solo really is something. I gotta say, get this right now if you like Thelonious Monk, Ornette Coleman, and/or Charles Mingus - especially if you, like me, like all three of 'em. It's not for everybody, but it's very much worth a buy.body, but it's very much worth a buy.
B000L212HW|5.0|I had Reign of Fire on Dvd, and buying it on blu-ray was a great choice. Crystal clear visuals and sound. This movie has been given a whole new experience.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|First off, let us look at this album's title. It is a German term, meaning something along the lines of \\"Sign of the Times\\". Besides the fact that such a title obviously sets off my Pretense Senses, it's clear to me the album is so titled because Corgan is trying to make a social statement, something he had never really done in the past - this isn't just speculation, either: the album's artwork and songs like \\"Doomsday Clock\\" (an excellent rocker), \\"United States\\" (which is no substitute for \\"Thru the Eyes of the Ruby\\", we'll put it like that) and \\"For God and Country\\" (a bizarre mix of psychedelia and hard rock that's best forgotten about) also take me to this conclusion. Okay, but how's the album? Well, it's a maybe. Not just any type of \\"maybe\\", a definite \\"maybe\\". The tone of most these songs is hard rock: it's like the goal was to recreate \\"Zero\\", \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" and \\"Cherub Rock\\". And recreate them. And recreate them. They do succeed in some places (\\"Doomsday Clock\\"; \\"7 Shades of Black\\"; the single \\"Tarantula\\"). \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\" is a typical Pumpkins song, but it's a good example of Billy doing what I like to call \\"Singing his diary\\" - that is, communicating his feelings in an open way. However, the album does slip in many places. I mean, let's take \\"Starz\\". Criticism of superstar lifestyle? I'm all for it. But couldn't they have bothered to make it, you know, good, and not a mess of churning guitars and stereotypical anti-fame lyrics. Then again, I don't know, maybe I'm stupid. Actually, the other half of this record gets old fast (\\"Pomp and Circumstances\\", which is overcooked; \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\"). In short, Zeitgeist is just another album. Better than the Machina fiasco, at least.<br />P.S.: Like how I made it through the whole album without asking whether or not this was a \\"real\\" Pumpkins record? Think of it like this: Billy and Jimmy were the only original Pumpkins who made Siamese Dream, too.
B00005K3O0|5.0|Saw this movie years ago and it was the first time seeing Anthony Hopkins  and I felt his acting made the movie; it was riveting and I decided, after all the other movies he has done, that I wanted to own one of the earlier pieces of work that he did. Consequently, I chose to purchase the DVD, so that I could watch it when I wanted as it hasn't been on television to the best of my knowledge. So worth seeing and Hopkins was as good then as he is today.

B000Y96EWK|5.0|An action movie can only be as good as it's leading actor. That's why this edition of the Boure Trilogy is the best yet. Matt Damon has evolved into a bona fide movie star, an action hero that can bring a movie to the strongest levels of entertainment. As Jason Bourbe, he shines, especially as he begins to unravel the mystery surrounding his identity. He plays the role both with the male bravado you expect from an action star, and with great heart when he realizes who he is and what the CIA had created within him. This movie is non stop special effects and the stunts are  electryfying. To me, this what the movies are all about. I was glued to the screen..Supporting cast is a superb ensemble of established stars..but it is undeniably Matt Damon's movie. He is Jason Bourne. He's come a long way from the preppy anti semetic student in school days. His roles are all diversified, but carefully chosen, and his brilliance as in Good Will Hunting, shows brightly in this Bourdne movie. I hope the franchise continues.

080701429X|5.0|I am not much on bibliotherapy, but I have lost more copies of this book than any other giving it to psychotherapy clients to read.  This is an incredibly readable, heartfelt treatise on meaning-oriented, existential therapy.  The greatest component to it is that it is not written in an erudite nor an obtuse manner.  Instead, it is written so that everyone can grasp it.  Written from a first-person perspective, with the first part of the book focused on Frankl's personal and interpersonal struggles, trials, tribulations, and explorations while in a concentration camp, this book clearly and simply develops Frankl's logotherapy perspective on therapy.  As I have done before with countless clients, I highly recommend this book for anyone in search of meaning in life.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Michael Moore once again gives us another documentary that is very thought provoking. This time Moore's attention has turned to the US Health Care System.... \\"Sicko\\" doesn't focus on the 50 million Americans without health insurance, but the 250 million Americans whom are insured. Plus, \\"Sicko\\" also focuses on how the US health care system rates with other countries, like Canada, France, England & Cuba.<br /><br />I was really shocked at what I learned about health insurance companies here in the US after watching \\"Sicko\\"... and was surprised to learn about how well universal health care systems work so great for those that live in countries with this type of health care system. It appears that a universal health care system is the way to go after watching \\"Sicko\\". It begs the question: \\"If universal health care is working so great in other countries, then why aren't we implementing here in the US?\\".<br /><br />Not knowing the full scoop/impact of how universal health care really works/effects nations that use this type of health care system, it is truly difficult to say whether our health care system or universal health care is really the way to go. \\"Sicko\\" makes a great case for the use of a universal health care system, but is there more than meets the eye?

I'm sorry to say this is one album that I WILL NOT add to my Duran2 collection.  I think it 's great for kids now that are into all the club music and \\"trashy\\" stuff, but for oldtimers like me, the ones that helped build their career- there's very little of the Duran2 I fell in love with.  What a sad disappointment after the much anticipate wait!  Better luck next time, guys!

0767817478|1.0|There's been worse movies than the American version of \\"Godzilla\\". I haven't seen any, mind you, but I've heard of them. [[ASIN:B0000AGWMF Manos, the Hands of Fate]], \\"Plan Nine From Outter Space\\", and [[ASIN:B0006L0LOS Catwoman (Widescreen Edition)]] are all alleged to be pretty hideous. Most anything put out by Michael Bay is awful. The less said about [[ASIN:0790732912 Batman & Robin]] (which I have actually seen), the better.    But there's a special place in my heart for this movie. A deep, dark, unpleasant place. You see, I actually made the mistake of going to see this awful film in a theatre. I went with my mom, which is usually a very pleasant and enjoyable experience, as she loves the movies as much as I do. In this case not only did the movie deprive us of money and a couple hours of our lives, it also deprived me of a pleasant evening of movie watching with my mum.    Evil bastard movie.    There is absolutely nothing positive I can say about this movie. It's even worse than [[ASIN:B0000844I8 Stargate (Ultimate Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00008G8M3 Independence Day [Award Series]]], which is saying something, because those were pretty terrible movies.    In this film the plot is missing, presumed dead. The actors are all obviously performing as though they're dead. The film takes place mostly in the dark and rain (all the better to hide mediocre special effects). Some of the best scenes are obviously ripped from other, better movies. The government and military are portrayed as complete idiots. I could go on. But why bother? I'll let Roger Ebert do it for me in the first bit of his review from the movie (available at rogerebert.com):    \\"Going to see \\"Godzilla\\" at the Palais of the Cannes Film Festival is like attending a satanic ritual in St. Peter's Basilica. It's a rebuke to the faith that the building represents. Cannes touchingly adheres to a belief that film can be intelligent, moving and grand. \\"Godzilla\\" is a big, ugly, ungainly device to give teenagers the impression they are seeing a movie. It was the festival's closing film, coming at the end like the horses in a parade, perhaps for the same reason.\\"    The memories of this movie will sear themselves into your soul and you will never be able to dislodge them.    Avoid this movie like you would avoid, say, toys made in Leadtown, China.    If you have a choice between a root canal and this movie, go to the dentist.    If held at gunpoint and given the choice of watching this movie or death, then make your peace with god, because watching this movie will be a glimpse into hell.    In case you haven't gathered, I didn't much care for the film. :)

B00000293E|5.0|Willie Dixon really is the Blues, and the genius who wrote many of your classic rock favorites. Unless you already know more about this guy than I did when I bought this album, you'll find yourself saying....\\"I didn't know he wrote that song\\" over and over again. On this album we hear the man who lived the life that became classic rock and roll songs by The Doors, The Rolling Stones, and Eric Clapton. This album is a must have.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|The main merits of this well known tragic story resides on the fact James Cameron supported himself around four fundamental pillars; a solid and involving script, a perfect cast, an admirable soundtrack and  overwhelming stages, carefully and zealously showed, to bring us back a true kaleidoscope of encountered emotions. Of course the last ace of this brilliant filmmaker was to surprise us with the last words of a real survivor of that fatidic tragedy.<br /><br />The film will be remembered for countless reasons, but mostly because the apparently forgotten, overlooked old fashion style about a love story that remits us to Romeo and Juliet at first glance, but then there is a tribute for Gone with the wind and specially Casablanca, powerful love stories that have as common denominator the tragic fact of being a project of life of brief duration.<br /><br />On the other hand, the multiple emotive layers permeate the mind of the viewer, since the most sentimental sequences, the naïve humor, refined splendor of Victorian echoes and the last minutes of chilling realism in which the death smiles trying to tell this couple: \\"You have enjoyed the best the life can give you, you had all the time of the world, apart of the golden statement of Di Caprio \\"I'm the king of world\\" but now is my turn because my time has come.\\"<br /><br />An immortal classic for the next generations of viewers to come.
0143038419|2.0|I really expected to like this book based upon all of the stellar reviews it got.  May be it is my personality not matching up with hers, but I found myself incessantly irritated by the author's narcissism and sappiness.  I am all for introspection and self-exploration.  I have once or twice or, okay, a gazillion times, fallen prey to the itchy feet syndrome when confronted with a life crisis.  I keep wondering why so many people liked this book, and it kind of reminds me of a Fried Green Tomatoes kind of thing, or maybe a Thelma and Louise thing... kind of a \\"you go girl\\" mentality.  I found a lot of the information very interesting, especially regarding yoga and meditation, and it did make me think about my own spiritual life, but I couldn't help but think that maybe she was writing this book with her ex-husband and ex-lover David as an audience.

1594489505|4.0|I enjoyed the book however I did not enjoy it as much as \\"The Kiterunner\\".  The first part of the book moved too slowly.  Perhaps I had set my expectations too high.  \\"The Kiterunner\\" was a hard act to follow.  I would still recommend the book because it was worth reading.
B00005JPS5|3.0|Well my wife wanted to see \\"Bee Movie\\" last night. So there I was hand in hand with my bride walking up to the ticket booth just to get striped of 20 dollars of my hard earned money. I really didn't expect too much from this movie. Oddly, this movie performed above my expectations (which is why I'm inclined to give it three stars). Although the movie is slow in spots, misses on it's humor on more than one occasion, and subjects the audience to Jerry Seinfeld's voice it still out performed itself.<br /><br />The positives of the movie are that it has what I will call it's \\"enjoyable\\" moments. For example, Chris Rock plays a mosquito and at the end of the movie works as a lawyer. I also think most children will enjoy the movie. In the end I'm not sad I saw the movie. However, it's definately a wait until it comes out on DVD flick.
B000UK73QO|5.0|I've been reading spiritual books for 30 years and I have been especially interested in books that help us shift from an ego based perspective to a more soulful and spiritual one.  Though I admire Eckhart Tolle the title of this book was at first misleading. It seemed like it was going to be just another \\"find your purpose\\" title.  It is very far from that! Essentially, this has become the best book I know of for describing what the ego is, and how it radically interferes with true happiness and well-being, not only for ourselves, but for our entire planet.<br /><br />Only as we collectively overcome the ego with its tendency towards separation, fear, and attachment to the pain-body will we create a new earth.  That new earth will be based upon truly spiritual principles, which will help us change our tendency towards war, overconsumption, and the oppression of others.  Instead, we will live in a world that lives in love in part because we understand what love really is.<br /><br />To shift from an ego orientation to one based on love we also need to shift our consciousness.  As we do so we feel more connected to everyone and everything around us.  This book also helps you make that shift and in making the Earth is already made new because you will become one more person capable of living from the heart and helping to rid the world of so much suffering, hatred, and greed. Well worth the read. - Dr. Lisa Love, [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Several of sci-fi author Philip K. Dick's wonderful stories have been translated to cinema over the years, the most notable ones of which are [[ASIN:B00005N918 Total Recall (Special Limited Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], and [[ASIN:B00005JL78 Minority Report (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. I even liked [[ASIN:B0001NBNDY Paycheck (Special Collector's Edition)]] and [[ASIN:0767810880 Screamers]]. But Philip K. Dick's received shabby treatment from the film industry as well, what with [[ASIN:B000JMK6LW A Scanner Darkly]] and with this one, NEXT, which is loosely based on Dick's short story \\"The Golden Man.\\"<br /><br />Some plot SPOILERS follow.<br /><br />The premise of both MINORITY REPORT and PAYCHECK hinges in part on a character's knowledge of future events. Same with NEXT. All his life Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) has been able to see, with precise clarity, 2 minutes into his own future. All his life he's learned to keep a low profile, and even now he, as the Amazing Frank Cadillac, ekes out a living performing in a shabby little magic act in Vegas, wherein he could disguise his talent as a magic trick. Now and then, because his show doesn't pay a lot, he ventures in a small way towards the gaming tables. Cris is real careful. But, it turns out, he hasn't been careful enough.<br /><br />No-nonsense FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) senses that Cris is more than he seems and asks him to help her locate a nuclear bomb set to detonate in Los Angeles. Cris, however, wants no part of it. He's instead fixated on a beautiful girl he's yet to meet, a girl he glimpses in a bout of precognition. But the FBI aren't the only ones spying on Cris. The terrorists, having noted the FBI's interest in the magician, have been keeping tabs on him, as well. And, in Liz, the girl in the vision, the terrorists and the FBI have finally unearthed Cris's weakness.<br /><br />What drew me to the film was the cool sci-fi set-up. And, unlike most films or books, NEXT endows its lead character not with nebulous visions but with well-detailed peeks into his 2 minute window. The most enjoyable and exciting moments in the film deal with Cris utilizing his gift to deftly evade capture in a casino. This sequence, in terms of its pinpoint timing and execution, is very reminiscent of the hide & seek scenes in MINORITY REPORT and in [[ASIN:B000VWYJ86 The Bourne Ultimatum (Widescreen Edition)]]. After that, the diner scene, where Cris finally meets Liz, is the best and the most humorous. Okay, so these are the good things.<br /><br />Where does the film fall apart? Let's start with the villains, who seem to be mainly Europeans, but are mostly ill-defined and seem to appear in the movie simply because token villains are needed. The last half hour of so of the film deals with Cris taking on the baddies, and I can honestly say that these blaring, full-blown action scenes turn out to be the most dull and uninteresting of the lot. I simply didn't care. Another flaw is that there are too many moments throughout the film where the pace seems to just trudge along. What else? How about the introduction of Peter Falk's supporting character early on and then never seeing him again?<br /><br />And then there's the love story, which to me isn't pulled off convincingly. You have the lovely and grounded Liz, as played very nicely by Jessica Biel, and I guess I don't have it in me to believe that a practical girl like her could instantly hook up with someone like Cris, who, at first glance, seems a dubious and creepy character. When she gets guilt-tripped into offering him a ride, I was thinking: \\"How very not clever of her.\\" Admittedly, a large part of it is that I just wasn't feeling any chemistry between them.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I was ready to forgive and forget all these botherations because I liked the sci-fi gimmick so much. That is, until the ending came along and completed the sabotage. The abrupt ending really, really, really sucks! Although, in retrospect, I guess it's a fitting end to a movie which had been spiraling downhill, anyway. On the acting side, I wish Nic Cage would dial down the quirky a bit. Even Jeff Goldblum says he should tone it down. If he does, I feel his characters would be better off and be more sympathetic. Cage is this close to becoming a caricature of himself. I also expected better from Julianne Moore. Props to Jessica Biel, though, for putting in an honest effort.<br /><br />In the \\"Just in case no one's mentioned them yet\\" department, here's what we get for special features, which also let down the fans: the obligatory \\"Making Of\\" featurette (18 minutes); \\"The Next 'Grand Idea'\\" - a 7 minute featurette focusing on a corner of the Grand Canyon (where several scenes were shot) and its Indian reservation; \\"2 Minutes in the Future with Jessica Biel\\" - a brief and boring interview; and \\"Visualizing the Next Move\\" - an 8 minute f/x segment centering on the CG aspects of the film. Overall, a dull set of extras. Sorry.<br /><br />What cleverness there is in this film is ultimately drowned in poor choices and bad film-making. NEXT should've been better. Instead, when folks think of this movie - if they think of it at all - they'll think of the neat sci-fi gimmick, yeah, but also that this one's a derivative action picture with many lulls. In the end, Cris Johnson becomes a character I fear the viewers will forget 2 minutes after having seen the film. And that's just doing Philip K. Dick a disservice.rupt ending really, really, really sucks! Although, in retrospect, I guess it's a fitting end to a movie which had been spiraling downhill, anyway.

0143038419|3.0|All of us suffer from traumas in life, and true divorce can throw you into all kinds of disruptive life changes.  When you are hurting and looking for answers it's natural to begin a quest.  This author was lucky enough to have the funds (and a nice book advance) to begin her own quest across the world in search of healing and spiritual truths. She also had the courage to strike out on her own and travel as a woman at only 34 years of age. Though I can appreciate these qualities in her and much of her journey has humorous and some insightful moments, it seemed more like a travel monologue than a deep journey of awakening. Yes, self-healing and self-acceptance is an important part of a spiritual journey.  But, I kept looking for the deeper insights that come from a true spiritual awakening.  These include an ability to put one's suffering into proper perspective.  When there are literally billions of people on this planet who worry more about \\"eating\\" period and are praying for that, I kept wanting more of a breakthrough in terms of compassion and deep awareness of just how lucky she was to even be able to take such a journey.  Considering I have known many people who arrived at a such a deep level of insight without even leaving their home towns, I was disappointed, especially since she went to India, that her insights were not more profound. Still, many people are not willing to dig into their souls in such a deep way.  And, the author is to be admired for her attempt.  Considering she is still young, and this journey has yet to truly seep into her overall view of life, deeper insight may still emerge.  Then her prayers will go even further and contribute even more to the capacity to love.  - Dr. Lisa Love, [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]
0060839872|4.0|This book is for the philosophically inclined, and somehow I never quite got into it.  I found myself enjoying the events in the book (especially the traveling), rather than the abstractions and ponderings of the author.  However, it's probably a classic for the latter items rather than the former.  I can see why people like it so much, and it is very well written and timeless, but it's not my cup of tea.

0393317552|5.0|This is an amazing book, and a lifetime of research and thinking by Mr. Diamond must have gone into creating it. Even though it is almost 500 pages in length, it concisely covers the basics of much of human history and civilization. Thankfully, Mr. Diamond puts forth the opposite of a racist interpretation of human history. It is very much taboo to suggest that genetic differences between different races resulted in one group of people conquering or dominating another, but it turns out that there are genetic differences in the brain between the populations of people in different countries of the world today. For example, different populations have differences in the composition of certain neurotransmitter receptors, that may influence such things as exploratory behavior (i.e., novelty seeking), and might something like that not influence global patterns of migration? Read C. Robert Cloninger's 'Feeling Good' for more information on dopamine receptors. Another point is that this book seems to have arrived at a time when people want to write and read 'histories of everything'. That type of book seems to be selling well right now. Overall, a very interesting and worthwhile read.  Author of [[ASIN:1846940559 Adjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health]].
0671449028|5.0|I loved this book, it is sooo cute and soooo funny.  It became a regular of our bedtime routine when my twins were toddlers.  No matter what other books we read that night, this was the last one and they knew it signaled time to turn off the lights and go to sleep.  We finally found it after our move and I've now started to read it to my 20-month old son, and my girls, who are now 4 years old, come in and recite it while I'm reading it to him.
0060589469|5.0|Just a note before I forget:  When you buy this book, put your name in the front of it; it is one of those books in my library that I have to replace from time to time as I loan it... and it's never returned....<br /><br />I have seen in my lifetime a tremendous change in American societal attitudes in mental illness.  In the 1960's, anyone running for public office who'd seen a therapist or been treated for depression had to keep that information a deep secret or risk being ostracized.  Now in our daily television viewing we often see commericals for the medications that help treat illnesses like chronic depression.  In fact, we are moving away from the notion that depression is an \\"illness\\" and moving toward acceptance of such things as chemical imbalances.<br /><br />All of this is to say that, back when it still wasn't cool to be on Zoloft or its equivalent (and I wasn't, I swear I wasn't), I read this book.  Not surprisingly (since I was seriously pondering the truth of Hamlet's soliloquy at the time), I don't remember how the book came into my possession.  I only remember being changed by it.  There is a documented tendency toward depression in exceptionally bright people.  Perhaps they think too much.  I refer here to Robert Pirsig, author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  Though bookstores often mistakenly shelve this book as a novel, it is, in truth, a memoir.  But it is not about the troubled mind as much as it is about thought, clear thought, and all its processes.  Though I still cannot fully explain why, this book gave me hope and comfort in a time that was particularly dark.  Even now, with bright candles burning everywhere in my life, I consider Pirsig a kindred spirit.  Buy this book if you are searching... for truth... or for a life preserver.

B000WCBMA8|4.0|There is an air of last-ditch desperation surrounding The Hives' latest full-length album. But it is - like [[ASIN:B000066F6H Veni Vidi Vicious]] and [[ASIN:B0002IQ1PS Tyrannosaurus Hives]] - plagued by the band's biggest asset/detriment. From the beginning, The Hives have maintained that they are the only band that matters, from \\"The Hives are law; You are crime\\" to the brazen cockiness of calling a CD [[ASIN:B0002CHJG4 Your New Favorite Band]]. That attitude lends itself to the full-on assault that makes the opening salvo \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" a turbo charged potential garage rock classic, and then the hook-laden second track, \\"Try It Again\\" is all dance-floor stomp with a kiddie chorus. Do you miss The Ramones? Pine for Detroit noise from early Iggy or The MC5? These tracks and \\"Return The Favor\\" fill that bigger hole and The Hives are ready to do anything in their considerable powers to insure that you not only hear it, but feel it.<br /><br />Those first two songs are everything The Hives (and their most rabid legion of fans) claim they are. Twin guitar slams of attitudes that just overwhelm you with their energy and frontman \\"Howling\\" Pete's undeniable force of rock. But that all-encompassing belief that they are an amazing band and you need to know it forces dopey leftovers like the instrumental \\"A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors\\" and the draggy piano based \\"Puppet on a Sting\\" left on a CD to show the band's warts. For The Hives detractors, these indulgences (including the DEVO-ish \\"Giddy Up\\") are all the evidence they need to dismiss the band as cartoon posers, Stooges wannabes without the guts to make it stick.<br /><br />\\"The Black and White Album\\" is the sound of The Hives trying to overcome that adversarial barrier to the stardom they obviously feel they deserve. The two tracks with Pharrel Williams, \\"Well All Right!\\" and \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S\\" scream mainstream single, with the self-shout-out of \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S\\" seeming to beg for success ala Queen's \\"Another One Bites The Dust.\\" (I should add that it is my second or third favorite track on the CD.) This may also be the cleanest sounding Hives album so far, forcing their neo-garage assault into sharp, and yes, black-and-white relief. It makes \\"The Black and White Album\\" The Hives' most adventurous and (dare I say it) most likely album for world-class success.Dust.\\" (I should add that it is my second or third favorite track on the CD.)

B00000K19E|5.0|This is still my favourite movie and one that I have seen more than 10 times, as I went out and got the VHS edition back then before DVD's were in. It is a movie that can be seen on many levels. Some will see it just as a great action movie which it is, but there is so much more to this film. It is a fantastic depiction of the journey of the spiritual seeker and the difficulties that he encounters within himself as he starts pushing against the prisons of his own mind and the multitude of programs that operates and which keep us small.    It also neatly depicts the way humans are kept as 'food for the moon' in Gurdjieff's words or simply food for ultra terrestrials. In the film this is depicted as humans, being little less than cultivated biological batteries for the machines.    The story is part of a trilogy and all three parts are worth watching more than once, as you will undoubtedly see new things each time. Things that start making sense only after some time of reflection and reading. In this regard I can recommend reading the book by Ouspensky called \\"In Search of the Miraculous\\", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called \\"The Secret History of the World\\".
0887306101|5.0|The author of this book has done an outstanding job interviewing some of the greatest traders of our time and editing these interviews into an easy to read and entertaining format. Who better to learn from than the wizards who turned a few thousand dollars into millions, and most importantly, kept their wealth. The interesting thing is that this book proves that while correct money management and a winning psychology are important for any trader to be successful, there are many different methods to trading that you can use to make money.<br /><br />Here are the common characteristics found in the market wizards interviewed:<br />1. All those interviewed had a driving desire to become successful traders-in many cases, overcoming significant obstacles to reach their goal.<br />2. All reflected confidence that they could continue to win over the long run. Almost invariably, they considered their own trading as the best and safest investment for their money.<br />3. Each trader had found a methodology that worked for him and remained true to that approach. It is significant that discipline was the word most frequently mentioned.<br />4. The top traders take their trading very seriously; most devote a substantial amount of their waking hours to market analysis and trading strategy.<br />5. Rigid risk control is one of the key elements in the trading strategy of virtually all those interviewed.<br />6. In a variety of ways, many of the traders stressed the importance of having the patience to wait for the right trading opportunity to present itself.<br />7. The importance of acting independant of the crowd was a frequently emphasized point.<br />8. All the top traders understand that losing is part of the game.<br />9. They love what they are doing.<br /><br />This book is a must have to round out any traders library.

B000E1MTZE|5.0|I know of friends who only saw the first Matrix movie and that is a shame, as all three parts of the trilogy belong together as the journey of Neo and the change that happens to him along the way. It is a fantastic job that has been done in keeping the quality at the top without descending into making B-grade follow up movies as is often the case with sequels.    It is a movie that can be seen on many levels. Some will see it just as a great action movie which it is, but there is so much more to this film. It is a fantastic depiction of the journey of the spiritual seeker and the difficulties that he encounters within himself as he starts pushing against the prison of his own mind and the multitude of programs that operates and which keep us small.    It also neatly depicts the way humans are kept as 'food for the moon' in Gurdjieff's words or simply food for ultra terrestrials. In the film this is depicted as humans, being little less than cultivated biological batteries for the machines. A scary thought that we humans might not be at the top of the feeding chain.    All three parts are worth watching more than once, as you will undoubtedly see new things each time. Things that start making sense only after some time of reflection and reading. In this regard I can recommend reading the book by Ouspensky called \\"In Search of the Miraculous\\", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called \\"The Secret History of the World\\".
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I have been a guitarist since 86' and I can say that listening to this new album has me truly inspired again.  Where has the music gone where people could actually play their own instruments (without being coached) and sing??!!  I miss melodic rock and hard rock where the music mattered.  I'm a 80's hair spray metal child, but if you cut through the makeup and hairspray there were truly some good musicians to come out of that era.  Not all of them are working at Taco Bell.  :  )   Don't get me wrong but today there are some great bands.  Just take away the \\"Cookie Monster\\" vocals and you might have a hit.  Alterbridge did what they should have years ago and ditch the \\"oh wo is me\\" Stapp and have someone that has some real soul and isn't singing about how bad life is.  Oh and can I mention a word that most music today has forgotten?.... Harmony.  There is a good deal of it going on with this album.  In short, Bravo! and thank you for carrying the rock torch onward and kicking to the curb of the music samples, cookie monster and rap lyrics that have plagued good music for the last 10 years!    As they say in the Navy.    BZ!    Bravo Zulu!!      JamminDude99

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Isn't it funny how most of the one-star reviews here agree with the 5-star reviews of this pseudo-documentary, to wit: Michael Moore has created an entertaining, if somewhat biased, look at the sad state of healthcare in America today.<br /><br />SO WHAT if the Canadian and British socialized medicine systems aren't as utopian as Moore paints them?<br /><br />SO WHAT if the cutting-edge medical technology, that the rest of the world envies, is paid for by the ultra-rich and ultra-insured (and is unavailable to the rest of us)?<br /><br />SO WHAT if Moore staged his odd little stunts (like taking 9-11 rescue workers to Cuba for healthcare) -- these are acts of THEATRE designed to illustrate his basic points in the film.<br /><br />Moore's basic premise -- that the USA is the only civilized [sic] nation on earth to dump patients on the sidewalk for non-payment -- is indisputable.  His film is supposed to make you mad, supposed to raise awareness, supposed to get people questioning the wisdom of 'for-profit' healthcare.  It is not his responsibility to design a better system than is currently in place in Canada, U.K., Cuba, Norway or France.<br /><br />Change in our existing system will be extremely difficult.  The corporations (insurance, healthcare and pharmaceuticals) that profit from the existing system have enormous clout in Washington.  Without an educated electorate, our politicians will never be forced to correct the long-standing inequities in the existing status quo.<br /><br />Moore's film is not so much a 'call to action' as it is a 'call to wake up.'  Our healthcare is broken.  What are we going to do about it?

B00005MNP8|5.0|With its irresistible mixture of candy-coated 60s pop sensibilities, new wave cynicism, and the raw aggression of punk, Parallel Lines is one of the great albums of the late 70s. Its 12 songs are as fun and ferocious as anything the Ramones ever recorded, with a kind of snarl and bite that approaches Elvis Costello's. Songs like \\"Just Go Away\\" and \\"Picture This\\" fuse bouncing, relentless melodies with snidely poetic lyrics, while \\"Pretty Baby\\" is nothing short of gorgeous, candy coated power pop. \\"One Way Or Another\\" has a wonderfully relentless, urgent drive, and \\"Sunday Girl\\" features a hypnotic wisp of melody. There are a few more slightly experimental tunes, such as the icy, ethereal \\"Fade Away And Radiate,\\" or the eternally danceable disco-punk-glam of \\"Heart Of Glass.\\" All in all, this is a fantastic album, easily one of the best of the whole punk movement.
006097625X|5.0|I am learning how to write screenplays and I've heard over and again that film is a visual medium. Well, what really does that mean beyond the superficial?<br /><br />As a kid, I used to read comic books religiously. I stopped reading them when I \\"grew up\\". Now that I am attempting to understand how to tell a good story and how to do so in a way that people immediately grasp what's going on, it surprised me somewhat that some of the authors I've read and whose opinions I respect recommended McCloud's `Understanding Comics'.<br /><br />Reading it now, I can understand why. McCloud's coverage of how to tell a story in a comic book and the philosophy of design is right up a screenwriter's alley. This is literally visual storytelling. McCloud understands and shows the psychology of readers and, by extension, viewers. Then, he shows how to use that knowledge to craft an information-rich story visually.<br /><br />Not only that, but anyone who wants to tell a story graphically, anyone who wants to present using Keynote or PowerPoint, anyone who communicates in fact, should invest in thoroughly understanding McCloud. I'm frankly surprised that the art of my youth is now resurgent in my life, but I'm happy. I was always content reading comics and now I'm content knowing that the philosophy of designing comic books lends itself quite well to writing a screenplay.<br /><br />EDIT: Just as I was about to post the review, I spotted a term in the tags section that completely defines this books: information architecture. Yes, that's it. We're building stories and by so doing, transferring information. McCloud is the architect of the building process.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Note: Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated. Thanks.<br /><br />If you haven't seen \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou,\\" you've really missed a great movie. Very roughly based on events in Homer's \\"Odyssey,\\" this is a tale of three convicts who escape from a chain-gang in the 1930s. Their adventures are crazy, but insightful into the south during the Depression.<br /><br />There are actually a lot of elements from the \\"Odyssey.\\" The convicts meet three \\"sirens.\\" A man running for governor has the first name of \\"Homer,\\" another man is blind in one eye, and in the end, the men wind up in a courthouse where \\"Ulysses\\" metaphorically slays the \\"suitor\\" of his wife.<br /><br />In their over-the-top journey to find a stash of robbery money, they are involved in one incident after another that perfectly catches the spirit of America during the Depression.<br /><br />The music is wonderful, and the songs and comedy will stay with you forever--\\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" and \\"Let's Meet at the River to Pray\\" to mention two of the wonderful songs.<br /><br />I've watched in many times. Highly recommended.

B0001GF2DS|2.0|If you're a \\"Spaghetti\\" buff, it's worth it for the 2nd disc interviews. But I didn't like the extended version. It has always been my opinion that movies at the time they were made, are edited for a reason. I don't see the story value in the added cuts, +, the voices are dubbed by an older Eastwood and Wallach, and it shows. The final blow is the terrible and uninteresting commentary by Richard Schickel. Why they didn't use Christopher Frayling for the third triology film, I don't know. So, I bought the 3 disc trilogy, and that suits me fine.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|I recently watched The Holiday on DVD. I thought it was such a cute movie, the storyline was simple enough but the characters personalities and lives enabled the movie to be riveting nonetheless.    Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet play women living at other ends of the world, with very different careers, but share the common thread of failed relationships. Winslet has spent 3 years waiting and wanting for love that ends up betraying her, and Diaz, too busy with work, finds that her boyfriend is unfaithful. Both wanting to escape their lives for a 2-week holiday, the two women switch homes-which ends up being life changing experiences.    Both women find romance with different men-men who enable them to move on from their past loves.     This film was simply sweet and entertaining to watch. The performances were on point, and all of the plots' ends met. The Holiday is the perfect romantic comedy to watch-with lots of laughs and even more romance!

0525950079|5.0|\\"World Without End\\" by Ken Follett is a monumental work of historical fiction covering the town of Kingsbridge, England, from 1327 to 1361. The history of this fictional town is brought to life through the lives of four main characters: Caris, an independent-minded woman who values her career more than her lover; Merthin, a direct descendant of Tom Builder, the Cathedral's architect, and an architect himself; Ralph, Methin's psychopathic older brother, who values power and position above all else; and Gwenda, a poor peasant woman with perhaps the keenest brain of them all. We meet them as children, and then follow the events in their lives, big and small, over the course of the next 34 years.<br /><br />This book is being marketed as a sequel to the to \\"[[ASIN:0451225244 The Pillars of the Earth]],\\" a book considered by many to be one of the finest works of historical fiction ever written. \\"Pillars\\" has a worldwide fan-base that has been clamoring for a sequel. Now 18 years later, the sequel has arrived. \\"Pillars\\" captured the hearts and minds of historical fiction lovers worldwide because it recreated, with breathtaking authenticity, life during the height of the late Middle Ages. It was set in Kingsbridge during the 12th century, and focused on the building of the town's cathedral. The four main characters in the sequel, \\"World Without End,\\" are direct descendants of the main characters in \\"Pillars,\\" but the book is set a full 200 years--ten generations--later, making these connections rather superfluous. It is clear that Follett has not created a traditional sequel--one that closely follows the main characters through many generations. Here, Follett obviously chose to focus on the town of Kingsbridge, not the immediate descendants.<br /><br />Follett gives us Kingsbridge during one of the more interesting and critical periods in the history of Western Europe--the period when the Middle Ages are ending and the Renaissance is beginning. The author shows us how Kingsbridge reacts to the major forces that occurred during this period: the Hundred Years' War; the weakening death throes of feudalism; and most important of all, the Black Plague pandemic of 1340. The Plague killed more than fifty percent of the population of Europe. Its effect was so enormous that it is perhaps best understood and grasped emotionally through a work of fiction rather than through a work of history.<br /><br />The Plague changed everything. When it was over, the European world was headed in a new direction. One of the most intriguing effects of the Plague was that it caused a major shift in the balance of power from the clergy toward the mercantile class. All of this is faithfully and lovingly recreated in Follett's vision of 14th-century Kingsbridge.<br /><br />On the human level, the novel focuses on the everyday human, political, and economic struggles of Kingsbridge as seen through the lives of the four protagonists. This is a very large novel. At 1111 pages, Follett has amble opportunity to bring not only his four main characters to life, but also a huge supporting caste of townsfolk. Every aspect of the human condition is covered: greed, violence, torture, hatred, lust, love, jealousy, revenge, charity, piety, duplicity, power-mongering...the list is long, and the repetition at times seems endless. I would be remiss if I did not warn you that lusty sex does come up so frequently in this novel that one has to remind oneself that there was little else to do for fun back then. The emphasis on sex did not offend me--actually, it certainly made the reading all that more exciting.<br /><br />Follett did a lot of careful research before writing this sequel. The book is rich in details about the period's architectural, mercantile, and feudal practices. The chapters that deal with the Hundred Years' War give the author ample opportunity to tell us about the technology and art of warfare at that time. If there is a thematic focus in this book, it is demonstrating the shift from a clergy-centered world to a merchant-centered world following the Black Plague. As a result, Follett spend a great deal of time dealing with political and economic developments within the church and the town's merchants. This is necessary, and here Follett succeeds admirably.<br /><br />So, \\"World Without End\\" is not really a sequel to \\"[[ASIN:0451225244 The Pillars of the Earth]],\\" that is, not in the usual sense of the word. Neither book needs the other to be whole. Either can be read without the other, and if both books are read, it really doesn't matter which one is read first. The better book is clearly \\"Pillars,\\" but \\"World Without End\\" is definitely worth the time, and will reward the reader with a memorable and fascinating fictional adventure.<br /><br />Being immersed in either novel is an incredible experience--as close as you'll every get to literary time travel! I loved every moment of it, and know I will return to reread both books again in the future.<br /><br />According to the \\"New York Times\\" (Oct 25, 2007), Ken Follett has just signed a deal with Dutton to write \\"The Century Trilogy.\\" This work will cover several generations of families from the beginning of the 20th century through the Cold War. The first novel is scheduled for publication in 2010. There was no information given about where these novels will be set. Would Ken Follett dare to set it again in fictional Kingsbridge, some 550 years and 27 generations later? Let's wait and see!red world to a merchant-centered world following the Black Plague.

B00003CXTG|4.0|I know there are some negative reviews of this movie and I respect them. I saw this for the first time on DVD and nothing compares with the horror of that attack in 1941 sending America into World War 2. Some of the attack scenes send you direct into the face of battle. Graphic, gripping and so close to being there. Not bad a movie.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is a wonderful film that is likely to earn more respect and recognition as time passes. This is thoughtful science-fiction at its best.

Many are certain to walk away from this film with the feeling that they really can make a good run at their dreams, no matter their background or supposed limitations.<br /><br />As we get deeper into the 21st century with all it's gifts and burdens, humans may find that they need the human spirit more than ever to cope.

0316067598|2.0|I recommend this book only to a select few.  Lone Survivor is a first-person account of the worst Navy SEAL tragedy in its history; as such this is an important book to military historians though they'll be hard-pressed to distinguish what is true and what is false regarding Petty Officer Luttrell's claims about the incredible firefight he was engaged in given the author's easily discredited claims against the media and the Pentagon.<br /><br />For the casual reader looking for a thrill, the book has plenty, bring some tissue as well since 19 of our nation's finest died in this adventure.  However, I caution the adult mentor who is considering giving this book out to a young person; while the book does an excellent job of describing the SEALS and the critical role they play in our nation's security, the author is the antithesis of a good role model given his propensity to lie, an action one doesn't expect from an officer in our military, I certainly didn't.  I advise any mentor to engage in a lot of dialogue with their young reader using the author's delusional thinking as a case study in the importance of critical thinking and what happens when you allow extraneous considerations to cloud your judgment on pivotal decisions as Luttrell claims to have done in this book (where I won't provide an example since it would be a spoiler to the plot).<br /><br />Luttrell was ill-served by his publisher who should have taken a more parental role in editing out PO Luttrell's repeated false claims regarding the media and how rules of engagement are developed which not only get in the way of the story, but take away important pages better served telling us more about his comrades.  I fear these claims will haunt his career as he matures and hopefully weans himself of making such ridiculous claims and having such vile prejudices against other Americans.  The publisher should have also hired a non-fiction ghostwriter rather than an author who writes fiction.  As many of the other critical reviewers have easily portrayed; because it's so easy discrediting Luttrell's claims regarding the media, this leads to doubts regarding Luttrell's fantastic claims regarding the heart of the story - the battle his team encounters against great odds.  Because the battle his team of four engage in against hundreds of the enemy where our SEALS are able to fight for so long, one wants to believe him, yet the lingering example of issues we can corroborate that come up false forces the critical thinker to question anything the author claims that the Navy hasn't been able to verify.<br /><br />Two examples of great boots-on-the-ground stories from fairly recent battles that I recommend with no reservations are [[ASIN:1416574719 House to House]] (a great first person acct of the Battle for Fallujuh) and [[ASIN:0345496612 First In: An Insider's Account of How the CIA Spearheaded the War on Terror in Afghanistan]] with the former book referring to an embedded reporter from Time Magazine that Sergeant Bellavia describes as an important player in getting needed information to the American public, further discrediting this author's false claims.<br /><br />I've written a longer unpublished review that references Luttrell's false claims and will provide them in the comments section of this review if anyone wants to verify my claims against the author.rs have easily portrayed; because it's so easy discrediting Luttrell's claims regarding the media, this leads to doubts regarding Luttrell's fantastic claims regarding the heart of the story - the battle his team encounters against great odds.

B000069KIZ|4.0|Karl Bohm fell into an unusual gap between the traditional reliable Kapellmeister and the genuinely great conductor. He was thoroughly immersed in German tradition, of course, and on that score this set of Brahms symphonies cannot be faulted. If you want the feeling of a very good night at the Vienna Phil., here you go. The orchestra plays beautifully, the sonics are warm and inviting, the interpretations move confidently along. For many listeners this constitutes all that the music has to offer.<br /><br />But there's no real greatness to be heard. Greatness in interpretation implies insight, personal engagement, and fresh imagination. Bohm rarely rose to that level, but as someone who rarely buys his recordings, I msut say that in these works he does feel enaged. The abrupt, impersonal style often associated with Bohm isn't evident. There's also plenty of energy -- the reviewers who mention slow tempos are off base, or else they haven't experienced Celibidache and Klemperer. Those two maestros offer something highly personal in Brahms.  So does Toscanini, whose swift, lean, fierce way with this composer remains an eye-opener. But if I run through the list of great Brahmsians, among whom I would include Karajan, Bernstein and Bruno Walter, the ultimate in conviciton and inspiration remains Furtwangler.<br /><br />That said, this is one of Bohm's most appealing efforts, and I would place it considerably ahead of sets from Muti, Chailly, Jochumn, Sawallisch, late Haitink, and Abbado.  For repeated listening, it ranks in my mind with Haitink's first set with the Concertgebouw on Philips and Bernstein's early cycle with the NY Phil. on Sony. As far as bargain prie goes, this one is hrd to beat.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Where to begin. This movie is my second favourite movie only second to Kill bill Vol. 2. This movie boasts a star studded cast of Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Lucy Liu and the legendary David Carradine, with a special appearence by the also legendary Sonny Chiba.     Tarrantino delivers such an amazing story that cannot be rivalled by any other movie made. This movie is trademark tarrantino, but the whole movie is done in a brilliant new movie making style all together. Its like a patchwork of different short stories each done in their own styles. You see the film take on different characteristics as you go from a scene shot under a regular lense, to a black and white to highten certain elements of that scene, to anime, to a warmer coloured lense and so much more. This is without a doubt one of the most artistically done movies i have ever seen.    The movies litteraly starts off with a bang, making the viewer watch and just go \\"whoa\\" and the ending is equally good in that its one of the best cliffhangers you'll see.     The music intertwines perfectly with the mood of the scene making you feel every twist and turn the movie takes.    Overall this movie is a girl power movie but i beleive that men can enjoy this movie still. It's a story about love, a story about motherhood, a story about revenge and mostly a story about doing all the wrong things for all the right reasons.    Their is a lot of japanese influence in this movie to bring out the honor of fighting and how honourable it used to be to use one's own skill to defeat your enemies. The skill of the art of fighting. Thus making it the newest old skool martial arts movie there is.    Tarrantino fans can appreciate the \\"over the top\\" style of the movie and non-Tarrantino fans will love it right away. This was the first Tarrantino movie i watched and it made me a Tarrantino fan as i discovered the rest of his movies. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the crowning jewel in the Tarrantino collection and a recommend it to anyone.    The story follows a bride who is on a journey to claim what is rightfully her's; the lives of each and everyone responsible for putting her in a four year coma and the murder of her unborn baby. The journey not only takes us to where she's going but also to what brought her to where she is now.    There are some amazing fight scenes, that rival some of the action greats, with enough blood to send aid to the whole of Africa.    There are only a handfull of movies that recieve a 5 out of 5 from me, and this is definitely one of those few. In fact if it was possible i'd give this film a sixth star. Now buy it and watch it, because i guarantee you wont regret it.
055358202X|1.0|There was a time when I was convinced that George Martin was going to single handedly rescue the Fantasy field which seems of late to have been invaded by Lancelot clones and sex starved vampires. I devoured the first two books in this series and even read the third in less than two weeks. But this one got the best of me. I surrender.<br /><br />I struggled through the first few hundred pages over a 3-4 week period and put it aside for a while assuming that I simply wasn't in the right frame of mind to immerse myself in the story. I returned to it a few months later, reread what I had already covered and I have to tell you that it exhausted me. I couldn't finish it. I don't want to know about every GD person on the planet! I want a story with a beginning, middle and an end! Finish this one before the rapture comes and then start another one about a main characters 3rd cousin if you feel the need.<br /><br />Martin has obviously contacted the \\"Robert Jordan (R.I.P.) Disease\\", hereafter known as \\"RJD\\". I actually read the first 5 books of that series only to finally realize that he had no intention of finishing the story in his or my lifetime. Martin seems to have decided to go down this path. Hey, it's his story, his characters and his right to ramble on for decades (?) if he feels it's necessary. I finally decided however that it's my time and money that I'm contributing to his project and I guess that I'm not made of stern enough stuff to suffer through 700+ pages and then have to wait another 2 GD (01/09/2011 - make that 5+ years and counting...) years for the next hard back installment and another year for a reasonably priced paperback.<br /><br />I'm getting off the bus...good luck to those with enough time and fortitude to stay seated until the end of the route.

B0000004V2|5.0|Not wanting to drink the kool-aid or join a club, this popular album nonetheless blew me away and still does. Rich aural washes, amazing guitar riffs, gorgeous hooks, melodies, lyrics & beats that never get tiresome. At first I would only lsiten to the ten minute epic 'Fools Gold' but slowly noticed that every single song got the same attention and level of production. If you ask me to write about movies, long limber analysis flows, but in the presence of a great music, I'm kind of dumbstruck.     I'm with the majority. This is astonishing, joyous, living, ravishing, layered music. Finest CD ever.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This was one of THE best new shows on TV this fall, I am surprised that AMC has not jumped the gun and put together a DVD box set together for holiday buyers!      Echoing the sentiments of previous posters, this show was multi-faceted, with subtle layers, meaning you could watch it over and over again and find a small detail you missed the first time.      I can't wait for MADMEN next fall!
B00004R99F|5.0|This is hands down one of Disney's best lesser known and lesser mentioned classics. As everyone else has given a pretty good description of the movie, I wanted to say that this is a wonderful movie that has stood the test of time. This is a film that anyone can see and take away a great lesson. I first saw this when I was very young and I took on the viewpoint of Max. When I had small children, I understood a little more. Now, that I have teenagers, there is so much much more...I really enjoyed the second film and the Disney series Goof Troop but A Goofy Movie will always hold a special place in my families heart.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an excellent series that left TV too soon.  Shepard Book was a conundrum wrapped in an enigma. Ron Glass a great comedic actor from Barney Miller raises the bar in this role.  Gina Torres is just great.  As a warrior woman and the first officer of Serenity she is great.  Her athletic ability and acting are superior. If you get a chance check out Gina Torrres in Alias.  The rest of the crew is made up of actors who work well in this show.  Watch the series in the order that Josh meant you to see it then watch the movie Serenity that tells the back story of River Tam.  The bond between Gina Torres and Nathan Fillion as soldiers who fought a war together and now our travelling the cosmos is well done.  It is not the antiseptic space of Star Trek instead it is a gritty adventure series.  Check it out you will enjoy both the movie and the series.

B000002P2V|4.0|I bought this back in 1980. My first Who album. I haven't listened to it in over a decade, but listening to the samples on this site now I realize now how this may have seemed like a weak album back then. It doesn't sound quite as hard edged as I remember it. Still, this should have been their final studio release . . . not Face Dances, not It's Hard, and certainly not whatever The Wire is supposed to be.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|The only NL movie that I like. This one has me laughing so hard.If anything can go wrong for Christmas, it will happen to Chevy Chase and his family! For a some laughter, watch this movie. I only recommend this movie for older audience for crude humor and language.
B000002OX7|5.0|Their best non-concept album. The best of the Lifehouse material. I wonder what the radio DJs at the time (1971) thought of the long synthesizer intro to Baba? Since there was nothing else like it then, they may have thought Townshend had gone mad.
B000W1V5VU|2.0|This movie is sooooo slow and never gets a good take off. The filming is dark and you can hardly tell who is in each scene. The story line could have been a good one but the filming ruined it. So far Ocean's 11 is the best of the three.
B0001DMPVI|5.0|Eric Burdon has a voice that's full of longing, for what might have been and what could still be if people didn't act so much like people act. It can make you sad or it can motivate you to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|A good second movie but just lacked the umph of the first movie. I always hate it when they kill off a MAIN character. If they hadn't gotten rid of her then might have given it one more star. THe excitement is still there and the story line is still good.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|War heroes are not what the once were.  We know of their actions and their trails but little do we remember their names, their home towns, or what they were fighting for.  However, there is one exception to this, the war heroes of the world wars.  It is easy to name off men from those times and what they did.  In this day and age we have almost completely forgotten those heroes of World War I most if not all veterans of the war have passed on now, yet we should still remember these brave men for their sacrifice during the first war and their determination to make that the \\"war to end all wars\\".  To help us with this task of remembrance, we take a look at Sergeant York, a Howard Hawks film from 1941.<br /><br />The film tells the tale of Alvin York (Gary Cooper in an Oscar winning role), a rural Tennessee man who has more interest in fighting and drinking than farming or settling down.  We learn early on the York is a crack shot by shooting his initials into a tree outside the town church.  York soon discovers Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie) a local girl that York competes for with another local farmer and tries to set his life straight.  He works for a solid 2 months to raise 60 dollars for a farm of his own so he would have the ability to marry Gracie only to see this land sold to Gracie's other suitor.  York, in frustration, goes back to his drinking ways and on a ride home during a violent thunderstorm, he is struck by lighting and lives, only to find religion and become a model citizen of the town.  Soon after, the United States declares war and the men of the town rush to sign up for the armed services, all men but York.  York tries to be exempted due to being a consciousness objector but sent away to basic training anyway.  While in basic training York impresses his superior officers with his shooting ability and is promoted before being sent over to Europe.  Once there, York has to lead his squad during the battle of the Argonne Forest where York, almost single handily, takes out the German defenses and captures over 100 men.<br /><br />Gary Coopers Alvin York is one of those film characters that seemed the perfect fit for the actor and time frame.  The film was released in mid-September 1941, a little of 3 months before Pearl Harbor and was accused of being pro-war by many pacifist/isolationist at the time.  Yet, the film doesn't really cross on or the other line on war, rather letting the viewer decided, along with York, what the right decision is for him.  In the end, York gives his commanding officer the reasoning behind his logic for killing all those Germans and it is an answer you hear a lot, both in movies and real life.  (No, I'm not going to tell you what it is, watch the film to learn what it is).<br /><br />Cooper is an inspired casting for the role, and was the hand picked person for the job by the real Alvin York himself at the time.  It is hard to picture someone else pulling off that role.  Cooper is the greatest every man to act in film.  His stature and features were not awe-inspiring but his actions on screen showed that he was a man to be reckoned with.  You have to wonder what Cooper would be like today if he was acting.  Most likely he would be a character actor for movies and not have the fame and notoriety that he has now.  The best example I can think of an actor being on Cooper's level would be Michael Parks and his many characters that he has played over the years.<br /><br />The war in this film occupies very little of the film, taking only a portion of the last act and moves very quickly.  We do not see how York lived or interacted with his fellow soldiers other than boot camp and we certainly don't see other battle experience other than Argonne Forest battle.  Outside this fact, the movie does an excellent job establishing York and his character in the film.  I enjoyed the ending in New York where a still humble York asks to go home and turns down a six figure paycheck for endorsements for farming.  To me, which summed up York in the best way possible, he did what was right in his mind with his beliefs and he didn't want any more than the next man for what he did.<br /><br />In my limited research for this review, I found that most of the movie was fairly accurate to the life of York, though his conversion to religion did not happen in the flash of lighting bolt but with a steadfast attention of his wife and going to Sunday school masses. I'm sure there are other smaller items floating around here and there but that's not a bad record of inaccuracies compared to most \\"true story\\" films these days.p York in the best way possible, he did what was right in his mind with his beliefs and he didn't want any more than the next man for what he did.

B00023B1LC|5.0|Wow! Who would have thought Matt Damon would be a great action/James Bond type? It worked well! This is definitely a good role for him. Action, romance and revenge makes this an A+ movie.<br /><br />A hitman loses his identity and spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out who he is while along the way he finds the woman for him and the truth he needs to move on with his life.
B000WBZ5M0|3.0|(2 1/2 *'s) The draw of this gambling caper film understandably comes from the ensemble.  Just throw George Clooney together with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Eliott Gould, Bernie Mack, Casey Affleck, Al Pacino, and Carl Reiner; add an impossible plot; and let them run from the starting gate. The plot is almost impossible to untangle, but it's a fun piece of nonsense nonetheless.  Ocean (Clooney) wants to win back the casino business to Reuben (Gould) whose rival is a casino hotel owner (Pacino).  The sabotage is multi-faceted and often can raise eyebrows.  (It seems that some of the work would have to be more slippery to escape detection, and the sabotage would have to be less costly than the payoffs might suggest.)  The film's methods at least give the venture some credibility, and the execution is too breezy to make us even care.  Often friendly and fun, 'Ocean's 13' has a message added to the mix in a way that doesn't seem tacked on but naturally fits into the story.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Tom Cruise as the bad guy! I liked it. He did a great job and that was scary. Jamie Foxx's acting was also great as the \\"what the heck have I gotten myself into\\" cabbie! The acting is what made this movie great. The content is for adults only.<br /><br />A hitman decides to take a taxi, obviously the wrong taxi!
0060989157|5.0|Excellent, hugely entertaining. Sometimes you'll ask \\"have they really done THAT?\\"  Makes you help to understand the characters and appreciate the songs (buy red white and crue..)even more. Only regrets are it stops in 2001...but if you have followed the news, you'll notice reality really has changed a lot.. apart from the use of substances perhaps. Warning: it's very difficult to put this book down once you start reading...
B0006J28MI|5.0|Lonely Richie Rich makes new friends, rescues his family from extiction, and makes a few million all at the same time!

B000Y179KO|5.0|im not thrilled about the whole wallmart thing but if you are a fan this is worth it.the EAGLES harmonies are all intact.The songs are well written  they have the sounds of classic EAGLE tunes as well as solo HENLEY,WALSH  and FREY.Stand out songs are HOW LONG,NO MORE CLOUDY DAYS,DO SOMETHING(TIMOTHY B. SCHMIT on vocals)on disc one.Disc two opens with the title track LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN which is a really good song but its over 10  minutes long.I DREAMED THERE WAS NO WAR an instumental track written by   GLENN FREY which is simply beautiful.SOMEBODY another good FREY SONG.JOE WALSH has a song called LAST GOOD TIME IN TOWN which so like WALSH fantastic as he can be.Overall this cd is well rounded with COUNTRY,ROCK,POP even FOLK.Its not HOTEL CALIFORNIA by any measure but for guys that have been around as long as these guys,you really can't expect much more.As the EAGLES go I always preferred DON HENLEY even solo wise.But this cd it's GLENN FREY who shines brightly.
B000641D2Y|4.0|A good sequel to Home Alone. How do they keep leaving this kid? Full of funny antics that leave you laughing. It is a good thing that the bad guys from #1 made it to New York just in time to get some revenge while Kevin is there also! Cute movie I can recommend for all family members.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I PURCHASED ALL 3 STAR TREK-ORIGINAL SERIES ON DVD. THE PICTURE QUALITY VAREIES IN CERTAIN EPISODES. THE WORST ONE WAS (CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER)NEEDED TO FIX THAT.

TO REMEMBER THE PAINTED SCENCE'S IN THE BACKGROUND. JUST LIKE I SAID IN MY REVIEW'S WHEN TV SHOW CAME OUT. WE WILL BE PURCHASING THESE AGAIN.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Dark. Creepy. Eerie. Nightmarish. Surreal. Mysterious. Haunting. Fascinating. A movie that keeps challenging you continuously from the beginning to the end, and even years later. David Lynch's best movie. And one of the finest movies ever made. Do not expect to understand everything in the movie when you watch it for the first time. I didn't, and probably, most people don't. I had heard much about this movie before I watched it for the first time. After I finished watching it, I was like, \\"What the c**p? What is it trying to say? Doesn't make much sense at all, huh! Pretentious!\\". No, it didn't make sense. Everything in the movie seemed so incoherent on the surface. But then, it kept coming back to me. The whole movie kept replaying in my mind. I just couldn't get it out. And slowly, things started making sense. And then, a few days later, \\"Whoa! This is amazing. I can't believe this. David Lynch is a genius!\\". That was three years ago. Today, the movie has grown on me and still keeps haunting with its bizarre imageries (including the unforgettable last scene).    I don't want to include any spoiler in my review, but let me just say that the movie is actually about a nightmare. This is David Lynch at his best. He has created his own style that no other director can match. Even his other movies look weak compared to this one. The entire cast is great, but I can't help but make a special mention of the amazingly beautiful Laura Harring and the cool Justin Theroux.    Don't judge this movie by the number of stars it has been rated with. If you are looking for a totally new experience and wanting to challenge yourself, \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" might just turn out to be the ride of your life.
B000Y44LBG|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />In what is possibly the best gangster picture since \\"Goodfellas,\\" Denzel Washington stars as Frank Lucas, a real life drug lord who reigned over Harlem from the late 1960's to the early 1970's.  Lucas rose to prominence when he began buying his supplies directly from a military connection in war torn Vietnam, allowing him to push a \\"purer\\" product at a cheaper price than any of his mob competitors.  Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, an \\"honest cop\\" from New Jersey who leads an undercover investigation into the source of all this suddenly abundant street heroin, a search that ultimately leads him to Lucas himself.<br /><br />As written by Steven Zaillian (derived from an article by Marc Jacobson) and directed by Ridley Scott - two old pros who certainly know how to craft a quality movie - \\"American Gangster\\" is an epic tale of crime and punishment  that pays due homage to all the classic gangster pictures that have come before it.  Americans have always had a love/hate relationship with law breakers and gangsters.  Although we may be appalled by their callous indifference to the suffering of others, we can't help but admire their steely-eyed determination and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as their ability to turn the American Dream on its head with impunity (until they`re finally caught that is).  And Lucas is no exception, for here is the classic figure of gangster mythology - a boy from the streets who rises from obscurity to command his own empire, only to have it crumble before his very eyes when his own hubris and overreaching prove too much even for the gods themselves to countenance. In a strange moral paradox, much as we may like to see gangsters succeed, we also like to see them brought low and given their just desserts - if for no more morally admirable reason that that we envy them.  Lucas comes replete with that special cognitive dissonance that all gangsters seem to possess, and which allows them to live two entirely separate and compartmentalized lives, free of the guilt and hypocrisy that keep the rest of us duty-bound and law-abiding.  For despite his ferocious temperament, indifference to human suffering, and callow willingness to exploit human tragedy for his own personal gain, Lucas protects his neighborhood, dotes on his mother and family, and loves his wife.<br /><br />Ironically, Roberts, the cop, has less worth celebrating in his own life - his wife is divorcing him and moving with their son to Las Vegas, his fellow cops don't trust him (for the reason that he ISN'T on the take), and his hopes of becoming a defense attorney may come to naught if he can`t conquer his paralyzing fear of public speaking.  Yet, Roberts has one thing going for him that Lucas doesn't - he knows the difference between right and wrong, even though he doesn't always act on that knowledge when it comes to his own personal (as opposed to professional) life.<br /><br />Yet what truly distinguishes \\"American Gangster\\" from its recent movie counterparts - more even than the storyline or characterizations - is the tremendous amount of texture Zaillian and Scott bring to the picture.  Every scene is filled with intense interactions between characters, intriguing background information (especially the TV reports from Vietnam), and spot-on period details.  And even though Washington and Crowe appear together only in the closing moments, their powerhouse performances make the two concurrently running stories feel all of a piece.  It should also be noted that, for a gangster picture, \\"American Gangster\\" doesn't feel the need to wallow in excessive violence or gratuitous sadism.  It is much more concerned with the people involved than with their on-the-job activities.<br /><br />As with even the best of movies these days, \\"American Gangster\\" could use a little trimming in its later stages, where it suffers a bit from distention and attenuation.  Moreover, the final scenes feel a trifle implausible and pat despite the fact that they are reportedly based on fact.<br /><br />Still, these are minor shortcomings in a movie that is firing on all cylinders for most of its running time.d on fact.

B000007492|2.0|While others will appreciate samplings from a wide variety of albums, I have to stop and point out that this is called \\"The very best of...\\" NOT \\"A broad overview of...\\".  'Even in the quitest moments', 'Fool's Overture' are obvious hits that did not make it here, whereas songs such as 'Cannonball', 'Rudy', 'Hide in your shell', and 'Crime of the Century', are just so-so songs and not well-known at all. In fact, when I listen to them I'm not sure if I have even heard them before. 'Crime of the Century' was an album title and so is well-known, but critics  considered the album and that song to be a real 'crime'!<br /><br />Of course, this is pretty typical of what the music industry does: intentionally holding big hits off a \\"best of\\" album.  I have grown used to it, but that doesn't mean I am ever going to approve of it.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|It's refreshing to see a young band out there that's musically ambitious.  With all the disposable music floating around out there, it's nice to see an album like this.  The title track, \\"Dead,\\" and the \\"Yesterday\\" song stand out.    This album reminds me a little of Queen, a little of the tune-smithing of Foo Fighters . . there's a little of everything thrown in.    This review comes from an old guy normally into Wilco or U2.    Bravo.

1860498833|5.0|Deftly plotted with fascinating characters who wallow in the depths of psychological intrigue while illuminating the marginalized roles of women in Victorian England. The story is powerfully narrated by Sue and Maud, two orphaned women from opposite worlds of privilege and poverty who struggle between intelligence and instinct to discover they share an inexplicably intertwined destiny. Sue grows up in a Dickensian den of thieves or \\"fingersmiths\\" in the slums of London, where a scam means survival. Maud lives a sheltered, privileged life in the country as secretary to her book collector uncle. Sue is brought into Maud's life and opens her mind and heart when the ironically monikered Gentleman makes Sue a tool in his elaborate scheme concocted to take advantage of Maud's inheritance. The story moves through the lush greenery of the country, the dusty scourge of Victorian London, and the humid desperation of the madhouse with sensual details that envelop the reader as Gentleman's plan goes devastatingly awry.

B00003JRCQ|1.0|the only good things about this movie is -best pictures - other wise is the most boring story ,It is very slow , after I finished watching it ,   I was wondering what is the story about ?? I dont recomanded for anybody .  Effie

B00005JNTX|3.0|This was more violent and sadistic in content than I was prepared for, but that's probably a natural hazard when you're turning comic books into films.  The major weakness was that the individual stories were not adequately tied together at the end, and that reveals some weak scripting and a lack of immagination that otherwise flooded the screen.  The separate plots in, for example, Heavy Metal, were linked in a fashion that gave me a chill (or two).  Brilliant imagery, brilliant dialogue at times, and well packaged...but no chill.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I'm no fan of Gwen. I'm not a fan of her first solo album (which was trash), and No Doubt was a fairly overrated band, although the days when she sported the pink hair were the days I actually liked her, which is why I still sort of follow her career now. Nowadays I cringe when I hear any of her new material, walk as far as possible from her cheap looking yet outrageously expensive purses at Macy*s, and I try not to worry about her son who may one day get kidnapped by a creepy stalker after seeing the many times she smiled with the baby on a stroller, BEGGING for someone to snatch him.    Okay. I promise the rest of the review will talk about the album. There are no other better words to describe the songs than tiresome, annoying and pointless. Gwen has not seemed to grow up in terms of making anything worthy of anyone's time. Her voice is really annoying and extremely nasal, and the production of the music does not make it sound any better. As a musician she has downgraded several notches. Her music gets worse with each album. And honestly, judging by how awful the last No Doubt album was, it's not going to surprise me that their upcoming album will be just as terrible.    To be honest, Gwen is just like Beyonce, Christina and various other female singers who try too hard to blend in to what's hot at the moment. With the foul state of what r&b and hiphop is right now, it's not a surprise that Gwen has released some ridiculously bad content on this album. The nonsensical \\"Wind it Up,\\" for example, sounds like nothing but a way to cater to the audience that wants a poorly produced beat and lazy \\"rapping.\\"    Stay away from this like the plague if you really don't want to waste your time on juvenile lyrics with annoying background music to accomodate it. Sorry Gwen but I suggest you kindly step down before the wrinkles are visible through your makeup.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Heard this today while Christmas shopping for music--Then came home and bought it here.  If you like \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" this one will most likely captivate as well.  The more your hear it, the more you like it.  Can't wait to load into ipod.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|It would seem that Tarantino slapped together all the dialogue of his first three movies, a car chase and a lap dance when he made this.  None of the effort that rodriguez made in \\"Death Proof's\\" predecessor, \\"Planet Terror\\" can be seen in this film.  The first time I watched the movie I found myself sighing and wishing I could go to sleep after watching one of the best rodriguez films ever.  I decided to see it again, \\"Death Proof\\" is better and better each additional time you watch it.  However, it's hour of Tarantino dialogued isn't interrupted with any considerable amount of distractive blood and violence like all of tarantino's other films.  Yeah, there are two lengthy car chase segments...(the first of which is hilarious, the second too long and regretfully unclimactic).  All in all, this is a good film and should be in your collection.  But don't expect anything different from Tarantino in this one, and don't expect to be as entertained as you were when you watched Planet Terror.

B000HCO8IQ|5.0|Any fan of Seventies music like myself will love this album as with the debut - but what surprises the hell out of me is that not one review recognized what may well be the biggest influence upon the Scissor Sisters' sonic pallette.....put it this way, do not delay in your purchase of the following albums if money isn't an object: Blows Against The Empire, Dragonfly (featuring the minor Hot 100 hit \\"Ride The Tiger\\") Spitfire (featuring \\"With Your Love\\") and Red Octopus (this with the monster hit, \\"Miracles\\", which \\"The Other Side\\" thoroughly evokes).....any Seventies music aficianado will recognize those titles as part of the JEFFERSON STARSHIP catalogue - true, there is a LOT of Sir Elton in the Sisters' sound, but Jake Shears also vocally resembles, at turns, Andy Pratt (check out \\"Avenging Annie\\" for a near-perfect Billy Joel-Bee Gees blend and you'll readily agree it's a tune this combo needs to revive) Kenny Loggins/Lindsey Buckingham (of Fleetwood Mac) but, when not in the upper vocal reaches, frequently like a bizarre hybrid of the Starship's Marty Balin AND Grace Slick, especially on \\"The Other Side\\", \\"Everybody Wants The Same Thing\\" - even \\"Take Your Mama Out\\" from the debut.   Finally, I'm even more surprised that no review acknowledged from where the ONLY source of that catchy \\" I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\" rhythm could've been derived: \\"December '63 (Oh What A Night)\\" by Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons, still heard many times a night in American DJ rotations.....

B0001L3LUE|3.0|\\"Fog of War\\" is a little documentary that basically gives controversial former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara a platform to talk about his life and defend his actions for posterity. Although an unseen interlocutor poses a question every now and then, it can hardly be described as an interview, or even a conversation. A few damning clips are inserted by the producers, but for the most part, they give McNamara enough rope to hang himself and he does.<br /><br />I watched this movie without really knowing much about McNamara except that he was the Defense Secretary during the Vietnam War. I came out of it hating him. McNamara was one of our Ivy League \\"Big Brains\\" who have been such a scourge upon this nation. He undoubtedly was intelligent, and to this day is still immensely proud of his intellectual standing and achievements, even going so far as to crow about how he was the smartest kid in his grade school class. He went on to be a statistical analyst in WWII and rose to become president of Ford Motors, where he had modernized the company and dramatically increased profits. That's where the trouble starts.<br /><br />For some reason, JFK asked him to become his Defense Secretary. McNamara rightly protested that he was completely unqualified  for the position but eventually succumbed to vanity and accepted, continuing to serve under LBJ after the assassination. The problem with McNamara is that while he knew the Vietnam War was unwinnable, and even told the President so, he lied to the American people and continued to implement policies he knew were simply resulting in the needless deaths of our soldiers. Whether it was a misplaced sense of loyalty to the President before the nation, or if it was because of a sordid addiction to power, McNamara betrayed the public trust and well deserves to be despised as one of the most amoral empty suits ever to hold such power in America. When asked if he felt some responsibility for the Vietnam debacle, he replied in the negative without the slightest hesitation and blamed LBJ. McNamara's career showed us that having a Big Brain doesn't mean that you also are also endowed with courage, honesty, or principles.e slightest hesitation and blamed LBJ.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool's 5th album in 17 years.  They are not the most prolific band in the industry but every album they have come out with has been groundbreaking, epic and timeless, and their last, 10,000 Days, is no exception.  I am tired of reading all of these reviews that say that Tool has slackened and their last effort is a disappointment. It isn't! Just because it's not Aenima or Lateralus Pt. 2 does not mean that it's worse.  They're not exactly moving in a completely new direction with 10,000 days (their music in general is already a completely new direction), it is simply a new chapter in their book of head-scratchingly amazing and complex albums.  Minus the filler, every single song is a winner.  Even the drawn-out Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days have their purpose.  They are not necessarily supposed to go somewhere specific or invoke rocking out, but they create an atmosphere that is undeniable.  Vicarious and Jambi are both complex rockers in the epic Tool vein.  Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days tone it down but nevertheless keep the listener interested in what's to come.  The Pot picks up with the rocking with the help of the intricate bass lines courtesy of Mr. Chancellor.  The last 3 songs are no worse or less epic.  The only tracks that can be skipped on the album are the filler, which I've never been too big of a fan of.  I'm not going to go into song specifics as most of the people reading this are probably already Tool fans or have at least had some previous exposure and are not completely unfamiliar with their music.  My main point here is that it's not a step down for Tool.  It was undoubtedly the best rock album of 2006.  I'm not saying that it is necessarily their best album (I personally am partial to Aenima) but it is nonetheless an excellent album and far from a disappointment.  If you are a Tool fan and debating whether to get this then do not hesitate.  It is an excellent continuation to Tool's unique ability to boggle minds.  Or if you are just a metalfan in general don't hesitate to pick this up either. It will make you headbang and think at the same time, something that has not been done properly in a while.  Bottom line, it is just good.  It's good for Tool and it's good for metal in general.  It's just plain good.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|It has been a very long wait indeed for a proper, high resolution 2 disc anamorphic DVD of this epic medieval tale of passion and chivalry.  The final results are breathtaking.  The transfer is stunning and the sound is rich and full.  This is rousing entertainment on the grandest scale.<br /><br />It's hard to understand why this film took so long to arrive on DVD.  Perhaps, as some have suggested, the subject matter has been an issue in our over-sensitive, shrinking world of religious violence.  Or our discomfort with nebulous concepts of love, forgiveness and peace.  But most likely a matter of rights and licensing issues.<br /><br />The relevance of this extraordinary film remains current and is a monumental artistic achievements of world cinema.  On a personal level, this terrific film provoked me into thinking about how belief systems -- especially about the nature of God (or Allah) -- benefit or harm our world.<br /><br />The essence of the conflict between warring Castilians and Moors and an invading Muslim threat is unflinching in the opening scene as the North African holy warrior  Ben Yussuf quotes \\"the Prophet\\" as promising to conquer the world in the name of Allah.<br /><br />But the real conflict is the idea that there can be peace -- and perhaps even love -- between those who hate.  This is exemplified in the troubled and intimate story of Rodrigo (Charlton Heston) and Ximena (Sophia Loren).  It begins simply enough with a knight on his way to meet his bride when destiny forces a detour.<br /><br />El Cid, the legendary hero of Spain was a real person named Don Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar.  He lived around 1035 A.D.  Although he spent much of his time fighting on the side of the Moors, he became identified as the best incarnation of the true Castilian Christian spirit.  His name came from the Arabic \\"sayyid\\" meaning \\"lord\\" or \\"chief.\\"<br /><br />Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren are perfectly cast as larger than life figures of flesh and blood.  Their reported confllcts on-set probably added a degree of on-screen realism.  They are wonderful together.  Too bad Heston and Loren were not able to do a full, shared commentary at the time of the transfer.<br /><br />Anthony Mann's direction is robust and true to the theme.  The movie has a fine sense of composition that the terrific on-location cinematography only enhances.  Numerous action-filled vistas fill the screen, richly detailed and beautifully photographed.  No CGI elements can rival the texture of a real place captured on celluloid.<br /><br />The incredible flow of stunning images and the magnificent Miklos Rozsa score are a reminder of what movies can do when they tackle a worthy tale and go all the way.<br /><br />EL CID is about a real hero who selflessly followed his moral compass.  It's also  a reasonably true adapataion of the essence of the numerous medieval tales, plays and poems -- unlike the mangling of both poem and hero \\"Beowulf\\" in the recent movie of the same name.<br /><br />Amazing that this magnificent paradox of a tale -- after all, El Cid was a warrior and peacemaker -- continues to be told for a thousand years.<br /><br />The extras on the second disc include interesting featurettes on producer Sam Bronston, director Anthony Mann and composer Miklos Rozsa as well as vintage radio interviews with Heston and Loren and a \\"making of\\" documentary.<br /><br />The last scenes are a fitting epitaph for Charlton Heston the man and the actor.  His passing is truly the end of an era.<br /><br />This great movie deserves a place in any digital library.  Don't miss it.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.added a degree of on-screen realism.

B000002897|5.0|Released in the fall of '92' \\"Sweet Oblivion\\" was Screaming Trees second album released under a major record label.  One of the first songs they recorded for this album is \\"Nearly Lost You\\" which was to promote director Cameron Crowe's quirky Seattle love triangle movie Singles (1992).  It's a pretty good song \\"Nearly Lost You\\" has a very catchy beat and some interesting drumming by Mark Pickerel who bailed on the band after the recording to \\"Nearly Lost You\\" was finished.  \\"Shadow of the Season\\" is my other favorite song on this album, the songs sounds like a mix between bluegrass and rock.  \\"More or Less\\" has this sinister slow rock sound to it.  \\"Butterfly\\" my third favorite song had this calm and steady sound to it.  \\"The Secret Kind\\" is a fast paced sound that reminds me of Led Zeppelin's \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" and Ramones's \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\".

Even before its played once!  Good going, Atlantic.

B00005JPS9|1.0|The future of movies is here.  BEOWULF is stunning in crystal clear, ultra sharp Imax 3D and big wattage surround sound.  A big epic adventure that has an incredible sense of mood and time and place.<br /><br />However, what's missing is the heroic heart of this most ancient of English tales when the friction between paganism and primitive Christianity was generating political conflicts and offering liberation.  Why did the screenwriters decide to suck the life blood from Beowulf and offer a not so subtle Christian bashing subtext and hero so flawed that he loses his legendary worth.<br /><br />The final fight of a redemption challenged hero with his own offspring is ludicrous.  As is Wiglaf's lingering temptation with a seductive Grendel.  Our 13 year old son, no doubt the target demographic was also disappointed with the movie.  He has read various versions of the epic poem and wondered why Wiglaf didn't throw an axe at Grendel's mom in the end.  Has Wiglaf learned nothing being Beowulf's best buddy al these years?<br /><br />Check out the 3D, then read Seamus Heaney's transl;ation or better yet, listen to the CD.<br /><br />In our age of religious conflict, is it possible to have a flawed but morally principled hero who will risk all for not for the glory and the fame and the fortune, but to remove the evil that has befallen an enemy?  That's the question.  How can an an enemy become an ally?  Beowulf is clearly a type of Christ figure and that has been removed from the movie.<br /><br />A note to Zemeckis: Think of the millions lost in revenue by this unfortunate creative decision.  It didn't hurt Narnia to be true to the premise.  Maybe a little tweeking on the DVD director's cut can fix this with a few choice dubbed words and edits and an extended finale that finishes the job of fighting demonic evil.
B00005JPS9|5.0|This movie had almost everything you would want from a sword and sorcery movie.  It doesn't have near as many characters as Lord of the rings nor is their much magic.  This movie makes up for that with its psychological intelligence and suspense.  The special effects are pretty cool too.  The characters look life like as well.  The script is very good.  This movie has strong fantasy violence and adult situations that kids will not understand.
0446577391|4.0|Most authors cannot balance both plot and character development but Baldacci manages to pull it off well in Stone Cold. It is however recommended that to fully understand and enjoy this book that the reader have already read the previously written Camel Club books in order. There are a few places where one has to suspend disbelief such as Alex's flexibility regarding his work schedule along with Olver's sharpshooting and killing skills still at peak, world-class level despite zero practice over many years or decades but overall, the story is quite enjoyable. It is worth the full paperback price but I will not recommend the hardback and I will never re-read it.
B000VI70WM|5.0|This is such a fantastic record!  All the great elements we've come to love about Duran Duran are there once again and yet, everything sounds fresh and alive.  Beautiful melodys, rich synth-scapes, crisp rhythm, driving bass grooves, and perfect vocal harmonies are all there once again in a collection of new songs that are very easy on the ears.  My personal favorite tracks are:    1. The Valley- This opener is probably not what you would expect but it is great fun to listen to as it develops from a simple synth-riff into a complicated and catchy production.  I love the very \\"present sounding\\" bass solo...its very different from what we've heard before.  Background vocals are amazing.  2. Falling Down- Simply beautiful...right up there with \\"Save a Prayer\\" as one of their finest ballads.  3. Box Full O'Honey- A nice acoustic oriented number where Simon impresses once again with his remarkable melodic gift.  4.Zoom In - I saw someone bagging on this tune earlier which mystifies me.  To those that don't enjoy it...try listening this way.  Listen to the chorus each time it comes by. It goes from a single line, to a unison line, to a harmonized line, to a more dramatically harmonized line and so on.  The dissonance in the chorus near the end of the tune is remarkable.    One reviewer noted that \\"Tricked Out\\" had kind of a \\"Munsters\\" sound to it. I have to agree...I thought it sounded kind of like \\"Scooby Doo\\" so there must be something to it.  Even still, I enjoy the track.    Well done guys!  Now get back to the studio and make us another one!
0143112589|4.0|I have enjoyed the Rumpole series for years, and this installment is certainly entertaining, even when the subject is as current as this is.  I found it to be an excellent read, fully in keeping with the character, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Rumpole, even though it is somewhat lacking overall compared to earlier stories in the series.

B000Y179KO|5.0|I think it is a miracle that a team that split up almost three decades ago comes up with such good work, in particular after so many rows and use of drugs. The men reinvented themselves and decided to be real professionals instead of big egos. I will keep mentioning this record ' Eden' , because that's what Eden must sound like. The album is more balanced than Hotel California, which has too many Walsh rockers on it. Don Henley proves again that het is the real genious of the group. I like the second CD best, because it keeps you in a sort of trance, probably also because the tracks are longer than on part 1.
B0002OXVDW|3.0|I bought this set with the understanding that it is of more historical than entertainment value.  The first installment of the series is excellent and entertaining all the way through, but subsequent installments tend to drag at times.  I felt that Judy Garland got a little too much screen time in the later installments, as well as some of Gene Kelly's modern dance numbers in the later installments.  This sort of entertainment is still far superior to 99% of what passes as family entertainment today, and it is excellent for showcasing the superior talents of yesteryear compared to the less than stellar attitudes and behavior exhibited by so many of today's \\"stars\\", both on and off screen.  These are the kind of shows that you may only watch once a year, unless you are a big musical or MGM buff, but they are worth having in your collection even on that basis.

B000JLTR8G|5.0|This is an excellent movie in its own right, and it helps define the meaning of giri or obligation, in a way which any number of more modern, violent caricatures fail miserably to do so.  It is not always given to us to do as we would wish, but we have the choice to take our responsibilities and our obligations seriously, regardless of any modern elastic interpretation of what may or may not constitute morality.  While this is a work of fiction, and the violence is seriously subdued compared to today's fare (which is not a bad thing), this movie should be required watching to anyone interested in things Japanese, including the martial arts (and not for the fight scenes).
B000BBOUD6|3.0|The two previous reviews are a little gushing IMHO.  This film is beautifully photographed.  After that, there's little to rave about.  The acting is poorly directed.  The script seems forced and contrived in situations where some greatness is called for.  It's also one of those movies that uses up well over two hours but seems like far too much was edited out leaving many story lines unfulfilled.  This is like a 12 hour mini-series crammed into a few hours.  And why is Brad Pitt illuminated like he's a christ or something?  The guy is eye candy enough without making him glow on mountaintops.  It's just too much.  Great cast and photography.  But the writing and the direction sabotage this effort.  In the end it's becomes another weeper worthy of the Hallmark Channel.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|It is anybodys guess if it is the right way to view this classic for the first time.This version seems to supply more cohesion to the work, and though it is eighty-three minutes longer, it is not any less admirable than the directors cut of years ago.If anything, it is richer and fuller in effect.But going by my preference for good editing,whether films or books or for that matter any work of artistic expression,I prefer the edited directors cut. The more you take out in the right places, the stronger the work will stand ,if it stands at all.As another review suggested, if you are new to this film, view the directors cut first;and then looking at this one will be like getting a special treat of extras that does not ruin the  film but rather makes it a longer narrative,and a no less admirable war epic at  sea.( as seen from the Axis side)
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Kanye west too most is egotistical, arrogant, and racist because of the comments he made at the president and of what he says in some of his lyrics etc, but it's not really too many producers that come out with good, quality, positive music and at the same time keep it real.  On this cd, kanye has a different vibe than this first 2 cd's, but that don't take away from the quality of the music.  This cd uses various sample, but it works for kayne west.  Stronger uses a techno sample, but it is a feel good song and one of the best on this cd.  Other songs im feeling are big brother, good morning, good life, can't tell me nothing (the remix with jeezy is tight),everything i am, and barry bonds.  I could have done without drunk and hot girls; even though the song was funny.  Not Kanye west's best cd, that would go to the college dropout.  If you want some feel good music, then cop this album.
B000ESST6U|5.0|This has to be one of the finest Handel operas on DVD, not only for the singing but for the production: the sets are great and there is always action on stage that goes well with the music--even when Handel is being intentionally silly!    Highly recommended!
0765357151|4.0|The \\"I Am Legend\\" NOVELLA (160 pages) is GREAT... I, too, bought it in anticipation of the upcoming Will Smith movie.<br /><br />The ONLY problem that I have with this \\"BOOK\\" is that the book is NOT JUST the Vampiric mutants story \\"I am Legend\\" ...You get the I AM LEGEND novella followed by 10 other short stories after that. NOWHERE on either cover of the book is this explained to you. That is a HUGE LETDOWN!!!<br /><br />I was not aware when I had finished reading \\"I Am Legend\\" ...  I kept waiting to see how these new tales would 'tie in somehow' since NOWHERE (except in the table of contents) is there any indication that there might be more than ONE story here.<br /><br />After reading the third short story, I began examining the book to try to determine 'for sure', if these new tales were indeed 'separate stories'... so the first thing I did is 'google' the ISBN number to get a description of the book and who would be 'more dependable' than Amazon....<br /><br />Welllll nowhere in any description of this book and it is EXACTLY the same book they have pictured here with the same ISBN number and all... NOWHERE does it tell you that you are buying a collection of short stories with the 'novel', as it is called.<br /><br />There is not even one blank page between the 'novel' and the short stories and since the book DOES END abruptly and without warning, I just kept reading waiting for the next thing to happen and all the while having questions building in my mind such as \\"what the heck does this have to do with what I have been reading?\\"<br /><br />I am seriously blushing here especially since I AM a seasoned reader but I am sorry there was no indication of what was going on here.... I don't feel ripped off since I did get other works by the author but I would have REALLLLLLY appreciated being able to savor the end of the story as it was without discovering after reading 30-40 more pages that I had already come to the conclusion!
B000VWYNOG|3.0|It would have been great to replace my Van Morrison \\"Best of\\" CDs with one comprehensive disc and when I saw the title of this new collection, I was certain that \\"The\\" greatest hits CD was the one.    With only a handful of hits here in the States, how is it that two of Van's biggest hits are not among the 21 tracks (!) on this CD?  Sure, the big hits - \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" and \\"Domino\\" - are here.  But where are \\"Blue Money\\" and \\"Come Running\\"?    As a young boy who began purchasing 45 RPM singles around 1970 (at age 5), \\"Blue Money\\" was one of the first records I ever bought.  I admit, it wasn't the best song I had ever heard, but it had a good beat and the kids could dance to it, you know?    Now that I think about it, I haven't seen \\"Blue Money\\" on any of Van's compilation CDs.  I have to believe that some music snob (maybe more than one) will write about its non-worthiness or something about how Van always hated that song, but I would say that it was certainly among Van Morrison's greatest hits.    And another thing:  How is it that \\"Into the Mystic\\" and \\"Tupelo Honey\\" didn't make the cut?  Did I miss the Van Morrison \\"Anthology\\" CD??
B000M06K5C|5.0|A Weekend in the City, Bloc Party's 2nd album, is one of my top 2 albums of 2007.  While this album is less explosive in the rock and loud instrumental as Silent Alarm, that gap is filled by melodic guitar work and entrancing British vocals by Kele.  The album is very intimate in expressing the growing social problems between people on many levels, such as love, social behaviors, societal norms, and common ignorance or misconceptions.  The band is still heavy in effects, which is wonderful.  One of Bloc Party's footprints in music is their intense and consistent use of guitar effects, along with Kele's accent.    It is different than Silent Alarm, but I would say that the band has \\"evolved\\" for the better.  Please check out this album!    ALSO! There is a set of B-Sides titled \\"Another Weekend in the City\\" and has some FANTASTIC songs that you must hear.  One B-Side comes along with each single from the original A Weekend in the City.  So to have the entire set of B-sides, you need all the singles of A Weekend in the City.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|This film is not complicated or cerebral as some have commented. It tries to be that but these attributes should not be confused with a thin plot supported by a sound track that seems to be in every scene making noises for no reason, disjoined scenes, dark sets and minimal dialogue. It could have been good if the plot and characters were fleshed out. I've watched it three times and the film becomes thinner and the backing track even more pervasive and annoying. A chance was missed with this one.  This film is often compared with the Constant Gardener (that did have a plot which needed following). But leaving people confused is not deep film making. All I got out of it was that the central character was a cold blooded, upper class and uncompassionate CIA operative, with little love for himself or his family - so what?
B000S5BUXI|4.0|The National has released yet another captivating and expressive album that makes my top 4 of the year.  The Boxer is more intimate and softer in comparison to The Alligator. But don't let that deter you from listening, because what it lacks in bang, it makes up for in depth with many subtle layers of instrumental and sounds.  After listening and concentrating on this album 4-5 times, you will notice all the additions that make this album feel whole.  The lyrics are still dynamic and flow so perfectly with his style of singing.  I really do commend The National on this album!      If you have not yet heard The Alligator, make it a priority!!!
B00005JPD0|5.0|Magnificent Mr. Washington!  A very good plot. Had to watch it twice to make sure I understood it, but the concept is terrific.  His leading lady, Paula Patton was great too (she was also in Hitch) and as always, so was Val Kilmer.  Recommended.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|With some playful lyrics and catchy beats, this album is surprisingly fun (considering I only listened to see _how bad_ it was).  One negative is that Britney's voice sounds processed and robotic throughout, and she is actually not much more prominent than the squad of backup singers.
0684135051|4.0|I learned how to knit (and crochet and tat and other yarn/thread things) as a child, but didn't do much with it until the early 1970s when I was spinning my own wool and wanted to make things with the yarn. I knit a couple of scarves, an afghan, and a complicated sleeveless vest. I wanted to knit a sweater but the idea of setting in sleeves, etc. was daunting. I picked up this book, learned about circular knitting and designing your own sweater, worked out the gauge for my handspun, and knit a sweater with a circular yoke (fair isle leaf design)which I wore for years. Knitting Without Tears is not a book that will walk you through the basics of knitting for absolute novices. What this book offers is empowerment, a number of very good tips on basic knitting methods, and some really important general advice. Knit a bit to get comfortable with the process and to figure out whether you're a tight knitter or a loose knitter (I am one of the loose ones).   Then get the book and knit a really great one-of-a-kind sweater.
075640407X|5.0|At first I couldn't put my finger on why I loved this book so much, so I started comparing it to books I'd read lately in sci-fi/fantasy.  I was still having a little trouble and started trying to figure out when was the last time I enjoyed any book so much.  As a rough estimate, this is probably the best book out of the last 200 or so I read, and one of the top ten out of the last 1000, including classics & bestsellers of all genres.      I won't summarize the plot, amazon and plenty of reviews do that.  So the question remains, what makes this book special?  You have well developed, sympathetic characters.  That makes this book good and involves you in the character's outcomes.  Within fantasy there are tons of sterotypes, magic, elves, ultimate enemies and fate.  Fantasy can get to be the same old thing.  In this book, when you hit a fantasy cliche, like magic, it's completely different from what I've read before.  That makes it above average and creative.  You also have storytelling - taking its time, going at the right pace, just the right amount of detail, not trying to trick the reader, tipping the hand a little by foreshadowing, and not ending on a ridiculous cliffhanger.  So many books end a chapter or book in the middle of a plot line, or describe a sword for a page, etc.  This story runs smoothly.  That makes it exceptional.        As a special bonus, the story is all written, part two out next april, and part three out the following year.  As someone waiting unendingly for Martin's song of ice and fire, I can appreciate that more than I might have before.  For parents, this book doesn't have anything that is inappropriate for preteens or teens, which isn't always true of fantasy.  However I obviously can't vouch for the other books of the trilogy, and this book primarily concerns a adolescent boy growing up, so the two volumes yet to come may be more explicit.
B000VLE3IS|3.0|I don't plan on writing a very thorough or expert review.  I wish I had not bought this CD/DVD.  Yes, the CD's sound better (in some cases it is hard to tell), but the song selection missed a few critical ones and the DVD was a complete ripoff (I didn't know it was the SAME footage as the Led Zeppelin 2disc DVD).  You will be better off buying the full DVD set and the Earlier/Latter Days combo, not this.  Instead, save your cash so you can go see them if they hit the US.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|\\"Sawdust\\" is a collection of B sides, remixes, covers, movie tracks, and more by dance rockers The Killers, and it's a fan's delight.<br /><br />Most fans would have already heard the sawing/droning \\"Move away\\" from the excellent \\"Spider-man 3\\" soundtrack, and \\"Shadowplay\\" from the movie \\"Control\\".<br /><br />The Beatles/Oasis-like \\"Glamorous indie rock and roll\\" was on the UK version of their debut \\"Hot fuss\\". Their smash \\"Mr Brightside\\" is given a glossy dance make over, while the title track to their sophomore set \\"Sam's town\\" is given a more stripped down piano Beatles-like treatment.<br /><br />For a collection of B sides and rejects, it features strong songs; single \\"Tranquilize\\" (a rousing theatrical sounding ballad), \\"All the pretty faces\\" (B side to \\"When we were young\\" with similar pulsing guitars and synths), the shimmery \\"Sweet talk\\", a cover of Dire Strait's \\"Romeo & Juliet\\", and \\"Show you how\\" (which starts off as a phone message before morphing into a blistering rocker) to mention a few, the latter an unreleased song along with the choppy \\"Leave the bourbon on the shelf\\".<br /><br />Look out for a bonus track, \\"Change your mind\\", a sunny rocker with nice jangly guitars. Vital to all Killers fans.
B000WQW988|5.0|It did take a long time, but at least it's here right! We are no longer left wondering when? Got my copy and am watching it right now. I love this album, and the show is exactly what I remember watching way back when. But with extras! I didn't remember that Kurt Cobain was so damn hot either! A masterpiece to own on DVD.
0553381342|5.0|\\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" is a good book...one of those books that are enjoyable to read and educate you in some way at the same time.  Richly drawn with a well-developed plot line and memorable characters (and caricatures), this is a book that should stand the test of time.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this book was how well the scenes, settings and characters were drawn by Wolfe.  He has a gift for capturing the essence of a time and place...something he does quite well in \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" for different sides of New York City in the 1980s.<br /><br />This is a great and memorable book.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Now Yes, this Cd is going to be every Gay boys fantasy, normally id lump little girl in there too but i think they are smarter then that.    the songs on this CD are all the same techno BS we hear in clubs.  i used to love britney, but with this CD its vry clear that the stress and the stuff has taken its toll and proved she cant sing at all anymore.    say what you will but your actions outside of the studio reflect those once your inside it. and real people see this and are tunred away from you brit.    want a real pop Cd grab the new Backstreet Boys thats a Good Cd. this is Trash!
0671434004|5.0|\\"Contact\\" is, in my opinion, one of the best science fiction books written to date.  Carl Sagan addresses one of the fundamental questions facing the world today...does life exist elsewhere in the Universe?<br /><br />Beyond the scope and inherent engaging elements of this question, \\"Contact\\" is so good for a number of other reasons as well: it is credible, the characters are interesting and engaging and the tone of the novel is one of suspense coupled with science education coupled with an undercurrent of what this all means for humankind.<br /><br />\\"Contact\\" is a great book for all readers, but especially good for readers with an interest in science and technology.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie is well casted and very romantic.  Captain Wentworth in one of my favorite heros in a romance.Ciaran Hinds is soooo good (and very handsome)  It's starts off as a melancholy story but it turns out so happily in the end. And to top it all off, it was filmed in Bath!!
0394716787|5.0|\\"Complete Tales and Poems\\" of Edgar Allen Poe is a great compilation of Poe's works, spanning pieces such as poems and tales.<br /><br />Poe's writings have a certain timeless quality and this publication offers a good \\"one stop shop\\" for Poe readers.  This is an entertaining, thought-provoking and worthwhile book...highly recommended.
0517227851|5.0|This book is precious to say the least.  I'm reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as if it's hot off the press in 19th Century England.  It's easy to read as the words are not too small but your eyes still have to adjust a little at first.  It has a lovely pink pattern all over the book, which makes it gorgeous, simply gorgeous.  It fits very nicely into any medium size hand-bag, which makes it perfect for \\"on the bus\\" reading.  Even if your not a reader, and your styling your room in a classic style - place it on a vanity table!! If you love classics, you will love and appreciate reading a classic in this little pocket book.
B000000H64|5.0|I truly believe my life would be different if Fear Factory did not exist. This album along with its follower, Obsolete are my all time favorite albums. I would say they are the soundtracks of my life because I have listened to them probably a couple thousand times each, I just can't get tired of them. If you like metal you reaaally have to have Fear Factory albums in your collection, they are truly masterpieces of metal, beautiful and full of hatred at the same time. No words can make justice to this music.

B000024D4R|5.0|I am firmly in the camp of Pink Floyd fans who feel \\"Animals\\" is an unfairly overlooked masterpiece. It was the band's response to the evolving British society of 1977, enveloping the boom of punk, Rotten's \\"I Hate Pink Floyd\\" t-shirt and countless political and social divides. Roger Waters in typical style confronted his views head-on, creating parallels between society and the animal kingdom presented in three grand pieces.<br /><br />The pieces each represent a different aspect to Waters' animal theme, with pigs for greed, sheep for thoughtless following and dogs for unabashed selfishness. At times the lyrics become slightly derived and a little too obvious, but this is to be expected as Waters' vision for the album was not to confuse with subtlety - it is essentially a straight-edged, hard-hitting satire.  The lyrical content is presented perfectly in three classic and epic Floyd tracks. The first of which, \\"Dogs\\", is the band at their best, combining Gilmour's cutting and beautiful guitar motifs and solos, heartfelt vocals from Waters and a typically excellent atmospheric performance from Wright. The song is the essence of Floyd's progressive best, and has over the years become one of my favourite prog rock songs. \\"Pigs\\" fashions a catchy chorus hook, more brooding atmospherics and grand guitar antics. \\"Sheep\\" showcases the most energy, shifting the tempo up and galloping to its excellent climax. These three songs weigh in at a hefty forty minutes, so patient and repeated listens will reward. The songs are bookended by \\"Pigs On The Wing\\", a lovely little two-part piece that finishes off one of Floyd's greatest achievements.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Ditto to Jay Schufman's review.  I may be in the minority of finding both the theatrical and the director's cut versions magnificent.  For too long some of us have waited for the DVD cut of the theatrical version.  It has been unduly panned.  As a film-noir fan I have deeply missed the voice-over.  Replicant or not, Deckard's insights lends terrific pathos to the story and to the thematic texture of the film. (I would have definitely included the unicorn scene.) Even its \\"happy ending\\" provides intense irony to the risks of self-delusion in our moments of happiness.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|My son had to have this collection and none of us in the family were disappointed.  Awesome DVD's.  A must for every AC/DC fan of any age.
0525950079|4.0|I am currently reading it again. That's how good it is. Folletts' ability to make you actually care about these characters is probably his biggest strength.  It amused me that I was on the edge of my seat really stressing over whether or not  one of the characters would get the prioress position she coveted. Think about it. A meeting of monks and bishops in the 13th century, and there I was, chewing my fingernails worrying about the outcome. There are 4 distinct main characters, but the real character that stepped out  of the book and into my den was RALPH! This guy is well worth reading the novel. I cheered for him from the first chapter on! Despicable does not give  him his props. This book is Follett on steroids. Pillars was better, but this comes close. 2nd best from KF. If there was one complaint, it was the fact that he telegraphs the next moves of his characters from a mile away. A minor problem in the grand scheme. Thank you Mr. Follett for keeping my interest in a story for more than the usual 3 minutes it seems to be these days. I can't wait for the next installment. Snap to it!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|i watched this movie for the first time tonight... ive heard about it and heard that is was a crazy movie.... honestly i absolutely loved it! i love jarad leto and i think this movie is amazing! i highly recommend it!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I loved this movie. It's a great movie for families, unless you're not into the fantasy material. It's a combination chick flick, fantasy/sci fi, comedy, and action, which is perfect for me. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B000WQW988|5.0|Words cannot express how I feel about this performance.  Nirvana gave us a collection of sonic masterpieces, while others remember them for the album NEVERMIND, it is this performance that will be remembered as their finest hour.   Tonight I finally got to see this show on VH1 along with a bare witness documentary of those who were there.    I pre-ordered the dvd a few days ago and even paid extra so it gets to me ASAP.      Finally NIRVANA has come home.      Come as you Are!
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Big starring Tom Hanks is still sweet, delighful, and brilliant as ever! Directed by Penny Marshall, Big is a film I used to watch over and over again as a kid, and now the film has been re-released on DVD with an extended edition. Hank's performance is so endearing, he is probably the only actor who can pull off vulnerability and physical comedy all at the same time. I highly recommend this feel-good comedy, a must-have!
B000VR824S|4.0|I must add my voice to the chorus.  The first thing that I looked for when I saw the track listing was A Day in the Life by J Beck.  It was gratifying to read the comments and realize that I was not alone in my disappointment.  I also agree with Big Tom in that this and Isn't It a Pity were the 2 goosebumps musical moments at the show.  Having said that, this is a pretty good representation of that great day in July.  It looks like, unlike the previous Crossroads DVD, the incredible Sonny Landreth wasn't slighted this time around.  Also kudos for the obvious inclusion of Dear Mr. Fantasy which proved that Mssr. Winwood could hold his own with the best of the guitar gunslingers that day.  So I must end with this plea to Jeff Beck:  How about a separate release of your entire set with the amazing Tal Wilkenfeld?  I am sure that a few of us commentators would be first in line.
1843104954|5.0|The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome: Review    \\"Congratulation's, you've got Asperger's Syndrome.\\"      If you have to quote one phrase, I think this best sums up the tone of this book.    Attwood's view is that being born with a differently wired brain is not always a bad thing.       If I were the publisher I would change the title of this book to something that really accurately portrays the content - something like:      \\"Asperger's Syndrome: A Half-Century of Understanding and Progress.\\"    Rather than summarize the book in a quick review, it is possibly easier to go to the preface and spell out what isn't in there.   The author hints at this when he spells out where he sees future Asperger's research going.    Here are some quotes from page 10:  \\"We need to reach on consensus on diagnostic criteria\\"  (More work) \\"must be done to achieve employment appropriate to qualifications and abilities.\\"  \\"More research...into aspects of sensory perception.\\"  \\"Evaluate programs to encourage friendship/relationship skills, the management of emotions and the constructive applications of special interests.\\"    This all means that the work isn't as complete as the real title might suggest.   But pretty much everything else you would expect to be in the book is in there.       To say the book is well written -on a micro level- would be to undersell it.    You would expect nothing less from Tony Attwood, the world's foremost author on Asperger's syndrome.   But what is a surprise to me is how carefully crafted the content arrangement of the book is.   I read the chapters out of order, starting in the middle going to the end moving back and forth until finally I got to chapter one- last.  That is a tribute to this work being a good reference book as well as a good read.  The individual chapters are structured with a poignant quote from Hans Asperger at the beginning, to `hook you in', followed by a current summary on knowledge of the sub topic and always ending with a quote from a person with Asperger's syndrome because as Attwood puts it:    \\"I think that those with Asperger's should have the last comment.\\"    To run through a brief content checklist:    1/Diagnostic information including where established practice has rough edges?  Check  2/Solutions to better cope with a differently wired brain at toddler, child, teen and adult levels?  Check    Some of the proposed `paths to the future' may not have the rigours of scientific proof.  But if anecdotal evidence can be at all useful, then Attwood has documented it.    Although the style of the book may be at times almost disarmingly casual, the bibliography at the end is `clinically complete'.    Criticisms?    A book like this is at risk of suffering from observer bias.   The skills needed to gain the necessary insights and recognize nuances means it is possible, even likely, that Attwood and his clinician colleagues have brains wired close to `opposite polarity' on the Asperger's brain scale spectrum.   Thus it is possible that Attwood acting in his professional capacity has a biased view of what constitutes a `normal brain' because of the company he keeps.    One description of an Asperger's wired brain is an `extreme male brain'.    It could be that some of the diagnostic and behavioral observations in this book, labeled as unusual by clinicians, are really normal spectrum `maleness', which is perceived to be abnormal because of observer bias.     The book starts and finishes with the delightful (fantasy) tale of Jack, an Asperger's boy, who ends up with a PhD, a research career and a late blossoming relationship with a single mother.   However, I find it incongruous that right at the end of the story Jack would choose as `a label of his success' to buy a new BMW Seven series car.  That is the largest and most wasteful car in the BMW range (presumably so Jack can transport all of those friends Asperger's people don't have).  Meanwhile Jack purports to his workmates a `green image' (it is irrelevant if it is real or not) of fanatically breeding endangered Koala bears which would no doubt flout all sort of wildlife service protection laws  (hence going against a known Asperger's trait of honesty over co-worker empathy) if it were true.   I wouldn't normally bother pointing out such a trivial inconsistency in a profound work.   But it is the very last thing in the book, so it sticks in my mind.    Tony if you ever read this review stick to the day job - I don't think the producers of `Neighbours' and `Home & Away' will be seeking out your soap opera scenario script talent yet!    OK, I admit it I am really struggling to find anything bad to say about this book.     If you want to learn about Asperger's syndrome this is easily the most complete work available.  Most complete that is, until Tony Attwood publishes his next book!
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Creepy, truly creepy. Max Schreck as Count Orlok is beautifully terrifying. The portrayal is oustanding and truly spooky. This silent film has achieved without any words what most films today can't with all their budget and special effects. The film is excellently made and is one of the best horror films I have seen. Truly haunting.
B000X3KZVI|5.0|I was lucky enough to be at the taping for this concert DVD, in Anaheim CA, and I am happily awaiting December 4th, when it will be released in the US so I can relive the night.  Mariah not only sang her hits of \\"The Emancipation of Mimi,\\" but she performed some of her classics, too, including her duet with Boyz 2 Men (who stopped by to sing with her!).  The DVD will be complete with extras, including the Spike Lee short film \\"Lovers & Haters\\" starring Mariah as a version of herself and Maya Gilbert (from \\"I Wanna Be A Soap Star\\" / \\"General Hospital\\" fame).    It's been years since Mariah has released one of her concerts on DVD, so this is a must-see for all fans, as it is the only place to get some of these songs live.
B000000OF6|5.0|If you are looking to add the music of Queen to your CD collection, this is the album to buy.  Queen was (and is) one of the greatest bands of all time and it isn't difficult to hear (and see) why.  For starters, their late, great front man Freddy Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara) had a larger-than-life personality and charisma to match his larger-than-life voice.  This man's range as a vocalist was genre-defying (he easily made the transition between triumphant rock ballads like their brilliant, classical music-inspired opus, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" to ragtime-inspired \\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\\" to gospel-inspired \\"Somebody To Love\\").  What's more, he easily moved from his lower register into high falsetto without missing a beat.  Plus, he was a brilliant songwriter (penning: \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\", \\"Killer Queen\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\\", \\"We Are the Champions\\", \\"Bicycle Race\\", \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", and \\"Play the Game,\\" all featured in this collection, among others).  Band members Brian May  (guitarist), Roger Taylor (drummer), and John Deacon (bassist) match him note for note with their great artistry and genre-bending expression.<br /><br />We not only hear the best of Queen on these two albums, but, we get a sense of their evolution, instrumentally.  While the 1970s showcased the band's range in fusing rock & roll, jazz, soul, classical and heavy metal music (to name a few), they went on to incorporated more synthesized sound and harder percussion (one of Queen's most well-loved songs from that era is \\"Under Pressure\\" recorded with David Bowie).  Listening to the band's magnificent songs, regardless of era, is truly a cathartic experience.  Queen's musical artistry was second to none, and they also knew how to poke fun at themselves and had a terrific sense of humor, which only added more to their songs.  Be sure to read the liner notes (complete with photos of the band in their Glam Rock glory, as well as their various stage personas that changed from album to album) that come with this musical collection.  This album is nothing short of brilliant.ck glory, as well as their various stage personas that changed from album to album) that come with this musical collection.

B00008976Y|5.0|The \\"beauty\\" of Kieslowski's later works has little to do with \\"pretty pictures,\\" but everything to do with his cinematic imagination, and his ability to tap into and enrich the emotional, spiritual, and aesthetic content of his work.<br /><br />The opening sequence to \\"Blue,\\" involving the car passing through a tunnel, as we are immersed in the ambient sounds (hearing bits of conversation, viewing the swish of vehicles and splash of lights through the window), followed by the passage into late afternoon light (and the silvery blue balloon being sucked out the side window flapping in the breeze), just before the accident, is as astounding in its beauty as it is penetrating in its content....<br /><br />This film is resplendent with cinematic sequences as unique and profound as its opening, and, throughout,\\" Kieslowski's use of sound as a way to access Binoche's interior process is absolutely brilliant. Witness the sequence, when she finally feels able to step out into the world again and move into the city after the accident. She rents an apartment on an upper floor of a large, strange vacuous building, and there, that first night, through her window, witnesses the beating of a man on the street, who escapes and runs into her building, the fear on her face, as she listens to him climb the long metal escape stairway, floor by floor, still followed by his assailants, as he comes closer to her....<br /><br />But it is not only the imagery (Binoche blurry through window, staring vacantly somewhere, as she experiences intimate relations for the first time since the accident), or ambient sound (the sudden clamor and echo of the indoor swimming pool as she comes up for air from under water) that reflects the nature of her psyche, but Preisner's haunting music that simultaneously takes us back to her husband and her tragedy, as much as towards her recovery of self. She is a woman who has lived in the shadow of her husband, while yet participating in the creation of the very music he is famous for, and as the music enters the film, each time, it is her reflecting on and coming to terms with all that it represents to her, including, finally, the bridge to her salvation....<br /><br />This is not a typical Hollywood redemption tale handing us the standard prescription for such a tale of woe, no \\"how to reclaim your power as a woman course 101.\\" This is a tale of truth, and we believe Binoche every time she makes a decision because we are not only privy to her experience, but fully engaged in her process.<br /><br />I could go on and on through every scene like this, but it is better to watch and listen to the film several times by yourself....or, and as the music enters the film, each time, it is her reflecting on and coming to terms with all that it represents to her, including, finally, the bridge to her salvation....

072325804X|5.0|We purchased \\"Beatrix Potter - The Complete Tales\\" as a book to read to our grandchildren.  We were not sure how little children raised on TV and video games would respond to the sweet, slow-moving tales written over a century ago.  What we found was constant requests to \\"read another one, Grandpa,\\" and \\"just one more.\\"  The little ones absolutely loved this book. The book is beautifully illustrated, beautifully bound, and protected in its box cover.<br />  If you treasure good books, quality books, and wish to pass along these sweet stories to another generation rather than see them watching death and mayhem on the boob tube, we would highly recommend this book for your collection.

My only complaint is that a lot of what this movie goes over should be common sense by now. Although I learned a few new things from the film, the majority of it is stuff that has been proven for a long time now. You'd have to be ridiculously insane not to believe in global warming by this point. You'd have to be ridiculously insane not to believe in global warming last year, or the year before. I mean, you might as well say a isn't a, or 2 + 2 doesn't equal 4. A lot of it has been common knowledge for a while now. But the common knowledge is presented nicely, and if you already know about global warming then there are still a few tidbits that you will be surprised about or learn from.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I am shocked at some of the negative reviews for Red Carpet Massacre. I have been a die-hard Duran fan since first seeing \\"Planet Earth\\" on MTV WAY back in the day. I've stuck by them thru good times (their Beatle-esque popularity in the early 80s) and not so good times (less than stellar record sales, band members coming and going). I own every CD they've ever released, box sets, DVDs, you name it, I have it when it comes to Duran. Do I love everything they've ever recorded? No. I must say tho, that I believe that Red Carpet Massacre is one of their best CDs. Almost every track is addictive and hypnotic.     What I've always loved about Duran Duran is how they just keep plugging away, they don't give up. They keep recording albums, growing and changing as musicians and taking chances. Not one Duran album sounds like any other. They are all unique and stand on their own merits. The same can be said for Red Carpet Massacre. Songs such as \\"Falling Down\\", \\"Box Full O'Honey\\" and \\"She's Too Much\\" showcase that great, melodic sound that Duran is SO good at. Songs such as \\"Skin Divers, \\"Tempted\\", \\"Nite Runner\\", \\"The Valley\\" and \\"Zoom In\\" are danceable and fun, and Simons voice has never sounded better.     I was nervous when I heard that Justin Timberlake and Timbaland would be working with Duran on this album. My fears disappeared after hearing the CD, its awesome! Duran Duran has proven that they are still relevant in 2007/2008. Wild Boys indeed!
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Love what I have seen so far unfortunately wide-screen is not part of the translation (35MM source material does not support).  I have purchased this set but will likely re-sell most of the disks as singles on Ebay in the upcoming weeks.  Hopefully I can enjoy all of the episodes, recover my investment and have a disk or two of my favs in my collection.  The retail price of $195 is enough to turn most folks off especially those who have not seen it.  This set is a bargain on Amazon for $132 with shipping or if you are patient this set can be picked up for $100 on Ebay.  Good luck.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000VDDDY6 Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season (Combo HD DVD and Standard DVD) [HD DVD]]]

B000WQ9UA8|2.0|I use to love Brit and her music during her first 3 years after her first hit single, but when I went to a local store and bought this CD, I didn't know it was out, didn't see any more in stock (so what I had in my hand was the last copy), and I actually found this CD hidden behind Carrie Underwood CDs.  So right there, I thought it was a sign and I just bought it like I was being called to.  lol (obviously, I misread the \\"sign\\" ROFL!)  However, sad to say, I didn't like this CD.  :(  Or maybe I just complexly go through phases and I'm currently at my country music phase, which is after my British pop phase earlier this century...  I'm sure this CD by Brit is good in certain perspectives, but not with me...  (maybe it has something to do with the fact Britney is no longer blonde on the cover... lol  (cause I typically buy only media with blondes on it as people claim. rofl)) I would give only one star, but just as a generous consideration, I'm giving 2.  If you've heard tracks from this CD and liked it, by all means, get this CD.  I'm sure it's good...  Just like some people like peaches and some others don't.  (bad example, since I like peaches...)
B000002LQQ|5.0|Dire Straits' ON EVERY STREET is one of the most misunderstood albums in rock history. Viewed by some as a whimpering follow-up to their mega-successful hit BROTHERS IN ARMS, ON EVERY STREET came and went so quietly that few paid attention when Mark Knopler & Co. called it quits not long afterwards. All glory is fleeting, but a band this good deserved more respect...and so does their farewell tilt.<br /><br />STREET is a brilliant and subtle album, as understated as fine glass of wine. Missing are the synthesizers, crashing drumbeats, and extended guitar solos which marked most 80s-era rock; missing also is the upbeat, almost manic attitude that characterized BROTHERS. This album is melancholy as a rainy day. It summons up images of cigarette smoke and sippin' whiskey, nursed in some divey blues bar two flights below the boulevard. Of nights spent alone and heartbroken, but not defeated. Of sensuality, cynicism and backhanded humor. In other words, its a different and discreet sound, one which makes no attempt to compete with the long shadow cast by BROTHERS. Instead of competing with themselves, the Straits simply tacked off in a new direction.<br /><br />Nearly every song on the album is good, and a few are truly magnificent. \\"Calling Elvis\\" sets the tone, combining Knopler's trademark melancholy wit with his traditionally understated vocals. \\"On Every Street\\", \\"Fade to Black\\" and \\"You and Your Friend\\" are beautifully depressing, sung in a voice barely above a murmur, and the more compelling for it. \\"Planet of New Orleans\\" is as nakedly sensual as the city itself, and \\"Iron Hand\\" is brilliantly evocative.<br /><br />Not everything is so downbeat. \\"Heavy Fuel\\", \\"The Bug\\" and \\"How Long\\", sung in a rock and pop-country vein, pick up the album's pulse nicely, and \\"Ticket to Heaven\\" and \\"My Parties\\" sheath scathing social commentary behind their complascent good cheer. On the whole, however, ON EVERY STREET is as mellow an album as you'll find outside of the Mazzy Star catelogue, and probably no song better sums up its tone than \\"When It Comes To You\\"...the lyric could have been directed at critics of the album who labeled it dull, boring and underachieving:<br /><br />\\"You've been givin' me a bad time<br />Tell me, what did I do?<br />How come I always get a hard time, honey<br />When it comes to you?\\"y no song better sums up its tone than \\"When It Comes To You\\"...the lyric could have been directed at critics of the album who labeled it dull, boring and underachieving:     \\"You've been givin' me a bad time  Tell me, what did I do?  How come I always get a hard time, honey  When it comes to you?\\"
B00005JMJG|5.0|The one thing you must remember when viewing this film is to WATCH IT BEYOND THE FIRST 20 MINUTES! That first bit of the film might make you think you are watching another insufferable Jim Carey movie about a couple of simpleminded (brain damaged? mentally ill? Borderline retarded?) people who fall in love. What becomes clear after the 20-minute point, however, is that \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is a much richer and more interesting film.<br /><br />The main plot device is a company called Lacuna, Inc whose job is to erase bad memories. The rest of the film involved a love story, but also explored the complicated realities and ethics involved when you lose your bad memories but others don't. There are some scary moments in the film, mostly revolving around a character who changes his mind about the procedure. There are intense chase sequences that take place inside a person's memories that are at least as frightening as any chase involving cars or bad guys.<br /><br />Carey and Kate Winslet are perfect as the crazy-in-love couple. Elijah<br /> Wood is perfect as the geeky tech who wants to date Kate. Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst are fantastic as the workaday team busy changing brains while eating pizza and flirting.<br /><br />The real star of the show, though, is artistic. The writing, editing<br /> and lighting had to be perfect to represent the dreamlike mindscapes in which the characters maneuver for much of the film. Sections of the film take on a surreal quality with quick cuts, pinprick lighting, bizarre (but comprehensible) scene changes and repetitions.<br />The effects used to represent the disappearance of cherished memories were varied and quote convincing.<br /><br />A phenomenal achievement on every level.<br /><br />HINT: do not ruin the film by watching Jim Carey mug through the DVD extras. But do watch the infomercial for Lacuna, Inc.
B000P7V45S|5.0|With A TRICK OF THE TAIL, drummer Phil Collins replaced Peter Gabriel as lead vocalist, and the result was phenomenal. Both the music and the lyrics became simpler, which was a good thing, because I never really did care for Gabriel's cosmic lyrical flights very much. Collins, on the other hand, seemed to express real human emotions in a way similar to how I answer my therapist when she asks me about what's on my mind. In other words, it's a lot easier to relate to Collins' lyrics than to Gabriel singing about all sorts of strange creatures, which distorted my sense of reality too much. Contrary to what many fans think, Peter Gabriel didn't make or break Genesis. In fact, as this CD makes clear, the band actually improved when he left and Collins took over.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Like other reviewers here, I originally had a problem with the murky mix. But a really strange thing happens. The more you listen to it, the less the murkiness matters. I'd even go so far as to say it disappears. Maybe this is an added bit of magic and O'Brien knew what he was doing all along. I swear, it now sounds expertly produced.    A friend and I have gone back and forth via email about the production; after several listens, he now agrees with me. He encouraged me to let others know that the audio perception changes. A musician and former music critic, he wrote, \\"You made some good points succinctly & are right. You should also say it never lets up & is loaded with hooks.\\" And this is indeed true.    Magic is one of Springsteen's best albums (and I go back to the beginning, having purchased Greetings from Asbury Park when it came out in 1973). Some reviewers, here and elsewhere, cite Magic as a return to form. Because it contains some of the E Street Band's signature sound, I can understand why they're saying this. But Magic represents a move forward. There are a lot of interesting, subtle, and different things happening with the music, lyrics, and, yes, the production.    My friend's summary is worth sharing: \\"It's an awesome piece of work. It never lets up & then resolves itself beautifully.\\"    The only thing I'll add to that comment is five stars.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Reading the liner notes to \\"Help!\\" I didn't think I could add anything to the debate because director Richard Lester and Martin Scorsese capture the essence of the film so succinctly.  My comments may be reiterating the obvious but so be it.  I haven't seen \\"Help!\\" for a good twenty years or so and I was taken aback about how much better it was then I remembered it.  Aside from the Marx Brothers style hayhem I was struck by how sly the humor in the film was.  Alot of it is specific to the time and place it was made in a.k.a. mid-sixties Britain and wondered if a relative neophyte would get a lot of the inside jokes.  I was also in awe of the musical segments that in my mind, moreso than \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", precursed the images we would later see on MTV.  The songs are naturally great, a progression from their previous album, \\"Beatles for Sale\\" and anticipated \\"Rubber Soul\\" which was released later in the year.  I also admire the fact that the Beatles were generous in deferring  screen time to some of Britain's finer character actors, Leo McKern, Eleanor Bron, Victor Spinetti, and Roy Kinnear among others.  What make's this achievement even more amazing is consider that it was made during a period of whirlwind recording and touring for the Beatles.  Also consider that Lester directed \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" the previous year and directed \\"Help!\\" and \\"The Knack...and How to Get It\\" in 1965.  This enterprise doesn't have a hint of cynicism and is indicative of how the Beatles always delivered a heartfelt effort to their fans and public alike.

B00005JPWF|5.0|Into the Wild is Sean Penn's rendering of the book written by Jon Krakauer, which is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch, who lost weight for this role). McCandless graduates from Emory, donates his entire life savings to Oxfam America, and decides to trek to Alaska and just \\"live life\\" in the wilderness. Some have called him inspirational, some have called him foolish.<br /><br />Leaving his car (and family and friends) behind, McCandless finds his way across the country hitching rides, sneaking onto trains, and even kayaking. He meets several interesting characters who all develop a fondness for his views and thoughts on life - a couple of hippies with love issues, a sixteen year-old \\"ready to vault herself onto a fence post,\\" a foreign couple taking in sights and sharing grilled hot dogs, a charismatic grain farmer (played by Vince Vaughn), and a lonely war veteran.<br /><br />The visual scenes of the land and sea are beautiful and we're able to witness what we'll probably never see in person. Not so beautifully, McCandless succumbs to the wrath of Alaska's wilderness, but he finally realizes that happiness is only real when shared with others.
B0000028VT|4.0|Not Her worst or best release.<br /><br />This CD encases what an R&B artist who is in love with ballads would and should release.<br /><br />Well, to be honest there are more mid-tempos and up-tempos than the ballads. But the ballads make up almost half of the CD.<br /><br />What I really don't understand (and don't want to) is that people say that this disc just mimics Whitney Houston! Ha.<br /><br />First off, Whitney doesn't write ANY of her songs. And that stinks. And none of these songs sounds like a Whitney number. What do you think?<br /><br />Anyway, my favorite track is track #1, Dreamlover. It also happens to be her best song ever. Very fun with a pinch of meaning to it. It showcases Mariah in her upbeat glory.<br /><br />But then the album goes into inspirational numbers (Hero, Anytime You Need A Friend) one pointless and throwaway dance number (I've Been Thinking About You) and one good one (Now That I Know) and of course the ballads (Hero, Never Forget You, Without You, which is the second best track here, Just To Hold You Once Again, All I've Ever Wanted).<br /><br />This disc is solid, just not her best.<br /><br />My aunt actually gave it to me cause she said she doesn't listen to \\"this\\" Mariah anymore.

The series was amazingly well written and best enjoyed without commercials.  The included pilot teleplay script gives a really interesting perspective on how well the writing was acted out.  Furthermore at $160.00 (as of now) the series is a steal!  Not only does everyone that worked on this series deserve every last dime, but they priced it competitive to the cost of stealing the whole series.

0786852550|5.0|In Bartimaeus: The Amulet of Samarkand, there is something behind this magic. Demons. Yes, demons. Magicians are powerless without the demons that do their bidding in this book. True, the magician must be powerful in order to control the demon, but as a plus there's more depth to the whole \\"magic scene.\\" This book adds more than \\"just the words,\\" adding a whole new twist to the plot of this book. Whenever something happens in the Amulet of Samarkand, it is always having something to do with a demon and a magician.     Nathaniel is a young boy, age 11, who is the apprentice of a magician. He has had a fairly smooth life after the age of six. He had intense studies and lessons for every type of education, including language, math, writing, drawing, etc. Around the age of 9 he had gone to a celebration with his master to see his master's colleagues. During the party Nathaniel's master showed him off to some of his superiors. They questioned him and got answers. They said his master did a bad job. Nathaniel got snooty and was abused for it by the leader of the group, Simon Lovelace. Meanwhile his master sat and watched. After this night Nathaniel sped up his education in order to get revenge. After two years Nathaniel summons a powerful djinn, Bartimaeaus. He then orders Bartimaeaus to go steal a valuable artifact from Simon Lovelace, an object that Nathaniel knew Lovelace had stolen, the Amulet of Samarkand.

I saw it in IMAX today and boy, I was stunned.<br /><br />You already know the story of Beowulf: Man slays monster, man slays monster's mother, man slays a dragon and another man. Since you already know that, I'm gonna break down the film: ANIMATION: 10/10: Incredible! Looks gorgeous, and breathtaking. It has Polar Express graphics, the facial expressions are priceless. Even Grendel looked awesome.<br /><br />NUDITY? Yes. Beowulf's behind gets shown (ugh) and everything obscures it. Angelina is nude, but obscured by gold. Sorry, fanboys.<br /><br />BLOOD? GORE? Yes. Lots of ripping in half, and blood!!!!! YUMMEH.<br /><br />SCRIPT: 10/10: Great Dialogue.<br /><br />Great movie!!!!!!! As for the 3D: The 3D is incredible. It's not like that corny stuff that pops out of the screen at you, it adds depth. Only a few things come out of the screen, which is someone's Spearhead. Otherwise, it looks GORGEOUS, it brings the movie to life. I saw it in IMAX, so that could be part of the reason... it was beautiful.<br /><br />Anyways, the 3D is the way to go, and I highly recommend this. See it!
184195425X|3.0|Both exciting and tedious. There were points to the story that are very gripping but other times when it seems to drag on too long. The first section of the book I could have done without. The author delves into the main charachter's religious and spiritual life and then kind of drops it when Pi becomes stranded. Either that or he just doesn't make a good point of it. The main part of the story of when Pi is stranded on a lifeboat with a bengal tiger that will hold your interest.     With a book titled \\"Life of Pi\\", I assumed I would be intellectually stimulated with thought provoking insight or something. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Instead, I was reading about someone who tries to be politically correct by worshipping Jesus, Vishnu and Mohammed simultaneously. All without offering any spiritual lesson. The pages only consist of bird, fish and animal killings to detail, repeatedly, travelling far from any kind of plot. One is left tossing, swinging from boredom to interesting and back to boredom again.

The son, left on his own, and knowing nothing about what his father does, begins out of loneliness to go for walks. He finds the camp and becomes friends with a boy wearing \\"striped pajamas.\\"   The ending of the book left me with  the word \\"Wow\\" and the need to start discussions with adults and students alike.
B00005JPS5|1.0|This movie goes nowhere and it takes a while to get there.  My kids and I went to the theater; I didn't laugh and they didn't laugh. In fact out of an entire theater only one lady laughed out loud; she only did that once or twice and I think she was drunk.  At least I know I don't need to buy the DVD.     Jerry Seinfeld is one of the top two comedians of our time but his humor and writing just don't fit well with a child's genre.  It makes sense after I've seen the movie, Jerry's humor is very adult; double entendres, innuendos and misunderstandings of mature subjects. It sounds like on of the Shrek movies but the Seinfelf humor just didn't translate into animated laughs. Some of it seems as if he was trying to be funny by committee.  All of the jokes, puns and physical comedy must have been pasteurized and homogenized by a group of executives.    The really disappointing thing is that they've been working on this movie for years, promoting it for at least 2 years and it's DOA.  They had the opportunity to really entertain, but in my opinion they had too many cooks in the kitchen.      Other reviewers have given away the story line so I won't bother, however I will say that the direction it starts out on is `self-discovery' and eventually gets back to that in the end.  And it is nice to see that the misconception some have; that MAN is not a part of nature, is somewhat dispelled in this movie.    I really wanted to like this movie too.  I love animated movies and I love Jerry Seinfeld but this movie actually combined the worst of the genre and the comedian. It just didn't work, sorry Jerry.
0765316889|3.0|Having loved Mistborn: The Final Empire last year, I was really eager to read its sequel, The Well of Ascension. The ending promised a lot of things to come, which made me curious as to what would occur next.    Unfortunately, The Well of Ascension didn't do it for me. Not at all, truth to tell. Indeed, for some reason it failed on basically every level to interest me. If this had been a book by anyone but Brandon Sanderson, I would have quit long before the end.    I really like Brandon. He's one of the nicest guys around in the genre, a class act and always accessible. I enjoyed both Elantris and Mistborn: The Final Empire, and I was truly looking forward to reading The Well of Ascension. In a way, I feel a bit bad about having to write such a negative review concerning the work of an author I respect. And yet, I have to be honest if I'm to maintain any semblance of integrity. Having said that, I'm glad there are some very positive reviews out there, which demonstrates that many people found it to their liking. I wish I could claim the same. . .    On the upside, once again I found the magical system to be the most fascinating aspect of this novel. We learn a bit more about it, and it's evident that Sanderson created something special. The action scenes are as cool as in the first volume, though they don't have the same sort of impact the second time around. The worldbuilding is interesting, yet I would have loved to learn more about the Deepness and the Well of Ascension. Still, I'm intrigued enough to pick up the third volume of this series.    In retrospect, I feel that there simply wasn't enough material to warrant a novel-length project. Yes, I'm well aware that this book weighs in at 589 pages, yet \\"filler\\" is predominant throughout. If you strip The Well of Ascension down to the bare essential, I feel that we'd be left with less than 100 pages. For the most part, by the halfway point of the novel, I was just going through the motions, plowing on without veritable interest, yet hoping that something would turn this one around and get me into it.    The Well of Ascension, with its banter and \\"funny\\" dialogues, shows once more that Brandon Sanderson is David Eddings' heir in terms of style, although he's more action-oriented than Eddings ever was. Which means that those who used to love David Eddings should enjoy Sanderson's work. On the downside, those people who couldn't stand Eddings will, in all likelihood, find Sanderson off-putting for the same reasons.    Unlike its predecessor, the characterization in The Well of Ascension is the facet which I found left the most to be desired. I believe the tale missed Kelsier a lot more than I ever thought possible. Vin and Elend's relationship makes for the better part of the story's backdrop, and I found it quite on the lame side. I was hoping for either or both to be killed by page 50, but alas this is no GRRM book. . . Without Kelsier, the rest of his crew lost all their erstwhile appeal.    The narrative doesn't flow well, mainly because Sanderson interrupts the flow of the story with constant thoughts and feelings from every single POV character. There is a lot of \\"inner\\" dialogue going on in their heads, often reflecting on what the narrative has just explained. This results in a somewhat sluggish pace, forcing us to go through a lot of emo crap which serves little purpose in the overall scheme of things. . .     The politicking -- the whole \\"let's make Ellend the bookworm a king\\" -- was clumsy and unrealistic. And since intrigue and politics are at the heart of the tale, I felt that this one read like a YA novel.    The ending is good enough to make me want to read the final volume of the series. But The Well of Ascension was a letdown, making this book my biggest disappointment of the year thus far.
0385522401|5.0|Lovely. A little, beautiful gem of a book, a masterpiece of restraint.  McEwan renders his story of emotional repression and loss with careful sensitivity and flawlessly controlled tone.  I was surprised to find McEwan displaying such care for the characters, for their various hurts, and for the eventual failure of patience and understanding toward each other that only hurts them further. There's not a trace of the mean-spirited or over-clever about it. I chose this as my last bit of unassigned reading before grad school got underway, and I'm awfully glad I did.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|Rachel Marron, portrayed by Whitney Houston, is a worldwide superstar singer and actress who has millions of adoring fans but one has taken there admirations too far.  In a world of glamour and celebrity Marron fights to maintain her career and Frank Farmer, her bodyguard, fights to keep her alive.    Kevin Costner portrays Frank Farmer, a no-nonsense bodyguard hired by the singers associates that struggles with Marron's devotion to her career and her own deluted view that she is invincible.      Houston plays a charachter that paralells her real life, an accomplished actress and singer who is being stalked by an obsessive fan.  Bodyguard was to be the big vehicle to launch Houston into a mega film career.  Although Houston's performance is commendable for her first film effort, her shinging moments in the film are when she showcases the soundtrack, which is incredible.  Costner is strong in his stern, powerful role.    Bodyguard, although panned by many critics, was extremly successful at the box office both domestically and worldwide.  The 8th highest grossing film of all time, Bodyguard was financially a success for Houston but her acting performance was ignored by critics.  The film has many twists and turns and keeps you guessing.  It is not an Oscar worthy performance by Houston, but highly entertaining!
B000WCDI64|5.0|This certainly is an accurate capturing of Amy Winehouse in concert. She's a bit tipsy, her between songs banter with the crowd is all at once funny, charming and rambling. She seems to lose her train of thought a time or two, but when she sings, there is no denying the magic and power of her voice. Her wonderful backing band does a stellar job throughout and the home turf of London makes for a very appreciative and supportive crowd.     I thouroughly enjoyed the hour long documentary \\"I Told You I Was Trouble.\\" Some great behind the scenes footage of her younger days, never before seen performances--even a very early showcase inside her record company's offices. If you are a fan of Miss Amy, you will greatly enjoy this DVD. Well worth the price!
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Here it is, short and sweet (all you need to know): Spiderman 3 is worth seeing for the brilliant performance of Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) as the Sandman. The Sandman special effect is terrific. However, this film suffers from the following: 1. Too many super heroes and villains. You can't tell them apart without a scorecard. Goblin Jr. is way too much like Bruce Wayne. You just want to slap Topher Grace's irritating little bad guy. 2. Overacting by Tobey Maguire (the evil spiderman persona is just too much). 3. Too much Mary Jane Watson (yikes, she even sings in this one). 4. Confusing plotline. 5. Way too long; at least a half hour should have been discreetly edited. 6. Comic schtick that falls flat. The scene in the restaurant where Peter is trying to ask Mary Jane to marry him with comic action in the background is excruciating. That's it. The Spiderman franchise is in real danger of going the route of the original Batman films: too many villains, dumb comedy and painful overacting. And, oh yes, Aunt May is so sweet you will want to toss your popcorn.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles perform a great collection of songs - and not just Eagles songs; there are a few Don Henley and Joe Walsh songs in here too. They play their major hits. Eagles hits such as \\"The Long Run\\", \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" and many more are here, as well as Don Henley hits (\\"The Boys Of Summer\\", \\"Dirty Laundry\\", and more) and Joe Walsh hits (\\"Rocky Mountain Way\\", \\"Life's Been Good\\", and more). They put on a good show, and they're fun to watch.    Video & camera work: The video is very clear and crisp. The focus is mainly on the band, as I think it should be, with occasional views of the enthusiastic crowd. Occasional close-ups of individual band members from various angles are also included, and is done very well. Overall, the video and camera work is excellent.    The sound is good, too. I only have a stereo sound setup, but I have no complaints on the sound.    This is one of the best concert videos I have seen. The overall combination of a great set of songs, along with the camera work and video quality, makes this a great choice if you're an Eagles/Don Henley/Joe Walsh fan.
B000WGZGNS|3.0|The Beyonce' Experience was Beyonce' Knowles's first headlining tour as a solo artist and lives up to everything you can expect it to be, based on what you're usually used to seeing from her.  Very glamourous, very flirty, very seductive, and over the top at times, Beyonce' pulled out all the stops on this outing as she breezed through her huge catalogue of hits in a 2-hour set that garnered nothing but positive reviews and praise when she toured the states the Summer of 2007 (sans the unfortunate pyrotechnics mishap in St. Louis and serious tumble down the stairs during \\"Ring the Alarm\\" in Orlando).<br /><br />While clearly realizing with certain numbers that \\"we've seen it all before,\\" from her \\"Ring the Alarm\\" performance a la the 2006 MTV Music Awards to her Kylie Minogue-inspired robot opening of \\"Get Me Bodied\\" from the 2007 BET Awards, along with familiar recreations of the videos on her B'Day Anthology Album DVD, it's the energy and commitment Beyonce brings to the stage that sells this entire tour, next to her Southern charm and beauty.  To see it in a live setting is just something that has to be admired, as opposed to watching countless award show appearances and performances and videos in the comfort of your home.  Even watching this DVD you can only imagine the rush of seeing her perform live.  However, there was nothing fancy about the show: no elaborate sets or gaudy costumes, not a whole lot of lights and explosions.  Along with her all female band, buxom backup singers known as \\"The Mamas,\\" and a fierce dance troupe, next to the star herself, you tend to finish the show wishing for just a little bit more.<br /><br />The set list was (which may stray slightly from the DVD release):<br />Crazy in Love<br />Freakum Dress<br />Green Light<br />Baby Boy<br />Beautiful Liar<br />Naughty Girl<br />Me, Myself And I<br />Dangerously In Love<br />Flaws & All<br />DC3 Medley<br />-Independent Women Part I<br />-Bootylicious<br />-No No No Part 2<br />-Bug a Boo<br />-Bills, Bills, Bills<br />-Cater 2 U<br />-Say My Name<br />-Jumpin' Jumpin'<br />-Soldier<br />-Survivor<br />Speechless<br />Ring the Alarm<br />Suga Mama<br />Upgrade U<br />'03 Bonnie & Clyde<br />Check On It<br />D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu<br />Get Me Bodied<br />Welcome to Hollywood<br />Dreamgirls<br />Listen<br />Irreplaceable<br />Happy B'Day<br /><br />The performance at the Staples Center differs from other performances during the trek as Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams join her on stage for \\"Survivor\\" and Jay-Z during \\"Upgrade U.\\"<br /><br />Highlights:<br />-After stripping the floor length gown off and into a sizzling mini-dress, she steers away from the original song to sing \\"Crazy\\" by Gnarls Barkley.  She also does this when she sings \\"Dangerously in Love,\\" quickly switching into Jill Scott's \\"He Loves Me\\" for the remainder of the track.<br />-Beyonce cried during \\"Flaws and All\\" at mulitple shows<br />-The \\"Welcome to Hollywood\\" swell captured some never-before-seen footage of Beyonce behind the scenes<br /><br />Some \\"Iffy\\" Points:<br />-Beyonce was unable to hold her own on the songs that didn't require just her, i.e. \\"Beautiful Liar,\\" which seemed out of place without Shakira, and most of the Destiny's Child songs<br />-Some of the songs had a twist on them that really should've been left out like the Chopped & Screwed mix of \\"Bug a Boo\\" and the slowed up version of \\"Check On It.\\"<br />-While it's realized that she wanted to give her fans all that she's offered musically, she tried to jumble way too many songs into the show, some should've clearly been omitted so that others could've been performed in their entirety<br />-The \\"Dreamgirls\\" sequence was just a little too much and could've been executed differently<br /><br />While some may contend that the lack of extra effects and high ticket cost (single seats topped $200 in some cities, not to mention up to over $1000 for fan club exclusive seats and a once in a lifetime meet and greet) was not worth it, the \\"experience\\" was clearly the making of a music superstar who has many years ahead of her to perfect her craft to icon status.  This is a DVD must-have for any fan of Beyonce, Destiny's Child, or person who was unable to score tickets to one of the most anticipated tours of 2007.e, Destiny's Child, or person who was unable to score tickets to one of the most anticipated tours of 2007.

The video is very clear and crisp.  The detail of the high-definition video makes this concert great to watch.    Camera work: The focus is mainly on the band, as I think it should be, with occasional views of the enthusiastic crowd.

B000EQHHJW|5.0|There are so many reasons to like this film version of Verdi's Rigoletto. So many people have already listed them I feel somewhat redundant in listing them again, but I had to add my \\"2 cents.\\"    The main reason to get this really is Ingvar Wixell's Rigoletto. He is to baritones what Callas was to sopranos... A SINGING ACTOR. He has the ability to make you feel for him, to despise him, to laugh with him, all the emotions. His is the most believeable jester I've ever had the pleasure of seeing and hearing. His singing is excellent as well, like molten lava, even if his top is a bit pushed. I also thought it wonderfully ironic to have him play both Rigoletto & Monterone- that way the curse is even more like a personal thing. If you liked Wixell in this, you'll love him as Scarpia in the Arena di Verona production of Tosca with Eva Marton (available from Kultur on DVD).    Obviously Pavarotti is another reason to get this. Vocally his Duke is impressive and no one captures that same kind of mischeiviousness like he can. That said I do agree with another review that the recording of his part seems to be overly loud- like he was mic'd too closely. I didn't find the same true with the other singers and in fact, Gilda's \\"Caro nome\\" required me to raise the volume a lot.     Gruberova's Gilda is wonderful as well. To me she has one of the most sumptuous coloratura voices ever. Her voice is never reedy or thin like some coloraturas, she has a heft and richness that is throughout her range. Her floating pianissimos are also simply astounding.     There are really no weak links here to me- I can cite some flaws, but overall this is a quality production and lots of fun to watch.  Highly recommended ******
0440238609|1.0|You know the verse.<br /><br />\\"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and your daemons shall assume their true forms, and ye shall be as gods; knowing good and evil.\\"<br /><br />Not quite how you remembered it?<br /><br />The biblical quote was tweaked by children's author Phillip Pullman, whose fantasies are set to revisit the world December 7th, as New Line Cinema releases their version of Pullman's celebrated novel, The Golden Compass. In an alternate England where Church is State and every human is attended by an animal counterpart, or daemon, the film tells of an orphan girl who travels from Oxford to the North in search of a kidnapped friend. Along the way she discovers comrades among the oppressed and enemies among the oppressors.<br /><br />A common storyline. What is everyone so upset about? According to Catholics, Pullman might have been a bit nicer to the Church (they're his villains), but isn't it just make-believe? Perhaps.<br /><br />For hundreds of years, make-believe places--Heorot to Middle Earth--have given us a clearer view of our own world. Readers set aside everyday life to peer onto another stage, where right and wrong are played out unequivocally, and when the curtains close, we love good all the more having known men like Aragon, and despise evil worse than ever having confronted murderers like the Nine. Young imaginations are especially receptive of supposals, as Jesus recognized when he told followers to receive the kingdom of God as little children.<br /><br />But what if a writer, harnessing fantasy's power, invited kids to suspend traditional beliefs about God, authority and growing up, for completely new assumptions? Just as the serpent whispered, Ye shall not surely die, the stories of such an author could circulate a new paradigm where a loving, omnipotent God and an afterlife in heaven were cruel lies. Consequently, man's rebellion against God would be revealed as a liberation from Him, with Eve becoming a heroine who rejected blind obedience for the sake of curiosity and an inquiring mind. That writer is Phillip Pullman.<br /><br />The Golden Compass is his auspicious opening of an increasingly didactic trilogy geared toward young readers. The engaging plot, action and colorful characters hook children, but Pullman's conclusion recasts truth and fails to deliver. Promising adventures turn into the disposal of a pathetic Ancient of Days, the exposure of the myths of heaven and hell, and the establishment of a society for mortals to utopianize until their atoms pass on to flowers and trees. Pullman may twist classic lines, but his additions don't enhance anything. Instead, young readers are left with a world devoid of hope and happy endings, where nothing is eternal except the present delight.<br /><br />Filmmakers are adamant that their production of The Golden Compass dilutes Pullman's hostile representation of the Church. In making their film more kid-friendly, they also removed the disturbing death portrayed in the novel's final scene. While these decisions may yield a PG rating [UPDATE: the MPAA has rated The Golden Compass PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence] and fewer offended churchgoers, children whose imaginations are stirred by the cinema will certainly devour Pullman's trilogy, where they'll learn \\"the Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" Heroes will assure them, \\"We shouldn't live as if [heaven] mattered more than this life in this world.\\" Pullman's Great Supposal stamps pliable minds with secular humanism.<br /><br />Practiced Christians who read the trilogy face little danger--Pullman's inversions ring hollow because they're not true forms. Thanks to God's unchanging Word, we know good and evil. We know that when the term is over, the holidays begin. But via Phillip Pullman, countless young people are discovering that religion is a ridiculous lie. The alternative His Dark Materials offers is the alternative these children embrace: \\"build the Republic of Heaven where [you] are, because for us there is no elsewhere.\\" We're all the gods this world will ever know, Pullman concludes, and today is our only time on stage. Shouldn't Christians call out, \\"Cut!\\"?he alternative these children embrace: \\"build the Republic of Heaven where [you] are, because for us there is no elsewhere.\\" We're all the gods this world will ever know, Pullman concludes, and today is our only time on stage. Shouldn't Christians call out, \\"Cut!\\"?
006088732X|5.0|Wow, I love love LOVED this book.  I thought it would be another regular book about the rich girls but this was an awesome mystery story...I can't wait to read the next book, Flawless!!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Highly recommend!  Beautiful music!  I asked for it for Christmas 2006 and \\"we\\" have practically wore it out.  My husband grew up listening to The Beatles, I am too young.  I thought he would not like it because of the changes done to the original recordings.  But he loves it!  And so do I.  It really made me want to listen to all The Beatles music and I learned to appreciate their talent.  Now I'm a Beatles fan.
B000026OWF|4.0|Herbie has fun with synthesizers here, and it actually turns out to be fabulous: I think the weird, buzzing synth on \\"The Traitor\\" has a lot of personality and sounds totally unlike anything I've heard the instrument ever do. By the way, \\"The Traitor\\" is also a kickin' piece of Stevie Wonder-like clavinet-driven funk. And I like \\"Hang up Your Hangups\\" even better: unbeatable bluesy jazz-funk. And even though the quiet, mellow funk \\"Bubbles\\" doesn't really break any new ground, the fact is I admire that song too, particularly the light, tasteful wah-wah guitar, soprano sax (played by Wayne Shorter, of course) and shimmering keyboards. Oh, and the bass groove. Can't forget that. And the burbling funk of \\"Steppin' in It\\" has Stevie himself playing a great harmonica solo. This is probably Hancock's funkiest overall release, but it's not without its problems: \\"Sun Touch\\" is downright annoying, and it isn't a significant advance beyond the Head Hunters sound: more Hancock resting on his laurels than anything else. Still, if you like the sound, you can't lose here.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I went to see this movie with my daughter and was immediatlely engrossed. I loved the French setting, I immediately needed a glass of wine. Then I needed fine cheese and strawberry.  I now own this movie, whenever I am alone with my daughter we put it in, I get out a nice red, Pinot Noir or a nice Merlot, strawberry and warm brie and apple juice for her.    The storyline, I refer to every-now-and-again when I need her to know that she is capable of doing whatever she wants, she just needs to have the desire, and also never do what is the norm, step-out-of-the-box every now and again.    Peter O'Toole's words at the end are indeed words, among others of course, to live by.    Entertaining, motivational, the life to live (romance,romatic)
B0009MAP90|3.0|Okay, so here we have it: Dylan's first record, and one of his more obscure. That's because only half of it shows Dylan's power and talent. Of course the popular, humorous talkin' blues \\"Talkin' New York\\", which preceded similar \\"talkin' blueses\\" like \\"I Shall Be Free\\", \\"I Shall Be Free, No. 10\\", \\"Motorpsycho Nitemare\\" and numerous others is one of them. That certainly belongs in the upper rank of Dylan classics. It's also one of the two originals here. The other is \\"Song to Woody\\", which is solid as well. Plus you also get several excellent covers of old folk songs. Every song but the two I already mentioned is a folk song, in fact. I'd much rather hear this bone-chilling, ragged version of \\"In My Time of Dying\\" than Led Zeppelin's ultra-indulgent version, and he gets the same general effect on \\"Fixing to Die\\", where he sounds as desperate as the title would imply. And I'm going to make a big controversial statement and say I like Dylan's edgy, cathartic \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" even more than the Animals' famous blues-rock take. Also solid is the desolate \\"Highway 51 Blues\\". Nonetheless, I can't get into all of this: I never enjoyed the lament \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\"; there's a far better version of \\"Peggy-O\\" by Simon & Garfunkel; \\"You're No Good\\" does absolutely nothing for me, but at least it's quick; \\"Gospel Plow\\" and \\"Freight Train Blues\\" are speedy but dull; \\"Baby Let Me Follow you Down\\" is much better on Live 1966, where it's converted into a full-on rocker. So basically if you get this you'll be entertained, and if you skip it you won't miss much.
B000VI70WM|2.0|Major disappointment this is. I somehow liked the last three tracks the most - She's too much, Dirty Great Monster(even though it should be Great Dirty Monster), and Last Man Standing. The entire album made me want to listen to Big Thing, a far superior set.
B000005H3A|2.0|What is with jazz musicians naming their debuts egotistically anyway? Mingus' first major label album gets pegged as Pithecanthropus Erectus, which just screams \\"I am artist, hear me roar!\\" Miles does Birth of the Cool (that's right, this is the birth of cool jazz! Right here, baby!), Ornette refers to his debut as Something Else!!!, the ever-pretentious (but still good) Mahavishnu Orchestra have the Inner Mounting Flame, Monk's got Brilliant Corners (well it was for all intents and purposes his first LP, since it was preceded by a covers album and a collection of 45s), and Hancock's is Takin' Off, which implies he's launching himself into the atmosphere or something. Hey guys, these are your debuts! Try to be a bit less assuming! Anyway, this is actually a fine album once you get down to it. At least if you're listening to the right stuff. \\"Watermelon Man\\" is a good example - his first release, and he's already experimenting with a rhythm that's sure not traditional jazz. Of course he later had a hit with the remade Headhutners version, but let me tell you, this one's better. Song rules either way, of course. Now the problem with Takin' Off is that Hancock spends most of it milking the \\"Watermelon Man\\" groove for all it's worth, which is why I only give Takin' Off two stars, instead of the five it could've gotten if everything was as good as \\"Watermelon Man\\". He does make it work on \\"Empty Pockets\\", but \\"The Maze\\" and \\"Driftin'\\" just left me wondering whether or not he planned to expand. And is the ballad \\"Alone and I\\" a good one? If you answered \\"No\\", you just won today's prize. So like all the stereotypical debuts built around a well-known song, it shows promise, but doesn't achieve that promise. That would come later.
B0000033IR|4.0|A lot of people rank this as Aretha's best album, or at least in her top three. I don't know about that myself; there is a lot of filler on this album, mostly mediocre to bad covers (\\"Groovin'\\", which never was that good a song in the first place - to generalize once again, covers of bad songs will probably turn out just as bad, if not worse; \\"Niki Hoeky\\" is, um... hokey; \\"People Get Ready\\" is turned from moving to schlocky - try to find the Impressions' original instead; no amount of Aretha's belting can redeem \\"Come Back Baby\\"). The rest is far better, thank Gitchie Mondou. You get a classic unbridled soul shouter known as \\"(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You've Been Gone\\" - the single song I use to point out why Aretha is the greatest soul singer ever; \\"(You Make Me Feel Like a) Natural Woman\\" and \\"Ain't No Way\\" are tender, moving ballads; \\"Chain of Fools\\" is my favorite Aretha Franklin song, a cup of proto-funk that would make James Brown proud. Speaking of James Brown, she also does a very good cover of his popular \\"Money Won't Change You\\". The most underrated of the batch is the slow, gritty blues \\"Good to Me as I Am to You\\", with a solid guitar riff from Eric Clapton. It was also written solely by Franklin, proving she could be quite a good songwriter herself: she also co-wrote \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" with Teddy White and \\"Ain't No Way\\" with her sister Carolyn. If you're addicted to Aretha, this will satisfy.
B0000AKY7R|4.0|So here we go, continuing in the direction of Santana's extremely underrated fusion phase. And who's guest-starring? That's right, John McLaughlin!!  Yeah, he's cool. Anyway, this whole shamalamadingdong starts off with a pair of excellent Coltrane covers - neither are better than the originals, but they both excel. First, \\"A Love Supreme\\" (only part one, not the whole thing) is awesome, with the two guitarists trading some truly fine licks; \\"Naima\\" is pretty lovely remade for acoustic guitars. Neither of these guys are known for their acoustic work, but they both can play those things rather well. Better than I can, at any rate. I find it odd that they cover Coltrane extensively on a fusion album, when Coltrane's more of a free-jazz guy, but Trane's my favorite artist, so I can't complain. After that is the only weak spot on the album. \\"The Love Divine\\" is obviously an attempt by McLaughlin to recreate \\"Ascension\\" or \\"Selflessness\\", but it's boring. And chaos isn't supposed to be boring! That's not how it works! God, I swear... But the song after that is my favorite: \\"Let Us Go into the House of the Lord. John and Carlos convey so many different emotions through their guitars on that one, it's amazing. It's like we've got two John Coltranes (of course, guitar-slingin' John Coltranes) on the same album! That is Santana. That is jazz. Now, there's one last song, but it doesn't do much for me. \\"Meditations\\" is... well, it's easy on the ears, I guess. The good news is that \\"The Love Divine\\" is the only pile of goat droppings on the album, and even then it's much better than \\"Open Invitation\\".
0375714839|5.0|It's been a long time since a book has affected me as much as Persepolis. I think it's the point of view, of a young girl growing into a young adult, that makes the story so poignant. How we come to our beliefs, how our beliefs sometimes shift, how we find ourselves making choices that don't necessarily reflect those beliefs: all of this and more is eloquently written and drawn in this memoir. If everyone who thinks  people in the Middle East, or all Muslims, are our enemies would read this book, perhaps we would be able to focus on the REAL enemies of our democracy.
140120306X|5.0|Well, after what seems like a lifetime of delays, copyright issues, publishing battles and general waiting, I finally have my hands on Black Dossier. and it's fantastic. The book is definately worth the money as it's chock full of all kinds of extra goodies including a Shakespeare folio, a sequel to Fanny Hill, a pornographic comic and of course the truly EPIC 3d section which closes the book (do NOT miss this bit!)    The story itself is probably more easily compared to volume 1 of the League than volume 2, as it involves several powers revolving around one item. However, Moore and O'Neill's storytelling seems like a natural progression from volume 2 ie. More sex, violence, nudity and swearing are included, in particular the swearing, which to be honest seems overused in some parts of the book. The nudity however is all tastefully done and does not detract from the quality of the story at all.    The book is basically arranged as follows:  It starts with Allan and Mina trying to obtain the Dossier... when they obtain it the first half of the Dossier itself is shown. This contains many different artistic and literary styles and is incredibly well made, even using different kinds of paper in parts! Then the story returns to Allan and Mina, and after that the second half of the Dossier is shown before the book's conclusion. This layout for the plot may sound confusing but it progresses very smoothly and works very well in detailing parts of the plot.    overall, this book is hugely successful and as a huge fan of the series my expectations were very high. I was not disappointed in the slightest and can therefore recommend this to any comics/League/literature fan as an incredible reading experience
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Hello Everybody!    I'm from Russia.  First we were shown 1-st season and I don't remember when it was exactly. Year ago probably we saw jast 2-nd season. On my last birthday my wife presented me pirate copies of all season. As a fact many episodos were missed. For this birthday I bought Rambaldy box and 5 seasons from Amazon. For the weekend I've seen almoust 4-th Episode and all night I was fighting with Sloan in my dreams. :)    If you asked - Are you a fan of Alias?  My answer is - yes.     First of All - it's interesting what will be after. Music is also wonderful. It's very dinamical and if needs dramatic. It's very interesting to watch under relations between Sid and Von. They are beautiful couple.     What I dont like:  Some scenes are to simple and not realistic  If somthing happens in German it means that all guys must drink bear and weitress must be dressed in meditiranian clothes. If it is Russia - vodka moscow and Siberia. :)    I think it was very fantastic and exciting to be one of principal caracter for 5 years. My favorite is father of Sid. He is a real hero.
B000BT97AO|4.0|Before I saw `Mirrormask' for myself, the glowing reviews here on Amazon surprised me a little. Despite being penned by fantasy author Neil Gaiman in collaboration with The Jim Henson Company, my reaction to the trailers I'd seen wasn't overly enthusiastic. Indeed I wasn't particularly moved to go out of my way to see this film. For some reason my impression of `Mirrormask' was that it show-cased a unique visual style, but wasn't quite matched by a satisfying story.    But in small part I found the opposite to be true- the story engaged me, but the special-effects didn't entrance me. This film does succeed very well however at contrasting the unique home life of the heroine against the strangely disjointed, dark, other-worldly realm she is transported to via her own sketches. If the visual style doesn't quite captivate in every respect, the dialogue certainly does, there are some beautifully phrased and memorable lines delivered by Helena, her mum and her partner-in-crime, the mischievous Valentine.    Having recently seen `Stardust' (based on a book by Gaiman) at the cinema I can definitely see similarities between the two films, the dialogue in particular, but if you expect a similar level of excitement you may be a little disappointed, because while `Stardust' is certainly the extravaganza, `Mirrormask' is more the curiosity, which may not appeal to everyone, but which I'd still heartily recommend for an honest and universal story of hope, fear and fantastical happenings.
B000VUFJ4Q|4.0|[[ASIN:B000VUFJ4Q Taylor Swift]]  Taylor Swift offers up the perfect \\"new country album\\" with the (re)release of her self-titled debut. The new release contains three more tracks than the original album (the last three on the album). Overall, \\"Taylor Swift\\" is about being a young woman, optimistic and emotional, living through the ups and downs of her country/cosmopolitan life. Certainly meant more for the women in the crowd, Swift's songs range from slow with gooey romantic lyrics to quick-paced and free-spirited. Her performance is remarkably strong, especially for a newcomer on the scene. Having all the talent and charisma of Carrie Underwood, but with a warmer touch and perhaps a bit more depth, \\"Taylor Swift\\" is a must-listen for anyone who is a woman, or has a woman in his life.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Thank you, Britney -- for proving that you can still create a decent album despite your personal life mishaps as of late. Blackout is great. I am impressed and surprised.
0141439475|5.0|This novel is probably one of the top twenty of all time for the grace of the writing, the vividness of the monster and the plot development.  I think I read a reviewer write that you should watch the movie instead of reading this book, or as a supplement to a movie.  That is a horrendous statement because Frankenstein has just about everything that a book has to offer.  This would basically be like telling people to never read anything but poorly written instruction manuals.<br /><br />First of all I love the way that Dr. Frankenstein is developed.  He is known to the author first as a dedicated learner, and we all know that man, but then he is known as a person that knows a woman, since his story also tells us about her.  So his character is already defined psychologically (and what other way could there be in a book because physical description of people only go so far in a book) in terms of a woman and his creation Frankenstein.  It makes me want to scribble some love notes on Mary Shelley's grave.<br /><br />Frankenstein himself is another extremely well defined character, and the whole story breathes life into him.  It is pure beauty, since he is not defined in terms of some properties alone, but what dominates is what the others have seen, and that's what he becomes.  The shading of characters, and the unwinding stack of letters, and the sequence of events make this book pure candy for the soul.<br /><br />If this book were a three-star book why would Frankenstein be a household name so many years later?  Also just for the sake of it, this book is not so reproducible as the Dracula story which abounds in bookstores today like no other myth.  Frankenstein is more of a psychological character made by the entirety of the novel and whole, described mostly just as \\"hideous\\", whereas Dracula is defined by others in terms of all sorts of cool properties.  Modern vampire books make him out as like some sort of mr. potatohead.  Frankenstein is the more tragic villain I would say, and more simply defined villain.  Dracula is kind of a hysterical villain, with his lusts and pluggable physical properties that accomodate his lusts for darkness with his lists of charms and aversions.  In fact many others want to be Dracula, and there is envy of Dracula, but Frankenstein is categorically repulsed as an abomination, and as a creation not of god, but he was born in the book, whereas Dracula has unexplained and freakish dispositions.  It's interesting now though that Frankenstein should grow in cultural relevance in relation to Dracula who was born out of slavic legends I think, with all of science's creations, but the Dracula franchise sells more for some reason.  Perhaps it's a more optimistic view of the future, an evolved human with cool sunglasses, sexually rapacious appetites and gadgets, rather than an abomination of scientific creation.mply defined villain.

B00005N7Z1|2.0|The only reasons we, Sid the Elf, gave this non-B stinkfest 2 stars was due to some cool explosions. Sid intended to do two things tonight, laugh and watch a great unintentional comedy. Well, Sid always has a good time, but there was not a passable unintentional comedy in sight.<br /><br />Robocop is based on an effemine Chris Hansen looking cop, who gets blasted, then transformed into a cyborg cop. So, eventually, he goes after the guys who killed him and turned into a metal man. In the business they call that a revenge story. Well, here's the revenge Robocop exacted until the last 15 minutes of the movie: he arrested the bad men. Wow, enthraling! Really, Sid was riveted. Then, they had to make this movie even girlier by making Robocop fall in love with his butch partner, who looked like Sid's sophomore year biology teacher. For those of you who did not graduate from North Pole High, that's not good.<br /><br />So, if your woman is looking for a chick flick with a little action, rent Robocop and put it on in one room. Then pop in your copy of Predator or Total Recall for yourself in another.
B000001FS6|2.0|I have a theory about this album, the first bad disc U2 ever put out. With The Joshua Tree, U2 suddenly had the ear of the world. So what did they do? They pushed their political agenda. And while I agree with Bono's points about poverty in Africa (which needs to be fixed), televangelism, and how amazing Martin Luther King, Jr. was, Bono makes a total fool out of himself on this album by presenting his opinion in the most didactic, in-your-face way. What's the dumbest quote on the live portion of the album? Well, there are several, including the infamous \\"Am I buggin' ya? I don't mean to bug ya. Edge, play the blues!\\", from the uninteresting protest \\"Silver and Gold\\", which is followed by a guitar solo that has as much to do with the blues as Beethoven's Ninth, to that laughable switched lyric from \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", \\"All I've got is a red guitar, three chords, and the truth\\". Yeah. It's far too obvious to beat up on the live tracks, which also contain a poor cover of \\"Helter Skelter\\" (\\"This is a song that Charles Manson stole from the Beatles... AND NOW WE'RE STEALING IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\"), so I just won't. Suffice it to say that they're all, without a single exception, really, really bad.<br />But hey, all that's all right, because the studio tracks are gonna save the day, right? WRONG! Okay, not entirely wrong. There are some really good songs on the studio side. Five, to be exact. First off, maybe it's because I like B.B. King more than most U2 fans, but I see nothing wrong with \\"When Love Comes to Town\\", other than the weirdness of the B.B.-Bono matchup. There are a few others, too: \\"Desire\\" is a blast, with a fun Bo Diddley beat and a horn section. \\"All I Want Is You\\" and \\"Angel of Harlem\\" are good songs too, and I love \\"Hawkmoon 269\\". And... that's it for the good stuff.<br />Now, onto... well, the rest. \\"God, pt. 2\\" is one of U2's most embarrassing songs. It's a trip-hop continuation of John Lennon's fantastic \\"God\\", but here it's just Bono ripping on the most trivial people he could pull out of the hat Edge wore on the cover of The Joshua Tree. Much as I like Dylan, he doesn't sound all that good on \\"Love Rescue Me\\", which he features on. They make the mistake of letting the Edge \\"Van Dieman's Land\\", and it turns out he's not a good singer at all.  And \\"Heartland\\" is a bland Joshua Tree outtake.<br />This, right here, is a classic example of what fame can do to a good band. I don't really like the direction U2 shifted towards in the '90s, so I see this as kind of the beginning of the end (at least until they were reborn with All That You Can't Leave Behind) for U2. A very bad, very unfocused, very confusing album.the most trivial people he could pull out of the hat Edge wore on the cover of The Joshua Tree.

B0000AUHPG|4.0|That's correct, for with 312 other reviews here you only need a few words from me. And while on the subject of words, this is a movie with much acting and action, but very few words. Think they only worked from 15 pages of dialog script. Astounding.    I love westerns, whether in book or movie form, but have never really gotten into the 'spaghetti' westerns. Somehow no matter how good, they always get it wrong, just cannot capture the American west. Almost like us trying to capture Roman Empire epics on film, the Italians can do it better, and have.    Well, anyway, got this DVD for five bucks and finally got around to watching it. Gotta say it is a very interesting movie, it does move slowly and the plot is almost paper thin, but the acting and especially the camera work are just plain terrific.    As a final signature western from Sergio Leone it is something to be proud of, as I'm sure he was. I can see how many people and many theatres did not like this film, and it did bomb in most areas other than France where it became a cult favorite.    But if you stick with the movie and pay attention to the movement and camera work you will be impressed. Hard to believe the camera work did not win an Oscar, for to me it is not only that good, but it is very unique from any other western I've seen.    One large gap here, though, is that Sergio was trying to tell the story of railroad building in America, yet there is little actual history or laying of track in the film. However, there are few scenes lacking either an engine or train cars so that does help tie things together.    I was prepared not to like this movie, but the camera work won me over. Glad I have it on my western DVD shelf.    Semper Fi.
B0001FGBD4|3.0|About what you would expect from a sampler CD.  The tracks range from OK to outstanding.  As a big Maynard Ferguson fan, I purchased it for the MF track which is good, but track 3:  The Real Blues by The Ray Brown Trio is currently my favorite \\"demo\\" track for my new speakers (Gallo Reference 3 and A'Diva Titanium surrounds).  The texture of the bass solos that start and end the track are incredible.  You may find a new favorite on this disc and it is a great way to audition a dozen SACDs.
B000VI70X6|5.0|Shakira does it again with her Oral Fixation tour. To date, it is estimated that more then 2 million people watched this concert live (wow). Indeed, this DVD shows you why she is internationally famous.    01Estoy Aqui--Simply the best performance of Estoy Aqui. The music is pleasing to those who don't speak Spanish.     02 Te Dejo Madrid--A favorite in Spain--this performance is one exiting show. Pay special attention to the electric guitars at the beginning.    03 Don't Bother-This peformance is great.    04-Antologia---Will simply make you feel as though you are in the air EVEN if you don't speak the language. It is very sweet, sad, and her voice sets the stage for a melancolic atmoshere. AND she does it well. The music is soft here---yet this is perhaps one of the most memorable performances of the DVD.    05--Hey You--Simply watch and enjoy    08-La Tortura---If you love reggaeton you will love this. Watch those hips shake.     09--No--Simply a breath taking performance. Watch that dress turn into a flower before your very eyes. It's simply one of the best stunts of Shakira.    10--Whenever Wherever---remember the music video. Well this is WAYYYY BETTER. Enjoy!!!!!    15-Ojos Asi--Simply a great belly dancing performance. Spanish not required to enjoy.    16-Hips Don't Lie---her hips really don't lie. The best dancing, belly dancing you will ever see on stage.
B000W1V5VU|1.0|Movie's good! But DVD sucks big time!!! I've got VHS cassettes in better quality than that DVD. At the beginning, I thought my Sony Home Theatre System(DAV HDX500) & Sony Bravia TV got totally messed up. Turned out, there's nothing wrong with the equipment - thank God! DVD's a problem!<br />Sound (Only 2.1) & Picture Quality (Very grainy, lack of focus etc.) make that movie \\"unpleasant\\" to watch. Even if you have decent TV & HTS. Kind of a bad copy of a very used VHS cassette. Shame on Warner Bros. or those guys who release such poor quality DVDs. I decided to buy/rent a couple more copies and compare the quality. If they're any better, than Amazon.com should reconsider their partnership with the distributor or whoever they are, 'cause it's definitely not the product I've expected!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|I am a staunch Republican conservative who thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Strangelove. It is not an indulgence in self-hating Americanism. Sadly, we cannot ignore the outside possibility that a political or military leader might go crazy and murder millions of people. This movie reminds us of the serious responsibility of safeguarding our weapons of mass destruction systems. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that whatsoever! A sharp distinction must be made between naively advocating unilateral disarmament---and prudently taking steps to limit the odds against human error or malevolence.<br /><br />Please watch Dr. Stangelove and judge it only by what is actually on the screen. The fact that it was created by left-wingers is not relevant. They did not cross the line and ridicule our country in this particular instance. I am sure that you will find Dr, Strangelove highly entertaining and thought provoking. It is truly one of the great movies of all time.

0307387178|4.0|I read Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer ten years ago and was captivated by the idea that people would readily embark on a journey under such extreme survival conditions. Krakauer is a brilliant writer who builds a character like Frank L. Wright would a structure...one within the environment.     Into the Wild describes another radical life style but this one is a boy, Christopher McCanless, just out of college with more advantages than most. McCanless rebels against his privileged family life and embraces one as a transient hitchhiker who dreams of surviving in the Alaska wilderness. I struggled to find meaning in the life McCanless chose, despite Krakauer's attempts to justify.  The book pulls you through his travels, intrigued, exhausted, and finally spent at the end.  I found myself asking, \\"Why\\"?

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is a story you've probably read before.  It's the Count of Monte Cristo meets 1984; and it's beautifully done.  I think a few other reviewers tried to over analyze it.  Yes, it IS probably saying that fascism is bad and that we must jealously guard our rights or suffer having them stolen from us.  It IS saying that it's not right to marginalize and criminalize people because they don't fit exactly into the \\"perfect citizen\\" mold.  Wouldn't any great piece of literature do the same?  Don't watch it for any social commentary though, it's a good flick.
0316001821|5.0|Reviewed by Tammy Petty Conrad for Reader Views (11/07)<br /><br />This is one of those books I knew I should have already read. Everyone had been talking about it. I knew it would be a good read and worth the time, but somehow it hadn't made it to the top of my pile on the nightstand. Besides, who wants to read about a fourteen-year-old girl being raped and murdered? As a mother of a teenager, it was a topic I wanted to avoid.<br /><br />But from the beginning of the story I was mesmerized. The victim, Susie Salmon, like the fish, as the author says, tells the story beginning with her brutal demise and carries on throughout the years watching her family, friends and strangers from her version of heaven. She becomes the proverbial \\"fly on the wall\\" and shares all that she sees. In the beginning we eavesdrop on the mind of a child as she becomes aware of the danger she is in and that she won't be surviving. As a parent, it is not easy to read, but the scene is so well written that you will continue to turn the pages even as your stomach turns.<br /><br />Sebold creates a new version of heaven with roommates and different sections to live in. We learn that it is not a perfect place giving us all that we desire. It really made me think about what it might be like and whether members of my own family were above watching me as I stroll through my own story.<br /><br />The villain, Mr. Harvey, is known from the beginning of the story. Susie not only follows her family from above, but she follows her killer's movements. It felt like being in the mind of a pedophile watching the deliberateness of his actions and the incredible patience he displayed as he waited, sometimes for years, for his next victim. He was truly the man down the street that nobody suspected expect the father overwhelmed with grief. Shivers raced up my spine when I read \\"He had killed animals, taking lesser lives to keep from killing a child.\\"<br /><br />As we might expect, the family takes Susie's death very hard. The gift of this novel is that it shares how each member of the family reacts and internalizes this horrible event. No one is the same and as we might imagine, the death of a child is not the end of tragedy for the Salmons.<br /><br />Even school friends and their reactions are woven into the plot line. Ruth, a mere acquaintance takes on a major role as the story develops. There is the Indian boy, Ray, who is at first accused of the crime and his mother, Runa Singh, whose lives become intermingled in the Salmon's as the book develops. She is almost as interesting as the saucy, often soused, grandma who becomes the glue of the family.<br /><br />The writer's style is simple and yet eloquent. She delves into Susie's desire and attainment of her first kiss. Prior to her death, that was the only sexual experience Susie had had. She goes on to watch the interactions between those left behind and even in death she is able to blossom into a woman in an amazing scene that I won't reveal. The author explains the urges of one character as \\"...a desire beyond the sweetness and attention, it fed a longing, beginning to flower green and yellow into a crocus-like lust, the soft petals opening into her awkward adolescence.\\"<br /><br />Not only do we learn how interdependent people are, but we also learn that usually people can overcome most anything. It doesn't happen easily or even the way we might expect. But it happens, over time. And just as Susie learns in \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" we too understand that connections with others can be miraculous.<br /><br />Book received free of chargethat it shares how each member of the family reacts and internalizes this horrible event.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I liked everything about this gem of a movie.  The smooth animation, the beautiful, sometimes breathtaking backgrounds, the wonderful music score, the story and pacing...everything.<br /><br />The plot is summarized in dozens of other reviews, so I won't address that here.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of RATATOUILLE for me is, out of all of the Disney/Pixar collaborations, this is the one that seems most classically DISNEY...The characters look more Disney-like, the villians are vintage Disney.<br /><br />A word about the rats:  to date, I have never seen a rat live.  However, I was not in the least \\"bothered\\" by the \\"infestation\\" scenes, and neither were my young nephews, ages 10 and 11.<br /><br />Some others have complained that this DVD version is not a \\"special edition.\\"  I also like to purchase special editions when I have the chance.  I must say, though, that this package is just fine: excellent movie transfer of picture and sound, and some fun special features.  Sometimes a second disc is unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall, a very satisfying, worthy package for a thoroughly delightful family film.  A happy addition to my collection.

B000WGNLLW|4.0|...that I love this album, because I love Duran Duran and have since I was twelve. I was so thrilled with their true comeback album \\"Astronaut\\" that I was expecting them to move forward with more innovative and inspired music. But this album falls just a bit short of the DD greatness that we've heard in the past.<br /><br />The opening track \\"The Valley\\" is pretty decent and does have some shades of classic Duran Duran. I was reminded of \\"Notorious\\" with this song. The second, title track has a great \\"spacey\\" opening then drifts into a raw drum beat - it's very 80s so I like it. The third track, \\"Nite-Runner\\" is the first track on the album that sounds blatantly Timbaland inspired and he provides some of the chorus vocals. I don't dislike Timbaland - he's done some great work - but there's something about his and Timberlake's presence in some of the songs that I feel rips away from the soul of Duran Duran.<br /><br />I know some reviewers have voiced their dislike for \\"Falling Down,\\" but it's my favorite track on the album. The melody is beautiful and the lyrics are quite appropriate for this age of rising/crashing starlets and pop singers and our consumption of them. For me, it's right up there with \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"Ordinary World\\" from the Wedding Album. Bits of the melody remind me of \\"Save a Prayer,\\" as well.<br /><br />Track five, \\"Box Full O' Honey,\\" is another lovely melody with great lyrics and acoustic guitar. John Taylor's melodic bass really comes through on this track as well. \\"Skin Divers\\" is a ready made dance floor hit/Timbaland beat machine with a catchy rap hook; it gets you moving, but Simon's voice sounds a little flat and lifeless on this track. \\"Tempted\\" is my least favorite track; it's sounds like they simply recycled Timberlake's \\"Sexy Back\\" and just changed a few chords. \\"Tricked Out\\" - All Hail Nick Rhodes! - is a fun instrumental track with shades of Berlin/Siouxsie/Bauhaus, etc. Very 80s, so of course I love it.<br /><br />\\"Zoom In\\" isn't a bad song, but it isn't great, either. It's got a nice beat, but feels a bit shallow. \\"She's Too Much\\" has a nice opening and a melancholy melody, which I always gravitate to, but it would be nice if John Taylor's bass was more present on this track. I think it would have added a much needed layer and you can actually hear the empty space left vacant by his lack of presence, which is a shame because he is one of the great bass players of our time. \\"Dirty Great Monster\\" has a great bluesy beat and Simon's voice really shines on this track - think \\"The Reflex\\" and \\"Union of the Snake.\\" The final track is a bit lackluster. Again, it sounds like a stolen track from one of Timberlake's albums - his first solo, I think - same beat.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a true Duran Duran fan, this is not an album to pass up. If your a casual Duran Duran listener, you'd do better with the Wedding Album or Astronaut or even their EARLY stuff. But I love these guys, so they really can't do anything wrong in my eyes; however, they need to dump the Timberlakes and Timbalands of this world and follow their own vision as they have in the past. You can definitely tell there are too many fingers in the pie on this album., either.

B000V8I2QU|2.0|I recently ordered both \\"Magic\\" and \\"Live in Dublin\\".  As a big Springsteen AND \\"E-Street Band\\" fan and rock & roll lover, I was really looking forward to \\"Magic\\".  I have rarely been more disappointed in an album.  The sound is terribly muddy.  Bruce's lyrics may well be terrific -- I couldn't tell through the mix.  Worse, with one or two exceptions, the tunes simply weren't any FUN to listen to (my opinion only, of course, and YMMV).      I tried, I relly did, I've listened through it a half dozen times, but I just cannot get into \\"Magic\\".  \\"Live in Dublin\\", on the other hand, has practically lived in my car's CD player for the last three weeks.  It's wonderful, diverse, well crafted and mixed, and, well, fun to listen to.  You can tell that Bruce, The Sessions Band, and the audience are all having a great time, and most of the songs/arrangements are simply outstanding.   Get both if you must, but if you're going to buy one or the other I would strongly recommend \\"Live in Dublin\\".
1591396190|1.0|Yes, it'd be useful if replication of past successes could ensure a glorious future.  However, accomplished practioners know that this isn't the case!  The authors have selected specific examples that serve their thesis and have repurposed valuable but somewhat dated concepts developed by Michael Porter and the Boston Consulting Group. Moreover, the Strategic Grid Technique, while a useful tool, seems a pale copy of QDF.  In my opinion, there is neither academic breakthrough nor deep critical thinking here!
B000VI70WM|5.0|I sat here and read through several of the reviews listed and am stunned by how people nit and pick and rip apart a good album.  I have to admit that initially I was more then a little annoyed at Simon, John, Nick and Roger making the conscious decision to use the 'big names' on the album including Justin Timberlake.  Although I can't fault Justin for having talent, I personally cant stand him (I love Nsync, but hate JT as solo).  Anyway, I felt they were using JT for his name, that if they got him to produce a couple of songs the sticker on the packaging would bring about another generation of listeners.  Anyone expecting music to match Hungry like the Wolf or Rio needs a serious reality check.  That music was over twenty years ago.  A different style, a totally different generation. The one thing I've always loved about Duran is their ability to adapt.  I'm not saying that every album they've put out since Notorious has fit properly with the genre that is popular at the time, but if they were to have done that, then at some point they would have ended up doing a Country album.  I think that this album shows that they still can put out great music. I've been a fan for well over 20 years and was more then a little pleased that a girl, ten years younger then me, loved the album as much as I loved it.  There is a new generation of fans that they have been able to reach by using Timberlake and Timbaland and I say I'm very proud of the product.  This is a very danceable album and  more then a few times I wish I could be at a club listening and dancing to this music.  Give it a chance and have an open mind.  This is not your High School Durannie music.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|If it's one thing this cd made apparent to me is that A7X has range which is a good thing. I must have listen to this cd more than 2 dozen times and every time i keep hearing things that i hadn't heard from the previous listen. I know a lot of people are bashing these guy these days, but that's to be expected when a band tries something new. It just proves that not only do they have range, but they have the ballz to go where no other metal/hard rock acts would even dare to step. Though the entire album was awesome i can't help but think of 'A Little Piece of Heaven's' tim burton style song structure and excellent(dark) story that compliments it. This song to me is by far the most out-landish on the cd, but some how the boys pull it off and with style. 'Dear God' is yet another surprise and proves that even bad boys have a heart. Now i admit i wasn't totally crazy about this one the first go around, but when it picks up somewhere half through with the guitar solos, it again proves just how far the band is willing to go to try something new. M. Shadows shows his maturity as well by demonstrating just how far his vocals have developed since his surgery, and even since Sounding of the Seventh Trumpet. He gives his best vocal performance to date. Overall, A7X lets critics and fans know they're still here and are going to be here for a long time to come.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|This is a good Sci-fi movie. Theres a degree of intelligence to this that is missing from say 'Event Horizon' which is a film of a similar content and style. To add a bit of oomph to it they have thrown in a psycho at the end, which is really incredibly unlikely (as indeed is the whole film though!).<br /><br />The actors and actresses do a reasonable job and as a piece of visual entertainment it certainly is dazzling. The problem I have with it is how it compares with say '2001' or 'Alien'. The fact is it doesn't - though to be fair not much does. '2001' had great special effects back in the late 1960's without the use of CGI. In terms of sheer horror 'Alien' is in a diferent class. There are enough previous reviews which describe the plot so I am not going to repeat any description of it. Its certainly not a daft idea but current estimates indicate the Sun will burn for a about another 5 billion years or so. The future of the human race is already doubt today....<br /><br />So this is probably going to be worth buying if you can get it cheap and have access to a large TV, which makes it a pretty impressive movie. On a small TV at full price - no thanks.
1401300529|5.0|Most Americans of my generation (early baby boomers) feel they know at least a little bit about the Korean War and they may be correct, but this excellent book gives not only the military, but more importantly, the political view of it. In my opinion, the political side of the equation appears to be more important. There are excellent minibiographies of the major players (and even some minor ones), but the main focus is on how all of this got started, and why it lasted as long as it did. The chief \\"villain\\"(if you can call him that) is Douglas MacArthur, and the coterie of sycophants with which he surrounded himself in Tokyo. Believing he knew more that the folks back in Washington, he deliberately either exceeded, or ignored, orders, and his action led to untold thousands of unnecessary deaths on both sidwes. The politicos, and military chiefs, in Washington don't escape their share of the blame, for they were gutless in removing MacArthur until too much time and blood had passed. The author makes comparisons with Vietnam, and they are not bad, except for the rogue general. Excellent reading; highly recommended!
B000002KAT|5.0|I have been listening to this CD for over twenty years now, and I can't say I have every regretted putting it on.  It is pure and beautiful.  I can remember listening to it one evening and having the distinct feeling it was divinely inspired.      This entire work swirls and pulses; love, joy, regret and sad longing presented in a blurring, timeless expression of one man's faded memories.  My throat tightens and my eyes well up before I've made it 2 minutes into \\"Astral Weeks\\".  This album and two beers and I think I could propose to a stranger.

0060589469|5.0|This book is not about Zen, and only tangentially about motorcycles -- though the narrative does follow a motorcycle tour of America. It embodies a deep examination of personal and technological values and how we arrive at them, and is written by a man who thinks a long, long time before he writes. (A two-book career is something of a rarity for one whose first shot was a bestseller, and remains in print in multiple languages 30+ years down the pike.)<br /> Pirsig's later tome, LILA: An Inquiry Into Morals, written ten or fifteen years after ZEN..., is also the tale of a journey -- on water. Though it too is profoundly thoughtful, the metaphors seemed weaker, the translation from personal to universal more tenuous. Then too, the author and I were both that much older, with the sharp distinctions of youth unavoidably greyed by the accumulated ambiguity of life. Yin and yang may be a central truth, but as we come to terms with paradox we learn a bit about compromise.<br />  As some other reviewers have noted, Zen is in some measure dated and a period piece, but it is bound to remain an important work for many young readers as they come of age.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Some may call this movie an homage, but to me its just a gimmick that doesn't work.  The stylized presentation and too clever dialogue cannot hide the fact that this movie is just plain boring.  Of course Tarantino pulls his one trick out of the bag, gore, for a brief appearance toward the end.  But by then I was itching to push the FF button and get through this dog.  Kurt Russell was the only decent part of this whole project and it was a shame his talent was wasted.
0393061310|5.0|Why did western culture triumph in the struggle for world dominance? Here's your answer, clearly and boldly laid out by a far-sighted historian grounded in evolutionary biology and biogeography. Or, rather, here are the four answers, all deriving from one overarching truth: human history is a function of the environment. 1. There are significant continental differences in wild plant and large animal populations, particularly in regard to domesticability. Most of the plant species on which humans depend today originated in southwest eurasia in the region known as the Fertile Crescent. Africa south of the Sahara (and a bit of West Africa) had and has no native domestic plants or animals. Australia has none of either except the macadamia nut (domesticated by Europeans at a late date). The Americas have only a handful of native domestic plants, all low in protein, and only the llama was domesticated - and that in a limited area. 2. The geographic axes of the continents were crucial. Whereas domestic plants and animals from the Fertile Crescent could easily spread to both the Atlantic and Pacific in a contiguous climate zone, the north-south orientation of Africa and the Americas meant that agronomic innovations in one place could not easily spread to other inhabited INTRAcontinental regions. (Think of planting a tropical food crop in Canada, for example. For crops to spread from the Andes to even central Mexican highlands with a similar climate, they would have to traverse tropical rainforest regions. >From Mexico to the Southwest U.S. meant traversing a desert, etc.) 3. The geographic arrangement of the continents affected INTERcontinental movement. The oceans prevented any new eurasian cultural infusion of the Americas until 1492, and delayed its spread to Polynesia. Similarly, though North Africa benefited from Fertile Crescent agriculture the Sahara blocked movement south (making North Africa in this regard part of eurasia). When invaders arrived with their advantages of domestic food and animals they almost invariably overwhelmed every native hunter-gatherer population: the advantages of nutrition and energy afforded by agriculture were huge. 4. The advantages of the first three factors created the final factor which is population size. Agriculture permitted a population explosion wherever it took hold. It allowed the creation of specialists, leading to metallurgy, writing, empires or national governments, investment in public works including military, underwriting of expeditions, etc. Also, and critical to their success, the combination of agricultural settlement and close association with domestic animals permitted the evolution of animal-based microbes into human diseases. All the killers to which eurasians became more or less immune, and which devastated native populations elsewhere, came to us from pigs and cows (and other animals to a lesser degree). (An estimated 95 percent of Native American deaths after Columbus arrived are attributed to smallpox, flu, tuberculosis, the plague, and other hitchhikers &oacute; not guns and swords.) Jared Diamond marshals his facts, arranges them in easily understood chapters, and illustrates the whole with specific examples from biology, medicine, geography, archaeology, linguistics, and scholarly history to deliver a readable and convincing overview of how we got here and why.

0807126063|4.0|A wonderfully funny novel -- with a protagonist so bizarre and beyond the pale that a reader almost longs for him to go away -- this book is a marvel of nuttiness and despair. Though it feels less weighty and far less politically correct than many other Pulitzer Prize winners, the award does not suprise me in the least. That it was awarded posthumously -- the author a suicide long before publication -- overhangs the book with an air of irredeemable loss which only contributes to the reading.  The scene is set in New Orleans where we meet Ignatious, a gluttonous mound of a man, still living with his mother though well into his 30s. His \\"valve\\" is sensitive to the least psycho-social stress, and his rage at the world for its fall from the glory of the middle Roman Empire is unbounded. The valve in question is the pyloric, and its stuckness produces typhoons of belching and gas, caused in large part by the lack of geometry and religion in the world. He plays the lute and the trumpet, is writing the book which will restore classical enlightenment, and is very unpleasant to his mother. Meanwhile, his ex-girlfriend, a socially conscious rabble rouser in New York City, writes frequent letters expressing her certainty that his celibacy is the source of his discontent and stuck valve, and that she could facilitate a cure.  In seedy bars in the French Quarter, a failing garment factory, the Paradise foot long hot dog vending garage, as well as at home and in letters, Ignatious tells and retells the saga of his only excursion beyond New Orleans, a Greyhound Scenicruiser journey to Baton Rouge so terrifying, so assaultive of his sensitive valve, that he could not use his round-trip ticket, but took a cab home instead. Other characters are equally wild, the best portrayed being a young black man whose jive slang is artfully written, funny and smart, and who manages to swing from being \\"vagran'. Whoa!\\" to heroism. In the end, Ignatious' mother decides to ... but I guess you should read that for yourself. Great fun!should read that for yourself. Great fun!

B000V86OKG|5.0|Miami blood-spatter analyst and moonlighting serial killer Dexter Morgan spent the first season of Showtime's groundbreaking drama helping his police department track the Ice Truck Killer, a man who turned out to be the brother Dexter never knew.  In Season Two, he helps hunt someone even closer...himself.  When his Glad-bag graveyard is discovered at the bottom of the ocean, all of Miami buzzes about the Bay Harbor Butcher, the nocturnal crime fighter who litters the sea with body parts of bad guys.      The search for the Bay Harbor Butcher (and the ensuing cat and mouse game between Dexter and his colleagues) provides the overarching glue for Season Two.  The middle episodes of the season feature the slippery Dexter trying to wiggle his way out of the grasp of the investigation, lead by new character FBI Special Agent Lundy (Keith Carradine), a professional everyman as unassuming as he is brilliant.   Lundy's dedication and focus rival Dexter's and present a challenge for our hero even greater than his \\"game\\" with the Ice Truck Killer.  Lundy's ritual and disciplined life of cucumber sandwich lunches and Chopin interludes clears his mind, giving him almost clairvoyance into the heart of his target.     The second principle plot centers on Dexter's new love interest, Lila.   Early in the season, Dexter is able to explain away his erratic behavior to Doakes and Rita by pretending to be a recovering drug addict.  His relationship with his sultry and insightful sponsor sparks tension between Dexter and his girlfriend and forces Dexter into chambers of his mind that have been closed for decades.  In the arms of a troubled figure with a past nearly as dark as his own, Dexter feels understood for the first time.       Dexter's \\"improvements\\" in rehab, coupled with the relentless investigation of him by Doakes causes a reduction in body count for Season Two.   Just as Season One established the winning formula of building a 12 episode serial plot accentuated with weeklyself contained subplots with payoffs, Season Two also has small stories to keep the viewers entertained as the search for the Butcher continues.  The difference between Seasons One and Two is that these small plots don't always involve Dexter killing someone.  Season One almost had a reality-tv consistency with Dexter \\"voting someone off the island\\" each week.  But sometimes Season Two episode plots are about his relationships with Rita, Lila or Doakes.      This is part of the more human Dexter presented in Season Two.  His conscience gets to him a few times; he underestimates one of his victim's strength and then walks into a trap; he routinely gets outsmarted by Lundy; and he's unable to control his feelings toward Rita and her kids.  He's come a long way from the unemotional science project of the first season.   The extra dimensions to his character and a season-long plot that amazingly trumps the edge-of-your-seat plight of Season One's Ice Truck Killer are only two reasons why the series has improved since its sublime debut season and now fills the void left by The Sopranos as television's finest hour.
1594489505|3.0|Only so many ways one can highlight the inequity of the women due to Afghan (and Arab) \\"culture\\". I got tired of the repeated brutality.    The book is an eye opener for westerners, but I felt I was bludgeoned with the brutality/inhumanity.  One wonders why anyone would stand for such treatment, let alone take years to run away.  As such, my sympathy level for the women at the end of the book wasn't as high as it was at the beginning of the story.  Seems like the women had masochistic tendencies.    Good second book, but not outstanding.   Buy it used.
0671015206|5.0|The authors, university professors that specialize in market research and the rich, explore the characteristics of America's affluent. They divide people into prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) and under accumulators of wealth (UAWs).     In sum, they find that the preponderance of America's millionaires are self-made, spending far less than they earn. The authors argue convincingly that in order to become rich it is crucial to reject our culture's focus on status symbols and high consumption.    Probably the biggest insights are reserved for how money affects children. For example, the authors say you shouldn't tell your children that you're rich (assuming you are) or give them large sums of money until they have already learned to live and work independently (payments for college or graduate school excepted).    Before you go pay for that European vacation or go to the bank to borrow for that new BMW, read this book. You'll decide to stay at home and buy a 10 year old Buick, and you'll be infinitely happier than if you had done otherwise.

B000OV170W|5.0|The concept of one child's body parts being used to help save the life of another child in that family raises some serious ethical issues.  What an assignment for the author of this book!  Yet she skillfully addresses these issues in a book which held my interest.              Each child in a family has feelings which can be hurt no matter how hard parents try to do what is right and what is best for each child and for the family as a unit.  I did find it strange that there seemed to be so little sibling rivalry.  Perhaps feelings of pity and guilt displaced the rivalry.         The author gave each character a voice and most characters, a chapter.  Her use of a distinct font for each character was an artistic touch that I appreciated.  Why, though, was there no chapter for Kate's thoughts and her viewpoint?         Is an important factor of our grieving for a lost loved one the realization that the other person no longer needs us - therefore, we have lost part of our own identity?  Then no activity seems important or significant enough to fill the time left dangling there.
B000AL730O|4.0|Nigel Goodrich kicked Paul McCartney's complacency square in the crack. Even McCartney, while doing his promotional junket for \\"Chaos and Creation,\\" admitted that hardly anyone had the backbone to tell him to NOT do something on his albums, but Goodrich did. The result became McCartney's most restrained and even-handed album in decades, and easily his most heartfelt. While the melodic strengths that have long been a hallmark of McCartney's songwriting remain intact, what Goodrich seems to have brought to the table was an ability to challenge McCartney to reign in his indulgences and make him not choose the path of least resistance. It shows in that there is but one silly love song of sorts here, the whimsical \\"English Tea.\\"<br /><br />Instead, the lyrics seem somber and introspective. Despite this being a period when he was married to Heather Mills, the darker songs still seems infused by the loss of Linda McCartney. \\"Jenny Wren\\" (shades of \\"Blackbird\\" and Bluebird\\") and \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" tug at some sad heartstrings, and \\"How Kind of You\\" finds Paul singing from a point of awed humility. It's a rare glimpse at McCartney that rarely surfaces in his music. By keeping the instrumentation spare and tasteful, it allows the songs to breathe and step forward. As a result, these songs feel more personal than the ones on [[ASIN:B00005QK3W Driving Rain]] and [[ASIN:B000002ULO Flaming Pie]] did for me.<br /><br />It is also surprising to me that \\"Chaos and Creation\\" was started up after McCartney had shelved songs that would eventually see the light of day on [[ASIN:B000P2A242 Memory Almost Full]]. Giving the nostalgic view he took on that album, it is interesting to hear the less optimistic tone of this album, and realize why McCartney set those songs aside when his muse led him on the path to \\"Chaos.\\" They are albums that reflect each other, with \\"Memory\\" hewing closer to Wings best work, while \\"Chaos\\" mirrors such homemade classics as [[ASIN:B000002UC7 Ram]] or [[ASIN:B000002UC5 McCartney]].

B000WSHF4E|2.0|First of all, The story or History - well, I don't think the King Of Spain, Filipe II, wich was also, at the time, the King Of Portugal (the Portuguese throne gave him the command of the high seas - so, much of the ships were Portuguese caravelas), was only concerned with the Queen of England - it's ridiculous. And surely isn't as diabolical as showed. He made war against England not only because of the protestant position of Elizabeth BUT the fact that England's piracy were robbing ships and Spanish colonies with the Queen's consentment and not respecting the treaty causing economic conflict. Plus, Filipe was one of the most intelligent men in the world and the most powerfull too.  The only good thing in this movie is - as everyone knows - Cate Blanchet. Samantha Morton was also good in her role as Mary, Queen of Scots. I agree with most of the people. The first film was much better - the dialogues, intrigue, menace, all great, memorable sometimes. And with a grand finale! This movie, Elizabeth - The Golden Age lacks a good argument, intensity. It looks like a soap-opera sometimes. Very bad supporting actors like the young Bess! Even Rush isn't as good as he was on the first chapter. But with such discrepancies it could have been a good film, but it fails because of the heavy handed Kapur.
B00004RFG0|5.0|This is a very powerful movie. I have never been a big fan of Jim Carrey, but in this movie he is great and plays the character with much sensitivity apart from humor. Apparently the movie was never a big success in the US, which could be because the subject is too close for comfort.    It brings to mind the story by Gurdjieff of the evil magician, as the movie shows how Truman is really not in control of anything, as it is all orchestrated from above. Just like we like to think we are at the top of the food chain and in control of our lives, so too does Truman believe that he makes real choices and that he is free. Little does he know that he is lives in a \\"cage\\". To keep Truman from discovering the Truth, the \\"media\\" is employed to constantly shape his opinions and to suppress any questioning of the reality in which he lives. This has scary parallels to todays world, where the mainstream media and manufactured opinion polls acts like the ancient Greek chorus in shaping public opinion the way the controllers wish it to be.    So definitely a top movie, that won't disappoint. It is a wake-up call to question one's own reality and to whether one is just a machine playing out a script written by someone else.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|London Calling is a sprawling, ambitious, endlessly creative and unfailingly exciting record. It's full of daring ideas and musical revelations, a rockin' funhouse mirror that encompasses punk, rockabilly, folk, reggae, pop, and even elements of soul and disco, with lyrics full of apocalyptic anger and sociopolitical rage. Nearly twenty years after its initial release, it all still sounds so good. The title track is a taut, nervous punk number with a paranoid rhythm and a cruelly catchy vocal, and the lyrics are pure apocalyptic poetry. \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" is raucous ska, and \\"Train In Vain\\" is boisterous pop. \\"Lost In The Supermarket\\" is a genuinely heartrending meditation on isolated alienation, and \\"Spanish Bombs\\" is a sweeping, hard-hitting acoustic rock anthem. \\"Brand New Cadillac\\" has a psychotic rockabilly punk edge, and \\"Clampdown\\" is a stomping, undeniably catchy rock classic... with lyrics about the evils of colonialism. \\"The Guns Of Brixton\\" is raw, defiant, bass-heavy dub reggae, and \\"Wrong 'Em Boyo\\" is a deranged double-time singalong. There is, in short, a ridiculous amount of great music here. It's a rock 'n' roll masterpiece for the punk era, a classic record if there ever was one.

B0000C8AVR|5.0|Highway 61 Revisited is a loose, epic, surrealist, rambling, back alley daydream stroke of musical genius. It's gritty rock 'n' roll, starry-eyed folk, and vicious poetry all at once, shot through with strains of blues and country and soul, all of it united under the umbrella of Bob Dylan's bizarrely visionary ideas of what good music is supposed to sound like. It also freaking rocks.<br /><br />The album sounds like masterpiece right from the get-go: It opens with the stunning \\"Like A Rolling Stone,\\" a musical masterpiece in every sense of the word. Just listen to those gorgeous swells of melody, to the relentless drive of its rhythms, to Bob's strange, hypnotic vocal incantations! And listen to those lyrics! Listen to that broken, vengeful, dreamy, and acidic poetry! One of the greatest uses I've ever found for my ears, and it's only the first song on the album. After that comes the broken-down hillbilly car chase/ gut-bustingly funny surrealist ramble that is \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" and lush, sardonic pop of \\"Queen Jane, Approximately.\\" There's the apocalyptic, piano driven \\"Ballad Of A Thin Man,\\" and the barroom daydream of \\"From A Buick 6.\\" \\"Desolation Row\\" is a gorgeous, doom-laden acoustic ballad, and \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\\" is pure wheezing blues. \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" is full of wonderfully resigned sarcasm and sparkling pianos, while the title track is a hilarious series of slightly absurd (and sharply satirical) visions.<br /><br />Rock out, friends.

B000001EL3|4.0|There are, in my opinion, two genuinely awful songs on Destroyer: The first is \\"Great Expectations,\\" a truly inexplicable monstrosity- it's \\"experimental\\" in all the wrong places, an awkward lump of pretentious lyrics, bizarre production, and a boys choir (the use of which makes me temporarily hate children). Gene Simmons' strained, confused, and somewhat stoned vocal delivery is comforting in that it suggests that at least I'm not the only one wondering what the hell is going on. The other bad song is \\"Beth.\\" Sorry folks, but once you get past the shock of the fact that Kiss actually wrote a ballad, you're left with a sappy, melodramatic, and plodding tune with some annoyingly raspy vocals and lyrics that make high school poetry seem like Bob Dylan. It's the quintessential moronic hard rock ballad, and it just plain doesn't work at all.    Aside from those two train wrecks, there really is some fantastic music here. \\"Detroit Rock City\\" is one of the great rock 'n' roll anthems, thanks to its gigantic guitar chords and bullhorn vocals. \\"King Of The Nighttime World\\" is primo teenage fantasy-rock, and \\"God Of Thunder\\" is a mean, stomping heavy metal (ish) anthem. \\"Do You Love Me\\" is unabashed celebrity sleaze-rock, and \\"Shout It Loud\\" is another meaty foot-stomper.    So, there's enough good stuff here for any rock fan to dig.

B000002L9J|5.0|I had the good fortune to discover the Smiths just before my junior year of high school. At the time, they seemed to have been designed specifically for me, for the beautifully disconcerting moment that my life had become. Morrissey's poetic, hilarious, and terminally heartbroken lyrics seemed to have been written after extensive interviews with me, while Johnny Marr's endearingly skewed sense of pop songwriting and introverted guitar virtuosity grabbed my attention better than any Jimmy Page fireworks display. Their sound was both unique and instantly lovable, their songs charming and cathartic. The Queen Is Dead was my favorite of their albums (it was also the one I got first), and it accompanied me through many a long and lonely late night drive.    Which is to say that this review, and my opinion of this album, may be somewhat nostalgically skewed. I mean, I can't claim to identify with Morrissey's lyrics the same way that I did back then, and I really don't know how the band would have sounded if I'd discovered them later on in life (indeed, it was a real stroke of luck that I picked up this album- on a whim, while I was in an HMV in London- when I did. Junior year was a particularly chaotic period in my life, more so than sophomore or senior. It went well with these songs). But really, music is always a personal, individual experience- every single album that I've come to love or hate exists in a larger context, and that's true for everybody. And the truth of the matter is, for one reason or another, I still love the Queen Is Dead. I love the title track, with scorched-earth sound architecture, as Marr spews forth cathartic swirls of feedback while Morrissey howls with sardonic rage, bemoaning the fate of the world and his own emotions. I adore \\"I Know It's Over,\\" with its doo-wop tinged melody and harrowing climax. And then there's \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again,\\" which is informed by equal parts gallows humor and bitter regret. \\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\"has a blissful, evocative melody and wistful lyrics, while \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\" is spare, hypnotic, and gorgeously sad. There are also a few lovable throwaways (\\"Frankly, Mr. Shankly,\\" Vicar In A Tutu\\"), and an endearingly self-deprecating ditty by the name of \\"Cemetery Gates.\\" The Queen Is Dead and I simply haven't grown part. It's still a masterpiece.
B000TSIK14|3.0|I have to hand it to these guys. They retain all the qualities that made them stand out after all these years. I was not a Scorpions fan in the 80's, simply because I was listeing to more progressive oriented material like Kansas and Tull, etc. Then, when \\"Pure Instinct\\" came out and I was working in a record store while it played, I found myself drawn in by it. Suddenly I found many parallels with the kind of groups I listened to while ignoring the Scorpions. I was blown away with Klaus Meine's voice, the sheer tunefullness and the fact that they were not afraid to sound pretty as well as hard. Plus, there was a sense of tongue-in-cheek showmanship that was affirmed when I saw them live. I now appreciate the band more than ever. I respect how they uphold real singing (ageless vocals, great intonation and feel) and songs with hooks and smarts, as well as laughs (Why is it I can accept hearing the cliche \\"are you ready to rock?\\" in 2007?). \\"The Game Of Life\\" is my fave on the album thus far. I am still getting into it. Definitely worth a listen and more!
6303444202|3.0|This musical \\"The Music Man\\" Starring Robert Preston, Shirley Jones, Ron Howard & others has always been one of my all time favorite musical's. I have this VHS film of this movie, which i have had for a long time. It's a Great Musical, but do yourself a favor & buy it now on DVD & make sure you get the one on Widescreen. In my opinion, it makes all the difference in the world as far as Quality goes to be able to have it on Widescreen period. This is definitely true for the Classic Epic Film's.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, is the story of Charlie's freshman year of high school told in letters.  Charlie's first letter is written in admiration to a person he has never actually met. Because Charlie is scared of starting high school, he continues writing these letters.   At the end of eighth grade, Charlie is surprised to learn that his close friend has committed suicide.  So as he nears his first day of high school, Charlie is afraid he will have no friends; but at the first school football game, Charlie befriends two seniors, Patrick and Patrick's sister, Sam.  Along with Patrick and Sam, Charlie frequently attends high school parties, parties that promote drugs and alcohol.  At these parties, Charlie doesn't bring much attention himself; he just sits there and flows with everyone else. He talks to people, but doesn't talk too much; he mostly just listens.  Charlie also becomes friends with his English teacher whom he calls by his first name, Bill.  Bill gives Charlie extra books to read because he thinks Charlie is exceptionally smart.  Charlie talks to Bill like an ordinary friend, not a teacher.  After Bill hears what's on in Charlie's life, he tells Charlie to participate more in life, not just think.  Charlie thinks too much, in my opinion; he also cries a lot, more than anyone should at his age.  In Charlie's first letter, he writes, \\"So, this is my life.  And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.\\"  This was something I could relate to in some ways, but certainly not on the same level as Charlie.  Charlie is depressed; but no one knows it, not even him.  He actually has no clue why he cries so much, but he knows that he doesn't like it.  He cries every year on his birthday because that is when his most loved relative, his Aunt Helen, died.  She was the only person who hugged him, and she was the only one who bought him two presents: one for his birthday, December 24, and one for Christmas.  These people make Charlie feel special and loved; but even though he has friends, Charlie still has a hard time participating and makes many mistakes while trying because he has a low self-confidence, which often leads to him crying.  Charlie cries when he is sad and sometimes when he is happy.  On occasion, he just bursts into tears; and because he doesn't know why, he cries even more, harder and louder.  When Charlie learns why he cries so often, he never mentions himself crying anymore in his letters. I think Chbosky uses this to symbolize Charlie's recovery from suppressed depression.  The Perks of Being a Wallflower is written in the same way a normal guy Charlie's age would speak, which makes it easy to read.  At first I thought I wouldn't like the letter format, but it helps enforce the character of the book and Charlie.  I would recommend this book despite some controversial text: it's portrayal of teen sexuality and drug use.    Find this and other reviews like it at notrequiredreading.com

B000001Y9I|5.0|I bought this CD because Steve Morse is my favorite rock guitarist, at least more so than being a fan of Deep Purple. I've listened to this CD probably at least three hundred times (in my car as I drive) and I can say that honestly that it is probably my favorite rock CD that I own. I never get sick of it, all the songs are different and don't all sound the same (like some groups), and Steve Morse rocks! I never knew Deep Purple could sound so good!
B000T05R8Q|5.0|No complaints about the music contained on these discs--I only wish I didn't have to nearly break them to remove them from their jewel cases. Also, it would've been nice if the \\"book\\" that's contained inside didn't immediately break off from the rest of the package as soon as I opened it.    Terrible, clunky, so-called \\"deluxe\\" packaging.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I loved Red Carpet Disaster on first listen in my car on a long drive.  As much as I liked Astronaut, I think RCM is even better.  Nite Runner, Skin Divers, Falling Down, Box Full of Honey and She's Too Much are my favorites.  Last Man Standing reminded me of The Seventh Stranger.  I'm recommending that all of my friends get a copy for themselves.  If they don't, this will be a great Christmas present.  I just hope that radio will embrace Duran Duran again.  This record should be heard.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is the album of theirs that started it all for me, and to my ears, it is still their best.  I very much enjoy their new albums but the compliation of tracks on this disc is varied and exciting.  Really, I can't not recommend this disc to any fan of well crafted music.  Some will claim that the musical ideas of repetative, not much unlike some electronic and trance music, and while I agree to that on some level, all music is repetative in nature.  The point is that they are creating musical repetitions that are intersting and one would want to hear over and over.  Really, i'm not doing this album justice in this here review.  I'll just say that if you like some rock/folk music with really singable/catch melodies then this one is worth a try for sure.
B000J4QWM2|2.0|This movie just didn't make sense, it starts out with the ususal club scene where everyone is so cool and some unsavory characters. the sound was very quiet and i felt I didnt understand what was going on from the get go...it's like the director started the middle of the movie in the beginning where you're just lost!    I wouldn't watch it again.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|Paramount is not getting my money this time around. Yeah it's a cool thing what they did with the CGI, but let's see, they got me for the very first VHS Tapes. Then They suckered me into not only the black and white color mix of THE CAGE but a few months later got me with the full color version of THE CAGE. Then there were all the laser discs. Then the individual 2 episode DVDs. Then the whole series package. Plus all the multiple versions of all the movies.Does this ever end? Well it ends right here and now for me. I'll just rent from NET FLIX. Watch it a couple of times and send it back.  And for those who say we're boo hoo'ers, then obviously you don't have a morgage payment and a family to provide for. Get A Life! Paramount can go suck it!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I hate to see the ending of one of the best action series of recent times because apparently Matt Damon is not coming back for another movie--I don't blame him, he doesn't want to get stereotyped. It was a great ride and I hate to see its culmination. Director of the last two series Paul Greengrass, once again gives us plenty of action sequences with raw power and stylish cinematography, but also we finally get to see the true origins of our main character. He is a present-day James Bond who went rogue to a corrupt organization that created him but betrayed him in the end. The Bourne Ultimatum is on my list of this year's best.<br /><br />Brief Intro Story:<br />After surviving a certain death in Moscow, the wounded Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still in Europe taking care of some business. He makes a stop to tell Marie's brother (Bourne's girl in the second film) that his sister is dead. Bourne really loved her and wanted to give up his past and start a new life, but her death changed all that.<br /><br />As he is reading a newspaper, Bourne finds out that a British journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) has written an article about him and knows about operation \\"Blackbriar.\\" Apparently he knows something about Bourne's origin. He travels to London and finally contacts Simon, but he gets killed by a sniper who follows orders for a small CIA secret team led by the evil Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Mysteriously Vosen wants him dead fast and he will use all the CIA's resources to do so. Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) thinks it's not a good idea to kill Bourne--she prefers to keep him alive. Meanwhile Bourne is following more clues that the journalist left behind. He is getting closer to the truth, but it won't be easy. The CIA's killers are after him.<br /><br />Review:<br />In this last installment of The Bourne Ultimatum, we get to know Bourne's origins and why he has vivid nightmares and visions of his past. We also like the character's perseverance to get to the bottom of all this animosity towards him--the reasons why different agencies what to kill him and who he really is. He is strong, intelligent, determined, and ready to even risk his own life in order to find the truth. I always have a special admiration for this character and fans of the series will be pleased by the character's coolness and cleverness to be a step ahead of his enemies. But he also makes new friends in this movie from the organization that betrayed him--this creates drama and a sense of humanity of our main character.<br /><br />Academy Award Winner Paul Greengrass (United 93) knows how to make an action film, pure and simple--his camerawork is stylish and always puts you right in the action. The filmmaker takes us around the world--a total of three continents--following our main character's search for the truth. We also get to see state-of-the-art espionage technology used by agencies like the CIA that really makes us think about our own security, but this doesn't work for Bourne who makes a fool out of the CIA. The car chase extravaganza in this film is entertaining, raw and dynamic, perhaps the best of the year--it's full of difficult stunts that will keep you on the edge of your seat. When it comes to martial arts, Bourne has no match. The fight sequences are extremely raw; Bourne's moves are fast and powerful--similar to the Israeli Krav Maga fighting style.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />With an excellent cast, great action sequences and the satisfying ending, The Bourne Ultimatum will not disappoint fans of stylish action films. I'm sorry James Bond, but you have to step aside. Director Paul Greengrass is once again, the star--besides Damon--of one of the best action pack of the year because of his style to make new cutting-edge films. I hope Damon reconsiders and make another movie. I truly hope so.animosity towards him--the reasons why different agencies what to kill him and who he really is.

B0000AK7AA|4.0|We got this a month ago for Halloween because our 4 year old really wanted it. We've enjoyed it as a family, decent rendition of classic Casper story, with a great cast. There are definitely parts that are a bit too scary for our 4 yr old, though. She wants to see it but is scares her and gives her occasional nightmares, so we've shelved it for awhile.   Effects are good, plot is a bit plodding and comedy is very broad, but the kids don't mind that. Casper coming alive at the end is better than you'd think, Cristina Ricci is fun and likeable, cameos are great.  A good family film for over 5's to perhaps tweens.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|I just loved the way this DVD was put together. So thoughtfully done.  One thing that did bother me way the way that DG has accepted his wealth. (Remember MONEY!) Other than that...the uncomfortable meeting with RW. Better audio would have been great there, but I was left with the impression that they really wouldn't have wanted me to hear what they said to each other...so why put it in? To show that they won't kill each other whenever they meet?     Anyway. DG is a man among men. He isn't trying to be PF, he just moves on. And, why not have your old buds play with you, if they can?     Give me more!    Dave
0671027344|5.0|The brutal honesty and provocative realism that made The Catcher in the Rye a classic is reborn in this novel. If you didn't like Catcher (not that I think that's possible for people who actually understand it), you won't like this.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink's third album and follow up to Dude Ranch is arguably their finest work. The content of the songs really captures the lives and perils of being a young adult and the writing and musical crafting digs deep into your emotions to put yourself in the shoes of the song. The addition of Travis Barker really helps as he is an extremely talented drummer and musician in general. This is one of the finest albums of the late 1990s.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I am a 60 year old man; I am offended by any reviewer/ critic who would find any fault in this DVD. The most important message in this DVD is what the true meaning of Christmas really is; not to spend money or overdo the \\"commercialism\\" of Christmas; to exchange each other at Christmas, to be good to each other and not \\"think only of yourself\\". This DVD gives you the true meaning of Christmas. Tom Hanks is awesome in his roles in this \\"gem\\" Also when we were young how many of us,  like the \\"know it all\\" acted like the \\"know it all\\"? I am guilty a he is.To those who find it scary, GROW UP!!!! This is sheer brilliance!!!!; it is also a \\"dream come true\\"  My wish is that Tom Hanks himself give each of us a copy of this DVD!!

B000WZAE1I|5.0|To be quite honest I usually find most fantasy movies are of very poor quality and highly cheesy.  However, my husband drug me to see this movie, and even in spite of my disinterest in seeing it, it completely impressed me.  The casting was great, the effects were awesome, and the story was amazing.  It's definitely not as innocently made as a Disney movie, but it's still nothing that would be inappropriate for children to watch.  Overall, I can easily say that this is the best movie I've seen all year, and I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD!!!
B00005JPLW|5.0|300 is bound to take its place as one of the great movies of all time. Every frame is a work of unforgettable art. Everything from the acting, the set design, the photography and lighting and script should be up for all kinds of Academy Awards in 2008. Gerard Butler enacts his role of a lifetime with savage brilliancy. He doesn't just act it, he looks incredibly heroic, as does the rest of this extraordinary cast. You soon forget about the technical genius that brings all of this to life. You become enmeshed in the thrilling story-line and the lives of the characters. How this movie was made, its origins and its eventual fruition into this masterpiece would make a wonderful coffee table book. Yet, I don't want to get bogged down in the technical wizardry since this would break it down into bits and pieces of computer work. I've added this movie to my collection of masterpieces and it sits right there with \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" and \\"Metropolis\\" as among the filmic masterpieces of all time.

B000PC8AFU|1.0|I absolutely agree with the first reviewer.  Any fan of Stevie has at least a handful of thee songs already.  Yet again the record company tries to profit by releasing a few 'new' tracks in the hopes of getting the fans to re-buy what they already have.  This CD makes an excellent case for single track downloading so fans dont have to buy the same songs oevr and over again just to get a few 'new' tracks.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|Fans of the Die Hard franchise were upset when it was announced that this film would be the first one in the series to be rated PG-13, an obvious bid to attract a younger audience. Thankfully, the more violent, profanity-laden unrated version is included on this DVD so that we can watch the film the way it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />The first disc includes an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, actor Bruce Willis and editor Nicolas De Toth. Right from the get-go, all three men address the studio-imposed PG-13 rating thing and how they went ahead and shot an R rated version anyway. There are quite a few lulls as the three men tend to get caught up watching the film but manage to deliver a fairly decent track.<br /><br />The second starts off with \\"Analog Hero in a Digital World: Making Live Free or Die Hard,\\" a feature-length documentary that can also be viewed as 10 separate featurettes. Wiseman admits to being a big fan of the series, especially the first one, and this motivated his decision to accept the gig. Various other aspects of the production are covered in detail, including casting the main roles, set design, stunts, editing, visual effects, and sound. This is done in an accessible way that is entertaining and informative.<br /><br />\\"Yippee Ki Yay Motherf*****!\\" Filmmaker Kevin Smith interviews Bruce Willis in this fun, entertaining extra. Smith flat out asks Willis why he decided to do yet another Die Hard sequel. He admits that mistakes were made on the second and third films and with this new one he was more conscious about not repeating those mistakes. Smith asks good questions which Willis answers them honestly.<br /><br />There is a music video for \\"Die Hard\\" by Guyz Nite, a pop punk band.

0385512104|4.0|The premise and story line of this story have been previously reviewed by many so I'll not repeat what's already been written.<br /><br />I will say that this story of Christopher the autistic 15 year old is certainly one of the most unique stories I've ever read.  While I've known persons with Aspergers, autism and pervasive developmental disorders, I'd have to say I'd not thought in great detail as to how they really experience the world on a daily basis; how they have to cope with their environment and its populace, and the coping strategies they employ.  Reading about what might be their experiences in the world and their perspectives of the world was a very insightful experience to me, and if other reviews I've read are to be believed, the portrayal in this book appears to be quite accurate.<br /><br />The writing is simple, but neither the concepts nor the content are  simplistic.  Some of the short chapters are tangential and seem to provide little in the way of the development of the initial story line, but then this is not a typical investigative \\"who-dun-it\\" kind of tale.  These seemingly irrelevant tangents are useful by providing information and perspective to the reader as to what goes on in the mind of Christopher (or others with autism) and his need to have a defined, predictable and, in his case, a preferrably solitary existence.<br /><br />Anyone open to a new reading experience would do well to read this story.  Whether you end up loving it, hating it, or remaining neutral about it, you'll have to agree that you've likely never read anything quite like it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Wonderful condition.  I really enjoy this album.  It really is a great journey of the Beatles musical history.  From start to finish.  I can't really say any more than this.  I have been a Beatles fan from the time Yellow Submarine was released - that song captured me! I can still remember singing to it with other other children my age at the time, I was about age 5.  Interesting to note that my son who is roughly the same age currently, enjoys Yellow Submarine too and sings along. But his favorite song on the album is 'Let it Be'! A far more mature, thought provoking, choice!The Beatles speak to every age and for all time!
B000000WA4|5.0|\\"Mellon Collie\\" is such a huge, multi-faceted, and stunningly beautiful album that it's nearly impossible to cover everything in one review.  Suffice it to say, this was Smashing Pumpkins' most ambitious and overwhelming release by far, and IMO their artistic zenith.  Despite the fact that Billy Corgan has always been the main songwriter, this album, perhaps much moreso than anything else they've done, was very much a full-band effort.  You can just tell that there was a great deal of collegiality here between the members, and it really paid off.<br /><br />To describe the album in greater detail is a daunting task, to say the least.  There's just so much here, and the songwriting is ridiculously consistent throughout its 2-hour length.  You've softer, plaintive tracks like \\"To Forgive\\" and \\"Thirty-Three\\", harder rock like the grunge anthem \\"Zero\\" and the raw and aggressive \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\".  You also get more bizarre and experimental stuff, like \\"Cupid de Locke\\" and \\"We Only Come Out at Night\\", and more epic tracks like \\"Porcelina\\" and \\"XYU\\", all of which further add more eclecticism to the already rich tapestry of sounds.<br /><br />And of course this album yielded tons of radio hits, like \\"Tonight Tonight\\", \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\", and \\"1979\\", which prove that you can be artistic and still get commercial success.<br /><br />There's also a really cool element of symmetry to the album, as the discs both end with lead vocals from other members (James Iha on \\"Take Me Down\\", and all of them on \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\").  Also, both of the aforementioned songs end with the line \\"in your heart\\", and the last track of the second disc ends with a reprise of the haunting piano melody that serves as the intro to disc 1.  I don't know, I just dig stuff like that.<br /><br />And of course the performances from each band member are all fantastic as well, especially Jimmy Chamberlin, who is definitely one of my favorite rock drummers.  His powerful and diverse style really drives the music well, most notably on \\"Tonight Tonight\\", where his thunderous crescendos mimic the symphonic rise and fall of the song perfectly.  His ability to conform to many different styles is surely no small part of this band's eclectism.  And of course, Billy Corgan's vocals, while not for everyone, really convey the raw emotional power that this music demands like few others could.  I wouldn't trade him for a \\"better\\" singer in a million years.<br /><br />Simply put, this is one of the most stunning and well-accomplished albums of the 90's, and any music lover needs to hear it.  As glad as I am that they're back together, and as much as I enjoyed their comeback album \\"Zeitgeist\\", they will never be as good as they were here.well, most notably on \\"Tonight Tonight\\", where his thunderous crescendos mimic the symphonic rise and fall of the song perfectly.

B000VI70WM|4.0|While RCM isn't your 'traditional' DD effort, any person that can apppreciate a good pop record will love it. Like DD has done in the past, the music is meant to be danceable and fun to listen to. They've managed to accomplish this, quite successfully, and always with a sense of humour.  They've never done very well with critics, and no matter what they release, it will be shot down.  I say congratulations to the guys for coming out with a fresh sound that is intermingled with some 'old' sounding work. They are what they are, and they have millions of fans around the world that love them no matter what they release. I say just sit back and enjoy it, and lighten up everyone!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Some might write Johnny Cash's final album off as \\"just a cover album\\", but this would be a terrible mistake, as this album is an astonishing display of the full range of his awesomeness.  With an eclectic array of artists from many different genres, this proves that Johnny had a great deal of respect for music of all kinds, and is likely one of the main reasons that respect is mutual among all different types of musicians and music fans.  Plus, it shows that he could pretty much sing just about anything.<br /><br />There's a little bit of something for everyone here.  There are covers that you might expect, like the Eagles' \\"Desperado\\" or Hank Williams' \\"I'm So Lonesone I Could Cry\\", as well as ones you might never see coming, like Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" and Sting's \\"I Hung My Head\\", which are still executed every bit as convincingly.  Also great is the traditional Irish ballad \\"Danny Boy\\", which I've always thought was kind of sappy, but this version is definitely the best I've heard.<br /><br />However, the standout of them all is definitely the amazing cover of Nine Inch Nails' \\"Hurt\\".  This song has the honor of being tied with Jeff Buckley's cover of \\"Hallelujah\\" as my favorite cover song of all time (and speaking of \\"Hallelujah\\", it's a shame that Johnny never did that one too, but oh well).  The emotional power of the original seemed nearly impossible to duplicate, but if there's one man who could possibly capture that same element of exquisite gloom, it's Johnny Cash.  And of course, when put into context with his approaching death, it's that much more powerful (sort of like Warren Zevon doing \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\", also knowing full well that the end was near).  Truly an amazing cover, that's all I can say.  Plus, the simple fact that a 70 year old country singer was even familiar with Trent Reznor's work, let alone thought enough of it to cover it this convincingly is pretty damn cool.<br /><br />There is some original work here as well, like the title track, which is also excellent.  With its bizarre, abstract lyrics, and foreboding Jim Morrison-like delivery, it should be obvious this isn't your average country music. Johnny was truly a brilliant artist that transcended genres.<br /><br />So anyway, the point of my horribly rambling review is that you need to buy this album.  Doesn't matter if you're a country music fan or not (I may be from Texas, but believe me, I'm anything but), this is a fine collection of songs that anyone could enjoy.  Its predecessor, \\"Unchained\\" is an excellent cover album as well (which features his killer version of Soundgarden's \\"Rusty Cage\\", another fave of mine).  Both are highly recommended.<br /><br /> Long live Johnny Cash.  You are forever the man.ich is also excellent.  With its bizarre, abstract lyrics, and foreboding Jim Morrison-like delivery, it should be obvious this isn't your average country music. Johnny was truly a brilliant artist that transcended genres.    So anyway, the point of my horribly rambling review is that you need to buy this album.  Doesn't matter if you're a country music fan or not (I may be from Texas, but believe me, I'm anything but), this is a fine collection of songs that anyone could enjoy.  Its predecessor, \\"Unchained\\" is an excellent cover album as well (which features his killer version of Soundgarden's \\"Rusty Cage\\", another fave of mine).  Both are highly recommended.     Long live Johnny Cash.  You are forever the man.
0486446859|5.0|I was introduced to Arthur Rackham's magical illustrations as a child via the old St. Nicholas children's magazines, and his pictures have lost none of their magic in the ensuing years. Rackham's pen-and-ink drawings are complemented by a muted palette of colors that transform the glossy pages into insubstantial doors that open into an enchanted world populated by slender butterfly-winged fairies, multitudes of elves and gnomes, and twisted anthropomorphic trees that capture a child's imagination, without being threatening. At the same time, the sharp angular faces of the children in his drawings suggest a subtle mischievous humor that prevents Rackham's illustrations from ever sinking into sentimentality.<br /><br />Rackham's pen covered a wide range of subjects, from Shakespeare's \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and \\"The Tempest\\" by way of Kenneth Grahame's \\"Wind in the Willows\\", Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" and classical fairy tales, to Wagner's \\"Ring of the Niebelungen.\\"<br /><br />We are so lucky to have these beautifully reproduced Dover illustrations in a single book. They should be introduced to one's grandchildren so that their own imaginations may also take flight with the enchanting creatures of Arthur Rackham's world.
0099481685|3.0|I just read this book for a second time, yesterday. It's a Christmas book with a message but it's not a serious book and shouldn't be taken that way.<br /><br />I found Tina's (Maldive, Indian Ocean) comment below, 'over the top'. Come on....I don't for a minute believe that the references to skin color were meant to be racist, in any way. John Grisham is not that kind of person/author, even if he was, would he be spouting off his racial beliefs in a 'fluff' book like this? I don't think so.<br /><br />His references to skin color are about the Krank's trying to hide their recent tanning sessions, in prep. for the upcoming cruise and trying to keep this from their daughter. I won't spoil the plot but Tina, at least in my opinion, is reading way too much into this part of the book. There are so many really racist comments and books out there to worry about, Skipping Christmas is not one of them.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Another cute family movie that had a couple of good laughs in there for the whole family.  Some unexpecting twists at the end that left a little surprise (disappointment), but over all this was a good movie for the family and one that we will keep for our daughter to watch as she gets older.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|\\"Robocop\\" is Paul Verhoeven's bleak view of the future. Here corporations make their own rules and use and destroy anything that stand in their way. Like Verhoeven's later \\"Total Recall\\" one can see this film as a devastating satire of Reagan-era America.<br /><br />Verhoeven indulges in his usual over-the-top violence and grim humour, which constantly skirt bad taste. However, there are lots of nice details, social commentary, imagination, action, and yes heart to keep most action fans happy.<br /><br />Followed by two terrible sequels.
B000INAXGU|5.0|This is one hell of Funkdified Adventure...Jay Kay is one of the most interesting characters i've ever run across...compare him to many but pin him on none. This entire collection is Funky, Danceable, and sad at the fact that Jay Kay ( Lead of the band) has apparantly quit the music buisness sighting a loss of his inspiration and a longing for a famliy, namely children. This is by and far the best collection of Jam's hits, an overall if you will...yes a true is going to buy the individual albums, no one will blame you. My only complaint is that a few tracks were cut short namely \\"Alright\\"...but it's cool, i have the single. Lyrics are a bit out there but very honest and the music has BALLS, they weren't trying to be like every other group and they've had staying power...hopefully we'll see the return of the space cowboy...my fav's are \\"Virtual Insanity\\", \\"Alright\\", and \\"little L\\"...o'h who am i kidding i LOVE the whole thing!!!
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|Precious Ramotswe is a 30ish year old single woman who inherits a sum of money after her father's death. Since she has suffered through a terrible marriage, and is actually quite intelligent, she decides that rather than continue to grow cattle, she will open up the first ever detective agency run by women in Botswana. So, she buys a home, an office, office furniture, a sign, hires a secretary, and waits for clients to arrive.<br /><br />The book tells the stories of her earliest cases. The very first one involves solving the mystery of a christian convert who seems to have run away from his wife. Another mystery involvest the disappearance of an eleven year old boy; then there is the matter of the doctor who appears to be on drugs or schizophrenic; and on and on. Interleaved amongst all the mysteries, are chapters that describe Precious's life and her troubled marriage.<br /><br />The focus here is not on the mysteries. They are not the point. The point and the focus is on how this woman makes her way amongst her people in Botswana. It is about how she manuevers within her culture and how she applies her people-sense or people-wisdom towards solving thevarious problems. Of course, this sometimes is not enough and you wonder if she was not played the patsy in the story of \\"Jack\\" and another missing husband case.<br /><br />Each story is told with gentle humor and involves no violence. Oh, there are people and animals who are killed, but we only find out about them later, for the most part. This is not a hard core mystery, it is more a celebration of the life of this remarkable woman.<br /><br />Her life evolves too. As we hear the stories of the mysteries she solves, we also become aware of her immediate friends and community. It is not a static community. Although Precious vows to remain a single woman, she ends up agreeing to marry one of the characters who appears in the book. One of the final stories told is about how they choose which house to live in and how Previous handles the groom's housekeeper - in a way, by the way, which is different than anything she had done before.<br /><br />This is the first book in a series that tells of Precious's life. While there is nothing particularly wrong with the book, it is simply not my style, so I will probably not read any more of them.ekeeper - in a way, by the way, which is different than anything she had done before.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|I have been reading fantasy for as long as  can remember and I have seen some great works get destroyed when they hit the silver screen.  Not this time.  Stardust was so much fun I advanced ordered a few copies for friends for the holidays.  I will put this DVD on my shelf next to Legend and The Fellowship of the Ring as one of the best fantasy movies in my collection.  It is not the same as the book and nothing can compete with Gaiman and the art of the Vess man but I would say that they gave me what I wanted most from the film and a few extra things too.  I would love an extended version of this thing.

Author Eric Nylund fleshes out the battle itself, the events leading to it, and the back story of the main characters - the genetically enhanced marine, the Master Chief; his creator, Catherine Halsey; and his commanding officer, Captain Jacob Keyes.<br /><br />One of the first things you notice about the world of Nylund's Halo is that there is no civilian government, at least any worth mentioning.  The sole players in the novel are military, which seems to be in control of a vast galactic human empire - but not doing a very good job of it.  Outlying planets and planetary systems are in open rebellion and the military sees only a future of dissolution and collapse.  Why these planets are seeking to secede is never explained.  Perhaps they have legitimate grievances.  If so, they are of no concern.  The Spartan program is to create a group of super-soldiers to wipe out any and all dissent.<br /><br />Overseeing the program is Dr Catherine Halsey, whose first task is the selection and kidnapping of children deemed suitable candidates for genetic manipulation.  The children are flash-cloned and the copies sent back to the parents, while the real children are sent to boot camp, toughened up and prepared for genetic experimentation.  Assisting her is Jacob Keyes, a career naval officer chosen to work with Spartan not because of his expertise in genetics, but because he values ideals - loyalty and duty - more than people; when faced with an ethical choice, he supports the institution above the individual.<br /><br />All the major characters, besides being members of or closely associated with the military, appear to be Caucasian. There are a few exceptions in the supporting cast, all of them lower down the chain of command, including Lt Hikowa, a Japanese female stereotypically described as a \\"porcelain doll,\\" and the tough Latino drill sergeant, Lt. Mendez.  Among the family names of the rest of the cast:  Keyes, Halsey, Stanforth, Watts, Cole, Wallace, Lovell, Hall, and Jaggers.  The Spartans, too, are mostly Caucasian.  Kidnapped and stripped of their family names, we have only givens:  John, Sam, Kelly, James, Linda, Kirk, Rene, Fred.  Of the 74 children kidnapped, 30 diewhen their bodies reject implants and genetic manipulation.  Another dozen survive with serious disorders, including the only one referred to by name, Fhajad.  Of the 30 Spartans that survive, one nearly didn't make it:  a woman, Kelly.  With the exception of the Musashi, Arabia, and Iroquois, ship names are derived from western culture:  Gettysburg, Commonwealth, Heracles, Vostok, Argo, Athens, Atlas, Magellan, Minotaur.<br /><br />Characters speak in clich&eacute; about duty, honor, sacrifice. No one ever has a second thought or a regret.  The Spartans never wonder what their lives might have been like if they hadn't been kidnapped and genetically altered by the military.  They harbor no suspicions against their handlers and their \\"makers.\\"  And those that made them, those that trained them, those that send them on assignments justify their decisions as necessary to preserve (their now devolved state of) civilization.<br /><br />Author William Dietz, who has written the second Halo novel, an adaptation of the the game story, seems to have tried to correct some of the more offensive elements of Nylund's creation (which may have been partly dictated by game developer Bungie).  In Dietz' novel the military is no longer a bastion of Arayanism, filled with \\"black, brown and white faces.\\"  Among the Anglo crew left over from Nylund's novel, we now have characters with names such as Bisenti, Abiad, Wang, Singh, Dowski and Yutrzenika.  And Dietz' own character, Major Antonio Silva, who leads the remnants of the Marines that escape the Pillar of Autumn, raises for the first time the moral and ethical issue at the heart of Halo and the Spartan program as depicted by Nylund. Silva describes the Master Chief a \\"freak, \\" the result of a morally and ethically dubious experiment.<br /><br />Skip this novel.  In fact, skip Dietz' novelization, too.  Go play the game instead and don't have your experience of Halo ruined by Nylund's 21st century fascist fantasy.<br /><br />=====================================<br /><br />After having been pulled back into discussion of a novel I'd mostly forgotten, I had a quick look through some of the critical reviews and found Mr. Jonathan McCartney saw something that fits in well with my contention.  Please go read his full 2-star review, \\"Doesn't do Justice to the XBOX Game Series,\\" 08 January 2008:<br /><br />\\"Though he was a man of few words on the XBOX and XBOX 360, [the Master Chief] was still effectively portrayed by Bungie Studios as a determined, fiery and most of all, noble and sympathetic warrior.

Any attempts that Nylund makes to state otherwise are very unconvincing...it's hard to believe the Master Chief is feeling much regret after very deliberately and savagely beating several of his comrades to death in an exercise room. Worse, the Master Chief is laughably invincible in Nylund's novel. Although the reader is expected to and should suspend his or her disbelief for a sci-fi novel such as this one, there are limits. The Master Chief takes on impossible odds while his comrades are portrayed as helpless, pathetic weaklings that are constantly marching toward certain doom.

B000VEA38E|2.0|I was so much looking forward to this brand new edition of the spectacular Star Wars music. I was picturing images that looked similar to the Lord of the Rings Complete recordings. But then my dissapointment was complete, when I got the item. The artwork is nice indeed, all of the 2 Disc-CDs covers have the original LP recordings coverarts, but the music has not been further remastered or enhanced non whatsoever. I begin to think, that the best available editions of John Williams's classic are the 1997 RCA Victor editions, which have been digitally remastered and brought to life chronologically, as they are in the films. Since then, the 2004 Sony Classical edition, and then the 2007 edition is the exact same music in the exact same sound quality, which could be better. Maybe the digital technology has it's limits too, and the original 77-80-83 master tapes cannot allow any more enhancing, but I don't think, that the Throne Room and End Title from A New Hope has to sound so scratchy as it does in all of the editions. Why can't they rerecord those tracks, that are in too bad shape to enjoy them perfectly? I'm sure Maestro Williams could find the time to do that with the London Symphony Orchestra. I think, that Sony Classical's love for this absolutely amazing, legendary music is simply not enough to handle it with the passion and dignity it deserves, as the people's, who did with Howard Shore's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. Compare the two editions with one another, and let them speak for themselves. This is almost outrageous for a true Star Wars music-fan, who (like me)owns all the previous editions of the music. I'm still hoping and waiting for a true collector's edition, and not just of the artwork and packaging, but the MUSIC. That's the most important. Until then, may the Force be with John Williams.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Diane can make any song sultry, this collection is a testament to that point. To be able to produce a \\"Best Of\\" this early in her career says a lot about her appeal to the masses. All of Diane's albums except her holiday offering and \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\" are represented, the countrified \\"The Heart Of Saturday Night\\" is a bonus track issued in Japan from the \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\" cd and hails from those sessions. Speaking of sessions, this \\"Best Of\\" could have served as a means to assemble her excellent outside studio work for artists like Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard so these songs will have to be sought out and is worth the search. Be that as it may, the three tracks new to this collection keeps this collection from becoming obsolete. Diane is busy having a family and deserves her time off. Thank you Diane for the wonderful catalog of recordings available and we will welcome you back with open arms.
0061547832|4.0|You either love him or hate him. Either way, this book tells it how it is. While I don't agree with every aspect, i.e. hire someone and then don't trust them, it has worked for him and can clearly work for many others. I can definitely take some of his ideas and implement them. Success is a mindset. If you don't think that you can be succesful, you won't be. Simple as that. Read this book from front to back and then read it again. You'll laugh, get upset, agree, disagree, maybe cry, but no doubt you'll be back for more. One last thing, anyone who says that he's a trust fund baby is a moron. There are simply too many people who have lost millions to believe that you don't have to be smart to keep what you have and make it grow into billions!
B000001DQI|5.0|I love music--and own everything from Madonna to Joni Mitchell to Patsy Cline to Queen--and everything in-between.  That said--this is without a doubt, my favorite album of all time.  I never, ever get tired of even one song on it.  It is a masterpiece through and through.  If I had to choose only one album to listen to for the rest of my life--this would be the one.
B000SM7QUC|4.0|You know: I read Amazon's review and cannot help but think how shallow and stupid the person was behind that. This album is a window into the life of a sick individual. The story that is told via the lyrics and the supporting music was done very well. No, this isn't Motley Crew as I'm assuming the reviewer expected it to be. Instead, it's a theatrical tale that covers the pitiful life of an addict. Give it a try and open up your mind, I think you'll like it!!!
B000002J3W|5.0|I gotta admit, when I first heard Skid Row, I wasn't too impressed. They seemed to be just another band that mirrored the LA glam scene. Then came Slave to the Grind, which had a few promising tunes but still had the overall tone of its predecessor.<br /><br />Subhuman Race is a far cry from their \\"MTV\\" days. It rocks hard and has major riffs and hooks. If you're a big fan of their earlier material, then this effort will probably not be to your liking. On the other hand, if you disliked the first 2 albums but saw the potential for them to take it to another level, then this will have you grinning widely. All those tours with bands like Metallica and Pantera finally rubbed off on their songwriting and pushed their musical ability to the limits. Crushing songs like \\"My Enemy\\", \\"Medicine Jar\\" and \\"Firesign\\" prove that they can also do downtuning, odd time signatures and dual guitar riffing, as well as a good mix of melody and make it sound good. Great album!
B000O75F7C|5.0|As a life musician and snob musically with a predisposition to technically oriented guitar music (Dream Theater, Joe Satriani and that ilk) I can say that I had not until this albumn been aware of P.T. I was really missing out. This is exceptional musical experience in my opinion. The sonic textures and melodies are fantastic and moody. The critisisms of the lyrical content to me are irrevelent. The melody, harmony and feel of this music is outstanding the work stands as an excellent piece of sonic landscape. I will seek out the rest of the work by P.T. and can only hope to find other such exceptional work. I have listened to this constantly since discovering it at for free at the public library of all places. I will purchase it as well as anything else I can get my hands on!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Shame on me for taking so long to purchase this piece of world history.  I had seen World at War over the years on TV, but never saw the complete work.  If you are a history buff and interested in the molding of this great world we live in, this is a must.  I would like to think that we could make it mandatory for our children to watch and study in school.  But, I will leave it because unfortunatly that will never happen.  If anyone is reading this and is thinking about buying this fine set, think no further, DO IT.  You will be greatly rewarded with this masterfull piece of our history.

B000VI70WM|1.0|I don't blame him for not wanting to be a part of this mess.  This sounds nothing like the D2 I have known and loved since the 80s.  They sold out, plain and simple, by saying goodbye to Andy and bringing in the two Timbas on this one.  They have turned their collective backs on the loyal fans who have been there since the beginning.  Thanks guys.
0440238609|1.0|The books by Phillip Pullman have been described as \\"atheism for kids\\".  Pullman is a militant atheist and secular humanist who despises C. S. Lewis and the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\".  His motivation for writing this trilogy was specifically to counteract Lewis' symbolisms of Christ that are portrayed in the Narnia series.<br /><br />Clearly, Pullman's main objective is to bash Christianity and promote atheism.  Pullman left little doubt about his intentions when he said in a 2003 interview that \\"my books are about killing God.\\"  He has even stated that he wants to \\"kill God in the minds of children\\".  It has been said of Pullman that he is \\"the writer the atheists would be praying for, if atheists prayed.\\"<br /><br />While \\"The Golden Compass\\" itself may seem mild and innocent, the other books are a much different story.  In the trilogy, a young streetwise girl becomes enmeshed in an epic struggle to ultimately defeat the oppressive forces of a senile God.  Another character, an ex-nun, describes Christianity as \\"a very powerful and convincing mistake.\\"  In the final book, characters representing Adam and Eve eventually kill God, who at times is called YAHWEH.  Each book in the trilogy gets progressively worse regarding Pullman's hatred of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Do not buy these books.  I am returning the ones I ordered for my daughter.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Love this band!  Stumbled onto them on Sirius, and promptly went out and bought the cd!!  Some of the best music I have heard in a while!!!!
006112429X|4.0|While I agree with many of the favorable reviews of this book: writing, pacing, plot, etc., were excellent, I am surprised at how little comment was made about what an awful woman the mother was.  While it's true that the Kevin seemed to start off disliking her, I can't help but think that even infants can sense when they are unwanted.  I began to count the number of times Eva referred to children's behaviour as moronic.  She seemed unable to  judge a child in a different frame of reference from an adult.  Her superior attitude about almost everyone else (fat people shouldn't use health issues to excuse their overeating; overeating is their problem) was annoying; her self centeredness was apapalling; any incident was drawn back to her own experience leaving one to wonder if Kevin sensed at a very early age that he was never going be what all children need and want to be; the center of their mother's universe.  While you have two somewhat exreme types of personality in the parents: the father too naive and trusting and the mother just the opposite; the balance should not have led to the disaster of Kevin's personality. Postpartum depression likely played into Eva's lack of feeling for Kevin, yet she refused to accept that possibility despite her obvious intelligence and didn't seek help. While Kevin may have been born a bad seed, his mother only set an example for him of an arrogant and withdrawn parent while his father was nearly a 50's sit com joke.    Having said that the book was tremendous - I was unable to put it down until finished despite feeling sick to my stomach while reading and she maintained the narrative beautifully.  I don't know if I could highly recommend the book simply because it's a very tough read only because of the subject not the writing.    I think that sociopaths are born not made and I think that Kevin was one;  but who knows?
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The Planet Earth HD DVD was my initiation into the HD era of video.  The purchase was a one that I was glad to make.  Crisp clear video greeted my eyes once I loaded the video into my Xbox 360 HD-DVD add on.  The snow covered earth sparkled in the sunlight and the polar bear's fur ebbed and flowed with the blowing wind.  The rugged beauty of certain landscapes brought tears to my eyes and my wife was astounded by what she saw.  So much so that she put down what she was doing and settled beside me just to watch the documentary.  It prompted me to order a copy of the Galapagos documentary on HD DVD.  This is a keeper for my children, beautifully made documentaries that they can fall in love with mother earth with.
074327931X|2.0|Apart from the brilliant name, there is nothing else in the book that's in the top leagues.  This book has a lot of errors in the verbal section (trust me, I know what I'm talking about; I had a V51). Some of the problems in the quant section are quite challenging though.    So overall, if you do need extra practice beyond the \\"Official Guide\\". I suggest you go for the Official Guide verbal and quant books rather than this one. Kaplan 800 is a waste of money, but can be of use for quant if you get it free.
B000031WBV|5.0|With my large collection of CDs (downloaded in WAVE to iTunes and a 160GB iPod), I realized that one of my all-time favorite collections for late nightime is Chopin's nocturnes.  The pianist I had was Maria Joao Pires, selected years ago for no apparent reason.  Recently I looked within Amazon at the various comments and listened to several other versions.  To my surprised there seemed to be others that sounded superior.  I wasn't sure, though, because how accurate is a 1 minute sound-bit though the internet.  To test it out, I ordered 3 new sets that had high reviews:  Rubinstein, Moravec, and Arrau.  (By way of background, I seat on the Board of Directors of a regional symphony, but I have never heard of any of these pianists, except for Rubinstein.)  After the CDs arrived, I have carefully comparing various nocturnes for all four pianists.  First, my preference for nocturnes is sleepy/dreary as though right before going to bed.  No Beethoven's Fifth if I want to go to sleep anytime soon.  To my surprise there were real differences.  I don't know if it is the piano, recording, or what.  My favorites are Moravec and Rubinstein.  They are both very musical, restful and peaceful.  I expected Rubinstein to be poorly recorded, but not so.  Between the two, I generally prefer Moravec.  For No. 13 (Op. 48, No. 1 in c), however, I like Rubinstein better.  The other two seem a far distance 3th and 4th place. Arrau seems more mechanical, and it sounds as though the recording was right next to the piano sound board - too shrill for my tastes. Pires is more similar to Arrau than to Moravec or Rubinstein.  As to all of them, I have no prior allegiance, instead simply tried to compare them for my tastes.  Hope this helps others.
6304498969|5.0|This is definetely one of the best \\"At-Home\\" concert you can watch in your house. Really makes me feel that I'm sitting in a front row. Eric Clapton presents his singing, lead and rythm guitar, etc right in front of cameras. All the songs are great!!!! Hard to pick up the best.    I was first attracted to this CD version. To me, as the editorial review says \\"how well rock stars and their material can hold up when stripped of elaborate production values\\". I like big arena concerts and I appreciate their performance and show values. But for some of them, I do wonder \\"I don't think he's actually playing\\", \\"they are using somebody or even tapes in order to look like they are playing\\", etc that sort.     My problem with this CD is that I listen again and again and leave it be in my truck till I think I'd better change it. My biggest curiosity had been who is playing the guitar at \\"beggin' pleeeeeeeese\\"? Sounded like EC but he must have been focusing on his vocal. Yet is this DVD worth buying just to see it? Well, it was him. This is it!! This really shows his talent that he can really sing and play his guitar simultanously, while some has to be backed up either one at the real concert. His backing band is minimal hence no cheating. He even picks up the right moments to push up his glasses!!     I don't have enough musical/guitar experience and knowledge but I do know EC is real. I guess I have to watch this DVD again and again in my house as I listen to the CD again and again in my truck.  SY
0446310786|5.0|i just finished reading \\"to kill a mockingbird\\" two days ago and it has still not left my mind, the characters harper lee creates wrap a blanket around your heart and show you a different side of life and loving and understanding one another, atticus finch is to me the ultimate figurehead of  loving in the face of immeasurable injustice (and when read and compared to trials of modern day, the lessons taught from his character only seem greater and more profound) and the book as a whole struck me in such a way that it left me now as a changed and better person, i waited far too long to read this book.
1592332803|5.0|I have been vegan for about a year now and have experimented with some interesting products. This book is great because it describes, and gives you suggestions on ingredients you can and can't substitute. The Peanut Butter Chocolate Bars were a big hit at the office and I plan to try the Pumpkin Cheescake this Thanksgiving. The pictures are gorgeous and the Cooks' tips are insightful. I also enjoy the Food Lore about several of the delicious recipes in this book. I can't wait to try all of the recipes and knock the socks off of my non-vegeterian friends!!!

So if a woman likes a man, why shouldn't she take the initiative and ask him out? (And if she doesn't then she must not like him)    With their logic, I must not really like this shy guy in my class, because I have not asked him out yet.

B000VL9XE2|5.0|DEP seem to get more progressive with each release.  While some find it a turnoff that every track isn't jackhammer oldschool DEP, I find comfort that there's still some bands out there that actually progress with each album.  If you want a band that you know how EVERY release will sound then you should check out Nickelback.  I find that a lot of these tracks have a very King Crimson'ish feel to them (minus the vocals).  Overall it's just a gret album!
B000QQFKYE|3.0|The movie centers around an enormously wealthy actress Nikki (Dern) who after getting an usual visit by a crazed Polish immigrant neighbor (Twin Peaks's Grace Zabriskie), Nikki gets a call from her agent telling her she got casted in the role of Sue in this of this romantic movie.  Still in pre-production the movie was soon revealed by the director (Jeremy Irons) that the movie was in fact a remake of a Polish movie that was never finished because the main actress died during filming.  After that the movie goes into a winding trip in which we follow Nikki/Sue dealing with her abusive husband who has connection with the Polish mob, visiting a Psychiactric counselor in a rundown building, several obscure scenes with people in bunny suits, encountering drug addicted prostitues along the Hollywood strip and in Nikki/Sue home, wondering if she is in reality or not and constant shots of a city in Poland.<br /><br />I wouldnt say this is my favorite David Lynch movie (that goes to \\"Blue Velvet\\", \\"Wild At Heart\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\") it was too long \\"almost 3 hours of non stop acid trip\\".  It dragged on!  There were lots of unnecessary scenes in this movie that should've been left in the cutting room floor, one particular scene that seems like Lynch was ripping on Tarantino's style of endless dialog.  IMO this movie wouldve been better if Lynch boggled it down to at least one and a half or two hours long.  Interesting this movie does feature cameos such as Willam H. Macy, Mary Steenbergen (Back to the Future 3), Diane Ladd, and Julia Ormond.
0805079831|5.0|This book is a revelation. Brilliantly researched and written, it exposes the moral bankrupcy and base criminality of the Chicago School of Economics and its enablers who have perverted and crippled the world's financial and political systems. The author, Naomi Klein, has shown great courage and also exceptional skill in reporting this story. For those seriously intersted in knowing why the world's is in such big trouble, here is a big part of the answer.
B00009L1UP|5.0|Released in the Autumn of 1990 (I think thats when it was released), Empire was Queensryche's follow up to their massive successful selling (although it didnt yeld any hits) rock opera album Operation: Mindcrime.  Unlike Operation: Mindcrime, Empire is just a standard music album in which the songs dont relate to one another.  The highlight of the  album is \\"Silent Lucidity\\" which was Queensrych's only single to ever chart (a shame considering these guys deserve more due to their talents).  I remember the video to \\"Silent Lucidity\\" was played on a heavy rotation on MTV even at the height of the grunge scene era and post grunge era.  It's a very Pink Floydian song that seems to be about dreams and nightmare.  Chris Degarmo and Michael Wilton both do an excellent job with the guitar riff, especially the solo part of the song.  One of the feature songs on this album is the title track \\"Empire\\" which is a thoughful song about drug dealings and gang war in America during the late 80's and early 90's and how government is not spending enough money on law enforcement and more on military and space expeditions.  My favorite songs on this album are \\"The Thin Line\\", which has a really good beat and lyrics about sacrificing yourself for your love one (that was a guess from reading the lyrics).  \\"Jet City Woman\\", a really good rockin song about stalking.  \\"Another Rainy Night\\", a ballad that was played alot on Pirate Radio station (a awsome metal station that played 80's and early 90's metal) when I was living in Monterey, California.  \\"Hand On Heart\\", another ballad and \\"Anybody Listening\\" which the bands decided to go back to their progessive roots.  This is a really good album, I really like it.  I listen to this album alot.  I love Geoff Tate's deep voice and Chris Degarmo's guitar rhythms.  The version I owned is the special edition which has three added bonus tracks.  I'm not really going to mention those but \\"Last Time in Paris\\" is a catchy song.  \\"Empire\\" is a album worth checking out, some might get turned off because of the dated sound, but hey dated stuff are always better sounding any recent music of this generation.orth checking out, some might get turned off because of the dated sound, but hey dated stuff are always better sounding any recent music of this generation.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|Clever little action romance that executes fairly well on the little twist of the idea that Cage can see 2 minutes in the future.  There are a few holes in the story and questions about how his gift actually works,  but the beauty is it that they keep the action excellently paced which  makes it an enjoyable experience.  It's a bit cheesy in parts, but has enough clever twists that keep you engaged and trying to figure out what else may be in store.  Another solid performance by Cage.
B000TXG3YA|3.0|Some part of Baroness has gone missing.  What was once a blistering corrosion of upbeat riffs in albums First, Second and Third is now diminished, or at least lacking, in Baroness' latest release, The Red Album (2007).      As the first release from Baroness' new home, Relapse Records, The Red Album shows how the four boys from Savannah, GA have matured.  However, The Red Album certainly fails in comparison to previous releases.  Though the all-familiar interludes and original melodies make several cameo appearances throughout the album, the unfamiliar addition of clear vocals brings great change.     While it may share similar juxtaposition and abrasiveness with bands like Torche, Kylesa or Isis, Baroness seems to flow in and out of several established spotlights in The Red Album. For those who enjoy Steve Brook's echoing vocals of Torche, then maybe this album will satisfy those more traditional needs.  Since its recent move from At A Loss Records to Relapse Records, there's significant revision to the Baroness sound.  It could just be Baroness' tribute to its traditional roots, an intention that was never fully developed.     On a less jarring note, Baroness reaches a new experimental high with tracks like \\"Wailing Wintry Wind.\\"  Given the solid instrumentation with fewer vocals, this track reminds listeners of Baroness' musicianship.      For what it's worth, The Red Album certainly brings a new face to the well-respected progressive sludge project of Baroness.  Only future releases will allow its loyal listeners to make the judgment of Baroness' fate.      --JBlumensheid
B00005JKHP|5.0|Similar to what the recent remastering of the original series has done, this is updated as well, but in a lesser degree. A lot of care was put into touching up and completing Robert Wise's original vision for the film. Using modern technology, new scenes that were in the original storyboard art but never used are finally brought to life. It's not so much new scenes, but the original vision for already existing scenes that could be done when the film was originally made. There aren't big changes, but small ones that you probably wouldn't really notice unless you were very familiar with the original film. That's how natural the updated film feels and stays a loyal as possible to the original movie.<br /><br />Some scenes that have been added are just beautiful. One scene in particular is the first time you see Spock on Vulcan. They have finally been able to make a realistic looking Vulcan planet and give it atmosphere. Unlike in the original film when he is blinded by the sunlight, but the sky is black and no sun to be seen. Overall, this updated \\"Director's Edition\\" just makes the film more enjoyable to watch and even more \\"sci-fi\\" than it previously was.<br /><br />It will not convert you if you don't like the original film, because it is very much the same and it is just as interesting. So, if you thought this film was boring, you still will. But, if you like this movie, it just enhances the experience.

B000JLTRKE|2.0|World Trade Center directed by Oliver Stone showed promise in the first 30 minutes but after that, this film lacked a heart and soul. The all-star cast are expectionally talented but the true-life survivors they are portraying seem so fake and unsympathetic. Oliver Stone was such a great director but his \\"masterpieces\\" have suffered greatly in over a decade, I can't remember a flawless film he's created in such a long time, it's so sad. If you want a film that is truly a tribute to the courageous heroes of 9/11 then I highly recommend United 93 instead. That film is perfect from beginning to end.
0385522401|5.0|Was anyone ever as naive and blundering as Florence and Edward? These two young people in their early twenties demonstrate a depth of ignorance that dooms their wedding night. Ian McEwan's novella ON CHESIL BEACH covers the few hours in 1962 during which Florence and Edward eat a mediocre wedding dinner in a hotel suite, move to the bedroom where they botch the whole thing badly, and fail to say the one thing, offer the one reconciliaton that could have saved them.<br /><br />The overriding gift of this little book is McEwan's beautiful writing, which truly takes center stage. The plot is closely contained within Florence and Edward's relationship and the events of their wedding night, and there is barely enough supporting documentation to justify his clumsiness and her terror.<br /><br />The point is universally made by reviewers that all this was before the Sexual Revolution of the sixties and early seventies. It hardly seems enough to explain the complete lack of communication between these two, and especially Florence's fear of sex. McEwan throws out a few clues about the relationship between Florence and her father but chooses not to develop them, and it's a noticeable choice in such a short book.<br /><br />Another choice McEwan made was to define the story so closely. ON CHESIL BEACH is unusual in this regard: it's a book that could have been longer. After the fine dissection of the wedding night, the last section pelts through several decades, as if the only thing about these two worth discussing was over and done with. The harsh last minutes of the wedding night, on the beach, might have been a fulcrum point for a longer story. That was not McEwans' choice, however.<br /><br />As a character study and an exquisitely disciplined exercise, ON CHESIL BEACH comes through beautifully and is a strong contender for another Booker Prize for McEwan. Yes, there are questions unanswered, but you have to suppose that was McEwan's intent all along. This is a book to be remembered and mused over for a long time.r a long time.
6304712936|5.0|Don't buy this movie if you're looking for a FACTUAL and HISTORICAL account of Amadeus' life... if you want to get to know the \\"real WOLFGANG A.

B000VBJEFK|5.0|\\"Ratatouille\\" is the most amazing hi-def disc I have seen from either camp, Blu-ray or HD-DVD.  First off, the detail and clarity of the image is beyond wonderful.  The details are incredibly fine.  The colors are rich and everything is fully stunning.  Add to this, the story is extremely well done.    Now, to the features.  People who support HD-DVD will often rag Blu-ray for its lack of Picture-in-Picture (only at the present time, as it is coming).  However, that being said, I haven't seen an HD-DVD release with PiP that matched the complexity of interactivity on this disc.  The option for Cine-Explore allows you to choose the special features you want, but if you pick the automatic feature you are in for a wild ride.  The movie then has the director and prodcer's's commentary track throughout, while flashing photos, drawings, and paintings, and also branch off to special videos (90% I would say are in 1080i or 1080p) about the making of the film, then come back to the exact spot the film left off.  This is no tiny spot in the corner, but rather full-screen videos.  Altogether, these extra videos make the film run about three hours or more.  Magnificently put together, all work seamlessly.  But it is definitely something to watch AFTER you see the film for the first time in regular play.    In addition, there are separate featurettes on the making of the film, two Pixar shorts, and the game, which really keeps you busy.  Plus an Easter egg that leads into five short pieces.    I highly recommend this as something that could even turn an HD-DVDer into a Blu-ray supporter.  Magnificent job, Disney!

0441172717|5.0|This book is truly in a class by itself.  It grabs you right off the bat and you won't be able to put down.  \\"Dune\\" has it all--gripping plot, rich characters and captivating style page after page.  Herbert possesses a stunning intellect and an incredible imagination, and he demonstrates both here.  This book is a truly epic jounrey, and it is required reading for all science fiction fans.  So, if you have yet to experience \\"Dune,\\" treat yourself to one of science fiction's greatest masterpieces.  Highly recommended.
B000VL9XE2|5.0|Let me explain one thing, if your expecting \\"Calculating Infinity\\" or \\"Irony Is A Dead Scene\\". Don't. It's actually is more like \\"Miss Machine\\" but with Unretofied/Phone Home dripping in the vains of DEP witch is not really a bad thing. As a matter of fact, it improves thier artestry as a band more. Now don't let some naysayers tell you different. This is a good album. And if you are someone who is open for some changes within the band on this album. Then enjoy.
B000SUKPKM|1.0|Why on earth did the Goo Goo Dolls include an inferior, \\"newly-recorded\\" version of \\"Name\\"???!   This is arguably their finest song and since the original version was absolutely perfect, there's just no reason for this kind of mess.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|Not Britney style!  Don't like the background \\"music\\" it does nothing for the music...very ghettoish and just not normal.  VERY DIFFERENT I WILL GIVE THE ALBUM THAT!  Love the song Freakshow...she talks about Shaving her A$$  She has balls :)  The album is pretty good but I'm critical of music and \\"Freakshow\\" and \\"Gimme More\\" are the two that stand out!  She's tried going more rap instead of music!  Only it's more a monotone rap not even good beats and style!  The lyrics are better than the album!
6305971935|4.0|My God it was fun and thrilling to go back in time to 1984 when I first saw THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT in the movies, and then go back again to 1943 (before my time).I had completely timewarped myself out and still was pleased to say that this science fiction/fact/romance/action/Thriller still stands the test of time as a classic piece of riveting,nail-biting,allbeit tad corny time travel!    In 1943 an experiment on the U.S.S ELdredge goes terribly awry as the Navy tries to make the ship go invisible so that Germans will not detect it on radar.It does...but something has gone wrong as two of sailors jump ship and fall into some time vortex that lands them in 1984,in a town in Nevada that has suddenly disappeared! There are incredible storms brewing and everything is being threatened by this timewarping.The two sailors are shocked and confused by what has happened.They do not know where they are and what year it is.What is certain is that one of the sailors is electrically charged and seems to be linked still to the electromagnetic field.The two sailors \\"kidnap\\" a girl, and she becomes their link between the two time fields.    Corny? Yes.Exciting and provocative? Yes. For all of the obvious \\"holes\\" that this script has (I mean,c'mon it IS science fiction which is inevitable),this film never lets up with narrow escapes,car crashes,burning buildings and special effects that still look convincing enough even for the most sophisticated 2007 Sci-Fi officienado!    Michael Pare and Nancy Allen star as the two whose love will span the time zones.The fact that this film IS actually based on a true experiment makes this film all the more compelling.A ship DID disappear in the Philadelphia Harbour in 1943, and a man did reappear with the ship embedded in the deck! After that, who really knows.This is one possible account with lots of extra added in...and it still works after 23 years.    A great companion film would be THE FINAL COUNTDOWN.
B000F7CMRW|1.0|George Clooney has the distinction as the star of one of my favorite movies and this one. The worst I have ever seen in 65 years. If you are looking for a plot, good acting, a story, or entertainment look elsewhere. Its like a George Bush speech, lots of screw ups and not much content. I paid $2 to rent this thing and should have used the money to wash my car. Would have gotten more pleasure and a better use of my time. Finally I would like to say OH Brother, Where Art Thou?
B000VNMMR0|5.0|The \\"unrated\\" version on this disk is essentially the R rated version that was intended and shot.  The PG-13 theatrical release was the Stupid Studio wanting more box office dollars.  Scenes/audio were removed or changed from the shot version to create this PG-13 release.  Now we can see the movie the right way.  The first three Die Hard movies were all R rated.  The unrated version is a very enjoyable action movie.  A worthy addition to the franchise.  The commentary with Bruce, the Director and the Editor is interesting, and has a few cool tidbits.

B000UR9TQO|5.0|Anybody who says this is not Led Zeppelin at their best is simply trying to sound like an expert when really all they're doing is regurgitating something Jimmy Page was quoted as saying at some point a long time ago. As someone who has listened to just about every Led Zep bootleg ever made I can say with confidence that most of the songs are definitive live renditions. No Quarter, The Song Remains The Same, Rain Song, Since I've Been Loving You, are all spectacular! And then there is Dazed And Confused; this song continued to grow and mature live just as the group did. The '73 edition is the pinnacle of that songs existence. In '75 although it was longer, it began to meander and loose focus. Dazed from this show is tight, moves gracefully from passage to passage, builds, releases and shows why Jimmy Page is a master craftsman.   I'm sick of negative reviews of this show!!! All I can say is you don't know what you're talking about. I am very excited about this complete release. Get It!!!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|No, this movie does not compare to the original DIE HARD.  Let's just get that out of the way right off the top, shall we?  I frankly can't imagine any movie comparing.  It was one of those rare movies that turns an entire genre on its head...or even invents a new genre.  How many DIE HARD rip-offs have there been?  Many of them awful...and many of them pretty good...but still, they are knock-offs.  SPEED?  DIE HARD on a bus.  Still a great movie...but it didn't feel 100% original.  DIE HARD did.  Simple as that.  I still watch that film and thrill to it...I may know everything that's coming...but it is so well-crafted and structured...so well edited and acted...you just see over and over why it is unmatched.    LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is still a damn fun movie!!!  So what if it isn't DIE HARD...it's still one of the most exciting and outrageous films in a long time.  A formula flick that delights, surprises and satisfies on a gut level.  It promises a thrill-ride and it delivers.  It does not promise intellectual insight (and delivers none), great political commentary (arguably there is a little bit snuck in) nor would it ever claim to be a Best Picture Oscar contender.  And that's a GOOD thing.  It is fun!  And the kind of fun that only a movie can deliver.    Willis is John McClain again...many years older.  His wisecracks are a little dispirited (at least at the beginning), not because the movie is unoriginal...but because McClain is a little burnt out himself.  We first see him spying on his teenage daughter to make sure the guy she's making out with is okay.  It's a funny situation, but it's a little sad too.  Here's this guy who has basically saved thousands of people from obliteration...and he still can't get his personal life together.      He is quickly thrust into saving the life of a computer nerd (Justin Long), and wouldn't you know it...this is no ordinary case.  This is another world-shaking, cataclysmic terrorist event in the making...and only McClaincan save the day!  Yep, you just want to roll your eyes...but 99% of you just smiles, kicks back and relaxes.  You know you're in good hands.    Willis really delivers.  He knows how to play this part with his eyes closed...but the great thing is, he doesn't coast.  (He has coasted in the past...but to his credit, Willis is one of the most physically committed actors around...he seldom just phones in his work.)  And he is well-matched with Justin Long.  Talk about an odd-couple!  Naturally, as the movie progresses, and Willis saves Long's life for about the 100th time, Long grows to respect this artifact of a by-gone era.  And Willis grows fond of this nerdy kid.  Nothing earth-shattering there...but their by-play is so well-done that it feels, if not fresh, at least well-thought out.    Maggie Q is in the Alexander Gudonov role...you know, the henchman to the main bad guy...the one who almost never talks but can sure kick some serious butt.  She is extremely physically in her role, and she and Willis have a brutal and brilliantly stage (and super exciting) fight scene.  This alone almost makes the entire movie worth seeing.  It's one of the best fight scenes in a long time.  Outrageously unlikely...but only made more enjoyable for that fact.    Speaking of bad guys...Timothy Olyphant plays the master criminal, and it's an odd casting choice.  He's supposed to be one of these mild-mannered, soft-spoken but oh-so-dangerous psychos.  Sadly, he mostly comes across as mild-mannered and maybe a little peeved.  The plan he's executing is a lot of fun (I won't spoil it...but suffice it to say that he wants the world to go REALLY low-tech), and the details of it are enjoyable to follow...but Olyphant is only really weak link in the acting chain here.    The stunts in this movie are among the most jaw-dropping I've ever seen.  Apparently, the more ridiculous the better...and again, it's that sense of glee, that sense that the filmmakers know perfectly well that what they'veconstructed is entirely without credibility...that makes it WORK!  I've never laughed more at stunt work...but in a good way.  I was almost like a little kid, ready to just clap my hands and stamp my feet in delight.      LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is a totally \\"big-studio, money-grabbing, escapist summer movie.\\"  But it shows that sometimes, that kind of film, well-done, is exactly what the doctor ordered.  If you enjoyed DIE HARD...you should love this film too.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel...but it sure makes the biggest, loudest, most awesome wheel you've seen in a long time!!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is the first time that I've left a product review of any type, but I just felt that I had to....<br /><br />I'm not an expert in audio, but I DID get tired of less expensive headphones just not living up to my expectations.<br /><br />These Sony headphones are worth every penny.  First, they have plenty of volume - something lesser headphones lack.  Sometimes I just wanna ROCK - I want it LOUD.  Most headphones dis-appoint on that.<br /><br />So - I bought these because I read a review saying that they had higher volume at lower settings.  Not only am I pleased with the volume (even when only connected to my ipod!), but the sound quality is STUNNING.<br /><br />FANTASTIC Bass - You'd SWEAR that there is a sub-woofer operating somewhere, and the highs are all there.  VERY impressive dynamic range.<br /><br />Ok - I'll stop being a salesman for Sony.  Let's just say that I was impressed enough to leave my FIRST product feedback.  Buy these headphones, you will NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />Ron (yoda)

Hello...you've now become a zombie! The approach taken in the Power of Now is the age-old Buddhist solution: life is amount to suffering from which we must escape.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever really lived will tell you that the beauty of life lies in appreciating in the whole range of suffering, joy, foolishness, chaos, pleasure and pain.

0307275639|1.0|Morrie's philosophy of life? I truly hope there was more to it than is presented in this book.  Pull out Morrie's lessons on life from the book and you will have trouble filling half a page.  THERE IS VERY LITTLE HERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WHAT IS ADVERTISED.  What is here is a lot about Mitch.  Its a short book but in it you learn more about a fairly uninteresting character, the author, and about the incremental progress of a fatal disease, than you do about what Morrie has to teach you.  Morrie does not come alive in the book, he is two dimentional at best - not very interesting either.  The author just simply could not pull it off - it was not an easy book to write and he failed miserably.  Pay particular attention to Morrie's quotes.  There is no shift, no change in character.  Its not Morrie talkiing, its only Mitch recalling.  Quotes or no quotes, it comes across as the same person speaking to you.  Read just a little between the lines and you may get an uneasy feeling that Mitch was perhaps a bit opportunistic and that the book might be a little too self serving for the author.  Anyhow, its and easy read, very easy, and if you do you may wonder like me what all those wonderful reviews are all about, the idea of the book, or the book itself.
B000002LUB|5.0|Initially, when I recieved this album, I thought it was pretty run-of-the-mill. It seemed like all the songs blended together and I had a hard time remembering which song was which for quite some time. I already had \\"The Dio Years\\" So I was already aquainted with \\"TV Crimes\\" \\"After All\\" and \\"I.\\" It took me along time and tons of continuous listens before I really began to love it. For the last month or so its all i've played. Im a huge Sabbath Fan and a Huge Dio fan, so when they combined it was like heaven to me. Song Reviews: Computer God- Really solid opener, my only complaint would be the drumming, kinda ho-hum, other than that its brilliant. 9/10 After All (The Dead)- The beginning is slow and boring to me, but it pays off with the rest of the song, 7/10. TV Crimes- What can i say other than Awesome!!! 10/10. Letters from Earth- Another solid track here, Iommi rift madness..9/10. Master of Insanity- Good song, a little different from the rest, 8/10. Time Machine- Awesome!! 10/10. Sins of the Father- Not sure about the start but again it pays off later 8/10.  Too Late- This albums \\"slow start dio song\\" if your familiar with dio you know what im talking about. Pretty solid. 9/10. I- Sweet song, pretty heavy but sometimes the lyrics seems a bit trivial (the hobbit like Dio singing things like \\"I'm a giant, im a monster\\" and \\"I'll Smash your face in\\"(which sounds like something a 4th grade student would say) But im sure its all metaforical to ego's or something. 9/10. Buried Alive is the closer and is one of my favorites on the album, tied with TV crimes for best. 10/10. I am a fan of all types of music becides extreme death metal. For me this album blends everything i love about rock and the darkness of metal together. I wouldn't reccomend it over Heaven and Hell but its a very good heavy metal album. It would be a nice addition to any metal collection.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|An Inconvenient Truth allows Al Gore to push his theory that global warming is real and potentially very hazardous to the human race, wildlife and all nature. He is correct; and he supplies us with charts, graphs, scientific data and anecdotal self-revealing tales in order to get his point across.<br /><br />Although there are several times when the movie and Al Gore's slideshow are so full of dry scientific data and lingo it could make a man fall asleep while trying to watch it, there are also much more substantive moments when Al Gore relates the wealth of scientific data to the real people in his life. We see how tobacco brought on the death of his big sister and he connects tobacco smoke to the pollution we put into Earth's atmosphere every day as a type of cancer smoke we all gradually breathe more and more frequently. Gore sometimes jokes with his audience even though the subject matter is, of course, no laughing matter.<br /><br />However, even if your attention does drift a few moments here and there (just don't tell people you sometimes felt bored), you still get the message loud and clear: global warming is something we cause by pollution--and it's also something we can fix in order to avert a serious climate crisis within the next fifty years. Perhaps the most dramatic graphics Gore uses are those of what would happen to highly populated areas including New York City and Beijing if too much ice melted from warming and became water--huge areas of major cities would be underwater.<br /><br />The DVD comes with several extras. We get two commentaries with directors and others and Al Gore himself gives a roughly thirty minute \\"update\\" on what events have taken place since this movie was first made for the big screen. Unfortunately, Mr. Gore has much more sobering data to support his claim that global warming must be stopped at once. I also liked the eleven minute featurette on how they made An Inconvenient Truth.<br /><br />The quality of the picture and sound is excellent. They did an excellent job of editing the footage, too; this becomes more apparent when you watch the featurette on the making of this movie.<br /><br />Overall, Al Gore makes a strong case for global warming and the urgent need for us to change our ways in his fine movie entitled An Inconvenient Truth. I highly recommend this film for people studying global warming; and if you ever needed motivation and spirit to change the ways you use energy this movie sure will influence you!<br /><br />Four stars.cellent job of editing the footage, too; this becomes more apparent when you watch the featurette on the making of this movie.

B000NA77YO|4.0|Not bad but the new tracks arent that special. Ear in the Wall is the stand out, Shadow of the Wind would have been better if dio was 20 years younger, the Devil Cried is my least dio-sabbath song ever. It would have been much better off if \\"Falling off the edge of the world\\" was replaced with \\"Country Girl\\" Or Sign of the Southern Cross, which are significantly better. After All should not be on there and it should be repaced with Time Machine or Buried Alive.

B00005JO20|2.0|Okay, the film is not absolutely terrible.  The basic story is intact, and there's lots of color and action.  Great.  But owning it on DVD, repeat viewings for me are going to be few and far between.    First, there's a lot of character development and backdrop that goes nowhere.  The movie takes forever to get going, but you're thinking there must be a reason for all this character introduction.  Well, there isn't really.  It goes nowhere and is completely superfluous.  Beyond that, Anne's affection for the ape is nonsensical.  I think maybe its a veiled attempt to project some late 20th-century environmental/animal protection sensibilities into an era where they make no sense, or perhaps the writers didn't even realize they were doing it.  The 1930s probably had much the same exploitive attitudes as the Victorian era.  The movie also had a darker more foreboding atmosphere than the original, which eventually seemed pointless and gave way to the cartoony NY scenes at the end.  Maybe it was also related to the weak and undeveloped morality-play aspect of the film.  In the middle of all this, Jack Black sticks out like a sore thumb.  I think he was meant to pull off the reassuring confidence of the original Denham character, since he's certainly not a dramatic character, but he falls short and just seems comical where its inappropriate.    And CG in general is really tired and is a big turnoff to me.  I almost loathe it.  In this particular movie some CG was okay, and a lot was borderline to just plain bad, which was surprising.  I find older movies that predate CG to be more enjoyable to watch often times, not because the effects are more believable (although in a sense they are because you know you're still seeing a real \\"thing\\" on screen), but because they had to be more creative and work within limitations and were also more constrained to simpler \\"within-the-realm-of-possibilities\\" type scenes.  Now instead you get some fat nerd on a workstation somewhere goingberserk with the unlimited use of models and crashing and explosions and noise and digitally-created indistinct \\"crap\\" flying everywhere in some scenes. Gimme O'Brian, Harryhausen, and even Lucas' 70s puppets any day.  I hate watching a CG action scene where you can't keep track of what's going on because its just tons of flip-flopping stuff flying and crashing everywhere action.  To be asked to believe the absurd aerial acrobatics the characters are routinely flung through like rag dolls, escaping unscathed, begs incredulity.  A more recent example is the disorienting urban fight scene in Transformers, an otherwise superior movie.  Get real.  Note to Hollywood: less is more.  Concentrate on story and characters (and have a point to each), use limited effects to enhance -- not bowl over.  But given that those of non-discriminating tastes eat this stuff up, I don't expect any changes any time soon.
0786838655|4.0|If you love Greek mythology then you're Rick Riordan's target audience and sure to love THE LIGHTNING THIEF.  Heck, even if you've never read a Greek myth in your life, you'll probably enjoy the book.  It's that much fun.  Half of Riordan's work is done for him (the creative adventures and profiles of the Greek gods) and he ably provides the other half, mixing modern times with ancient and coming up with something that's not only successfully Greek to me, but will be to young readers who love plot as well.<br /><br />This follows the old \\"quest formula\\" to perfection, as young Percy Jackson finds out the hard way (read: attacking monsters with ancient Greek pedigree) that he's not your average kid.  No, he's a demi-god, a half-blood, a product of a mortal mom and an immortal dad.  Once he knows something's fishy, Percy quickly puts salt and water together to determine that \\"Pop\\" is Poseidon himself.  In true hero-in-training fashion, Percy must now take on a quest to prove himself and the quest involves a trip to Hades and back.  Getting there turns out to be a lot trickier than expected, but readers will enjoy the monstrous obstacles thrown in his way as it will cause pages to turn faster than Hermes on FTD's busiest day.<br /><br />OK, so I had some trouble with the pacing of the plot, choppy as the Aegean Sea at times, and also with the caricatured portrait of Percy's step-dad, Gabe, but these are trifling matters compared to the enjoyment even reluctant readers will find in this series.<br /><br />They'll love his sidekicks, Annabeth (Athena's own) and the satyr Grover and remain transfixed as Percy meets one monster and God after another.  It's like a Homecoming for the Olympians and their old tales of derring do (and don't) as we meet Medusa (and her bad hair day), the Furies (in their Plymouths), Procrustes (in his \\"bed\\" which rhymes with \\"dead\\"), Argus (who knows the eyes have it), Ares (battle-tested brute), Zeus (Big Man on Campus), Dionysus (always wining and complaining), Cerebrus (three dog night), Charon (a ferry good paddler), and Chiron (no horsing around).

B00004XPPK|4.0|Gilda (1946)<br />Directed: Charles Vidor, With: Rita Hayworth,, Glenn Ford,<br />  George Macready<br />A typical melodrama of the forties, with an unusual advantage: it had in it the sex goddess of the times, Rita Hayworth, then, at 27, reigning supreme, for no other female star could match her sexual bravado, beauty, if not talent. Talent, not for winning Oscars, but for subjecting an audience to a hypnotic state reserved only for celestial figures that became flesh. There are a couple of other factors that make this oldie still watchable and memorable. Glenn Ford, early in his career, gives a magnetic performance as her frustrated lover, who finally wins her, but who had to undergo the conflicts of loyalty to his boss and overcome his dislike for the type of women he thought his inamorata represented. And the final reason is George Macready himself. A polished villain, scarred on one cheek, wielding a cane with a stiletto in it, he is one of those villains Hollywood produced in the `40s and `50s--Basil Rathbone, George Sanders, James Mason, among others--that audiences loved to hate. He is corrupt and totally unscrupulous, running an illegal casino in Argentina, but fatally smitten by the charms of Hayworth, and insanely jealous.<br /><br />The mix is good, though the plot is murky. We don't quite know whether Macready is a megalomaniac Nazi and what the cartel he presides over really is, but we have the tension created among the three intensify as the movie progresses, and Hayworth's dancing and \\"singing\\" at the right moments add to the allure of this movie, semi-forgotten for its message (there is none) but reminding us what Hollywood had at its disposal women of the silver screen whose sex appeal (without much bare skin) has never been duplicated.<br /><br />Film category: film noir? But that does not matter either, for only the performances here are worth the watching. Don't try popcorn, or valium, while watching. Just sip some wine, if your predilections do not prohibit,
0316789798|5.0|I had this when I was growing up and wanted to share it with my toddler.  It is great because although he is too young to draw these things, he recognizes them in the book (and when I draw them) and we can make up our own stories together.  When he gets a better handle on drawing for himself, the book will grow into that role.  Yay!
B000B5Y00U|4.0|The main interest of this Traviata is of course the performance of  Montserrat Caballé. Caught in her youthful prime (1967) her sound   is utterly gorgeous from top to bottom. She negociates the colora-  tura of Act I with considerable ease and elsewhere her singing is  often exquisitely beautiful. She brings elegance and refinement to   the role but ultimately her style and manner are a bit too regal  and stately for Violetta. Carlo Bergonzi is likewise all elegance  and refinement but he brought more spirit to Alfredo on his earlier  recording with Sutherland. Sherrill Milnes also caught in his youth-  ful prime sings superbly but at this early stage of his carreer he  simply sounds too young for Germont. Georges Pretre has been harshly  criticised for his conducting but despite a few erratic passages he  is fine. The score is complete with second stanzas and cabalettas in-  cluded. In sum there are a lot of vocal delights on this set to enjoy  but the end result is somewhat unconvincing dramatically.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|I have always loved the older Springsteen music. I have missed his ballads,the E-Street band and the sounds they created together. The attempt is there, to recreate that 'magic'.  It comes through in a couple of songs. To me, the CD starts slowly but gains momentum.  I am happy with my purchase but had hoped to hear more raw and emotional performances, like I enjoyed listening to from the 'Boss' of old.

I hated the Golden Compass, and I would have thought that I would have liked it.  Personally, I don't think His Dark Materials are children's books.  The story lines are too adult.  I didn't mind the dig at religion.  I just thought the story was stupid, and didn't make sense.  There isn't an ending.  I won't be reading the other two books in the series.  I jumped ahead and read a few bits out of the next two books, but the story just didn't grab me.  Like the first, each of the other two books doesn't have an ending.  Very unsatisfying.

B00005JO5L|2.0|This was my first viewing of this film. Maybe I was expecting more, but I felt let down by the whole story line. Al Pacino does infact do very well in his part which seems to pull you into the film. Its a dark and depressing look at the overly stereotyped S&M and cruising scene in the 70's/80's. The shocking or disturbing murder scenes, with the exception of the first, are dull and lackluster. There was nothing disturbing about them. Bigger drawbacks were the overall gay scenes were not convincing enough. So much looked staged and rehearsed, specifically the cruising scenes in the woods or city. It felt like people were trying to hard to act the gay parts. The ending is a let down. The climax of the movie seemed to peter out in a film that should have ended 15 minutes ago. There are some good points to the film itself, but I cannot think of any at this time.

I want more novels like it and I cannot wait for Diane Setterfield to publish another novel.

159562015X|4.0|I've read through most of the traits and then took the test and discovered that my top five traits are about what I was expecting.  The test involves no math or reading exercises, just questions where you are asked to rate something on a scale from one to five.  Based on this information, the computer calculates your top five strength traits based on your personality.    I agree with the philosophy that we should accentuate our strengths instead of spending more time on our weaknesses.  This enables us to become more empowered and confindent hence adding to our happiness and well-being.  What I don't agree with the author on however was that \\"Rudy\\" wasted his time trying to play football.  How does he know that one of his strengths wasn't overcoming adversity?  This could have very well put Rudy into the \\"Achiever\\" category (like me).  There are a few other traits that Rudy could have been like \\"Competitor\\".  How do we know that just because a person struggles a great deal with something that his strength isn't \\"struggling\\"?  There is no such trait given in the book, but many of us are motivated by adversity.  That could very well be a strength trait in itself.    We shouldn't expect everything to come naturally and easily that we enjoy and all of the things we should be doing.  We also shouldn't always quit when things seem unreasonably difficult.  Case in point, Micheal Jordan did not make his high school basketball team after 2 or 3 tries.  Albert Einstein did not pass his college entrance exam the first time.  So before we give up at something because we seem to be struggling more than others, we should critically examine ourselves.  We should ask if we are just \\"spinning our wheels in the mud\\" or are we on the right path.  Reading this book and taking the test to discover your traits is definately not \\"spinning your wheels in the mud\\".

B000009ED0|4.0|Anyone writing a review of Kid Rock should understand his art at a basic level. To compare him to most other artists is to completely miss the point of his music. It's like comparing Evil Dead to Night of the Living Dead, or worse, Gone with the Wind. To start with, you must accept the Kid on his own terms. Try to understand first of all, that he's trying to create a cartoonish world, playing off of the cliches of hypermasculinity, the windblown life on the road, and the joys of drugs and loose women. Further, he creates a persona of jaw-droppingly egotistical and maniacally self-involved proportions. The results are very funny....not because they are bad necessarily....not like \\"Full House\\" funny....but rather because they take the cliches and revel shamelessly in them, glory unrepentantly in poor taste, amplifying it until it becomes an artform in and of itself. Cartoonish, and who doesn't like cartoons? Cartoons make us feel good, entertain us, and make us laugh. They are well crafted and, sometimes, even become classics. That, ladies and gentlemen, is Kid Rock in a nutshell. A well-crafted, unselfconscious, uniquely American cartoon.
B0007Y08PQ|2.0|I was very disappointed the first time I saw this movie in the theater...but upon further viewing on DVD, it wasn't that bad.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Recently watched four episodes after not seeing the series for at least 10 years. Caught lots more than I did in the past, probably due to increased life experience pointing up the principles involved in most work environments. Unless one is put off/confused by the series's Britishisms, this will function as classic comedy descended from the likes of The Honeymooners, Laurel & Hardy, & even Wodehouse. It's some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen, with something for everyone but anyone who might be offended by the treatment of the Manuel character, but hilarity tends to override such concerns. Potential demonstrated by Cleese in Monty Python comes to delightfully manic fruition. Cleese is often given a run for his money by Prunella Scales's deliciously pretentious, instantly recognizable character, embodying everything comforting, annoying, and amusing in what might in America be called the \\"upper working class.\\"  I think the seriously ill should watch this in concert with any prescribed medications - if nothing else, they'll go out laughing.
0142000655|4.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden covers two families interwoven histories from the American Civil War to WWI. Most of the characters and events represent Biblical characters and events pretty overtly. One Biblical and philosophical theme constantly grappled with is the eternal question of good and evil. Steinbeck's answer to whether humans are destined to a life of good or evil is with a Hebrew word in the Bible: Timshel!, literally translating to 'thou mayest.'  While the characters appear to be inherently good or bad, they are not that simple. As Steinbeck attempts to prove, humans dictate their actions.<br /><br />At times East of Eden is jumpy and a mumble jumble of references and tangents. Yet Steinbeck's ability to cover the behemoth topic with pretty direct writing is impressive, and more than makes up for the wild tangential passages. After reading a brief synopsis of Steinbeck's personal biography, I see much of Steinbeck and his family comes alive in the characters. Steinbeck succeeded in covering an immense range of issues loosely following his own family history, and still maintaining his central thesis. Even though the first hundred pages are slow, I recommend this book, even to those with a lay knowledge of Genesis. Keep pressing through and enjoy Steinbeck's enlightening work and imaginative characters.

I had read the reviews on Amazon and decided to take a chance on these headphones. I'm happy I did. The output on these headphones is fantastic and they are comfortable to wear.

0786838655|1.0|Riordan should keep his ideas about the inferiority of women out of his books. The formula of fantasy derring-do can be done excellently without dumbing it done or treating woman as inferiors, humiliating people in general or belittling women. The derision of women in these novels disrupts the story. The many derisive references to fools and such nullifies any mechanism of developing a \\"bad\\" character and lessens almost all of the characters. Riordan lacked the imagination to create a world without incorporating nasty attitudes that should have died an undignified death by now.<br /><br />Many of Riordan's phrases are like ice water in the face and paraphrasing from other better books is shameless. Bah, garbage.<br /><br />This was the first work by Riordan I read. Disbelieving what I read, I got the second novel to make sure the first wasn't an anomaly. Riordan gets no more of my money. One can find better fantasy from authors like Dahl, Grahame, Hiassen, Lewis, Rawn, or Lackey.
0393324818|5.0|Moneyball made me more interested in baseball. Part of the reason I hadn't appreciated baseball was due to the fact that it always seemed like big market teams can buy championships. While that still remains true to a point, this book sheds light on what it takes to win baseball games, and that the statistics historically used aren't necessarily indicative of the value of a player. There are lots of lessons to be learned, but the book itself is an entertaining read. If you are a fan of business, value, statistics, or baseball, I can't recommend this book enough.     Also, if you are reading this review, you should read Michael's masterpiece, Liars Poker.
B000ROALCG|5.0|Being a Salsa afficionado, I know I am going to catch heat for this but I think that Marc did the songs better than Lavoe. The movie wasn't all it was cracked up to be but the soundtrack is awesome. I really can't stand Lavoe's voice, but I have always admired his improvisation skills, which were legendary. He should've been called \\"El Sonero de los Soneros\\" instead of El Cantante. Marc is the true el cantate because he really can sing and has a beautiful tenor voice. He's one of the best selling, if not the best selling salsero of all time. So give or take, I say they pretty much even out. If Marc were to improvise like Lavoe, He would've crushed him. Marc has star power unlike anyone and a charisma which rivals Lavoe. Plus Marc is not trying to imitate anyone, I wouldn't want him to imitate Lavoe.<br /><br />Honestly, I rather listen to Domingo Qui&ntilde;ones or Victor Manuelle than Lavoe because they can both SING and Improvise, and of course El Cano who can battle with anyone, probably the best out there besides Domingo right now. And for all of those who think everyone over 40 doesn't have a right to opinionate, or think everyone over 40 has Lavoe on a pedestal, You've been proven wrong. He did alot for salsa, but I don't consider him the best.<br /><br />5 stars Marc...you are the best. And Yes..i Love the Nelly Furtado penned \\"Toma De Mi\\", One of the best songs J.Lo has sang.

B000Y44LBG|4.0|This movie starts a little slow than picks up about midway to a fairly rapid end.  Though not quite as good as Serpico, it is a good film nevertheless.  Denzel Washington as Frank, the protege of the mob boss who ran Harlem.  Frank learned everything from him such as keeping a low profile away from his business and being good to the neighborhood.  Frank seems to elude all the police scrutiny until an organized crime unit in New Jersey headed by Russell Crowe (Ritchie) realizes that Frank must be someone important.  This notion starts the night of the Ali-Frazier fight, where Frank has virtually a front-row seat and is several rows in front of several important mob guys.    What is interesting is the dicotomy between Frank and Ritchie; Frank has a lavish Thanksgiving with a lot of family, while Ritchie spends his alone making a sandwich of Turkey and potato chips.  Frank has Miss Puerto Rico as a wife that stays by his side throughout while Ritchie is going through a drawn out custody battle with his wife.    The two don't actually meet until near the end of the film.  Though their interaction if brief, it is powerful nonetheless.
0307387178|4.0|My wife picked this up for me yesterday, I read it in about 3 hours.  I hadn't really heard much about the story, but I was aware of the movie.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book.  I found it easy to relate to the main character (Chris).  If you're the kind of person who likes to ponder the meaning of life and the evils of society when you're hiking/biking/camping out in the woods by yourself, then you'll probably like the book too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Would have given it a 5 if it had a bit more suspense.
B000VBP382|5.0|I don't know if I'll every truly know why, but I absolutely LOVE this movie.<br /><br />It's not as brilliant as `Sense and Sensibility' (mostly because it lacks the splendor that is Kate Winslet) but `Pride and Prejudice' is a perfect family film that builds off its subject to create a beautifully crafted masterpiece.  The performances match the surroundings and the direction by newcomer Joe Wright is astoundingly accurate and beautiful to look at.  Keira Knightley rightfully earned that Oscar nomination, for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is the best by far of anyone attempting at the coveted role.  The fact remains that `Pride and Prejudice' has been done and redone and supposedly mastered by BBC (and Colin Firth) in 1995.  While that is the case this beautiful reimagining of the classic Austen novel is, in my humble opinion, the best film adaptation, by far.<br /><br />The film, aside from being splendidly acted, is above and beyond a beauty to look at.  Each frame is astounding in its visual flare.  The camera pans out over the surroundings with beautiful precision.  Just watch the fog scene with Darcy and know that a picture speaks a thousand words.  It's graceful and mesmerizing.<br /><br />The film follows the love affair (or lack there of) between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, a pair made in Hollywood heaven.  She's strong-willed and opinionated as is he and they seem to butt-heads more than steal hearts but in the end there is no denying they are perfect for one another.  What makes this movie so brilliant is that it is in affect the catalysts for almost every other love story out there for these two characters seem to pop up in almost every teen film produced as of late.

Watching Keira chew up the scenery is orgasmic for me, especially when you think that this is the same girl who fights pirates and hunts criminals.

B000I0RR7Q|5.0|It is beyond dispute that Casablanca is the greatest movie ever made. (The movie 'Man Conquers Space' may come close.) This is a movie that you do more than watch. This is a movie to be studied.<br /><br />I also have the standard definition colorized version that I enjoy and recommend.<br /><br />Who is the Ingrid Bergman of today? No actress today is as beautiful. They say that men fell in love with her at first sight, I believe it.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|I may be one of the few people who found `Dead Poets Society' ridiculously clich&eacute;d and ultimately unfulfilling.  Yes I understand that just about everyone and their mother loves that movie but I just couldn't see where the draw was.  `Mona Lisa Smile' is pretty much the all girl affiliate to `Dead Poets Society'.  You have a liberal teacher who is nothing like the tightwads that walk the school.  This time around the subject is art as apposed to poetry which is a form of art in itself.  In fact it's pretty much the same recycled experience except for one strange development.  This time it seems to work.  Not brilliantly, but `Mona Lisa Smile' is by all means a `good' film but far from a `great' one.  It captures the attention of the audience and handles some heavy matters with care and diligence, but it fails to elevate itself to perfection.<br /><br />A big reason why this film works is the fact that its star, Julia Roberts, can make just about anything palatable.  Her performance is just what this film needed to make it entertaining and relevant.  Sure, this is far from her best start turn, but it is classic Roberts and it delivers on all fronts.  She's smart, commanding, witty and charming.<br /><br />Roberts plays Katherine Watson, the newest addition to an all girl's college.  She immediately realizes that she is outnumbered in thought and tradition and is forced to face the fact that her presence is not truly appreciated by the staff and most of the students.  Taking place in 1953 the idea of college graduate is merely for title, not for application.  The idea that a woman would excel to be something more than a common housewife is ludicrous to these women and far from encouraged, it is shamefully discouraged.  Katherine Watson is a different bird altogether though.  She ruffles feathers as she pushes forward in encouraging her students to break away from the domineering brainwashing of society and think for themselves, think about what would make them happiest.<br /><br />Her students range from the sweet natured overachiever to the shy and reserved `fat girl' to the misunderstood `loose girl' to the even more misunderstood aggressively heartless brat.  By the end of the film revelations have taken place for all of these girls and their lives are forever changed.  Julia Stiles plays Joan, the overachiever who dreams of being a lawyer yet is soon to be married.  In all due respects Julia is supposed to be our star next to the `other' Julia, but Stiles manages to get pushed to the background by her co-stars.  While her performance is decent the other three girls steel all of her thunder.  Kirsten Dunst is the epitome of evil as Betty Warren, and while this is far from her finest performance she is definitely effective.  The two standouts though are none other than Ginnifer Goodwin and Maggie Gyllenhall.  Their performances are layered and emotional and moving, and delivered with such perfection it's no wonder their careers are taking off.<br /><br />The supporting performances by the likes of Marcia Gay Harden and Dominic West are effective in their own rights and take nothing away from the film, albeit not really adding anything either.<br /><br />In the end `Mona Lisa Smile' is a sweet film that will touch the heart and satisfy the viewer.  It's not the type of film that moves mountains or changes lives and it's not a film that will stick with you forever but it will not leave you cold or distant.  It's good entertainment, but just don't expect it to be a masterpiece.  It is a bit clich&eacute;d and it is a bit generic.  We can all guess the ending before it comes and the revelations that face each girl are the furthest thing from original.  Like I said, this is recycling at it's best for it takes the same old thing and regurgitates it with different actors and a slightly altered setting yet it works slightly better than the original so bravo in that regard.dents range from the sweet natured overachiever to the shy and reserved `fat girl' to the misunderstood `loose girl' to the even more misunderstood aggressively heartless brat.

B000MXPE7O|3.0|I tried my hardest to fall in love with Robert De Niro's \\"The Good Shepherd.\\"  All the elements were there for a great film - fantastic material (the birth of the CIA and the Cold War), great cast, and more-than-ample budget.  Unfortunately, the total is far less than the sum of its parts - and far more tedious.    Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, privileged Yale undergraduate who gets inducted into America's least-secret secret society, Skull and Bones.  Given this access to privilege, Wilson receives a unique opportunity - to get in on the ground floor of America's new secret service, the OSS (the forerunner of the CIA).  Over the next few decades, Wilson will play a key part in the evolution of the Cold War.    This should be exciting stuff.  Terrific authors have had loads of fun with the very same material - John Le Carre, Robert Littell, James Ellroy - and their novels are riveting page-turners.  Thanks in large part to Damon's depiction of Wilson as an extremely cold fish, \\"The Good Shepherd\\" is largely an exercise in exposition and tedium.  Events transpire, characters grow old or die young, and bitterness and recrimination stalk the land.  Sometimes that works in a movie - this is not such an occasion.    Put \\"The Good Shepherd\\" on the shelf with the Great Missed Opportunities of recent years - movies that should have been terrific and yet failed to live up to expectations.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I don't know if I'll every truly know why, but I absolutely LOVE this movie.<br /><br />It's not as brilliant as `Sense and Sensibility' (mostly because it lacks the splendor that is Kate Winslet) but `Pride and Prejudice' is a perfect family film that builds off its subject to create a beautifully crafted masterpiece.  The performances match the surroundings and the direction by newcomer Joe Wright is astoundingly accurate and beautiful to look at.  Keira Knightley rightfully earned that Oscar nomination, for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is the best by far of anyone attempting at the coveted role.  The fact remains that `Pride and Prejudice' has been done and redone and supposedly mastered by BBC (and Colin Firth) in 1995.  While that is the case this beautiful reimagining of the classic Austen novel is, in my humble opinion, the best film adaptation, by far.<br /><br />The film, aside from being splendidly acted, is above and beyond a beauty to look at.  Each frame is astounding in its visual flare.  The camera pans out over the surroundings with beautiful precision.  Just watch the fog scene with Darcy and know that a picture speaks a thousand words.

B000BTJDG2|4.0|Perhaps it's unfair to compare \\"Emily Rose\\" to \\"The Exorcist.\\" One is a horror movie, the other is more court drama. But in another sense, the goal of both movies is the same. The author of \\"The Exorcist\\" has been quoted as saying that through \\"The Exorcist\\" he hoped to awaken in people belief in God, through belief in the devil. If, as the Bible says, fear of the Lord represents the beginning of wisdom, then perhaps the fear of the devil represents the beginning of the beginning of wisdom. And, in fact, the agnostic lawyer (in \\"Emily Rose\\") says as much.    So which movie is more successful at achieving its goal? The answer to that question depends on the viewer. To paraphrase an old philosophical principle, one can only receive what he is able to receive. For those who are attracted to the horror genre, \\"The Exorcist\\" is the obvious choice. \\"The Exorcist\\" is effective on a gut level and, overall, is a superior movie. That's no slight to \\"Emily Rose,\\" since I would rank \\"The Exorcist\\" as one of the ten or twenty most influential movies in American movie history.    \\"Rose\\" takes a more cerebral approach to the phenomenon of possession, and is noteworthy for its fair presentation of both sides of the possession argument. While it's fairly obvious where the movie-makers' sympathies lie, the writers employ a Thomistic even-handedness in presenting the most persuasive Rationalist arguments against demonic possession. The movie doesn't duck any difficult arguments, and it doesn't ram its viewpoint down anyone's throat either. So the movie should be accessible to athiests, theists and agnostics alike, and a great starting point for discussion.    I give especially high marks to movie-makers for the careful explication of Church teaching, and for the following memorable line. Paraphrasing: \\"Some people believe that what we see is all that is. Other people believe that the world around us is guided by supernatural entities. Both beliefs can't be true, but one of them must be true. And both beliefs are chilling.\\"    Yes they are. Yet most of us try to live somewhere in the middle.    Revelation 3:15-16  \\"I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm--neither hot nor cold--I am about to vomit you out of my mouth.\\"    Something for us all to think about.
B00005JNTX|5.0|`Sin City' is a film you will either love or hate.  There is a lot going on and sometimes it gets hard to figure out who is doing what but if you slip into the mode that is `Sin City' is will all put itself together for you.  You just have to want to `get' this movie.  I wanted to `get' this movie, and you know what, I did, and with each and every watch through I `get' it even more.  The fact remains that Sin City is above and beyond brilliant film making.  It's visually stunning and completely captures the imagery that Frank Miller created with his graphic novels.  It's dark, gritty and aggressive; violent and seductive.  `Sin City' is an amalgam of everything that makes `sin' in general so grotesque.  In other words, it's the dark underbelly of a life all too often glamorized.<br /><br />`Sin City' takes three stories from the `Sin City' alumni and interweaves them throughout one another to create the appearance of one long story.  The three stories used (`The Hard Good-Bye', `The Big Fat Kill' & `That Yellow B*****') all feature some strong if not flawed characters that have a habit of making some very poor decisions.  What is strange though is that we form attachments to these characters despite their behavior and we find ourselves rooting for them in the long run.  You see, despite their flaws and transgressions they are victims themselves and warrant our support.<br /><br />The acting is spot on for the type of film that this is.  I've heard some friends talking about the cheesy dialog and the wooden acting but what they fail to realize is that this is a comic book adaptation and it takes that very literally.  Robert Rodriguez brilliantly crafted a world that is so similar to the one Miller created frame for frame it feels like reading a comic, like peering into Miller's graphic novels.  The acting thus corresponds with this vision.  The dialog is at times even word for word from the books, and the way the characters respond and or interact is classic comic exaggeration.  It all comes together to create the perfect backdrop for the film.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and especially Mickey Rourke nail their performances, adding depth to the film as a whole.  Jessica Alba actually pulls out her finest performance to date (who would have guessed it) and made me proud, and I think she's nothing more than a hard body so she took me by surprise.  Elijah Wood is effectively creepy, something I didn't think he had in him, and his character stayed with me long after the credits were rolled.  As a whole the performances are strong and are all memorable, Benicio Del Toro and Rosario Dawson coming to mind as key supporting players who make an impact.<br /><br />Yes, there are flaws to be found within `Sin City' but to me they are few and far in between.  I love what Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino were able to accomplish here and I eagerly await their efforts with `Sin City 2'.  If they are even half as successful with the second act I will be a happy man.  So just sit back and absorb the imagery for even if `Sin City' is not you cup of tea you can't help but admire the art that is set before you with each passing frame.aggeration.

0596527055|5.0|The Myths of Innovation by Scott Berkun is not a book about famous innovation fables - although there is some debunking going on in the book. No, Myths of Innovation looks at several commonly held beliefs and attempts to provide a social, historical and economic analysis of the \\"myth\\" and then consider what's true, and what's not true, about that commonly held belief. Berkun looks at innovation myths such as:<br /><br />  * Epiphanies - do ideas spring up from the \\"whole cloth\\"?<br />  * Innovation methods<br />  * Whether or not people love new ideas<br />  * The myth of the \\"lone inventor\\"<br />  * Whether or not the \\"best\\" ideas win<br /><br />There are plenty of commonly held beliefs or myths around innovation, which Berkun does a great job investigating. What's great about his book is that it is not advocating for or against innovation, but putting innovation in a context. He simultaneously demonstrates that innovation is simpler and less complex than we believe, and often more complex and difficult than we believe. His book is less a \\"how to innovate\\" book and more of a social commentary on innovation from an interested observer's point of view. He mixes a lot of history and commentary in the discussion of each myth.<br /><br />After all, anyone who can include the famous Lloyd Dobler quote : \\"<br /><br />  I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed.<br /><br />has got to have the confidence of his material while retaining a tongue planted firmly in cheek.<br /><br />This was probably one of the most interesting books I've read about innovation in quite a while. There's no story, no plot and very little \\"how to\\" in the book - more a historical and social commentary on innovation over time. Myths of Innovation reminds me of some of the \\"popular\\" history books by authors like Stephen Ambrose, who point out all of the economic, technological and societal factors that shape important technologies or events. However, Berkun writes with a style more in line with Berkeley Breathed than Herodotus.<br /><br />This is a great book if you are interested in innovation and want to learn more about the commonly held beliefs and how to overcome them. It is also an interesting commentary on innovation from a societal and historical point of view, and keeps a very sardonic undertone - almost as if innovation were a politician who needed to be taken down a few pegs. A few reviewers have argued there's nothing \\"new\\" in the book - but that's just the point. Apple didn't invent the MP3 player - they recognized a number of technologies that needed some packaging to create a great consumer application. Likewise Berkun didn't create innovation methodologies and doesn't advocate for them - he just points out some of the \\"emperor's clothes\\" issues about innovation given real world examples that we are already familiar with - it's not the individual concepts that are important, but the commentary and perspective.<br /><br />Reposted from my Innovate on Purpose blog site reviewt all of the economic, technological and societal factors that shape important technologies or events.

B000UNYJV8|3.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers that this is the most accurate portrayal of the skinhead cult to date, but considering the other \\"skinhead\\" movies, that's not saying much. I was heartened to see that most of the skins in this movie were trads - those who do not subscribe to the racist/nationalist rubbish of the NF and other hate groups. However, I think that many who are trad skins or former trad skins have been blinded by the fact that this movie portrays some skins in a positive light. It's such a refreshing novelty that it may lead one to ignore all the shortcomings of the film. If you take the skinhead equation out of it and just look at this as a film - pretend all the characters are just \\"ordinary kids\\" not affiliated with any controversial youth cult - it's hard to argue that it doesn't come up short. The plot is thin and, other than the main character, Shaun, so is the character development. Woody, probably the most important living character in the film, basically drops out of the picture once Combo arrives on the scene. The whole thing is a bit amateurish and undeveloped. It's as if the novelty of making an honest film about skinheads allowed so many other blanks to be left unfilled.
B00005JPS9|4.0|Beowulf is a great looking animated 3-D epic adventure that plays a little too much like Excalibur or any other King Arthur tale. Still the voice acting is well done espcially the work of Ray Winstone (The Departed). Plus some critics are saying the animation isn't perfected yet but I totally disagree. I myself forgot a few times that I wasn't actually watching a live action movie. The movie also offers some breathtaking action that also makes Beowulf worth seeing even if the ending didn't work entirely for me.
061891868X|4.0|In his 2006 book, \\"The Trouble with Physics,\\" Prof. Lee Smolin of the University of Waterloo proposes to plow up the previous 30 years of theoretical physics and reseed the ground. He claims that string theory and other adventures following the 1973 standard model of particles failed to make progress solving underlying problems. Smolin proposes five unsolved problems.    While Smolin would have readers think his views are radical, actually they are timid. Problems he poses are grand issues of philosophy. Solutions to them whould have no practical uses. Smolin continues a tradition of three generations of theoretical physicists who, unable to solve problems of practical importance, decamp to remote quarters where they hope to apply skills they already possess rather than develop new ones.    A genuinely radical approach would roll back the previous 80 years of theoretical physics, returning to the many unsolved problems of quantum mechanics from the late 1920s and developing a theory that reliably predicts from first principles commonly needed properties of matter that agree with practical measurements, including: (1) full electromagnetic emission and absorption spectra of any atom or small molecule at any ionization state, (2) collision cross-section between electrons and any atom or small molecule, (3) collision cross-sections between any atoms and small molecules, (4) structure and interaction of complex molecules, (5) structure of single-crystal solids, (6) full energy and decay spectrum of any atomic nucleus, (7) collision cross-section between free neutrons and any atomic nucleus.    There are several other such problems. A successful theory will require only four or five natural constants for scale, electromagnetism and nuclear forces and might not involve any knowledge of particle structure. A theory that solves these problems will be of signal interest for materials development, industrial chemistry, molecular biology and many other applications.
0316067598|3.0|As a combat marine vet of Vietnam, I have nothing but the highest respect for the Navy SEALS.  Their training is the most challenging of any of the special forces, and the recon operations they perform are among the most dangerous of any military in the world.  Having said that, I found the book to be poorly written and a vehicle for Marcus Lattrell to disparage the media and all Americans who may be supportive of our troops, but opposed to the war.  I understand firsthand the military's \\"need\\" to portray any enemy as less than human, but Mr. Lattrell comes across, in my opinion, with a closed mind in his attitude towards others with a different religious background and culture.  I cannot imagine the horror he faced, and I applaud him for sharing his story, but the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are far more complicated than he would have us believe.  I appreciate the story, and his SEAL team's sacrifice, but it left me wishing for more balance and less liberal ranting.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|This is worth every penny. The remastering sounds nice, on both the Joshua Tree and B-sides disc.. It's finally nice to have a great sounding version of \\"Deep In The Heart.\\"    The Bonus DVD disc is where it's at though. You get a concert and a mini tour diary/documentary that totally sheds another light on the Joshua Tree era U2. If you weren't a serious fan in 87 you more than likely assumed, from what you saw of them, that U2 took themselves too seriously and weren't really fun at all.     The concert shows U2 in a different light than how Rattle and Hum showed them on film. The mini tour documentary shows them having fun, and seeing this now is so wonderful.     This was a wonderful package and hopefully older albums will be remastered and presented in this manner as well. I sure hope the WAR album is next!

159102594X|3.0|In `The Blade Itself', Mr. Abercrombie has created elements of something potentially masterful.<br /><br />I need go no further for evidence than the character of Sand dan Glokta, who is probably the most intriguing character in the genre today, and easily in the top ten most intriguing characters in the genre, period.<br /><br />Characterization is Mr. Abercrombie's masterstroke in this work.  There are no two-dimensional characters here.  Not only are their respective backgrounds their own, because Mr. Abercrombie writes from multiple POVs, so too is each of their voices.  Each has their own sense of humor - notably, they do not all have Mr. Abercrombie's sense of humor - their own levels of intelligence, and their own motivations.<br /><br />Logan Ninefingers is also an especially intriguing character.  Not as complicated as Glokta, he is nevertheless immediately likeable.  His, \\"You've got to be realistic\\" catchphrase should become a classic by the time the series is done.  Ostensibly, he is a northern barbarian - but few authors write northern barbarian characters without beating you over the head with their barbarian-ness.  There is beautiful humor when Logan goes south with Bayaz - into the city - and dresses up in a barbarian costume because that's the clich&eacute; look southerners expect to see in barbarian fashion.<br /><br />A character that Mr. Abercrombie must (hopefully) have much in store for is Jezal dan Luthar.  We finally get to see the POV of one of those sniveling arrogant young nobles we hate in all the other fantasy novels.  I say Mr. Abercrombie must have plans for this character because, so far, there's nothing enjoyable or redeeming about him at all.  By witnessing the other characters, I know the author can make any character seem relatable - but for reasons of his own choosing, that doesn't happen to Jezal in this book.  While there is (again) probably reason for this over the course of the trilogy, the chapters that focus on Jezal in this book were, for me, a slog to get through.<br /><br />The Bayaz character, finally, is also difficult to pin down.  Unlike the others, which are humble in their uniqueness, I found Bayaz simply over-the-top.  Where Jezal hints at something more enjoyable in later books, Bayaz just seems a bore.  No, he's not a typical sage-advisor-wizard like Gandalf or Obi-Wan Kenobi, but he is a typical crotchety town drunk / sage-advisor.  He is, in my opinion, the least successful of Mr. Abercrombie's many successful characters.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book's weakness is in its plot.  A trade off typically acknowledged in books that have superb characterization is that the plot is supposed to suffer.  I remember criticisms of the first X-man movie saying that focus couldn't be applied to plot because so many characters were being introduced.  Maybe that's the case here, but I've also read Pride and Prejudice, The Count of Monte Christo, and other books that don't allow me to buy the argument that characterization comes only at the expense of plot.  Of course, I'll give the author credit in that he's got a great many great characters to create...<br /><br />Still.  The plot is slow.  The `contest' storyline is not inspiring - especially once it's over.  Kudos to Mr. Abercrombie's courage which is, by itself, entertaining - he practically dares the reader to resent being led down a goose chase of a tale.  Well, this reader does.  Sadly, I cannot credit to this review what Mr. Abercrombie may do with what happened in later books, but it robbed this book of consequence.<br /><br />At the end of the day, little actually happens.  We're set up for what I expect will be an exhilarating trilogy - I've already finished the second book and have pre-ordered the UK release of the third - but if I must rate this one book on its own merits, I must give it three stars, if only to leave room to show improvement in the next two.  I believe superb characterization is insufficient to carry theday for a standalone piece, and even one installment of a trilogy must contain within its own bindings a superb tale to rate higher.st contain within its own bindings a superb tale to rate higher.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|November 20, 2007, marks the release date of The Song Remains The Same 2-disc DVD package from Warner Home Video, an upgraded and updated version of the the 1976 Led Zeppelin movie centered on Zeppelin concerts at Madison Square Garden on July 27, 28 and 29, 1973. While the movie itself (Disc One) has not been visually re-edited due to legal restrictions, the 2007 re-release offers several never before seen or heard features: a superbly re-mixed and re-mastered soundtrack (including Dolby 5.1) and (Disc Two) four songs missing from the movie that round out the complete Led Zeppelin 1973 Madison Square Garden set: \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" (previously unreleased); \\"Celebration Day\\" (cutting copy - previously unreleased); \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\"; and \\"The Ocean.\\"<br />Disc Two also includes news venue footage and the band's Tampa, Florida, airport arrival for the 1973 concert at Tampa Stadium; a vintage BBC interview with Robert Plant and Peter Grant (Led Zeppelin's manager, the movie's Executive Producer, and an actor in the movie); a vintage interview with Peter Grant regarding the robbery that took place during Led Zeppelin's stay at the Drake Hotel in NYC in 1973 in which almost $200,000 of the group's touring pay went missing from the hotel's safe - a still unsolved mystery; the original theatrical trailer; and a 1976 radio profile spotlight by Cameron Crowe,(who also wrote the liner notes)  Recommending this reissue With it's cheap t-shirt and bits of paper goodies is not a problem for me. If it was a zep fart in a bag I'd buy it. That's because I'm a collector!
B000XPU5NY|5.0|For those of us who missed the opportunity to see Genesis in 2007, we thankfully have this excellent live recording of the European tour.  The song mix is excellent, with a real good representation of both classic Genesis and the pop stuff.  The music is noticably keyed lower, to accomodate Phil's aging voice box, but is excellent on all counts.  The sound quality of the recording is also impecable, and the whole package is nothing less than we'd expect from a top flight band like Genesis.  My hope is that the boys will see that the demand is still there for their brand of music, and hopefully we'll see a studio album from them in the future.  5 stars!

0679720200|1.0|I was required to read this book for my english class. The only books we ever read are depressing, sad and pointless. If you want to conteplate how pointless life is and whether it is worth it for you to be alive right now breathing and wasting air, then this book is perfect for you. I don't know how it can be hailed as fantastic when the english level is quite low and meaningless. It doesn't make you contemplate the mysteries of life, it just makes you feel more sad and depressed, like our lives aren't. If you don't want to be cornered into an idea of contemplating suicide, then please do not read this book.
B000BHHCXU|5.0|I read this book twice and intend to read it again.  The first time was when I was 10.  It, along with Tobacco Road (Erskine Caldwell) was forbidden me as unfit literature for children (my mother was an avid reader, but she protected my childhood as long as she dared) so naturally, it became my goal to find where she had hidden them, and read both, which I did, having wasted nearly all of one summer looking for them.  Finding them buried deep beneath some old clothes in her large Cedar chest, I curled up on the old sofa beneath the sunny kitchen window where the yellow June blooming roses were alive and vocal with the buzzing of bees, eagerly opened the pages and began to read........    This book, obviously, parallels the story of Caine and Abel in many mortal ways.  It's an incredible tale of betrayal, that I understand had roots in truth, woven around the totally depraved character of one woman, who, though amply endowed with charm, intelligence and ambition, it's but an outward veneer, and she is without the things that make such a person whole - conscience, loyalty, mother love, or any other human emotion that separates us from the primitive - and gets what she wants by using others. Killing someone is not something she worries much about.    This woman, taken in by the Trask brothers after being found nearly beaten to death on their doorstep, marries one, beds the other and bears two boys who are by the brother not married to - twins - just before she leaves the good man who thinks he is their father - from her childbed, without a backward look.   The story gets better and more incredulous with each passing page.  You are given insight into any number of human conditions, characters, motivations, and finally, betrayal of yet another trust between brothers.    It's one of Steinbeck's best works.  He is a master of the written word - one who can pull you into the story even if you come from a different world than the one you are in as his fascinated reader - andask you to feel it move you all the way there and back.   There are these others by Steinbeck that number among my favorite reads and grace my personal library:    \\"Grapes of Wrath\\"  \\"Cannery Row\\"  \\"The Red Pony\\" which is an unusual story about a young boy and his horse - of a love lost, but with responsibility and maturity painfully gained - book from my youth, but which is much more than a child's story.

0316067598|5.0|As one whom has studied military history for the better part of my adult life, I must say I have not read an account like this before.  The account of the battle scenes are amazing.  I actually enjoyed the humor he put in there such as \\"okay Marcus, here is where you make your last stand\\" or \\"and my rifle was right next to me.\\"  People whom dislike this book may not appreciate the absolute ego that is a warrior. To get to this point as a SEAL is quite an accomplishment. He is proud, arrogant and boastful, so are a lot of great athletes but what good have they done for the world. Marcus should be credited for his devotion to his comrades, his sense of honor and his fair treatment of the Afghan people.  Yes he is political but when you have bullets flying over your head and your hands tied, I think Marcus earned the right to speak out.    A fast read told in a relaxing style.  I have come to the conclusion that I would rather have guys like Marcus and his SEAL team as my friends than  enemies.  He does a great service to the lives of those who died.  I can tell that he needed to tell this story.      RIP members of SEAL team 10
B000W1V5VU|4.0|These Oceans Flix are just fun to watch & keep me entertained. I enjoyed it. Clooney & Pitt again make the film. They are the personification of modern Hollywood style & pizzaz. Al Pacino & Andy Garcia were great. Its Fun to watch, There are always neat twists & turns throughout. I love Las Vegas & was glad to see a lot of the pic set there. Check it out!
0143036556|5.0|This book reminded me of my college days, of those classes taught by a Professor with a wealth of experiences, who could transfer this considerable information without it becoming tedious and dull.  Jared Diamond has followed up Guns, Germs, and Steel with another book explaining the Collapse of past civilizations.  One surprising thing I learned from this book is that environmental catastrophe is hardly a new phenomenon, and has happened as far back in history as over 1,000 years ago.     Diamond cites various historical case studies to explain how and why various past civilizations died out.  Of course, with Global Warming making headlines more and more often, these case studies have a lot to say and what might happen in the not too distant future.  If there's anyplace the book comes up short, Diamond really doesn't come to any real conclusions regarding public policy, and simply concludes with a guarded optimism.  Given his skill of describing numerous past societies in good detail in an engaging way, I was hoping for a more memorable ending to the book.
0451205766|5.0|Was curious by the reviews \\"Not as good as Movie\\". This intrigued me since one usually hears the opposite. I have the feeling these reviews were by people that do not read. They decided to read the book only because they enjoyed the movie.    Personally, I felt like I was watching the movie as I read. The movie was excellently done because the story is so well written. Any fan of the movie should appreciate the extra detail on characters left out in the movies. Some small characters in the movie (at least small screen time) are revealed to be much more important with the extra detail in the book.    I can now re-watch the movie with a different perspective and appreciate it even more so.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|It's been a long time since I got a CD I wanted to play more than once a day. A CD like that has to be solid (no bad songs or filler), be daring in concept and execution, and of course have a certin indescribable appeal. Not many come a long like that.    Britney's Blackout gets it. She comes out of the box and onto track one \\"Gimme More\\" in pretty stunning fashion with some strong words to begin with and then with an even stronger song. Track two \\"Piece of Me\\" gives us a glimpse of what it's like to be her in a format its hard not to sing along with.  As much crap as Britney's had to take from the media, I did so want her to fire back hard and in these first two tracks gratify that desire. After that on the remaining tracks she goes to work with consistantly strong work--each song a very very good one. It's hard to pick favorites but I'd guess mine would be Gimme More, Heaven on Earth, Get Naked, Hot as Ice, Ooh Ooh Baby.    This is an outstanding comeback for a major artist at a juncture where most others would fail. Britney is not just a passing phase--she's here to stay and it looks like in a big big way.
B000PA9Q6E|5.0|I'm a huge Muddy Waters fan and this is one of my favorites. The disc and case were in excellent condition and it was exactly in the condition that it said it would be.    It arrived before the scheduled date which made it even better.

The other tracks are just as good, and it's worth an entire listen through!<br /><br />This BSB album goes right on top with the others, along with Never Gone!And it goes to show you that the Boys are here to stay!<br /><br />And Kevin will surely be missed, condolencies to him! :)

1591391105|2.0|I was unable to finish this book because of how bland and boring it was.  I expected to get some good general information about becoming a leader, but it is so specific about moving to a new leadership position from a previous leadership position that little of it was useful.  It reminded me of trying to read my old high school textbooks.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I am a middle-aged doctor working in a US county system and I found myself clapping out loud at points during this movie.  Our health care system is incredibly sick, built on money and greed, and Michael Moore points this out very effectively in this documentary.  Every day at work I experience things that make no sense at all (for example, filling out forms to get \\"prior authorization\\" for medications my patients sorely need, or trying to explain to patients that they don't have the right benefits to get what they need to effectively treat their illness), and I felt this movie really captured this craziness well.<br />Could the movie have been more \\"balanced\\" by showing some of the deficits in socialized medicine...why, yes, it could have.<br />Did this documentary capture, in a witty fashion, the absolute crazy horror of people suffering miserably and losing lives because of our greedy,money-driven health care system...Yes!!!
B000WMEAKC|4.0|MySpace phenoms OneRepublic give it their all on their Interscope release `Dreaming Out Loud.' The LA-based band, which was introduced to the general public by Timbaland through his remix of the band's hit single \\"Apologize,\\" succeeds in proving they are much more than a novelty act.    OneRepublic kick off their debut major release with the U2-sounding \\"Say (All I Need),\\" which boasts a big-budget production value and lead singer Ryan Tedder displays his falsetto better than anyone in recent memory. The most emotional song on `Loud' is without question \\"Come Home,\\" as Tedder tells the story of  relationships, focusing on one between himself and the one he loves. But the underlying message is transferable to almost any situation in which the struggle for love to win the battle is present.    Besides the two versions of \\"Apologize,\\" which are lyrical and production masterpieces, `Loud' includes a slew of worthy follow-up singles like \\"All We Are,\\" \\"Prodigal,\\" \\"Mercy,\\" and most notably second single \\"Stop & Stare.\\" What makes these tracks rise above other bands' works are without question the lyrics. Almost anyone who has an alright voice and can play piano can produce something that sounds good, but if the lyrics don't mesh, the result is something underwhelming. OneRepublic's promotion of solid values and ability to focus on positive subjects help them connect with the listener and sets them apart from other bands that are big at the moment.    OneRepublic show an edgier side in tracks like the up-tempo \\"Tyrant\\" and the riotous \\"Someone to Save You,\\" but they still retain the positive message present in the album's previous tracks. In \\"You,\\" Tedder sings of saving his friend and takes part in a rousing, soulful final chorus.    The lowest point on `Loud' is \\"Won't Stop,\\" and that's only because it is boring. Another lackluster song is \\"Goodbye Apathy,\\" which includes a very repetitive chorus.    Needless to say, OneRepublic easily prove they are not just \\"The Fray of 2007\\" on `Dreaming Out Loud.' Their ability to offer both up-tempo radio anthems and heartfelt, moving ballads put them on an elite playing field. One they should be around to play on for years to come.
0312305060|5.0|This book makes it clear that perfect execution is not required in order to win a Pulitzer Prize. The editor in me cringed at all the parentheticals and head hopping, but the story-teller in me rejoiced at the vivid imagery and intricate, interwoven plot lines. It's an easy one-day read and well worth the investment regardless of familiarity with Virginia Woolf.
B00007LTIC|5.0|I've been a YES fan for decades. For some reason, I never bought this album. When I did recently, I was completely blown away. I never thought that I'd have a \\"newer\\" favorite YES song...there's so many...but \\"Awaken\\" has now taken that spot! This album is going up there with \\"Hemispheres\\" (Rush) as my favorite of all time. Chris Squire's 8-string Rickenbacker bass on the title track \\"Going for the One\\" sounds so much more rich with re-mastering than in the days when I remember hearing this song on the radio. Many players have used Rick's to lay down tracks...Chris seems to make his Rick sound so much more rich and full. Everyone sounded great on this album, I can't say enough about it!
B000WMEAKC|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. Ryan Tedder has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. He puts so much emotion into his vocals. The lyrics are outstanding, and really represent the theme of the CD, which is we fight to struggle to love and all the hardships that we associate with love. Yes, I love the single \\"apologize\\" but it is one of the worst songs on the record. The rock one is better than the urban remix. The instruments do a good job behind Tedder, the piano in some of the songs with the cello playing really adds to the emotions in the songs. This has to rank up with some of the best CDS in 2007. It is breathtaking to hear what real music sounds like, instead of some of the machine produced crap we listen to today. The lyrics are very relatable, and I can relate to many of the songs. Best songs on the CD are \\"say (all I need), \\"Come Home\\" (one of the most emotional songs I have heard in a long time), \\"All We Are\\", \\"Mercy\\", and \\"Stop and Stare\\". I will put \\"Come Home\\" in my top 10 from now on. Keep it guys.
B000W04S6U|5.0|This is the best Halo soundtrack yet. The sound quality is worlds better than the previous CDs because of the actual orchestra used for the recording. This is a complete musical journey through the Halo 3 game. The terrible songs by horrible bands that were on the Halo 2 soundtrack are gone. There is one band song at the end as a hidden track, so even though it is lame, it doesn't get in the way of the actual music. If you enjoy music from the Halo world, this is a must-buy.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am not particularly a big fan of Schwartz', but when I heard this soundtrack, I was immediately hooked. Strong, memorable songwriting, with great melodies and lyrics. Beside the obvious musical theatre song influences, this music has it's feel also anchored in rock and pop, with even a touch of the blues (!)    Without a doubt, the best musical theatre song selection I've heard, since the best days of Rogers and Hammerstein.    The stage show is just as great, with amazing lighting, makeup, funny dialog, great acting --- it just really doesn't get any better than this.     I took my wife to the stage show, as a Christmas gift, and she was thrilled with it. She's a musical theatre actress, and at the end of the First Act, she swiveled around towards me, and gleefully burst out \\"This is the best thing I've ever seen!!\\"   Speaking for myself, I just may agree.    Disregard the one dud reviewer that said he didn't like the music, you can't go wrong with this one.
0143038419|1.0|I hated this book but I forced myself to finish it. Putting the authors irritating voice aside, it epitomizes everything wrong with American culture today: worship of the mediocre, travel without seeing anything, polarizing of the Other and fake spirituality.  That said, I learned something important about spirituality as well but I'll get to that in a minute.  It has to do with learning not to judge (see above, I've become quite judgmental).    When I was dragging myself through this book, I experienced strong waves of hatred for this woman.  She missed all of the poverty in those places and all complexities of the cultures she \\"learned about\\".  She acted like hers was the only travel experience any of her readers have ever had with her \\"Let me explain what being Balinese means...\\" demeanor.  She couldn't even accurately transcribe the Italian words in the passage of curses (\\"Molto migliore\\"???).  She spoke about Italy like an annoying travel companion who has been there for five minutes, has read two things about the place and knows five words and acts like the expert and when you visit her there and after 2 days there yourself you can see that she still hasn't seen or learned a thing. She takes what she wants to see from the world and tells readers what she thinks they want to hear about it.  She doesn't even give an original spin to these common travel destinations, or even any insight into the expats she does meet.  Did she ever mention not liking someone?  Did she ever mention any negative emotions about anyone other than \\"David\\" or her ex-husband? Did she ever mention any locals being any less than thrilled that she graced them with her presence? Did any other readers feel her jealousy seething when the sexy Brazilian Armenia walked in Wayan's shop? Of course we all did but the author, miss Spiritually Enlightened at Greeting Her Emotions must still not be able to face that one.  Or maybe she can't dare mention it because that might make her readers not likeher and this woman spends all her energy spinning a version of herself that everyone can like.  I guess her spiritual enlightenment only works for exploring and sharing insights about her weight.  Or making money off the bored, privileged American public.    Now, how about how offensive she is?  Besides her condescending assumption that we are all married 35 year olds stuck in our houses who have never traveled and are relying on her to tell us how it is, she made two references where she tried to make the suffering of her love life out to be comparable that of a refugee (\\"we had the eyes of refugees\\" and counseling with the boat people revealed that their suffering too \\"was all\\" love story sagas (personally offensive to anyone touched by the world's refugee story).    Okay, I said that I learned something.  Yes, I learned something.  Important.  I looked deeply into my hatred I felt towards this woman throughout the book.  I learned that the reason I hated her so much was because I was expecting her to have something insightful to say and I was expecting to learn about the people from an anthropological, non-biased, realistic perspective.  Each faux pas she made infuriated me.  I wasn't seeing her for her.  I was trying to project what I thought was her view of herself onto her.  Basically, I was expecting her to live up to how great she tells us she is and when she didn't deliver, time after time, sentence after sentence, I felt some justified sense of triumph and anger at \\"catching\\" her, and then feeling immense frustration at not being able to expose her to the world so everyone else would see through her too.  Instead, I should learn to accept the book for what it is (horrible) and accept the author as she is (whoever that is) and accept that to her it was suffering, to her it was enlightenment and it does no good to judge her for it (even though I am not spiritually enlightened enough to stop myself).  Instead of hating her, I should have shut the book, written this review, and laughed about it.
B000NVT0RU|4.0|This is your standard war movie with a PC message.  We have seen it all before, but it is well done none the less.  I don't know how much sympathy Western viewers are going to have for Moslim soldiers, especially in France where they have had so much trouble with moslim immigrants in recent years.  One must also recall that many Arabic states during and after WW2 were pro-Fascist in nature.  Fascism appealed to Islamic nationalists of the time.  So these French Colonial soldiers were certainly not fighting for the greater good of mankind.<br /><br />The disgraceful defeat of France in 1940 resulted in a political split and partial occupation by the Nazi's.  Vichy France became a pro-Nazi puppet government, while de Gualle struggled to put together the Free French Movement.  Both factions fought it out in the French colonial empire and that is where these colonial troops come in.  With a shortage of trained soldiers the Free French sought to mobilize the colonial assets of their empire.  This is why the soldiers shown in the film have such a mixture of equipment and training.  French, British and American helmits are shown along with a mix of weapons.  This is because the Free French had to scrape together whatever gear was left over from the allies.  The French military reputation being nil, neither the British or Amercians were too keen to give them the best stuff.<br /><br />These colonial troops, while brave would not have fared well against the Wehrmacht in its prime, as indeed they did not with the defeat of France in 1940.  By 1943 onwards they are able to ride with the crest of the wave so to speak, but otherwise would not have been any creditable match for German infantry.<br /><br />I liked the film and the quality of its production.  The political message was strong however.  Innocent, good colonials wanting to do good for their French masters are instead treated like dirt.  We have seen this take before and it begins to wear a bit, but the play for sympathy still manages to work here.  The final firefight seems a direct inspiration taken from SAVING PVT. RYAN.  Are we going to see every beleagered allied squad in WW2 movies fight a mini-Alamo now? I hope not, because if anything the Germans should be the ones doing this against hordes of allies. I liked the film despite these drawbacks and its rather PC message.<br /><br />The special features had an interesting behind the scenes view of making the film, with interviews from the principal actors.  The rather crude cartoon seemed very basic in its message.  Did such a massacre occur of French Senegalese veterans in Africa after the war?  I always wonder at the heavy handed nature of messages like this where facts often get twisted to make a message for today.o work here.

It is a riveting story and we get a really great insight into what makes the Doctor tick following her time with her friend Dr. Anna Zenner who as a Psychiatrist  knows how to lead her friend into telling what troubles her .Having followed her through nine earlier stories we begin to understand what she really feels, how she looks upon various times in her life and begin to know the lady personally  (up to a point).Very enjoyable,a great forensic mystery.

140120306X|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  Moore has once again expanded upon the medium of comics, making this collection something well worth buying even in the wonderful world of file sharing.  This book is actually printed on several different types of paper, varying based upon which part of the book you're reading (there is actually a book within a book, the titular Black Dossier): one section will be typical glossy graphic novel paper, then one is thicker parchment paper, and another is a finer paper.  This may not thrill every reader, but it definitely adds to the experience of reading the book.  Additionally, a pair of 3-D glasses are included in the back, for an impressive 3-D section towards the end of the collection.    As far as the story goes, this volume of the League is much more driven by references and in-jokes to Victorian literature, from the obscure to the ridiculously obscure, which any fan of Moore's recent works would expect.  There is not necessarily as much in the way of a standard plot as the previous two volumes, but this is more than made up for by the depth that is added to the entire concept of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and in particular, the several different incarnations that have occurred over the years.  Characters like Swift's Lemuel Gulliver and Shakespeare's Prospero make appearance, in addition to the old standards Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain.  There are also a few more modern references, which make the book a real delight to read.    This is, admittedly, an English major's opinion, but I can definitely say that this is my favorite of the three volumes of the League that Moore has produced so far.  You also have to give credit to O'Neill for his art -- it not only propels the story, but it also does a great deal of the effort towards easing the reader into a book that is unconventional, to say the least.  People who enjoyed the previous volumes will not be disappointed, this is Moore, O' Neill, and the League at the top of their respective games.  You won't regret buying this book.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|For the amount of stuff that comes with the package, the quality of image, sound and special features it is definatly worth the wait and the price. Specially, the starfleet access features on the discs and the \\"inspection tour\\" of the ship which allows you to fire a torpedo!!! Recommended for all star trek fans and anyone one that is thinking about getting a copy.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|I still give this 3 stars for the superb sound quality. HOWEVER, Black Dog is edited and not just a quick short edit- it's missing 2 verses!! ...it's so bad I can never listen to it again. This was a huge disappointment for me. I've been waiting for the MSG version of Black Dog to be on CD for 30 years! And another bummer is Whole Lotta Love has a couple of edits!!!  Why Jimmy?  Why on earth wouldn't you just put the entire show on 3 discs?? Not one fan would've complained. I am a little more picky than most fans, so I have to complain. Most of you will not care about these small edits, but I will never get rid of my original version of THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME.
B00006GA4C|1.0|Comparing this group and album to Cream? Are you kidding?  I listened to  this album  recently for the first time in over 25 years, and if I hear it again in the next 25 years, it  will be too soon. Totally uncreative songs, vocals and solos. Headache- inducing at any  volume level.  Groups like this give rock music a bad name.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears second release, \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" struck accord with the year 2000 generation and will go down in history to be a classic album.  'Oops!' is full of catchy pop tunes about love, loss, fun, and for really the first time Spear's take on modern life (as witnessed in the tracks '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' and 'Lucky.)    1. Oops!...I Did It Again - This was the leading single and by far one of the best songs on this album.  The song has one of the most successful 'stuck in your head' choruses of all time as well as a modern beat and hip lyrics that all teens (even adults) can relate to.    2. Stronger - Another hit single about a cheating partner and the singer's ability to move on because she is 'stronger than yesterday'.    3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door - A catchy tune warning an ex to not come around anymore.    4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - A remake of the classic Rolling Stones tune, with a few tweaks to make it a female version.  Spears sings about the pressure from the world to try and create people into what they aren't for the sake of being popular.    5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - The final single from 'Oops!' tells a lover to be open and communicate their love for the singer instead of telling others how they feel.    6. What U See (Is What U Get) - A great tune about not letting your boyfriend/girlfriend control you and the way you live.  Very catchy and fun to move along to!    7. Lucky - Very successful single.  'Lucky' is about a Hollywood starlet who has everything but love.  A song that deals with the false belief that money and fame bring happiness.    8. One Kiss From You - A tween love song about a special someone giving strength and hope with one kiss.    9. Where Are You Know - A song about longing, wanting, and moving on after a relationship ends.    10. Can't Make You Love Me - A rocky tune about how you can never make another person love you no matter how hard you try.    11. When Your Eyes Say It - A ballad about how a lover's eyes express their love and devotion more than words.    12. Dear Diary - A very simple tune about a girl's crush and hope to be forever with that 'boy'.    \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" is a great CD for adults and teens to enjoy together or apart.  Britney Spears really showed her musical ability on this release.
B00006I53S|4.0|This review is pointed towards consumers in the price range of the Digital Rebel family who are looking for their first or second lens.  This lens is a great choice.<br /><br />Initially, two features catch the eye and are probably the reason why you're looking: the focal length (28-135mm) and Image Stabilization.  With the 1.6x multiplier of your APS-C cameras (including your Rebels), this lens gives very good reach.  If you're looking for maybe one or two lenses total to supplement your kit lens, I would definitely recommend this lens for that reason alone.  The IS is Canon's first generation and should give you about 2-3 stops.  For me, the IS is most useful when I'm just starting to consider the use of a tripod.  However, it is definitely not a substitution for a good tripod when warranted.  It doesn't come with IS mode 2 (horizontal and vertical panning) or tripod detection, which are good but aren't really necessary for this to be your walk-around lens.<br /><br />The lens is good quality.  The build could be a little more solid; Middle of the road and completely sufficient.  The barrel extends on mine if you grab it vertically from the end.  Oh well.<br /><br />The image quality is very good.  Not up to par with a prime lens or L-series, but good enough where you won't be wishing that you had bought a different lens.  I rarely shoot with this lens wide open @ f/3.5.  There is a noticeable difference between quality f/3.5 and f/5.6 at the shorter focal lengths (when f/3.5 is applicable).  The lens sports a 6-blade aperture and the bokeh is pretty enough.<br /><br />The AF works.  USM is good.  The lens has full time focus which allows you to fine tune the focus even when you're in AF.  Moving on...<br /><br />As my kit grew, I phased out the Canon EF 28-135mm lens and eventually sold it with my Rebel.  It has since been replaced by the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8, and the Canon EF 70-200 f/4L IS.  I enjoy the the fixed aperture and improved image quality of both.  Do I miss the IS from 28-70mm?  Not really.  Sure it would be nice, but for me I choose the f/2.8 and greater image quality of the Tamron.  However, I also spent a fourteen hundred dollars to replace the Canon 28-135mm IS with the two lenses.  Price is definitely a strength with the lens (and inversely, so is being single and financially irresponsible).<br /><br />So Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS?  YES.  Great choice if you're planning on having one to two lenses.  I wouldn't say that it has a single defining strength, but it does everything in it's range very well.  I could say a jack of all trades and a master of none, but I've used that phrase too many times as a derogatory term for coworkers.  Not a fair application here..

B000PKG7I4|5.0|This is a great second album for Amy Winehouse. The music on this CD has a very nice rhythmic blues beat. I enjoyed the music on this CD more than the singing actually. The singing is very good though. However there may not be any big hits on here as there were on her first CD. I hope Amy gets her act together and can continue her career so we may all be able to enjoy her music for years to come. All in all this is a great music CD.
0060512806|5.0|Nerds unite!  Here is your book.  I'm serious as this book just oozes nerd goodies.  This book has nerds from the 40's, nerds from the present time, German nerds, American nerds, British nerds, Techie nerds, graphs, charts, figures, formulas, manuals, gadgets, hacking, and yes even nerdvana.  If you are nerd just buy the book you know you can't resist.    That being said, the book is very well written and moves at a very fast pace.  I think I read this book in about three or four nights.  This is a book I put off for awhile because of its length but if that is worrying you just buy the book since once you start it you will not be able to put it down.
B000VDDDY6|2.0|I took in all the hype and was really waiting to get my copy.    ....  I wish I'd spent my money on something else.  The HD redone effects seemed  way to short to short for me.  Not there long enough to take it in.   And there are still alot of \\"record pops\\" in the video,  not to much ,  but for this much money I expected better.  And I do not know about seasons 2 and 3 ,  but the colors seemed out of wack or something.  Sortof like a music song which has been processed too much.  If it were cheaper ,  I would not have any issues,  but for this much money,  I do.  I give it two stars instead of one because I appeciated the attempt.  Please for the sake of everybody ... LOWER THE PRICE!!!!
075640407X|2.0|What is new in this novel?  The answer is nothing.  This might be a good book for new readers whom have not read much but for anyone who has.....  I mean the main character goes to a school for wizards...hmmm haven't seen that anywhere...when the character gets to the school he meets male cliche friend #1 and girl cliche friend #2 and they procede to encounter wizard school cliche scenes....ugggh    Recommended for young adult readers.    Not recommneded for adult readers whom have read more than a couple fantasy books.    By the way I have this book in the first edition hardcover and in great shape.  Add a comment to this if you would like to buy it from me.
075640407X|5.0|I'll confess, I didn't pay for this book. I wouldn't have been willing to pay for it until it came out in paperback. I'm just not willing to take a $15-$25 chance on a first-time author or really any author I've never read before.     That being said, I really wish that I had paid for this book. It was that good. Based on this first novel, Patrick Rothfuss may have a long and profitable career ahead of him. The book was exciting and really pulled me in and wouldn't let me go. I stayed up late a couple of nights because I couldn't bear to put it down. And the best part was that it didn't read so fast that I was done in two days. No, the wind blew and blew and blew for a week, and I was happy with it.    No book is without its flaws, of course. There were a couple of slow spots and while the ending left me eager for the next book, it wasn't really a satisfying ending. The main story cuts off in mid-sentence! That's just not cool.    The next one, I'm paying for and I'm getting it in hardcover.
0061544493|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my wife.  (I hope she doesn't see this review before the holidays.)  I took a look inside, and I think it's going to be a big hit.  Mrs. Beckham has a talent for combining utter  sincerity with self-mockery in a way that is completely irresistable.  I think it would be impossible to have a bad day while reading this book.
0375707972|5.0|\\"The Reader\\" takes place in postwar Germany. When Michael Berg is 15 years old, he begins an affair with Hanna, a woman in her late 30's. Although the relationship is incredibly passionate, it also borders on obsessive. Hanna is very secretive and is prone to irrational mood swings. Michael never learns very much about her, but he cannot bear to live without her. Suddenly, without any warning, Hanna disappears one day, and Michael assumes that he'll never see her again. Years later, when Michael sits in on a trial as part of his legal studies seminar, he is stunned to find Hanna as a defendant in the case, and it instantly becomes obvious that she is guilty of the horrendous things she has been accused of. Michael must come to terms with the fact that the woman he once loved was capable of such horrific actions, and he finds himself struggling with his own personal sense of values and responsibility.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book that forces readers to examine their own morality. The parallels between the main characters and major historical events are absolutely brilliant. I don't want to give away any additional details and spoil the plot for anyone, so just trust me when I tell you that \\"The Reader\\" is a truly compelling book that you won't be able to put down.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|Live Free or Die Hard was getting alot of flack long before it was released and such I was very skeptical especially with the PG-13 rating. Shortly before release Fox demanded a PG-13 rating which required some triming of the diologue and a few less violent scenes in order to get a larger audience. The movie itself was still a very action packed edge of you seat movie that you have come to expect from Die Hard. The story was great and very fitting for the times we live in. The key line was still there but it was muffled do to the cuts they made to please Fox. The Unrated version clocks in at the same length which is proof to what happend. They basically had either the actors do a voice over or they filmed two versions of certain scenes just in case Fox did what they are so known for. Cutting a movie right before release. As I said it's a good movie but if you want the true Die Hard experience and the movie as it is suppsosed to be this is what you want. This is one hell of a movie and I highly recomend it and this version as all the cut language is there and the end scene is the way it was supposed to be.
0064471837|5.0|Alexander Beard  mod 2  Book review<br />  The Mysteries of the Great Charter<br /><br /> I have read thousands of books, and perhaps my favorite one is Sabriel, by Garth Nix. Sabriel is a fantastic adventure-action-fantasy that also twines in a snap of romance. Sabriel is a girl that is originally from the \\"Old Kingdom\\" just north of Ancelestierr, where Sabriel goes to school. It is a somewhat normal day when Sabriel receives the startling news that her father was captured by the undead creature Kerrigor. Her father is the Abhorsen who keeps all of the dead things in death and in order to save her father, herself, and her world, Sabriel must go on a journey into the mysterious Old Kingdom to find and rescue her father, and on the way, she gets tangled up in a two thousand year old betrayal that leads her deeper into the depths of an ancient vendetta of the dead. This book is an irresistible page-turner that keeps you wondering what dangers and adventures await Sabriel around every corner. This incredible story of adventure will smash its way into your favorites and leave you begging for more! This may well become your favorite book to!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down until it was finished. Funny, poignant, wise, inspiring and uplifting!
B000VNMMQG|3.0|That this is an amazing story no one can deny, and the story has been capably transferred to the screen.  However it seems clear that many stylistic changes were made to give the movie a more American \\"Hollywood\\" style, rather than a more understated and realistic British film style.  This is somewhat jarring to watch, because of course the film is fully cast with great British actors giving top-notch performances - but it seems at many points that the orchestra soars a little too much, and the director attempts to pull one's heart strings a little too much - when the story itself is more than adequate to do that on its own.      My one big complaint, however, has to be with the DVD artwork.  Once again we see the opportunity for a great and inspirational cover thrown away by a belief that the only thing which sells DVD's to Americans is the number of famous faces one can place on the cover.  Remember the movie poster?  It was very melancholy, with Ioan Gruffud looking away into the distance.  It was a marvelous photo which has been replaced here with strips of \\"action stills\\" which - while showing scenes from the movie - completely fail to communicate the SUBSTANCE of it.      Typically the British do a much better job, handling DVD artwork more like that of a rock album - in a much more subtle and interesting way.  Just slide on over to Amazon.co.uk and look at the their \\"Amazing Grace\\" artwork.  Wow!  Now all that sun filtering down through the trees just screams \\"Amazing Grace\\" to me.  And what's more there's not a famous face to be seen - just a scene which invokes this story powerfully.      At this point I would normally tell everyone that you should have already bought a universal \\"Region-free\\" DVD player so that you can buy such DVD's from across the pond.  Typically a Brit-centric film like this would have far more extras on the UK release, but unfortunately they've bucked the trend and let us down with that this time.  Of course the current exchange ratealso makes that an expensive enterprise.  It should be noted, though, that you will usually get more extras on a UK release of a British film, and always get better picture and sound on the UK release of any British TV show made before the late 90's.  A lot of picture quality us dumped during the transfer process to US DVD from the UK tapes which the older shows were recorded on, but you don't lose that if you watch the UK DVD on a universal DVD player.      Anyway, the trend of US DVD covers is a disturbing one, so we need to complain every chance we get in the hope that it will change.  If we as consumers demand a better product intead of the most commercial one, we might just get it someday.      4 stars for the movie, none for the packaging.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|I love this CD! It is always in my CD player! Everlong is one of my favorite songs and I happen to love this version. Dave Grohl's voice sounds so raw and true. I like that the songs are changed up a bit. So many of the hits are played on the radio all the time, so I like the fact that on this CD, they're different, more \\"real\\" and less commercialized, if you know what I mean. Maybe I'm just such a Dave Grohl fan, that I think he can do no wrong! :P
B000UR9T8C|2.0|The first two Spidey films had moments of film-making wonder, awe, and fun.  This one simply was no fun at all.  It was a by-the-numbers film, and not very well written or executed.  Read below:<br /><br />First off, note that the screenplay was written by director Sam Raimi and his brother, not by more seasoned screenwriters as was the case with the first two films.  In this case it seems to have made a huge difference.  The script is weak and lazy.<br /><br />Secondly, the inclusion of the Sandman character seems completely superfluous.  He could have been cut out entirely and you never would have missed it.<br /><br />Thirdly, the plot hinges on geographic coincidences that would make a statistician slit his own throat in disbelief.<br /><br />And how many times can we hear Peter's Aunt May spout the same dialogue over and over again?  It seems like she gives the same speeches in each movie.  At about the 2 hour mark in this film, just when the audience is tired of it all and ready for the film to end, Aunt May launches into another one of her dialogue scenes that is so corny it made the audience giggle.<br /><br />The audience I saw this movie with was a large crowd made up of all types of people, and I could easily sense the audience's restlessness towards the end.  Few people seemed to like this movie and sure left the screening room in a big hurry when it was all over.<br /><br />This movie wasn't just disappointing, it was plain out insultingly bad.  Big budget, low creativity and originality.<br /><br />I decided before the film was even over that I would NEVER want to sit through this again.  Shame on Raimi for making such a piece of garbage.<br /><br />The special effects were spiffy and looked cool, but so what?
055358894X|4.0|Scott Lynch's \\"Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is an enthralling read.  The main character, Locke Lamora, is an orphan after a plague outbreak taken in by a Thiefmaster.  Locke is soon too much for the Thiefmaster to take and is passed on to become an initiate in the service of Perelandro.  Here, Locke finds education, brotherhood and happiness.  Then he grows up and malevolent forces begin to move in his home of Camorr.  Locke and his Gentlemen Bastards become embroiled in the trouble with interesting results.   This book is well written, somewhat in the style of Oliver Twist.  There are flashbacks interspersed with 'present day' which, after the prologue, take a little getting used to and don't technically carry throughout the entire book.  Some of the dialogue has a tendency to seem a little forced, but overall is engaging.  Character development is interesting and believable.  After one of the major events in the book, which is a little over halfway through the body of the novel, events move quickly.  The slow beginning pace isn't necessarily a detractor, however, as the author explains his world and his characters with a little action thrown in.  Overall, a satifying read.  I eagerly await the next installment.
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks did a fantastic job and in the foot steps of George A Romero he is able to comment on socioeconomic unrest and politics in not just one country but the whole world. This book isn't as much about zombies as it is about people's reactions and the consequences of those reactions. How else would you portray political and socioeconomic strife in the world? You don't want to pit one country or one race or one religion or one faction against another and pawn the blame on someone else. If this could happen to anyone, anywhere...isn't that terrifying?
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I have never been a country fan until the past year or so when this genre was introduced to me by some friends. In the meantime I have begun to purchase several country cds and this one by Brad is my favorite. All the tracks are great with easy listening or humorous lyrics, great guitar work and great diversity of styles. My favorite track on this CD is probably Letter to Me which should be listened to by every high school student in the country. It speaks to being able to look back at the past when your problems seemed so overwhelming , and how you will survive and life gets so much fuller and richer. I am going through those problems with my high school daughter right now , so that track definately speaks to me and has special meaning. On the strength of this CD I plan on looking into Brad's other music, this man is talent personified.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|You can easily tell that this is not the same version as released in 1976. This goes way beyond that, mainly due to the fact that this is the whole show, the audio taken from the three July shows that they put on at Madison Square Garden. The first thing that I noticed when putting on this CD was how loud it was. It was pure Zeppelin. The sound quality is superb, it's just like seeing them live, at the Garden.  The only problem that I have is that it does not have the same version of Black Dog from the Zeppelin DVD. This one has a Bring it on Home intro and is a much shorter version clocking in at 3:46 and not the usual 5+ minutes. Anyway this is an absolute must for any Zeppelin fan.
0307387178|5.0|This singular true tale came to me in a singular way. I don't remember another time in my life when two people have not only recommended a book, but put copies in my hand within a few days. Add to this that it was four years old at that time (hence not a current hit) and that it collaterally delves into personal issues that haunt me -- ghosts of which neither recommender was aware, and I have to admit that it had all the appearance of intent.  I mention all of the forgoing to confess probable bias in this review -- but, that said, this is a terrific story, wonderfully told. It is the tale of a young man's short life, his hegira across the American West, a successful Arctic vision quest, and the simple mistakes that ultimately killed him. Jon Krakauer writes vividly and compassionately of Chris McCandless, the youthful wanderer, and the family he left behind. The author's mountaineering experience feeds his and the reader's understanding of the forces that push and pull some folks (mostly young men) into life on the edge, and his thoughtful consideration of the tangled tension between some fathers and some sons clove me to the heart. Krakauer retraced McCandless' two year odyssey, tracked down all the principal players, shared his search, research, and discoveries with the family, and delivered a stunningly beautiful book.
B000H30B3G|4.0|I bought this edition only for the gift, and I was really really satisfied with this edition the art of King Kong on the top of the Empire State building is awesome.    About the movie only in the first disc I appreciate the extended edition movie, it was a great effects with more creatures on the island, but nothing relevant to the story.
0767903811|5.0|I was a stranger to Bill Bryson's work, myself, having avoided his, then new, highly touted, runaway hit, A WALK IN THE WOODS, because it was a highly touted, runaway hit. Herd behavior among humans generally irks me. (I read A WALK later and wondered what the fuss was about. STRANGER is far superior.)  This is not a book to read with food or drink in your mouth or throat. Heimlich's trick may not save you. Bryson describes everyday life in America with delightful humor, irony, befuddlement and charm, in prose that repeatedly left me gasping with laughter, wiping tears while I plucked the book off the floor. When he turns more serious, his warmth and sentiment feel absolutely sincere.  Having lived twenty years in England, the essays in STRANGER are weekly columns about reentry to Bryson's native land, written for Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper. The quality of this writing is so uniformly excellent that my first impulse is to take up a collection to send Dave Barry on a two decade remedial sabbatical to the Isles. (Tasteful humor for adult readers is evidently still written and read over there.)  STRANGER may be the funniest essay collection in my memory, though like Bryson I am teetering into the years when memory is iffy and, again like the author, it wasn't my strong suit in the first place.  Top notch, eh, what?
B000W93CHC|4.0|It's been many years since I read Pillars of the Earth, so I was wondering if I could pick this up without re-reading Pillars. I was delighted that I could without feeling like I'd missed something.<br /><br />It's fun, lots of twists and turns and reminds me of Candide how people's lives are up then down then up again. As I said, a fun read. But be prepared by doing your lifting exercises. This is a heavy book. I only give it four stars because it's good but not as good as Tolkein's ring trilogy.
B000ELJBAK|3.0|We've all seen this scenario a million times, and we'll see it again another million; famous, successful rock band begins having difficulties and before it splits, various members release \\"solo project\\" albums.  In some instances, factions within the mother band will develop, so Members A and B may record together, while Member C has B and D on his solo outing, but not A.  And, invariably, the solo outings are far weaker than the original band with A,B,C, and D together.      This album, 1978's \\"David Gilmour\\", is not that scenario.  It very well could have been, but it is not, for a few reasons.      First of all, this is not a \\"Pink Floyd album masquerading as a solo project\\".  To begin with, the personnel besides Gilmour are non-PF.  Second of all, Gilmour's contributions to the PF songbook were starting to decline (as Roger Waters tightened his dominance over Floyd, starting with \\"Wish\\", and culminating in \\"Animals,\\" \\"The Final Cut,\\" and \\"The Wall\\").      That is not to say that it sounds nothing like a Pink Floyd album -- you will recognize Gilmour's light, but pleasing, voice, and you will (for the most part) recognize his guitar tone.      The songwriting however, is entirely Gilmour's own, and represents a stylistic break with contemporaneous Floyd product (specifically, \\"Animals\\").  In place of the uncomfortable, bitter-sounding chord progressions of something like \\"Dogs\\" or \\"Pigs\\", this album commences with the sunny, major-key instrumental, \\"Mihalis.\\"  The soloing is loose, relaxed Gilmour -- his guitar reverbed to about middle-distance in the mix, slowly receding through the extended fade.      The album's highlight, \\"There's No Way Out of Here\\", follows.  This is an example of making much out of nothing -- the entire song springs from the simple, not very promising, chordal riff that opens it.  This is also the clearest demonstration of why Gilmour chose the sidemen he did here (and not members of the Floyd).  Take, for instance, the drummer's repeatedfill that ends with cymbal crashes on 'four' (short of the expected cymbal hit on 'one' of the following measure).  Notice, too, how the drummer, at the climactic point of the final solo (when the female chorus has re-entered) extends this same phrase to play the fill across the bar line, and finish with a cymbal crash on 'two.'  This is masterful stuff, the sort of thing Nick Mason was probably not capable of.  Furthermore, the bassist plays triplets through this same section, enhancing the staggered, loping feel of the song.  Gilmour's soloing is as tasteful and soaring as ever, but one has the distinct feeling that it is further enhanced by the playing and singing of the entire band.      As a bit of a side note, given how strong \\"No Way Out of Here\\" is - stronger, in my opinion, than \\"Comfortably Numb\\" or \\"Run Like Hell\\", or any of his other concert warhorses -- it's strange that Gilmour has not seen fit to resurrect it for any of his more recent tours.  I think he would be surprised by how well it has aged with his fans.      The rest of the album has strengths, particularly the closer, \\"There's No Way,\\" which may be taken as his meditation on the tense Floyd situation of the time (\\"There's no way/'Cause it's my show\\").  Also of note are the washing-machine-on-crack sound effects he utilizes for \\"It's Deafinitely.\\"      This is one of those \\"sleeper\\" albums, whose merit has only continued to appreciate.  It is also the best of the three solo albums by Gilmour.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is a beautiful three-part love letter to cinema by Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore. The first part is about the relationship between a fatherless Sicilian boy (Salvatore Cascio) and the man who runs the projector in the local cinema (Philippe Noiret). The second is about the boy as a handsome young man (Marco Leonardi), who takes over his projectionist friend's job, and his relationship with a beautiful girl (Antonella Attili) that is above him socially. The third is about the same boy as a grown man (Jacques Perrin) who has travelled to Rome and become a professional filmmaker. He is returning home to bury his friend, the projectionist. While he's there, he looks up his old girl friend (Brigitte Fossey), who is now married.<br /><br />The theatrical version focuses on the first two parts; the director's cut includes all three. I love the theatrical version: it is fresh and innocent, with the boy showing a lot of courage and personality, and the projectionist a lot of compassion. The first part is also filled with humor. The second, about the relationship between the young man and the girl he has fallen for, is touching and sweet. Returning home to bury his friend brings closure to the first relationship. There is also a very special present that the older man leaves his protege that is surprising and wonderful.<br /><br />Dragging out the third part by having the couple reunite as adults is just too much. It may fulfill some autobiographical need for the filmmaker, but it is unnecessary, even distracting, to the story. We don't need to know what happens to the girl; and, in fact, it creates a satisfying mystery for us not to know.<br /><br />What's most important is what happens to the man. He has grown from the delightful boy and passionate young man into an accomplished artist. His personal life has not been fulfilling, so why expound on it? What's important is that he has become what his friend the projectionist had hope he would: a famous director. He has fulfilled their shared dream. There is tremendous pathos in the final scene, when he opens his friend's present. It illustrates their love for each other, which is really what the film is about.<br /><br />No one does the innocence of childhood, the passion of youth and the pathos of adulthood like the Italians. They really understand the various stages of life. They are earthy, robust people, like their wines. Their films are the same. Besides passion, they infuse their culture, and even their religion, with humor. All this comes through in Cinema Paradiso. It is a wonderful masterpiece of youth and love that reflects filmmaker Tornatore's own journey through life.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithled their shared dream.

B000E1MTZE|4.0|I'm not going to review the films but rather give my opinions on the technical aspects of this set. I have to say that I was somewhat underwhelmed. Perhaps this comes from the fact that the original Matrix was the standard for testing your presentation back in the earliest days of DVD. It was THE best dvd out there. Because of this, I thought that this would be the same for the newest generation of movie playing technology. While the films look good, they don't look great. There is little to no compression \\"noise\\", artifcacts are nonexistant, and edges look good. What you get is a very clean picture. However, it's not as sharp as it could be. Perhaps this is a result of creative decisions by Wachowski's, or it's a byproduct of the coloring and filmstock used. Either way, what you're left with is a relatively softer picture than what I at least had expected. While I love the movies, the video quality of this set just doesn't knock my socks off like some other HD-DVDs and Blu-ray discs do. TrueHD sound works well if you're able to play it. Otherwise it's the standard 5.1 which, while uncompressed, is still pretty much the same as the standard dvd set. If you like the films and want the best possible presentation of them, then this set (or the ultimate one) is for you. If you want something to show off your equipment, you might want to look elsewhere first.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|A wonderful unique film that transcends genre as it is ostensibly a comedy yet does not betray or undermine it's spooky/horror theme.  It is elegant and moody with great performances all the way around, excellent art production and photography, perfect musical score. There is a campy humorous almost fairytale quality to the film yet it retains an uneasy underlying mood and atmosphere of the dark and occultic. Possibly the best vampire film ever produced.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|These guys just keep on going! I had the privilege to see them in San Jose during the TIOA tour and they displayed just as much power and majesty as ever before. This newest live album, which is culled from various European gigs, shows just how incredible the guys are, and although they're getting on in years (aren't we all?) their sound is still energetic and timeless.<br /><br />Notable highlights are Gabriel-era classics such as \\"In the Cage\\" and \\"I Know What I Like\\", and mainstream hits like \\"Land of Confusion\\" and \\"I Can't Dance.\\" There are even snippets of \\"Duke's Travels / Duke's Ends\\" scattered throughout a couple of the medley songs, which was a personal treat for me since \\"Duke\\" is one of my favorite albums. The mix is spot on (good rich bass and keys) and Phil's vocals sound as crisp and clear as ever. Tony's keys are still swirling and thundering, and we all know how Mike and Daryl can crank out the guitar magic. Pay close attention to Chester's drumming during \\"In The Cage\\", he's hitting those toms like a mad man!<br /><br />The tour itself was quite magical, as Genesis sold out many dates in Europe and packed houses in the states as well. I'm not sure if we'll see a \\"Live Over America\\" album or not, but for those who witnessed the tour this new live album will bring back tons of memories. 2007 has been a great year for Genesis fans: a new tour, this new live album, Encore CD releases, the first of three boxsets released, new books, etc. Hopefully Phil and company will realize the demand for their music is as high as ever, and perhaps another album and / or tour will occur in the future.....:-)
B000UNYJXQ|2.0|I saw Sicko in the theatre.  The whole film is based on a logical fallacy as the premise:  that there can exist either the over-regulated corporate welfare system known as HMO, or universal government healthcare funded by taxpayers.  No alternative is presented, even though the dependence on the HMO in the US has only existed since 1973 when legislation mandated that employers purchase group healthcare on behalf of employees.<br /><br />It only makes sense that removing choice of healthcare provider will hand the HMO a monopoly, increasing price and reducing efficiency and quality of care.  But for some reason, the HMO system is presented as the \\"free market\\" health care, and then the failures of the HMO system are assigned to the free market rather than to the government regulation where they belong.<br /><br />Moore fails to examine the effect of malpractice insurance on the cost of healthcare, and fails to examine any recourse that malpractice victims enjoy under government healthcare.  Moore touches on the fact that some drugs in Cuba cost a fraction of what they cost in the U.S., but fails to examine the reasons for this, such as corporate welfare in the form of such acts as the Prescription Drug Benefit, the lack of competition to the pharmaceutical companies due to FDA bans on import prescription drugs, and the general distaste for -- and bans on -- herbal and natural remedies found among government regulators.  Moore also fails to examine how the costs of medical technology and pharmaceutical research, where the U.S. leads the world, would be supported and incentivized under his proposed universal health care bureaucracy.<br /><br />Moore touches on the idea that doctors and drug companies bill the insurers the maximum amount and the insurers then bill the employers and consumers the maximum amount.  But he fails to show how this will be any different under the proposed government health care voucher system.  Instead of the doctors and drug companies billing the insurers the maximum amount, they'll just be billing the government the maximum amount, and the government will pass the bill on to taxpayers.<br /><br />As usual in Moore fare, the distortions are heavy and are presented through anecdotal evidence.  I've never had a claim denied, and while I won't deny that it happens, the incidence can be greatly reduced by checking with the insurer by calling the number on your card before accepting treatment.  Moore would like you to think that everybody's claims are denied all the time.  Similarly, Moore would like you to think -- again based on anecdotes -- that there are no lines, no waiting periods, no deferrals in the Canadian and UK systems, and that the quality of care is categorically better than in the U.S.  Well, I could just as easily \\"anecdotally\\" prove him wrong based on Net acquaintances in those countries.  Moore would like you to believe that care decisions in Canada, the UK, and France are always made in the best interests of the patient and never turned into political decisions, but presents only the testimony of a few young doctors to make his case.<br /><br />It is up to us to determine whether we pile more government on top of a host of existing problems, mostly government-created, or allow people the freedom of choice to take care of themselves.  Look into Switzerland's health care system as a way market choice, with appropriate controls, can take care of everyone (and how more government turns it into a failure).<br /><br />There is one Republican Presidential candidate who has consistently advocated for your right as a consumer to choose your healthcare provider and to take tax deductions for all health-related costs; your right to use herbal and natural remedies as you see fit; your right as a consumer to purchase prescription drugs from any source you see fit; and the end of the HMO corporate welfare that is a result of the 1973 Act.<br /><br />It is up to you to reject Moore's assertion that government health care is the only way out of the mess we are in, and to vote accordingly.  Health care that meets everyone's needs can only come as the result of real competition in the marketplace; it cannot come in the form of piling more government on top of the system that has already been broken by government.in, and to vote accordingly.  Health care that meets everyone's needs can only come as the result of real competition in the marketplace; it cannot come in the form of piling more government on top of the system that has already been broken by government.

0440213525|1.0|This was one of the worst books I've ever read.  Normally, I really like Grisham's works, but this was just terrible.  The plot was very weak and the characters were unbelievable.  The \\"bad guys\\" are FBI and attorneys trying to solve a murder.  The \\"good guy\\" is an 11 year old boy, who won't talk about what he knows.  The story is completely ridiculous and the boy's attorney makes everything overly complicated.  The characters were just completely unbelievable.  And he made the \\"bad guys\\" completely incompetent.    I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|Breathtaking.<br /><br />I personally never went after bootlegs or rarities from any band, even the ones I really enjoy and have all the catalague, like AC/DC. So, for me, almost all the footage contained in this set was a first-time experience. I'm astonished.<br /><br />Everyhting is worth here, and for such a fair price we have a deluxe edition with almost 6 hours of music and interviews. Of course, AC/DC being AC/DC, there are no interviews made especifically for this set, which is a shame... Anyway, since this is not intended to be a official doccumentary, but a \\"videomentary\\" showing live performances since the beginning, it's understandable that the guys from AC/DC don't appear exclusively for this set.<br /><br />The high points are so many that it's not worth to listen them... the live version of \\"Gone Shooting\\" for VH1 is unbeliavably good and warm and gives you a hint of what these guys probably can do when they are just jamming for themselves... And what about \\"Ride On\\"?? Quite a surprise!<br /><br />A sad moment is when Bon, in an interview backstage, says that they are getting better and better, that great riffs and ideas are coming at full speed, and that he thinks this would go on forever...<br /><br />All in all, you just can't miss it.
B00007LTIL|5.0|American Beauty is an American beauty, a lush and evocative collection of blissed out, post-psychedelic country-folk-blues rock musings that simply haven't aged a bit. Unlike the feedback-heavy excursions and spaced out experimentation of their sixties output, the songs are this album are short and tightly constructed, with few guitar solos and mostly acoustic instruments. If albums like Live/Dead and Anthem Of The Sun were a trip, then American Beauty (and, for that matter its sister recording Workingman's Dead) is the comedown, the weary, wise, and hauntingly quiet morning after. This is exemplified by the gorgeous \\"Box Of Rain,\\" which surrounds its intro- (and extro-) -spective lyrics in a warm country influenced atmosphere, with strange melodies twisting off into your subconscious. \\"Friend Of The Devil\\" is full of rural blues imagery and quiet longing, while \\"Candyman\\" is gently apocalyptic. \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" is earthy and ecstatic rock, and \\"Operator\\" has lush, tight harmonies and a bouncy rhythm. The album closes with \\"Truckin'\\" a darkly celebratory account of life on the road set to fleet-footed blues-rock chug. This is one of the first great 70s albums, and a true classic.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|On the surface it is a historical movie about the work of William Wilberforce against the English participation in the African slave trade at the turn of the 19th century.<br />But i think that the writer's had much more to say about English society than this, things that are still important and ought to be considered.<br /><br />Their deeper criticism is about the hierarchical nature of English society, the rulers and the ruled, the elite landowning and servant owning class and the masses of people toiling in the farms, fields and factories. There are several places where this criticism breaks the surface of the movie: the scene where the servant steps over the fence and sits in the field with Wilberforce and together contemplate spider webs, the scene in Parliament where the Whig opposition leader asks Wilberforce \\"the people?\\", and the analogy of America opening the bottle of revolution and France pouring it out.<br /><br />The defenders of America slavery in the 19thC took the issue of the hierarchical nature of society very much to heart, Robert Dabney in defense of virginia, stated boldly that without a natural hierarchy and an elite of rulers, and an underclass of slaves, Christian society was doomed to a radical equalitarianism stemming from the French revolution's atheistic call of arms.<br /><br />Wilberforce himself was an independent, but he supported wholeheartedly the Tory administration of his friend William Pitt, elements of this friendship make up a substantial thread in Amazing Grace. It is the Tory flurtation with French revolutionary thought that gets Wilberforce and others in trouble during the war years with France. The movie firmly takes a stand not only against the slave trade, for the moral improvement program of Wilberforce, but for the gradual flattening of English society into a meritocratic democracy rather than the traditional Whiggish view of elitism, as the movie so aptly sums it up near the end in the term-\\"Nobilis oblige\\".<br /><br />What i find curious is that only one review here hints at the larger criticism of society that this movie attempts. Slavery is not a burning issue in our society, but wage-slavery (as the wobblies pointed out) is much the same thing, elitism and a heritary hierarchy without reference to individual achievement is a big problem in England and an increasing problem in Western culture in general and the US in particular. If you look at the movie in this way it becomes not so much a criticism of a form of economics which rightly died in the mid 19thC, but part of an ongoing struggle for genuine participation in political and social life for all people, not only the ruling classes.<br /><br />I think that the writers avoided strongly pursuing this theme because the current climate of the natural audience of the movie, Christians are far more aligned with Whiggish theories of history and economics then classical liberal Tory type views and they really couldnt sell the movie to this group if they had made the elements stronger. but the fact that in Christ there is no Jew nor Gentile, no rich or poor, the theme of the field scene about spider webs and such, is one of the greatest criticisms of a hierarchical society that mankind has ever believed.<br /><br />It is a good movie, just look a bit deeper than a historical piece about Wilberforce and the ending of the british slave trade. it is an amazing and productive period of history and i'm glad someone was able to make a somewhat popular movie about a few of the pieces of the puzzle that is the Whig-Tory 18-19thC dance.one review here hints at the larger criticism of society that this movie attempts.

B000Y179KO|4.0|The Eagles are back. This double album is the best priced CD EVER! $12.99 for 2 cd's is a welcome change. Many cd's of lesser quality charge that or more for ONE cd.     About the music...  There are some really energetic tunes here, such as Joe Walsh led \\"Guilty of a Crime\\" and Henley's \\"Fast Company\\" just to name a few. This album also has some tender, beautiful songs like \\"Cloudy Days.\\" There are also songs in between ROCK and SLOW. Don Henley is awesome as usual with \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\" and his vocals on the title track are amazing, as they are through the entire album. Glenn Frey is also in top form, delivering some emotional and beautiful vocals, and his songwriting is, as always, top notch. The harmonies are unmatched in rock today, making CSN&Y look like school boys. The first track, \\"No More Walks in the Woods\\" shows off their vocal skills like never before. AMAZING. The first single, \\"How Long\\" is a tune they have played since the 70's and never recorded. I am glad they finally recorded it!!!!!!    Basically, this double cd has something for anybody. I happen to have very diverse musical taste, so I like every song. Stop trying to compare their work to Hotel California... That album has already been made. Judge them on NOW, not THEN.     This is a great album and even if you do not like the entire album, there is something here for you.

B000UJCALI|5.0|The Shining is Stanley Kurbrik's movie adaption of Stephen King's novel. The story is about Jack Torrance and his family taking care of the OverLook Hotel for the winter. Strange hauntings and a break down of Jack's mind are the horror of this movie.     Jack and his wife Wendy look forward to go to such a large hotel and have it for themselves. Jack besides spending some time in seclucion wants to also write a book. Their only son Danny is nervous about going to the hotel, and doesn't seem all that excited. The reason for this is Danny has ESP, that has to do with seeing some past events in the form of images. The hotel has a very powerful effect on him, by allowing him to see ghosts. Danny somehow has a spirit also within him, that advises him and shows him images.    The family is shown the whole hotel by Dick Hallorann, a cook in the hotel while it's open. Dick has ESP of his own, but he doesn't seem to have a spirit within him. But he does see past events, for what he tells Danny in the kitchen of the hotel. There's a few odd haunting scenes, but no all gore or attacking like most horror ghost stories. Some of the ghosts seem to be a threat, others are manipulative.     Jack experinces his own problems, I didn't get this after viewing, but on Disc 2 they explain Jack has his own ESP. He doesn't try to understand it for what it's worth, or even tells anyone of what he sees of ghosts. I felt the isolation also got to Jack, unlike Wendy and Danny. Jack starts showing signs of disrespect for almost nothing when Wendy tries to talk to him. Even when she knows bad things are happening to Danny in the hotel, it just frustrates Jack even more.     Towards the end there is complete chaos from hauntings and from Jack. I liked the ending a lot. It's simple, but the last shot gives it all.     The camera angles and the hotel itself give a lot of the mood of the movie. It's a nice hotel, but you feel it's somehow not safe, especially with only 3 people there. The hotel is huge. My favorite is the Golden Ball room with it's high ceiling. It's shown a few times throughout the movie.    This is the newest version of the Shining. It features 2 discs, the WideScreen movie format for disc 1. I've read that you will be missing the top and bottom with this version. But you will get more of the sides.  Some people claim it was orginally fullscreen, some say widescreen.         Disc 2 features the making of the Shining, all by Stanley's daughter's. She uses the camera to show how the movie was made. Capturing the working of the actors, and showing Stanley's directing to them. Jack Nichlson and Shelly Duvall are mainly shown to tell how they felt about the expierence during and after the completion of the film. They show the sets and locations of the hotel. How they did some of their camera tricks to capture so many different angels and motion.
B000VLE3IS|4.0|I have everyone of Zep's studio releases except for In The Out Door and this collection of Led Zeppelin tunes represents the very best the lads produced IMHO. The sound quality is first rate. For the price, you can't beat it. Hey, they throw in a DVD for Pete's sake! The concert footage takes me back to a show I was fortunate enough to witness. I will never forget Jimmy Page playing his guitar with that bow! Fantastic!!! If you haven't shelled out for any of the previous compilations then by all means purchase this set. If you have other collections of Led Zeppelin, I would hesitate to recommend this unless you are a completist. All in all a near perfect Zeppelin investment. I await the live recording if the upcoming concert. And you know...\\"big legged woman ain't got no soul\\".  - Ciao
B0007LXPBI|3.0|I have to say I prefer the original.  This version is very well done, but it's a little too sexy for my kids, at least as it regards the new wife-to-be.  Made me squirm when we all watched it.    Lindsay Lohan was undeniably cute in this film, as was Dennis Quaid.  And the way the story was tweaked was nice, a new twist.  ButI'm very glad that we have the original on DVD, because we like it better.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Wow! I remember hearing Santana when I was in high school. A fellow freshman played Treat on the piano for me one day and I was blown away. Then later I saw the band play in the movie Woodstock and I was mesmerized by the fantastic latin grooves and Carlos Santanta's blistering guitar, not to mention the teenage drum prodigy of Michael Shrieve. This is Carlos Santana at his very best without stooping to enlisting the latest brand name pop stars of the period. Viva La Santana - Ciao
B000NDIAWY|5.0|...and I'm straight. Just can't stop listening to her.  And I'm not normally obsessive about music.  She's immensely talented and honest and hopefully we'll all be singing her praises when she's, well, 64. Cannot wait for her next release.     She's a little bit country, but mostly folk in the vein of Indigo Girls, yet an original.  Thought-provoking and introspective but not depressing.    It would be hard to overestimate how good this release is.  It's even better than her debut and that was absolutely GREAT.  She's a keeper for sure.
0143038419|4.0|To sum up this book and all the people I talked to about it who've read it: you'll either love it or hate it.  It seems to be controversial -- like a Virginia Woolf's \\"A Room of One's Own\\" was when it came out.        I personally liked the book and it struck a chord with me.  While some will say that the author is selfish, I applaud her courage for taking the journey she did as unorthodox as it was.  The author readily acknowledges that such a journey is not for everyone.  The author left her marriage because she was unhappy -- why should she have stayed just to be miserable and probably make those around her miserable as well?  Why does that make her selfish?  The author took her year-long trip as a means to regroup and find a new equilibrium given all the changes and upheaval in her life (which I don't perceive as \\"kooky\\").  She did what she needed to do: she took care of herself and healed her spirit after her life did not turn our as she thought it would.  The writing was very honest and elicited feelings of empathy as a reader.

B0009R1T7M|4.0|The album as a whole doesn't always make the grade, but aspects of it I found well worth the price of admission. For example, I found Casimir Pulasky Day overwhelmingly heartfelt and John Wayne Gacy, Jr haunting.     The negative posts on this album repeatedly complain that Gacy fails to create sympathy... that doesn't seem to be the intent; rather, the intent seems to me to point out the common depravity of human nature. Call it trite if you want, but if you find that you can't see your own façade covered ugliness you are in denial.     Some melodies, after several listens, reveal an interesting complexity; one reviewer stated that \\"nobody would be humming this at work,\\" which is only true if you didn't' listen to it more than twice or you don't recognize melodies more complex than the latest pop song. Unfortunately several of the tunes are simplistic, repetitive, poorly orchestrated and consequently not \\"hum-worthy.\\"     A mixed bag, but ultimately my life is richer having listened to it 30 some times then it would have been had I never heard of it at all.
B000UR366S|1.0|I'm a huge (as in adoring) fan of Joni's, but on Shine she once again, as she's been doing during this latter part of her career, shares chanted cliches without the barest hint of melody, throws some instrumentation in the background and calls it, I suppose, jazz. Well, I'm also a jazz fan, and this just doesn't cut it. Too bad she's become this deluded, but the fact is, I put out money for this CD and am not happy about it. You can't lament war and the eroding environment at the same time you're ripping people off. She's desperately unhappy with anyone who dares mention these glaring deficiencies, but they are the 400-pound gorilla in the room. I dare anyone to whistle the music from this CD. There isn't any. But you can whistle Miles Davis and Thelonius Monk compositions. By eschewing melody she has not joined their ranks. I'll put on some Blue or Court & Spark and try to forget I ever heard Shine.

Escpecially since I could not stand Spiderman 2.<br /><br />I did enjoy this film and would recommend it to most, but I do think the movie tried to be bigger than it needed to be.  Probably because of the success of the first two films the writers felt the need to add more to this one.  There were too many characters and not enough time to explore them.<br /><br />The Sandman storyline did not fit in this film and probably should have been left out.  I think that character could have made a good story on its own.  This movie was about man's dark side and how our narcissistic egos and what happens when we lose control of them.<br /><br />The film should have focusedsolely on Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry. The inclusion of Gwen Stacy adds turmoil as well as Eddy Brock.  The movie should have focused here and left out the confusion of the Sandman.<br /><br />I am not sure how I felt about the ending.  I am fine with the movie turning away from the comic book, but I am not sure it fits well.<br /><br />Still, this is a good film and I was not disappointed with it.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I wish people would focus on the product being reviewed, rather than the person who released the product; if you only want to [...] about Britney's personal life, go rant on your blog.      Now, on to my review of \\"Blackout\\":    I find it curious that after years of hearing that Britney can't sing, people are now complaining that there's not enough of her voice on the album and far too many special effects.  Her vocals are present and fine; on a few tracks, yes, they are too subdued beneath the electronica-style music.  Otherwise, I think the ratio of vocals to music works well enough; if you're not into electronica/techno/trance styled dance music, then you won't like this album, whether or not you like the artist--try something else, this isn't for you.  If you like energetic, eclectic music--give it a try, you might be surprised.    \\"Gimme More\\" is a strong song, worthy of being the first single, with its addictive, catchy beat; I wish the chorus had been left out at least once in favor of another verse--otherwise, I have no complaints.    \\"Piece of Me\\" is a great retort to the idiot tabloid press and paparazzi who stalk her night and day; it's also a great, simply stated, commentary on our society's obsession-gone-too-far with celebrity.    \\"Radar\\" was not a favorite of mine originally, but it has since grown on me--it's one of the few songs where her vocals are over-processed with the \\"vocoder\\" used for many of the \\"special effects\\" on the album.  A definite club-friendly song, however; could easily be a future single.    \\"Break the Ice\\"--one of several favorites of mine; I like the intro. to the song in particular, view it as an apology to her fans for being absent from the music scene for so long.  A great beat, lyrics and vocals all woven together exactly right.    \\"Heaven on Earth\\"--This recalls \\"Outrageous\\" with its listing of various characteristics interspersed with standard lyrics and set against a quick-paced rhythm; it is like a modernized \\"I Feel Love\\"(by Donna Summer)in temperament.  And I like that one lyric, \\"I fall off the edge of my mind\\";that says it all!!    \\"Get Naked(I Got A Plan)\\"--This is a great, sexy dance song; whether or not it becomes a single, it needs to be performed in concert!!  Britney could really cut loose, here--with the right choreography and dancers backing her up, perhaps as a combination with \\"Touch of My Hand\\".  Some great, NC-17 level, remixes could come from this song, but the U.S. is too prudish overall for such things; perhaps it could be done as a European release.    \\"Freakshow\\"--Brevity has never sounded better; just under 3 minutes, it recalls \\"Outrageous\\" also--all the wonderful, freaky mischief that adults can indulge in, but usually viewed as \\"forbidden\\".    \\"Toy Soldier\\"--My favorite above all others on this album, it is wonderfully \\"strange\\" in its styling...something different and undeniably cool!!  I love the simulated drum beats; the lyrics are delightfully campy and perfectly sung(as if Britney were pouting about putting up with one too many poseurs, looking for the perfect guy).  This is the most interesting song I've heard in a long time, from Britney or anyone else!    \\"Hot As Ice\\"--I would've titled it \\"Cold As Fire\\", as its leaked version was called.  Still, it's a good, mid-tempo dance song and one where you can hear her vocals very clearly, without any effects obscuring them.    \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\"--A generic title, yet another spectacular song.  Her voice is front and center, the rhythm is a-rockin', and the lyrics ring true--however simply stated they may be.  I would like to see this become a future single, also; it's more than worthy.    \\"Perfect Lover\\"--Her vocals are more breathy and sex-kittenish here, but that's what she's known for and this is the perfect song to play that up with.  A mostly sedate rhythm later kicks into higher gear; a nice contrast with her vocals throughout.    \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\"--The only obviously autobiographical song on the album; she should do more of these.  Not to overexpose herself, as the tabloid press has already done for her out of greed; but to prove just how human she really is.  The most low-key track, ballad-like; its placement on an album that is otherwise Britney's answer to \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" may seem odd to some and I wasn't sure of it at first, either.  But it does wrap up everything very smoothly.    I only gave this album 4 stars because of the few times Britney's vocals were too subdued and a few special effects on some songs that I would've edited out or tweaked in some way.  Except for those minor criticisms(and others as listed above), I think this is an excellent \\"comeback\\" album.  Bring on the singles, videos, concert tour...all of it.  (If Britney can resolve all her personal issues satisfactorily along the way, so much the better for her; I wish her well in her endeavors, personal and professional.)  She is the rightful heiress apparent to Madonna, and it's time for her to reclaim the throne, at long last.
0195170776|5.0|I hope hardback is the only option! This is a full dictionary in a font that you can read without a magnifying glass. Many people only use the computer to check words, but having a dictionary in the house is vital for when you have a quick question and the computer is not on or the internet is down or you want more than a two sentence definition fast. This book is a gem for scrabble lovers (the scrabble dictionary sucks and is missing too many words). Definitions are well put and it includes history of many words and an occasional drawing. The only dictionary if you are an American word snob in my opinion; my editor friends agree.
B000784WMW|3.0|This version is like watching a video of a stage production.  It's okay, but the Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens is so much better.
B000002BBY|5.0|Had this album forever. Never got tired of it. still not tired of it. turned me into the superfan that i am.
B00004TVG7|5.0|This is one of the most - if not the most - peculiar recordings I own. Introduced to me by the owner of a classical music store/musician, I was at first stunned by the shock of primaeval rhythms and atonal soundscapes; but the intensely curious historian in me piqued my attention. Different from anything (I deliberately seek out the strange and unusual in music) we might hear in the world today, this album transports me into an almost hypnotic state in which my imagination runs rampant across the centuries. As a historian, I crave the full experience of past cultures: art, music, science, society, philosophy, politics, any aspect that deepens my understanding and knowledge.<br /><br />I love the impeccable research that went into this production: the reconstruction of ancient Greek instruments based on sculptures and vases, the reconstruction of contemporary notations, and the attempt at ancient pronounciations (very strange). I am aware of the differences between ancient and modern Greek as my mother has studied ancient Greek for decades - she owns scholarly recordings of individuals speaking Homerian Greek for the stage (unnatural, drawn out, with crescendos and diminuendos). How accurate is mere supposition. But this recording is strikingly similar. Also fascinating is that manuscript (papyri) gaps were filled in with logic and imagination; what painstaking work. Even so, the compositions are short.<br /><br />It is not entirely ancient Greek: there is Roman piece, and post CE pieces. This does not interfere with the overall impression, however. The sounds here are not melodic, but dissonant, rough, grating, sharply delineated, but utterly compelling. And if one listens long enough, there is a method to all this madness, much like peeling an onion: persistence pays off, and further layers of delight are revealed. As a side note, I have often played this for friends, even those whose tastes are more conventional than mine. Everyone has loved it.<br /><br />A favourite; a treat for the senses.enses.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I write this as a 51-yr old boomer. In the 70s, I enjoyed the early countrified Eagles -- 'Take it Easy' and 'Peaceful Easy Feeling' for instance. As they got bigger, I lost interest. I never disliked them, but I found them a little generic. I liked Joe Walsh as a solo performer, but never really thought he meshed well as an Eagle. However, even though I panned it at the time, I have come to recognize 'Hotel California' as a very good, near-great LP. During the 80s and forward, I have enjoyed some of their solo work, especially Henley's 'End of the Innocence.' So when I learned of this effort, my expectations were modest. I find, however, that this album is a delightful surprise. These guys are sharp pros; they have retained the signature Eagles sound, and they establish a solid groove that percolates through all the tunes on both discs. There is a lot of variety, they trade leads, they do rockers and ballads, and they do them all well. The important thing, and perhaps the hardest part for veterans like this, is to make the product fresh. Are they reaching back, doing the same stuff over again (like, unfortunately, Van Morrison), or are they charting new ground? Well, there is no great breakthrough here, but nor does this sound like old guys staying in their comfy shoes. This won't be the most challenging music you'll hear in 2007, but it will surely be among the most satisfying.
B000X9NI5W|5.0|Don't have a long review to write.  This is deep, affecting stuff.  If you truly enjoy music, it's a must.
B00005JKHP|4.0|I ordered this on November 8th, it just arrived yesterday, and let me began by saying, this film was AWESOME! The special effects seemed a bit dated by today's starndards, buy they were nonetheless, impressive. The film does have a bit of a slow pace though, and if you're not a fan of Star Trek, you probably wouldn't like it. I can't comment on the DVD extras because I haven't watched them yet. Directed by Robert Wise, this film marked the return of Star Trek after a 10 year hiatus. I highly recommend it!
B000WS4PCO|5.0|That this album is brilliance of the highest level goes without saying, and if you want to know about the album itself, go read about the 400+ reviews for the original CD printing.  I'm not here to talk about that today - I'm here to review the remastering job, and for that this album gets five stars.  The whole album is cleaner and with less noise.  Specifically, compared to the original printing:  1. Adam's bass is deeper and absolutely huge,   2. Bono's vocals are more pure and realistic sounding and sit better in the mix, and vocal harmonies are cleaner and better balanced  3. Larry's drums are more natural sounding and also bigger and cleaner-sounding with less \\"fuzz\\" around the hits,  4. The Edge's guitar textures sound even better, cleaner, more layered and complexities are more easily heard, and  5. the overall mix is much better balanced, with every instrument heard better.    The best examples of this are in the first 2:15 or so of \\"With or Without You.\\"  I listened to this track most closely for specifics at first, because I feel it is one of the best technically recorded tracks on the album (and of all time...).  I formed these conclusions based on that track's listening, then I listened to each track alternating the \\"original\\" and \\"2007\\" CD's, which confirmed all of the statements above.  On \\"With or Without You,\\" listen to these specific elements for their depth, clarity, balance, and natural timbre:    0:00 noise floor, toms   0:05 hat/tambourine hits  0:10 bass (this continues big and beautiful throughout)  0:17 lead guitar  0:29 vocals  0:42 lead guitar with echo  0:53 Bono inhales  1:09 tom eighth-note hits  1:26 guitar layers  1:35 \\"I can't live...\\"  1:45 drums  1:52 lead guitar  2:06 vocal harmonies  And the song's climax at 3:03 is also very distinct, each instrument sounding better and more easily distinguished, the overall mix better balanced.    One of the best remastering jobs I've ever heard (Miles Davis's Kind of Blue is another of my favorites).  Bravo to the engineers for presenting this classic, brilliant album in an even more euphonically beautiful package than ever before.  Even if you own the original album, buy the new remaster.    Note: Listening done on a Kenwood SE7 mini-component HiFi system with stock 10\\" bookshelf two-way near-field stereo speakers (came as complete system).  Amp is in \\"pure A\\" mode, preset EQ called \\"NB 1,\\" which has slightly enhanced bass and treble ('smile pattern').

B000WMEAKC|5.0|Colorado rock band, OneRepublic, releases their stellar debut album \\"Dreaming Out Loud.\\" As Timbaland's special project, OneRepublic has become a recent rising success with their #1 hit \\"Apologize\\" becoming the biggest radio hit in history. \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" is a common rock album with strong, meaningful lyrics and superior artistic production similar to that of The Fray's \\"How to Save a Life.\\"    The album starts out with \\"(Say) All I Need\\" a very good rock ballad with heavy Imogen Heap-like production and soaring heartfelt vocals. The album continues with \\"Stop & Stare,\\" OneRepublic's next official single. OneRepublic sings \\"Stop and stare. I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere. Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared. But I've become what I can't be.\\" The album persists with strongly produced and well sung songs. The album comes to an end with the #1 hit \\"Apologize,\\" featuring Timbaland. The songs on \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" are perfectly mixed, written, and sung.    With not a bad track to be found on the entire album, OneRepublic's new album, \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" is a solid debut fully living up to the success of their massive #1 hit \\"Apologize.\\"    Download: Stop & Stare, Tyrant, Prodigal, All We Are, Apologize    4.5/5 stars

0316067598|5.0|Luttrell offers an exceptional account of life on the edge.  In remote areas of Afganistan, you rely on your team & what you can carry.  The Ops detail is excellent and you feel a renewed sense of patriotism when you learn what these men did.  Truth is, there are few individuals like this in our society today.  Those with a 'higher calling' for the nations service.    He spends some time 'jabbing' at the politicians but I believe it has some merit.   Now, when I think of terrorism, I'm more thankful for guys like Luttrell, in the sea, air and on the ground.   Good Bless Texas.
1596912855|4.0|The rough scenario is as follows: A thirty-something \\"Darcy-obssessed\\" professional inherits a \\"gift\\" from a wealthy aunt who passes away. Her prize is an all-expense-paid trip to a resort for Austen fans (Penbrook estate). At the resort the guests and actors dress-up and live out the lives of the upper crust gentry in early 19th century England.    I really enjoyed this one, and yes I have to admit that I am a fan of Jane Austen's novels, as well as, most of the screen adaptations of her glorious works. She was definitely ahead of her time.    But I also believe that even if you're only slightly familar with Austen's stories, you'll enjoy this light-hearted, humorous chic-lit and will find something to love in this unique, perhaps a bit far-fetched \\"G rated\\" romance.    If you are looking for smut or graphic love scenes than this book is not for you. I found that the creative and clever writing style of Shannon Hale was enough to carry this story without the \\"R\\" or \\"X\\" rated scenes usually found in a romance novel--it was refreshing to say the least.    I whole-heartedly agree with another reviewer that this story could make a very cute movie.    If you like the authors, Sophie Kinsella, and Jennifer Crusie, and can make do without any descriptive sex scenes, (nobody gets naked in this one--not even close) than I think you may enjoy \\"Austenland\\" as I did. I recommend this one.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Oh my god, this is a fun dance album and fun to listen to.  But the talent is in the production.  Britney has never had a voice that deserves a second listen.  She is background to her wonderful production excess, but just about anyone could substitute for her singing(?) ability.  Britney's limited singing talent can be effectively used for sampling, but there is nothing substantial here.  She has hired the right people to keep her career alive, but really who cares?  Just think...who does she sing better than?  No one.     She is a lucky gal being able to turn her minor talent into a major career.  Don't get me wrong, if you buy this CD, you will probably enjoy it; it is fun.  But it is not Britney that is the talent here.  This is just a production album.
B00000420F|5.0|Even for the non opera afficianado, these beautiful songs, rendered with exquisite style and grace and meticulous accompaniment,make for enthralling listening. I listen to this album more than any other I have ever owned. I simply never get tired of the songs. It is a true collection that builds one on the other. It becomes totally engrossing placing the listener in a world all its own.

B000OY8NII|5.0|Eureka was the Sci-Fi Network's most sucssesful Original show, and for good reason. Regardless if you were a science fiction freak or a newbie, the combination of characters and humor in the writing and acting (and probably the directing) made the first season a wonderful joy to watch! I enjoyed (almost) every episode, especially because of Sheriff Carter's performance and the interaction with the other actors in the town. I havent had much time to watch the bonus features, but the TV series alone is good enough for me!<br /><br />One complaint, though, is that it seems they put the DVD together in origional series order and not in airing order, so some story arcs are out of whack...
B000VZC4CQ|5.0|Not much I can write about Closer which hasn't already been said--many times over--in the 25+ years since it was first released.  It's a likely choice as the most essential post-punk recording (a difficult decision, given the competition, from that fertile era:  how can one not mention Gang of Four, or Wire, or...?)    While Unknown Pleasures is great; Closer is near perfection.  Among its rare qualities:  brilliant sequencing, with many of the most emotionally-wrenching tracks held back until nearly the end.  (So many mediocre LPs have been front-loaded with singles, followed by crap which shouldn't ever have been released).    Then there's its depth:  how it continues to reward attentive listening, even after you've heard it hundreds of times.  I never felt capable of truly understanding \\"Decades\\" until I'd lived a few decades myself.    It was nothing less than a work of genius, how Ian Curtis (in his early-to-mid-twenties) went so deeply inside the dark core of his psyche.  Not merely his own, but the human psyche.  Few dare to introspect with such painful clarity, and Ian's history indicates the journey was too hazardous, as I imagine it would be for most of us.    When someone you love takes their own life, the question \\"why?\\" is always close to the surface.  But when you hear Ian's songs on Closer, you never wonder.  You KNOW his inner world was an eternal grey void too painful to endure.    If your own soul is bent and brittle, you feel the odd comfort (like a familiar friend) of knowing:  someone else has struggled under the same inexplicable weight.  Other times, it's too much--too close to home--and you need hit \\"stop\\" and shut it off.    The packaging of this reissue evokes memories of Peter Saville's graphic design on the original LP, while avoiding misguided attempts to fully mimic that format in miniature (cardboard sleeves are a poor choice for CDs; the discs tend to get scratched, and it's no small bother to remove and re-insert the CDs each time you listen).    One quibble:  hopefully the liner notes are fascinating, but I can't read them.  The text is almost microscopic!  I'll be forced to put the booklet on my scanner, in order to get the words on my PC's screen at a readable size.  (Those of us who heard Joy Division as teens are now reaching bifocal age.)
B000WTNCQS|5.0|I am not going to get into a review of the music on \\"The Joshua Tree\\"  because, quite frankly, if you are looking at the remastered version and have not been living on an island the past 20 years, you should already know all you need to know about the musical content of this album.    I will also preface this review by saying I have heard this album in many formats - LP, cassette, original pressing 1987 CD and a later mid-90's issue CD which had slightly different packaging but no noticeable sound improvement.    There is NO doubt that the remastered version of this CD is far, far superior.  I did buy the \\"Super Deluxe\\" version of this re-issue, but I have no idea what to tell you about the bonus CD or DVD as I have not listened/watched to either of those.  However, as for the CD proper, this is a far richer and sonically improved album; it's really like discovering \\"The Joshua Tree\\" all over again.    Whichever version of the remastered CD you buy, I promise you that you will be very pleased.  If you are pressed for cash, just get the single disc CD.  There is no reason to listen to one more second of the old, tinny, flat, poor quality previous master of this CD.    Now... if only we could get remastered versions of War, The Unforgettable Fire and Achtung Baby...
B000WTNCQS|4.0|So...  Just like 20yrs, 8mos ago, I was standing in front of the local CD retailer to be the first to pick up The Joshua Tree.  I succeeded yet again.  :-)    Being the looney that I am, I bought the \\"one-up your friends\\" version with the DVD and the book.  I've had a little time with each of the above, and I thought I'd share my findings with those who WEREN'T the first in line to grab the 20th Anniv. Ed.    The first CD, the reissue of the original material, is what you're REALLY buying this for, of course.  I haven't listened to every second of the CD yet, but after listening to about 20mins of it (pieces of every song), it definitely is an improvement over the original release.  Whereas the 1987 release sounded murky and muddy, with poorly-defined bass being its worst \\"feature\\", the new one is noticeably clearer.  It won't knock your socks off, but they did clean it up.  It also plays a little bit louder than the original, but not massively so.    The best feature of disc 1?  They no longer have the end of \\"One Tree Hill\\" cut off and tacked onto the beginning of \\"Exit\\"...  The chapter break (or whatever you call it) is now in the right place.  I don't know if later pressings of The Joshua Tree had this problem, but my first-run copy did (and does).    The second disc is mostly material that we've seen before, either as b-sides or in the singles collection of a few years back.  Only the last five tracks are \\"new\\", or at least new in the sense that you probably haven't heard them before unless you're a fanatic.  I'm not going to review these songs, or indeed the rest of the audio, since if you're interested in buying this set you probably don't care if the add'l material is any good, now do you?    The DVD, however, could affect your decision about whether or not to buy this set instead of the audio-only set.  To the contrary of the logo on the back of the box, the video material is NOT in Dolby Digital.  I thought that I'd made a mistake with the setup of my player, but after switching back and forth between a couple of other discs, I can only conclude that this is in fact NOT in surround sound.    The concert on the disc is a good show, near as I can tell after a half-hour of watching.  It's shot on video (in 4:3, like all the video on the disc) and is filmed at least partially at night, so there are occasional instances where the stage lights \\"smear\\" as the camera pans across them, but it's nowhere NEAR as bad as the Red Rocks show (which I bet we'll NEVER see on DVD).  It's interesting to finally have an official video from the era that's not \\"Rattle and Hum\\", and the performance of the band at the peak of its powers is quite engaging.    The two music videos are interesting but, again, nothing earth-shattering.  The alternate video of \\"With or Without You\\" isn't a giant departure from the one we're all familiar with, but I will say I'm glad they didn't use that one.  The video for \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" is presently up on YouTube so you can take a gander and decide whether or not you think it's something you MUST have.    The documentary is pretty cool (again, from what I've seen of it).  It even includes video of the shooting of the now-famous Time Magazine cover, among other things.  I think this and the concert make the DVD worthwhile.    Also in the box is the hardback book and a few photos.  The pictures are Anton Corbijn shots that are printed on heavy paper stock and sheathed in a cardboard envelope.  They're \\"suitable for printing\\", as they say, but I'll probably just leave them in the box.  The hardback book contains pieces written by several of the gents responsible for the original record, some more photos, the lyrics to all the songs, and several pages of credits at the end.  A nice piece that I haven't read every page of yet, but I will definitely set aside a half hour to pore through it.    So there you have it.  I'm giving this four stars instead of five because of the decision to not mix the audio for the DVD into Dolby Digital or DTS.  Another reason for the 4 stars is that I feel the remastering could've been a little more impressive...  It should've been in the SACD or the DVD-A format, for instance, and a little more time could have been taken to make it even clearer-sounding.    I'm sure that Island will happily produce a hi-res audio version of this at a later time and I can buy The Joshua Tree AGAIN.

B000VWYNNW|4.0|Nice package great sound but one very glaring unfortunate edit during the funky \\"Crunge\\" break down in Whole Lotta Love. The original SRTS Whole Lotta Love is clearly superior with a great little excerpt of just killer Led funk. Dazed and Confused is nearly three minutes longer and sounds excellent . Moby Dick is a track that was improved. Still I can't understand what happened and why would Mr. Page make such a horrible edit on Whole Lotta Love??? Please Jimmy fix it now!!! Its like erasing the smile on the Mona Lisa...its just wrong.  Still I recommend it for the extra tracks but beware of track edits.  Several other tracks were shorten as well.
B000YABV90|5.0|\\"August Rush\\" is a fairy tale. It doesn't have princes, princesses, evil stepmothers, witches, or big bad wolves, but it's a fairy tale nonetheless. And as such, it tells a story that resonates so strongly with its audience that it casts a magic spell. This movie is told in the language of music, and it exemplifies the harmonic connections between people, the rhythmic bonds that can never be broken in spite of distance and time. It's also told in the language of faith, of the belief that love will indeed conquer all. No, this is not a realistic idea, but that's not the point. Isn't it nice that we have films like this to escape to when realism is bringing us down? Isn't it wonderful when we find that one film that can raise our spirits? \\"August Rush\\" was that film for me, and I recommend it to anyone in need of a rejuvenating emotional boost.    The film stars Freddie Highmore as an orphan named Evan Taylor, a quiet yet determined musical prodigy. He was born as the result of a chance encounter between two musicians: an Irish rock guitarist named Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and a classically trained American cellist named Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell). While living in New York City, they met and separated through twists of fate--Lyla's controlling father (William Sadler) doesn't take the news of her unplanned pregnancy very well, and when she's hit by a car and injured, he uses that opportunity to make her believe that her baby did not survive. In reality, the baby was delivered and put into the legal system as a parentless orphan. Lyla and Louis go their separate ways, believing that they would never see each other again.    In the present day, their eleven-year-old son Evan lives in an orphanage with a number of broken-spirited boys. They're so disillusioned that they bully him into believing as they do. They constantly tell him that no one is coming for him, that his ability to hear music in everything makes him nothing more than a freak. And they will not stand for his belief that he actually hears the music of his parents calling out to him. But Evan refuses to sink to their level of hopelessness; he runs away to New York City, where the music seems to be beckoning him towards his destiny. It's there he meets Wizard (Robin Williams), a shady musician who houses a number of musically inclined children in an abandoned theater. He, too, is beaten down by life, so much so that he uses these children for his own financial gain. When he discovers Evan's natural ability to play the guitar, he gives him the pseudonym August Rush and forces him to perform in parks and on street corners.    Lyla, meanwhile, is living in Chicago as a music teacher. Single and without any children, she seems complacent yet stable in her new life. But all that changes when (1) she's offered a change to once again play with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and (2) she learns that her baby did not die eleven years ago. With a powerful yet unexplainable determination, she travels back to New York on a quest to find her long lost son, a quest that will hopefully be added by her playing of the cello. Hoping to help find Evan is Richard Jeffries (Terrence Howard), a social worker who met the boy when he was still living at the orphanage.    And then, of course, there's Louis, who has since gone on to be a businessman in San Francisco. His band members haven't forgiven him for leaving, least of all his brother, Marshall (Alex O'Loughlin). But worst of all, Louis hasn't been able to forgive himself, and upon seeing footage of himself performing on stage, he remembers the love he felt for Lyla. The memory is so strong that's he vows to reunite with her. This journey of finding lost love leads him from Chicago back to New York City, where he's inspired to rejoin with his band and restart his singing career. Much like his son--whom he doesn't know exists--Louis is a gifted guitar player; one can hear his passion and energy with every chord, and his music operates at the same frequency as Lyla's cello playing.    As you can probably tell, most of the film thrives on serendipity, and it gets more and more prominent with every passing scene. A kind-hearted pastor eventually takes Evan in, and when made aware of his musical genius, they send him to the Julliard School of Music. He composes a piece within the first six months of his stay, one that the faculty believes is good enough to be performed. Thus sets into motion the events leading to one of the most satisfying endings of any movie I've seen this year, a scene so touching that I was in awe. As I listened to Evan's \\"August's Rhapsody,\\" I felt as if I had been enveloped in the folds of hope, love, and happiness; the earthiness of the chimes blended perfectly with the smoothness of the violins and the energy of the guitars, all of which made his unwavering faith in the power of connection perfectly clear.    This is the magic of \\"August Rush,\\" a film so wonderful that I cannot recommend it enough. It's a modern day fable with a timeless message, and it comes across so well that I never once stopped to consider how implausible it is. Plausibility doesn't even come into play, here. What does come into play is the emotional impact, the sense that we can get something out of it if we surrender to pure fantasy. Evan opens the film by saying, \\"Music is all around us--all we have to do is listen.\\" This is one of the year's best films, and if you keep that quote in mind when seeing it, you'll be more inclined to agree.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|First off, this is a great movie!  An oldie, but a good one, As are the other three Phantasm movies!<br /><br />Yet why is it that Anchorbay has made the complete Phantasm movie set (along with a bonus DVD and ALL the movies are in a very cool silver ball with daggers sticking out) available to Region 2 (Europe) people, and not for Region 1 (America)?  First released back in 2005 and still not out for R1!!!<br /><br />Yes, if you have a DVD player that plays all regions (see review on the Phillips DVD player if you're interested), you can purchase that set through Amaazon UK (then convert the English Pound to the American dollar for your total which as of today is approx.  2:1...$5 USA dollars is equal to ten British pounds). However I don't know why it's not available for Region 1 people??<br /><br />You can see the silver ball Phantasm DVD set at the Amazon UK web page.

B000002KCC|5.0|Tonight's the Night is not an easy album to love. It comes from a dark, ugly place of human existence known only as 'the bottom', a place only a few of us have ever really been and where none of us want to linger. It's also where Neil was when he made it. Still wracked with guilt over the overdose death of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, a death he blamed himself for, Neil took refuge in booze, drugs, and music. The result of that witches brew is Tonight's the Night. This drunken, stoned, and grieving record is sloppy, sounds horrible, and is as raw as a tooth ache. It's also one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard. It's Neil at his most heartfelt, as he tries to come to terms with his part in Danny's death, who's lead vocals on Come On baby Let's Go Downtown take on the haunting feel of a voice from beyond the grave. The song stands as a reminder that you may go downtown, but one day you may not come back. The fact that Danny didn't come back, and Neil's struggle to come to terms with it all, drives the album. We see a snapshot of an artist who's  seen the top of the mountain, sold millions of records, and paid a terrible price for it all. Survivor guilt, combined with rock star fame and a misguided attempt to drink, smoke, and drug it all go away make for a truly remarkable record. One that's worthy of the lofty rating of five stars.     Tonight's the Night isn't a happy, cheery album. It's not something to cuddle with your girlfriend to, or play as background music at your holiday party. But when it's 3 AM and all the whiskey in the world can't make you feel and better about the way things are, put on Tonight's the Night. It may not make things better, but at least your misery will have company.

B000VWYNNW|2.0|As much as I agree with the other reviewers of this title that is has supurb sound, the rest of it is a very big let down. When the movie and sountrack came out in 1976, they were two seperate items. Now what has happened is that they took the remixed soundtrack from the movie itself and put it onto the CD. What's wrong with that is that there are a lot of bad edits in the movie that were transfered over to the CD itself. That did not happen in 1976. THIS IS TOTALLY UNEXCEPTABLE. I cannot believe that Jimmy Page would alow this to happen. If you want to save yourself some money this holiday season, buy the DVD and listen to the music. Don't waste your time on the CD (I would take mine back for a refund if I could). I am so happy I didn't get rid of my original copy.     As a hard-core fan who has been waiting over 20 years for this to come out, I do not recommend it at all. A very big disappointment.
1594489505|5.0|The book begins with Mariam in Kabul, a child that was unwelcomed by her mother and Jalil, her father, was ashamed of having. Jalil had three wives and was a very wealthy man, as well as other children by them. Mariam always looked forward to her father's visits every Thursday when they would have their time together. Mariam's mother Nana had a severe emotional disorder, and when one day, Mariam decides to sneak over to her father's mansion in Herat, not returning home, Nana commits suicide by hanging herself from a rope tied to a tree. Mariam is overcome with grief and blames herself for her mom's death. Jalil can only take Mariam in for a day or two before he has to make other arrangements. His other family is shamed by Mariam's presence, and so therefore Mariam is not allowed to remain there. She is very angry with her father when Jalil makes arrangements with an older man, Rasheed, who is a shoemaker. The wedding takes place quickly to get Mariam off of her dad's hands in spite of her protestations. As she is carried off my Rasheed, she tells her father she wants nothing to do with him ever again. And thus begins a hard life ahead.    Rasheed carries Mariam off to Herat, and though nice at the very first, turns mean and abusive to Mariam. She has to cook his meals just so and everything. And things really turn terrible when she becomes pregnant, and Rasheed expects a son. Mariam loses the baby though pretty quickly, and ever after is horrible to Mariam. She tries to endure Rasheed's behaviors with courage, but it is often very difficult.     On the next side of the story, Mariam gets acquainted with Fariba, another woman who is a neighbor there. The two women make friends for a while until they both separate through war in Afghanistan. Fariba goes on to have children, two boys and a girl, Laila.     Fariba becomes very weak and depressed, and her daughter Laila, sweet girl that she is, is always trying to help her mother. And when tragedy strikes, and she losesboth brothers to fighting in the war, her mother is permanently grief stricken. Laila carries on and has a special friend, Tariq, whom she falls in love with as well as being his best friend. Tariq looks after Laila, protecting her. Laila is absolutely devastated though, when Tariq and his family must leave Afghanistan and travel on to Pakistan first, and the Peshawar. Before they leave, she and Tariq make love to one another before saying their goodbyes. It would be an even more difficult road after this.    When Laila and her family made the decision to leave Afghanistan too, they had started to sell all of their goods to make money before leaving there. They had almost finished getting all of their items into a taxi when a horrible explosion took place. Laila's parents perished almost instantly, and Laila survived it, being left behind.     Laila's path will cross with Mariam and Rasheed's when she is left in their home to heal. In the meantime, Rasheed, rotten man that he is, takes a sexual interest in Laila, and wants to marry her also. After Mariam hears this, she comes to despise Laila. But that doesn't matter. Rasheed does what he wants and everyone must obey. Laila is pregnant soon, but not with Rasheed's child as he thought, but she had become pregnant with Tariq before he went on his way. A girl, Aziza is born, and Rasheed despises this child, and becomes very abusive to Laila afterwords, just the way he is to Mariam all the time. Later, Laila would become pregnant with his natural son, Zalmai, and he favors this child to the extreme, and his son of course favors Rasheed over his mother. As Rasheed becomes more and more abusive, Mariam and Laila become close and the best of friends to one another. Rasheed caught the two women trying to leave him with the kids one day, and when Mariam and Laila were returned by the sheriff to him., he tries to kill Laila, and almost succeeds. Mariam saves Laila's life as he tries to strangle her, and kills Rasheed in the process.     Mariam is sent to prison for several years, and on death row, even though she did it in self defense. I found this to be a very sad part of the book, and poor Laila would never see her best friend again.    This book is very historical and detailed. The author does a superb job building up the characters and keeping the storylines strong. It is defintely a book that once read, you could never forget, and probably reread again later.
0743455967|5.0|I am not a big fan of Stephen King's novels, never really can get into them. This was definitely NOT the case with, On Writing. What a wonderful, informative, inspiring and at times, touching book. King gives his take on what it means to be a writer, offers some good tips along the way. The biographical aspect of this book is also very interesting. I finished this book in one night, it was that good. Buy it,it's the kind of book that can be read and referred to, again and again.
0790731894|3.0|This was a good movie and Kurt Russell did a great job in his role.  I was disappointed that Steven Seagal was killed about 20 minutes into the movie, but if he hadn't, the movie would have been over in another 20 minutes as he would have retaken the plane in no time, all the bad guys were weak in comparison.<br /><br />This was the most realistic depliction of trying to board an in-flight hijacked plane I have ever seen, it's not something and just sky-diving onto a plane.  The truth is you would probably kill everyone on board trying.<br /><br />The terrorist were just a bit too sophisticated for real life though.  Come on, who creates a bomb that is too difficult to disarm on a plane where you are very unlikely to find a bomb squad around.<br /><br />Good movie, great to watch once, but not worth the space in the library.

B000056HE9|5.0|\\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is not unlike \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" -- a man who thinks he's in trouble is the recipient of divine intervention that reveals what _he_ thinks is right for his life, or the lives of others, isn't necessarily for the best.<br /><br />\\"Wife\\" is not nearly as dark as \\"Life\\" (though it does have one unpleasant sequence that counterbalances the \\"cuteness\\" of the film's conceit), nor does it attack the materialism of American society quite so forcefully. There is, however, a terse sermon at the end reminding the viewer of the spiritual significance of the holiday. And while Clarence does not actively interfere in human affairs, Dudley does.<br /><br />The trailer for \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is unusual, because it shows nothing from the film, in an attempt to hide the storyline and who the characters are. Given the way the film starts, with the angelic Grant walking unharmed among moving cars -- I find it odd that the director did not have him coatless in the outdoor scenes.<br /><br />Regardless, this is an outstanding film that reminds viewers that money is not the source of happiness, and that the highest monuments to God are not made from stone. As if we'll ever learn.<br /><br />Please avoid, at all costs, the remake, \\"The Preacher's Wife\\". I've seen only the first 15 minutes, but it is an atrocity.
B00005NTN5|5.0|The acting in this film is fantastic.  Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly and Joe Pantalino really put their heart into this film.  The plot is not your run of the mill storyline.  The pacing and intensity blow your socks off.  They need to make quality movies like this again.  Something that's original! not like retreaded trash like Fantastic 4 with crap actors.  At least these actors have heart.
B000002JSN|5.0|First let me say that this is just plain awesome.  This ambitious album gives the listener a taste of Classic Zeppelin along with some very experimental and masterfully arranged material.  There is something for everyone in this album.  My personal favorites are Custard Pie, The Rover, Kashmir, Night Flight, and The Wanton Song, although other gret songs such as In The Light and Down By The Seaside cannot be overlooked.  Quite frankly, I can't find fault with any of the songs on this album.  Just buy it.  You know you want to.
0142000655|4.0|John Steinbeck delivered another great America novel with one of his masterpiece, East of Eden. When I first picked up the book from the shelf of Borders, I was a little intimidated with the thickness of the book because long lengthen books tend to contain a lot of rambling and eventually I would loose interest. But because of the positive feedbacks I heard about the book, I decided to give it a read. The book was simply amazing and I'm glad that the length of the book didn't intimidate me as much.  Steinbeck begins the book with the setting of Salinas Valley, California. With the beautifully written description of the valley, Steinbeck introduces the start of the Trask family and the innately malevolence woman Cathy. The sympathetic Adam Trask takes in the ferociously beaten girl, Cathy, after he finds her on their doorstep during a rainy night. After taking care of Cathy's injuries, Adam finds himself madly in love with the girl. Cathy has extreme physical beauty, but the nature of her immorality is at hidden. Adam marries the girl and soon Cathy gave birth to twin boys- Aron and Cal. The young couple moves onto a plantation next to the Hamiltons. Then Cathy shoots Adam by the shoulder and flees from the city. Torn by Cathy's love, the confused and deprived Adam raises the twins with the help from his Asian helper, Lee.   Steinbeck then shifts the focus of the story to the Hamilton family. Samuel Hamilton, the man of the house, alludes to Steinbeck's grandfather. He describes Samuel to be a highly respected character with a brilliant mind. Through out the story, Samuel Hamilton becomes a great inspiration to Adam Trask. But when Adam takes Samuel's idea and starts the cargo business, the Trask family fells into poverty.  In the middle of the book, Steinbeck begins to unravel the mystery of Cathy. He starts this with her sons Cal and Aron. It is inevitable for the sons to not question about their `deceased' mother. But the words escapes and Cal finds his mother inthe brothel of a city not too far from Salina Valley. After Adam learns the location of his wife, he travels to the city in search of her. Adam learns the abusive history of Cathy and the reasons to her beating on that raining night when they first met. Later she poisons the owner, Faye and takes over the place under an infamous title. Knowing that his sentimental brother will be crushed to know he has been lied to, Cal tries the best to keep the secret. But one night when their father chose Aron's gift over Cal's money, jealousy overwhelms Cal and the secret flees as well. After Aron learns about the truth, he immediately enlists in the Army claming that he has no emotions left to care.       There're more to the story after Aron goes to war. The book is enriched with plots, emotions, conflicts, and descriptive insights. I simply love Steinbeck's creative story line and the highly sophisticated way he played with the adjectives. The story is allusion to the Book of Genesis especially Chapter 4 of the story Cain and Abel. Steinbeck managed to obtain many of biblical references to the story without giving obvious ending to the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who simple is looking for a good read.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|Being a big fan of both Hot Fuss and Sam's Town,I knew I had to check this one out.From beginning to end,there is something different for all Killers fans. Tranquilize with Lou Reed and Shadowplay start the album off strong.Sweet Talk,Where The Boys Dance,Move Away and on and on.The album rocks!!!! One of the better B-sides albums you will find around. If you like The Killers,check it out. You might find something you like more than from the two mentioned albums.Go get it,what are you waiting for???<br />A solid 4 stars for real good leftovers.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the original 1988 John Waters movie, one of my favorite films, so I wasn't sure how I'd like this new musical remake. It's pretty terrific, but I wish they had included a few things from the original film like the 1988 HAIRSPRAY title song, some of the original vintage 60's music, the dance routine \\"The Roach\\" and especially the dance routine \\"The Madison\\" (it's Madison time...hit it...).  The new anthem \\"I Know Where I've Been\\" is nothing short of magnificent.  Overall, this is a wonderful feel-good film that captures the energy and spirit of the original 1988 film and a joy to watch again and again.
B000M341QE|2.0|I wasn't feeling this film.  The plot was a bit confusing, and it just seemed like a typical cop movie with all the same gangsters and police coruption scandals we've all seen in hundreds of law and order and csi tv shows.  Martin Scorcese has done better films like \\"After Hours\\", \\"Casino\\" and \\"The Aviator\\".  At least those films were original and quirky.  \\"The Departed\\" was ORDINARY!! Get it out of here!
B000UR9T82|4.0|It was cool until the musical bit, I'm sorry but that was just retarded, nothing to do with anything in the movie. I think the writers or directors in this movie were frustrated musical fanatics who just didn't realize that spiderman doing a cheesy number in the middle of the film was just soooooooooooo wrong. God help us if he does an encore!
055357342X|5.0|This review is going to have spoilers.  If you haven't read this book or series yet, you are missing out, especially if you enjoy epic fantasy in the vein of Robert Jordan.  I actually think George R.R. Martin is better than Jordan (!!!) which is saying quite a lot, because Jordan's writing, at the height of his abilities, was unbelievably engrossing.  Many of us sacrificed jobs, marriages, mortgages and hygiene to the Wheel of Crack.  We became bad people but it was fun.    A few more words on Jordan: many times I think the book reviews that appear on the covers of trade paperbacks are not worth reading, and I think others can testify to the same experience, but in the case of Jordan's first Wheel of Time novels this isn't the case.  Jordan's work did nothing short of revolutionizing contemporary fantasy, and without Jordan, I don't believe the world would've been ready for Martin.  That might be hyperbolic garbage, but the fact is that before Jordan, people didn't write fantasy in the way that Martin does, and after Jordan people do.  Terry Goodkind imitates Jordan, but he is not as competent as Jordan.  George R.R. Martin imitates Jordan, and he is more competent than Jordan.    Never before has the literary press hailed the second-coming of Tolkien with such unabashed enthusiasm, and never before has a writer justified the expectations of his fan base more completely than Martin did with A Storm of Swords.  I wish I could say the same for A Feast for Crows; I only hope that Martin's abilities will show themselves in the forthcoming Dance with Dragons the way they did in this title.  \\"Shakespearean\\" is not too strong a word to use in describing Martin's powers of plot structure, character development, and the delicately accurate-to-life interpersonal conflicts that drive this series.  Seriously.  Shakespearean.  Unfortunately, I feel that Martin cut off his sword hand with this novel, and I will be totally astonished if his series recovers.  I hope with every part of me that feels, but I don't think it will.  He killed too many characters.  Bringing them back from the dead ruined Jordan and it will ruin Martin too.  Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, and Daeneryes Targaryen are THE ONLY CHARACTERS WHO MATTER in this series AT ALL, after A Storm of Swords.  The rest of them are window decorations.  If those three don't figure heavily (almost exclusively) in A Dance With Dragons I'll peace out the way I did with Jordan and MAYBE come back to the series when Martin puts out the last book or kicks the bucket.    But anyway, I don't want to dwell on admonitory notes too much.  It's not fair to the work Martin did with this title.  His writing was never better here.  This title makes the biggest case for Martin as the \\"American Tolkien,\\" but it's a complete misnomer.  Fantasy enthusiasts for decades have awaited the second-coming of Tolkien the way fundamentalists await the second-coming of Christ, but there won't be another Tolkien and we probably wouldn't read his books if there was.  Tolkien was not a novelist, he was a linguist and his prose is (admit it) Biblically cumbersome.  It's not that people enjoyed that writing style a long time ago and they don't now.  No.  People have NEVER enjoyed that writing style and they never will.  The prose of Robert Louis Stevenson and Sir Walter Scott is faster paced and more engaging than the prose of J.R.R. Tolkien.    It's a testament to the strength of his vision and his abilities with the language that The Lord of the Rings turned him into the rock star he is today.  The writing of George R.R. Martin is fantasy realism.  Tolkien utilizes symbolism and allegory; Martin tries to portray a fantasy world in which people think and act the way they do in real life.  In this respect, Martin represents the new direction the genre has taken in the way Jordan did, but unlike Jordan, Martin even went so far as to eliminate the \\"Dark Lord\\" character.  The idea that the fantasy genre is going to bring us back, someday, to Tolkien is the biggest fantasy in the market.  We don't even WANT to go back to Tolkien.  We want to take Tolkien with us and move forward.  If there was an American Tolkien (and I hesitate to acknowledge this possibility) the only realistic candidate for that distinction is Stephen R. Donaldson (sorry Terry Brooks), and his heyday was the 1970s, when Tolkien's popularity was first really beginning to rise (THIRTY YEARS after he published LOTR).  Martin has elements of Tolkien (I guess),  but maybe more elements of Shakespeare or Thomas Malory mixed with Jordan's theory.
B000CNFC76|4.0|Another film with a weak title that'll put the viewer off, but actually, this is a very good sports flick.  There's the young hero, poor and ill treated by his pensive father, hoping for a golfing career. There's the snobbie rich guys that run the country club and the lovely rich girl that believes in him. There's the priggish brother that keeps them apart. There's the great Harry Vardan, the British Champion, a man of the lower classes himself.  And there's the big US Open 1913 to play with mallet like golf clubs. It's all great fun and we get choked up at all the right places.
B00005JPS9|5.0|The most daunting task in teaching High School English is having to begin the year, and a new class, with Beowulf.  While there are those students who actually get into it - the truth is - most don't.  Of course, those reading this review do. The telling here is much more accurate than \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" of a few years back - and loses none of the darkening moods and violence which make the epic what it is.  Every High School Senior English class would do well to begin with this film which is without question, the most visually faithful rendering available - far more effective than struggling with the text.  Best of all, your students will, for once, at least, agree, and may even be inspired to read it.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|Die Hard Blu-ray far exceeds the Five-Star Collection version I own on DVD > I directly compared the two and the upgrades are incredible. The Blu-ray video is exceptional in almost every way. In my opinion the Blu-ray viewing exceeds the theatrical experience. The surround sound mix is sick > making great use of sub and back speakers. If you are a fan of the original Die Hard you will not be disappointed in the least with this release. Everybody knows Die Hard is one of the best action movies ever > highly entertaining and just as cool as it was 20 years ago. A classic flick given a great Blu-ray release > this is a no-brainer purchase.  I highly recommend buying this Blu-ray.
140120306X|3.0|After such a long wait: Disappointing. Undisciplined Moore, playing show-off and not all that effectively. The shallow, sadistic Bond character is hardly loyal to the Ian Fleming creation, and the digressions into the \\"Black Dossier\\" are hit and miss with more the latter. Lots of sex, but not much is actually sexy, just graphic. This effort reeks of the Hollywood production where a powerful actor or director gets carte blanche and sinks under his or her own pretentiousness. I'm not saying this is a failure of \\"Battlefield Earth\\" or \\"The Postman\\" scale, but it is a failure nonetheless.
1591841666|5.0|Contrary to a what a couple of reviewers said, this book is not obvious.  It is logical, and after you have clarity about something it seems obvious.  The best poker players fold more often than they finish a hand. But how many of us stick with something much too long, when a careful analysis would show that it is futile? But we never get around to that careful analysis, do we?  We've been taught that winners never quit. Conversely, how many of us quit too soon and watch others who persevered through the dip strike it rich? How can you know which is which? Seth helped me gain clarity on what things to quit, and what things to stick with. The result was that I unwound from some sluggish investments, uncommitted myself from some unproductive enterprises and invested more energy and money into something I had worked on for a long time that was about to bust out of the dip!  Like all realizations, when the student is ready, the teacher appears.  If you are at a point in your life where you are struggling with a quit or stay decision, this book will help you find the clarity you are looking for.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I really liked HSM1 so I was almost scared to watch HSM2, wondering whether it would pale in comparison. But I loved it. The music and choreography were fabulous. The character of Ryan Evans, Sharpay's brother, was way more fun, and intelligent, to watch. The 'you-can't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover' theme was carried through again, which in this often shallow society is refreshing. If you're scared, give it a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. And for the kids, it is totally a safe choice. Fabulous! Bet on it!
B0009UC7H0|5.0|This film was a fantastic surprise!  It was not hyped up in the theaters so when it came out on video, it was not well known.  What a shame.  This is a terrific movie filled with action we haven't seen since the \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" days.  Steve Zahn is hilarious and the beautiful Matthew McConaughy is well, beautiful (and shirtless).  What else could you ask for.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it.  It is an action packed fun ride.
B000BTGY1O|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It seems to be about a bunch of fashionably dressed shallow rich people drinking and smoking and saying really stupid lines over and over again. Unbelievable that its considered a \\"classic\\". Mickey Rooney plays an unfunny stereotypical Chinese landlord in what must have been the racist role of the year. The music is nice, thats about it. 1 star for the music.
B000M39SYE|5.0|Very interesting video.  If you are not hell bent on one particular party you will find this documentary very interesting.  As an intelligent person, I choose to watch videos like this and create my own thoughts and feelings on the matter.  I appreciate people like Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock who created Supersize Me for bringing attention to the topic at hand and setting a platform for discussion.
B000WQW988|5.0|Maybe Kurt was just at the right place at the right time. Maybe he was a sloppy guitar player. But he was a good song writer and he was honest. Call it Nirvana. That's what it is.     I was 12, maybe 13 when I was first truly starting to love this band. Something spoke to me. After seeing the Unplugged performance on Much Music I had to own it on video. Finally today, 13 years later, I am.    Nirvana unplugged was to me then what it is to me now. An honest performance of a band at its best that spoke to a generation and more.    Call Cobain what you will. He is the Elvis and The Beatles of a later generation.    And just so you know, there hasn't been an artist in rock as big since.    To finally see the entire concert uncut in the pleasure of my own home is a blessing. As a bonus, you can view the original aired version. The rehearsals offer insight into how the night was played out. See why Kurt was worried about screwing up 'The Man Who Sold The World', and why 'PennyRoyal Tea' was a solo performance. See for yourself why Nirvana Unplugged is a testament of time.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|This is truly remixed. For instance, the guitar solo on Celebration Day is longer and contains new sections from the original release. Plant's vocals are slightly different in places, too. The music will sound familiar, but you'll catch little nuances in the performances that weren't there before. Makes for a new listen.     The remastering is spectacular - same as How The West Was Won. Loud, full, clear. Excellent sound.    The packaging, however, can cause the discs to be scratched (similar to the limited, deluxe edition of Mothership). Wish Atlantic would stop trying to get cute with the packaging and just paste a plastic CD tray in there. My discs were scratched upon removal.
0525950079|5.0|This has been, without a doubt, one of my favorite books of the year. I remember when I read Pillars of the Earth, how the story actually stayed with me for a long time. It has been my favorite book for years. World Without End is as good. It took me a while to read it, not only because it's long, but because I wanted to soak in every word. There is not a boring place in the book. Your emotions will run the gamut. There are many cruel and graphic scenes. The characters a very memorable. The novel pulls you in in such a way that you'll walk away from this novel knowing how life was like in that era. If you liked Pillars you won't be disappointed in World Without End.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000OV170W|5.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and I cannot wait to read every book she has written! The way the story is told is unique and very interesting. Keeps you on your toes. There wasn't a dull moment in this book. No, the ending was not one I saw coming, but it still kept me hanging on every word I read and I still love her style of writing. Must read this book!!
B000Y179KO|5.0|This is well worth the wait. It's not possible to like all the songs in one album, it's never happened to me anyway, so I am totally happy with this one. Waiting In the Weeds is a master piece. I have played it like 30 times, each time it just gets better. The music is top notch, love the chorus and the instrumental part at the end of the song. Long Road Out of Eden is great too, 10 minutes is never too long a song in this case. How Long reminds me of Take It Easy which is one of my Eagles favorites :)
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Occasionally, human beings come together to create something greater than themselves; Once is just one example. This is a modern day love story that's impossibly original and classic. Like first discovering, chocolate, sex, or our favorite sonnet this movies envelopes and fills with rapture. The music is a sweet cherry a top. My god! I do believe in the human race once again!     \\"This mystery only leads to doubt...and if you have something to say ... say it to me to now...\\"
B000UR9TQE|5.0|Folks...this movie has never looked better...(oh yeah this is a review from someone who has seen it!)...and  its still as crazy/fun/lame/awesome as when I saw  it on  the  big screen a few decades back. It doesn't pretend to be the ultimate Zep show..it was a rough hewn gem (when  they explode on the stage to the strains of Rock N Roll it still gives me goose  bumps) and this presentation is terrific and the bonus stuff on the second disc is classic and to be appreciated by any true Zep fanatic starving for extra concert and interview footage.  There is a reason millions of people tried to get tickets to their upcoming show...THEY ARE LED ZEPPELIN for crying out loud and  this is a great timecapsule at a ridiculously low price..stop complaining and enjoy!!  its been a long time ...as the song goes
B0000797IO|5.0|This is one of my fav. movies. I love how original this movie is. Its deff. different from anything i have ever seen before. It has some really funny parts in it.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I cried for the Queen, I cried for Diana and I cried for Tony Blair. A must see.
0446577391|4.0|This is the Best of the 'Camel Club' series and it took me 10 hours to read it.  Could not put it down.  Everything came together from his other 'Camel Club' books and was very satisfying.  It explained and revealed so much the others did not.  Do hope this is not the end of his 'Club' books.  Love the characters and hope to 'see' them again.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci.  You hit the jackpot!!
0061122416|5.0|The most amazing book on following your dream ever written. In this simple yet beautiful story, the reader is shown how we all have the power to create our own destinies.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|If you are open-minded about music...meaning you enjoy many different types of genres this will be another one of those albums that you will rarely skip a track. U.S.A...specifically Los Angeles was overdue on a talented music band...not anymore.
014028009X|5.0|The BIBLE of London chick-lit Helen Fielding basically invented the genre. The elusive yet kind Mark Darcy vs the naughty yet irresistible Daniel Cleaver are characters than any girl with a heart can relate to. And that said, I dare any girl not to love this book.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|Note: this is a review of the 2007 \\"Super Deluxe\\" remastered 2-CD/DVD set.<br /><br />Nearly 21 years after the original release of The Joshua Tree, the CD version of the album has finally gotten its due.  In what must be considered an embarrassment of packaging riches, this new \\"Super Deluxe\\" 20th Anniversary Edition of the album more than does justice to the original album art (poorly served on previous CD releases), and the music has been given a spanking new mastering, supervised by none other than The Edge.  The \\"Super Deluxe\\" edition comes in a sturdy, 6\\" x 8\\" x 1.5\\" box with fully restored cover art.  Inside is a 56 page hardcover book containing liner notes, lyrics, pictures, single-sleeve art, technical information, and a number of essays, including ones by Bono, Daniel Lanois, Adam Clayton, Anton Corbijn, Brian Eno, and The Edge.  An embossed envelope contains five more Corbijn photos, printed on 5\\" x 7\\" sheets of textured, \\"antique\\" paper.  The three discs all come in their own mini-LP gatefold sleeves: the album disc is in a quasi replica of the original LP sleeve, whereas the bonus CD and DVD are in similar sleeves featuring alternate photos.  No detail has been overlooked - even the CD labels are patterned after the spindle label on the original LP.  This is a truly \\"super deluxe\\" package.<br /><br />But what about the sound?  While the original 1987 mastering was never great, much of what has been lambasted over the years as murky sound is really intrinsic to the original recording and/or mix.  It is important to note that this is a remastered version of the original mix, not a remixed version of the original session tapes.  Thus, the overall qualities of the original mix remain, such as dense atmospherics and an ambient soundscape.  However, this version improves matters.  There is a substantial increase in volume, but generally not to the point of clipping.  A visual analysis of the waveforms reveals only a handful of clipped peaks throughout the album.  Comparison between this release and the mastering on Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's Gold Ultradisc II release (out of print) reveals very little difference between the two, which indicates to me the engineers on this remaster used discretion with their techniques, and did not go overboard.  Overall, instrumental textures are fuller, and bass response is improved.  Also, the continual tape hiss that was present even in between tracks on the original CD has been removed.  (Some hiss intrinsic to the original analog tapes remains, but is reduced from the original mastering.)  Generally speaking, all but the most critical and particular listeners can feel confident they are getting the best sounding version of this album yet released with this new mastering.<br /><br />The 14-track bonus audio disc contains a number of b-sides and unused tracks from the period that have previously been available elsewhere, but have never been collected in one place before.  Six of the fourteen tracks were either previously unreleased or were very rare prior to this release.  The songs range from excellent to barely worthy of release (\\"Drunk Chicken\\"), but are all worth having if you are any sort of completist.  For those who have always imagined that The Joshua Tree was the best double album never made (an erroneous notion, as Edge makes clear in his essay), the bonus disc provides them the perfect opportunity to construct their own version of the fabled opus.<br /><br />The concert presented on the DVD goes a good distance toward filling a gap that has existed in the U2 catalog for the last two decades - namely the absence of a full-length concert video from The Joshua Tree Tour.  This video (the liner notes say it was filmed, but industrial-size video cameras are clearly visible onstage) features the entire concert U2 performed in the Paris Hippodrome on July 4, 1987, minus three cover songs (the concert openers \\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"C'Mon Everybody,\\" and a rendition of \\"Help!\\" that they played between \\"Electric Co.\\" and \\"Bad\\").  The band is in top form, playing a classic lineup of their songs, many of which have not been heard on later tours.  Notably, they did not perform \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" at this concert, an omission that occurred a number of times on the European leg of the tour.  The video direction is refreshingly plain, avoiding the overly moody lighting Phil Joanou employed in Rattle and Hum (the Paris footage was directed by Gavin Taylor), and without the short-attention-span jump cuts of the band's recent concert videos.  The sound is an excellent LPCM stereo mix - not surround, it's true, but every bit as good as you would expect from a live album on CD.  The sound is actually better than either the live tracks on the Rattle and Hum CD, or the fan club only release of the 1989/1990 New Year's concert at the Point Depot.<br /><br />The documentary, \\"Outside it's America,\\" basically plays like Rattle and Hum's little brother, only in color and not as well shot - and, frankly, not as interesting.  On the other hand, it does not have the myth-making posturing that so marred Rattle and Hum.  Both this documentary and the concert video show a more human, down-to-earth, less \\"god like\\" side of the band.  Still, the documentary has a lot of footage that will likely be of interest to die-hard fans only.  (It is worth noting that the documentary was directed by Barry Devlin and Meiert Avis, not Phil Joanou, and therefore is not an assemblage of rejected Rattle and Hum footage, as has been speculated elsewhere.)  The two music videos are fair makeweights, but are hardly essential.  The selling point of the DVD is without question the concert video, which many fans will find invaluable, making this set an easy choice over the two-disc Deluxe edition.<br /><br />On the whole, this is an outstanding issue that more than makes good on its promises.  Thoroughly recommended.
0440241413|5.0|The entire time I read this book I kept saying to myself \\"This is so me!\\" and \\"Oh my god - I do that too!\\" Confessions of a Shopaholic is a hilarious account of how when it comes to shopping, most girls really can't help it! (Plus there's a few cute British boys thrown in.)
B00000J7JO|3.0|I can't listen to the song \\"Around the World\\" anymore because the guitar riff that opens the song is ripped off directly from an old 70's song called \\"Breadfan\\" by a rock band named Budgie.  This is a fact.  Did the Red Hot Chili Peppers give them credit by mentioning them?  No one can convince me the guitarist from the Red Hot Chili Peppers created that guitar riff on his own.  I won't buy it.  I don't normally mind rip-offs, but this is a rare exception where a musical idea is obviously stolen from an old rock band, and in this case, the bands name is Budgie.  It makes me really concerned that maybe other ideas from other songs were taken directly from other artists.  Maybe the band thought they could trick some fans out there by assuming these fans don't listen to older rock bands and therefore, would have never known about the old Budgie song.  Wrong mister!    Despite that, the band has plenty of pretty good songs to fill up the rest of the album.  These guys are certainly better songwriters than many people give them credit for.
B0000691U1|4.0|Duke Ellington recorded two albums in the same month with younger musicians near the peaks of their powers.  There is the disc with John Coltrane, and this one with Charles Mingus and Max Roach.  I wish Duke had done more of that, because both discs are very good.  \\"Money Jungle\\" shows a surprisingly avant-garde side of Duke Ellington.    This CD opens up with the title track, which is an absolute 5-star song.  \\"Money Jungle\\" sounds unlike anything you'd expect from Duke Ellington.  It wouldn't sound out of place on a Bad Plus CD, for example.  It bristles with raw energy.  Charles Mingus hits the same note on the bass like he was Neil Young.  The song is timeless, and reason alone to get the CD.  Things settle down for \\"Fleurette Africaine\\" where everyone plays with more touch and subtlety.  \\"Very Special\\" can be considered the \\"average\\" song on this CD - it's blues-based, mid-tempo, and has very tasty playing.  \\"Wig Wise\\" is a revelation to me, this version sounds better than any other I've heard.  The version of \\"Caravan\\" puts a unique twist on an often-played classic.  \\"Solitude\\" is in large part a Duke solo spot.  \\"A Little Max\\" is a sprightly, catchy tune.  Not counting the alternate versions, the rest of the disc and the bonus tracks are similar to \\"Very Special\\" in their bluesiness.  The playing is stellar across the board.  It's great to hear Duke without a big band, Mingus is Mingus, and Max Roach doesn't play flashily, but he always a very musical drummer.  This CD is highly recommended, even if you're not a big fan of Duke's big band stuff.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|From all of the other reviews that I have read on this page, I am getting the idea that this album is misunderstood. It was not a \\"What we think are our greatest hits\\" album, but in fact a compilation of all of their Top 10 Hits from the AC list. That would explain the absence of some regular staples like \\"Long Way Down\\" as well as others. Most of those have already been included on a previous complilation record \\"What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art, and Commerce\\"   So, this album is more one for fans of the band's hits and those who do not want to purchase all of their records (I would definetly suggest you check them out anyway, their lesser known's are all just as good as the hits) Not an album for the die-hard Goo fans who have followed their career from he start.   I would definetly recommend this album for anyone who enjoys the Goo Goo Dolls they hear on the  radio, these would be all of their great songs, \\"Iris\\" \\"Slide\\" \\"Here is Gone\\" \\"Better Days\\" etc. The next album they release in the spring will be one for the b-sides and covers (that's why \\"Give A Little Bit\\" is not included on this album...it is not an original work) Looking forward to the next one!
B000VR824S|5.0|I attended the festival. I stood about 5 rows in front of the stage in the section reserved for 800 GA tickets. It was an unbelievable day! I didn't want it to end! I also was hoping \\"A Day in the Life\\" would make the DVD, but oh well, there's plenty of incredible stuff on here. \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" was a definite highlight, along with the entire Clapton set at the end. Buddy was great. John Mayer was great. The country gang was great. Bill Murray was hilarious. This is an absolute MUST for any Clapton fan, guitar player, or music fan in general. This was an epic event. No matter where the next festival is, I'm going to make a vacation out of it.
B000W04S6U|5.0|As an owner of all the Halo soundtracks available I'd have to say that this is perhaps the best Halo soundtrack yet. Two CDs equals hours of awesome music, both new songs and embellishments of the ones we've come to love. As far as I know, this is the complete set of music from the game, including some bonus material. If you love the music as much as the game, you have to get this album! You will not be disappointed.

B000WTNCQS|4.0|Note: this is a tentative impression, as I just brought the box home today. I won't comment on the music, as it's all been said before...    I was debating whether to get this super deluxe version or go 1 tier down to the double-CD level (the single CD was not a choice since I wanted the b-sides and alt. takes, etc.). I never got his on vinyl but have had the original redbook CD for years.I know there've been several audiophile editions over the years (MFSL, etc.) but they've been out of print and 2nd hand go for very steep prices. So I was curious if the sonic improvements would be worth it. In a nutshell, the sound is noticeably better, with a definite more visceral bass and \\"presence,\\" but the improvement is not earth-shaking. It would have been nice to have this as a hybrid SACD or a DVD-A, but those formats have not been widely accepted. A 5.1 mix in addition to trad. stereo would have been nice too. Hence the 4 and not 5 stars. Quick first impressions:  Package: Nice black box (not too big) holds contents in a manner that makes them easy to remove. The 2 CDs and the DVD are each in their own black cardboard sleeve that folds open (as opposed to an open sleeve that makes it easy for the disc to fall out).    Extra CD: no comments yet.  DVD: the concert was videotaped, not filmed. I'm guessing for TV, as the aspect is small-screen. Can't comment on the sonics, but on my TV it sounded very well recorded. The additional documentary (on film) follows the band around on tour. The usual backstage banter, rehearsals, mixing with the Calif and Arizona locals, etc. Interesting and artfully made, but not sure this would bear repeated screenings...One video is in grainy and shadowy B/W while the other, in color, is a bit more straightforward, with the band in some coal mine (canary and all).    The book:  very handsome and classy with essays and pix - some new insights, but again, not sure it's worth it.    The package of 5 cards: I guess they're suitable for framing. Apparently from the same photo session that yielded the album cover. Not necessary.    Bottom line: the live concert on the DVD is definitely worth it. Especially if (as expected) it won't be available separately for the foreseable future.
B000UJ48U4|4.0|Was it worth the attention? Definitely. Was it worth the money? Absolutely. Was it worth the effort? Certainly. Was it worth two years? Probably. Was it worth the wait? Not really. Does it deserve to be the last effort of the great late director? Unquestionably.    As the plot of Eyes Wide Shut unfolds, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman struggle to attract the audience's attention. They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream.    As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance.    The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity.    Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy.
6305537313|5.0|Set in the '60's, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is a flawless production starring the timeless, Audrey Hepburn in one of the finest performances of her film career. Sweet and romantic, this DVD is a must own collectible for any DVD library.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is a beautifully imagined fairytale-like story of Beatrix Potter, the author of the best-selling children's stories, most notably The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Her life and love story are touching and her determination to become published and share her \\"friends\\" with the world are remarkable. Not content to simply be a children's writer, this is a woman who is responsible for one of the largest conservations efforts, with a donation of 4000 acres to the British Empire.    If after Chicago and Cold Mountain there are still nonbelievers in Renée Zellweger's acting ability, with Miss Potter she proves that she can wholly transform into any role of her choosing. What Zellweger managed for Bridget Jones, she applies the same magic to Beatrix's character.    Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting, Moulin Rouge), who previously teamed up in Down with Love, share chemistry that is overwhelmingly delightful to watch.    Finally, it must be said that the animations in the film are precisely on cue and manage to capture Potter's extraordinary illustrations.    To compare this film to Finding Neverland, as so many reviewers have done, is to do Miss Potter a disservice. Miss Potter is captivating and light-hearted even when the subject matter is grim. The acting is far superior in Miss Potter and the magic of the Petter Rabbit books is ever-present in the movie as it was in the main character's life.
0312330537|5.0|It is rare when I want to read a book again or want so fiercely to possess it so that I can underline passages and come back to them because they are so poignant and touching.  This is one of those books.  There were times when I had to stop, think, absorb, re-read or just plain pause to cry -- because his words were so raw, so right at the center of human nature, so exacting in their description of the human condition that they overwhelmed me. I loved this book.  I adored the characters; some more than others - Prabaker, Didier, Tariq, others, too.  There is so much in this book to take in.  Some sad, some funny (the over-under pants scene-OMG)and some parts so painful you almost can't read them.  It is almost horrid to think they will make it a movie because anyone who has ever seen a book made into a movie knows they will ruin it.  There is no way to capture the essence and the true heart of this book in film.  It is truly an amazing story, quasi-memoir-novel or whatever one wants to call it.  It is one of the top ten books I have read in the last ten years and I have read more than 300 books.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Live Free or Die Hard (aka Die Hard 4) is the perfect summer blockbuster - a smart popcorn fare with incredible action-packed sequences, outstanding special effects, smart dialogue, and a well-executed plot. It's the kind of movie Spiderman 3 wanted to be. It's the kind of movie that Pirates of the Caribbean 3 should've been. Instead, this summer, all the action/adventure belongs to a 52-year-old Bruce Willis Die Hard Collection (Die Hard / Die Hard 2 - Die Harder / Die Hard with a Vengeance), Perfect Stranger) reprising his role as the wisecracking New York cop John McClane.    In 2001, Willis proclaimed that he would no longer do violent action or \\"save-the-world\\" movies. Had he stayed true to his statement, we would've missed out on one of the best movies of 2007.    Live Free or Die Hard is the first respectable sequel in the summer of sequels. It is a great film not just for the Die Hard or action/adventure lover, but a great movie in general.    I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did and I extend my full recommendation for it. It's truly a perfect Fourth of July movie.
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini has done it again with his second book; which is just as appealing, if not more so, from a woman's point of view, as Kite Runner.  This latest book takes a different perspective and he writes from the woman's (or young girl's) perspective. Like others who have gone before him (think Memoirs of a Geisha) he does an amazing job thinking like a woman in writing about being oppressed in a society that only favors the rights of men.  That is not to say that men will not enjoy this book equally as much as will women.  It presents a fast paced story of life in war torn Afganistan where a split second can change everyone's life and where access to food and shelter is often more valuable than privilege or social status.    Couldn't put this one down and know that all would enjoy.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The Bourne Ultimatum is an incredible achievement, but particularly more so because it is the third movie in what is promising to be one of the most exhilarating movie franchises in cinema history. The movie is intense, suspenseful, and extremely dynamic. It grabs your attention and holds on tight all the way until the credits.    The music score, as does the rest of the movie, hits the right tone and all the right notes in all the right places.    Matt Damon (The Good Shepherd, Good Will Hunting) proves he is still on top of his game and Julia Stiles (Save the Last Dance, 10 Things I Hate About You) gets a bit more of a script to work with than she's had in the predecessors. Her appearance in the beginning of the movie is extremely welcome (Sidenote: her actual appearance is totally cool, particularly, the haircut with the highlights suits her face marvelously). Joan Allen (The Contender, Pleasantville) mouthes off against David Strathairn (We Are Marshall, Good Night, and Good Luck) quite nicely as well.    Just when you think there haven't been enough explosions in this thriller, the movie impresses you with what has become signature car chases for The Bourne trilogy. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the stuntwork that was designed into it is a lot cooler than the let's-bomb-the-entire-bridge sequence in the only other successful sequel of Summer 2007, Live Free or Die Hard. The choreography of the chase scenes and the fighting scenes is also commendable. The fighting between Jason Bourne and Dash, another \\"asset,\\" is an incredibly skillful stunt scene with raw energy seldom shown on screen.    This action-packed thriller is as intelligent as it is entertaining. Rising above the standard popcorn fare, the movie also makes subtle and not so subtle commentary on political policy, from rendition to CIA agent training, and lightly focuses on the argument of when the end justifies the means.    The Bourne Ultimatum proves that sequels aren't necessary an easyway for the studios to earn the big bucks and something for the movie watchers to avoid. And as a sequel this movie manages something that is extremely rare in this era of sequel-driven Hollywood - The Bourne Ultimatum manages to top its predecessors. And, for that, if nothing else, this movie must be watched and celebrated.
0375842381|1.0|I've been a junior high English teacher for several years, and I am disturbed by the dark messages that this book teaches. Pullman's trilogy is twisted and disturbing in its message--twisting the concept of evil vs. good, with the evil depicted as the good. The author, Phillip Pullman, said in a 2003 interview that \\"My books are about killing God.\\"<br /><br />I'm sickened that they are making a \\"mild version\\" of his book into a movie to ignite interest in his books.<br /><br />We have enough violent and dark messages being taught to young minds, and this author is teaching them in a sick and subtle way. I hate this book, I despise this author's intentions, and I hope that no matter what religion you believe in, you will not condone a book that ever teaches that EVIL is good. EVIL is never good. The Holocaust was simply evil. Loving people is simply good. How can you twist and complicate those universal messages around to young, developing minds!<br /><br />A huge thumbs down. Tell everyone you know to not buy into this sick author's messages.
0060899220|4.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed watching Bradley Cooper (Alias, Wedding Crashers) in the short-lived FOX TV show Kitchen Confidential, I welcomed the opportunity to read Anthony Bourdain's novel on which the show was based. As is often the case with book-to-movie or book-to-TV adaptations, Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly the book is much better than Kitchen Confidential the show.    Anthony Bourdain, a two-star chef and a junkie for everything from good food to drugs and sex, is unmercifully honest in his expose of the industry as well as his portrayal of himself. He is as delightful as he is haughty, particularly, in his descriptions of his exploits with his fellow chef cohorts Dimitri, Steven, and Adam-Last-Name-Unknown.    Bourdain's book is divided into separate chapters that could (and judging by the acknowledgments page did) appear as stand-alone articles. This is, simultaneously, the book's greatest strength and its greatest weakness. In this nonrestrictive format, Bourdain manages to tell various stories that have nothing more in common than food and the fact that he was present during those anecdotes. Yet, due to such a haphazard format, his book lacks continuity and a coherent timeline for all the events. The lack of a time frame might or might not be a reflection of the disorientation that Bourdain experienced while he was overindulging on drugs and crashing on the beaches of Long Island after his numerous stints as a chef in New York's Rainbow Room atop the Rockefeller Center.    As much self-indulgence as this chef experienced, he abstains from making his tales sound too egotistical and self-centered. Instead, he is passionate and levelheaded - there is nothing in the book that's there purely for shock value. It is clear that Bourdain values a no-frills approach not only in his Les Halles kitchen, but in his writing as well.    One of the quotes, located on the inside of the back cover of the Bloomsbury Paperback edition of the book, suggests that Bourdain is \\"a lucky sod\\" for being able to cook and write \\"brilliantly.\\" I'd have to agree. Bordain's writing is concise, easy-to-read; his topics alarming and shocking at times. Throughout the book his writing is always hilarious and charming.    The most helpful chapter is \\"From Our Kitchen to Your Table.\\" In it, Bourdain explains why he never orders meat well done, eats seafood in restaurants on Tuesdays and Thursdays, eats mussels only when he is the one who cooked them, eats bread regardless of his whereabouts, and always observes the body language of his waiter. In fact, this chapter is full of common sense and circumstantial evidence and should be mandatory reading before people step into a restaurant.    It is precisely these kinds of scandalous revelations that put Bourdain's books on bestseller lists over and over. I'll admit to having done many of the author's no-nos: ordering seafood from restaurants famous for other cuisine, eating brunch, and requesting an alteration of the contents of a menu item, among others. After reading this book, one thing I will definitely never do at a restaurant is order meat well done.    Bourdain's book earns its momentum with his description of his first oyster in the Gironde and doesn't let up until his elaborate description of consuming a fish's eye in Tokyo. Like its follow up, A Cook's Tour, Kitchen Confidential is essentially a book about making and eating mesmerizing food. Because as Bourdain aptly puts it, \\"in the end, maybe it is all about the food.\\"

0099481561|4.0|Hemingway has a way of getting into our heads.  The characters are plain spoken; almost Shakespearean at times; with  powerful, philosophical paragraphs sprayed in.  His interest in bullfighting is obvious if you have read any of his work; and is not ignored here.  Against the rules of writing he uses the Spanish tongue; although irritating, he gets away with it.    Set in the mid 1930's, and centered around an American munitions expert fighting to help the cause of removing the Germans, Italians, and the rest of the fascist armies from out of Spain.  He links up with a group of cave dwelling partisans outside of town.   Much of the book is spent on his relationship with this group and him falling in love with a young girl, whom he can never have.     Some may object to the ending, but I found it fitting; \\"I man's gota' do, what I man's gota' do\\"    Wish you well  Scott

0451196716|3.0|The Long Walk is set in an alternate reality where the U.S. appears to have a totalitarian government and a bloodthirsty event called The Long Walk is held once a year.  One Hundred boys from around the country volunteer to walk.  The pace of four miles per hour must be maintained at all times.  If you lag, you get a warning.  Three warnings and then you get a bullet to the head.  Warnings also drop off at a pace of one per hour so you can get back to a clean slate.  The walk continues until only one is left alive and he wins what amounts to anything he wants for life.  The main character is Ray Garraty although we get to know a number of the other boys along the way.  Some of them are likeable but others are mean spirited.  Along the way, each of them is tested to the limits of their endurance and beyond.    The overall tone of this book is pretty grim.  There are some heartening moments where Ray and another boy, Peter McVries, help each other despite the obvious incentive to let a competitor die.  Mostly, the walkers are ground down in every way possible.  Emotionally, mentally, and, of course, physically.  From the moment the walk starts, it is an unremittting grind and the reality of their hopeless situation becomes more inescapable with every rifle shot and every step that adds to their fatigue.      Because the book is about a slow grind toward breaking down the boys, the reader is inflicted with a certain amount of fatigue as well.  There are so many passages that blur into others that seemed the same... more walking, more sore feet, more walking, vacant eyes and bitter words... repeated over and over again.  I understand the purpose but it doesn't make for the most enjoyable reading.  The ending was almost painfully anticlimactic and a bit ambiguous as well.      All in all, I would only recommend this one to serious King fans who are up for a depressing read.  The book is similar in concept to [[ASIN:0451197968 The Running Man]] but not as entertaining.

0553260111|3.0|The Bourne Identity is a spy thriller that tells the story of an amnesiac on a quest to learn about his past while staying ahead of those intent on killing him.  The story of his life and the intrigue surrounding it are both unraveled slowly throughout the book.  The story takes many twists and turns, but I won't reveal them here.  Ludlum intentionally put readers almost on par with Bourne in terms of information.  He obviously wanted readers guessing and trying to figure out the truth at the same time the protagonist was.    This novel's greatest strength is the suspense and action of the story.  Ludlum creates a very dangerous world and seemingly all of it is devoted to tracking and killing our hero.  Readers can't help but be anxious for nearly the entire book as each page reveals some new plot or treachery to trap Bourne.      The book's biggest weakness is undoubtedly dialogue and characterization.  All of the characters seem pretty cardboard including Bourne.  When Marie says things like, \\"Darling, oh my darling!\\" I find myself wondering who Ludlum knew in his life that actually talked that way.  Most of her lines sound like they were copied down from old melodramas on the late, late show.      At its best, this book is a high-octane thriller.  At it's worst it's talky with stilted conversations and not terribly interesting characters.  For much of the book, I labored to get through it, but the last hundred pages or so definitely had me hooked.  This was my first experience reading Robert Ludlum and I'm not at all sure that I'll read any more of his work.  The Bourne Identity is not a bad novel, but it was far from great.  I'd recommend it to Ludlum fans but others might want to look elsewhere.
B000WQW988|5.0|It's been 14 years, but Nirvana's legendary Unplugged performance is now on DVD.  The picture quality is excellent.  Same with the audio.  The rehearsals are a great bonus too.  I could talk about this show all day, but if you're reading this, you know how great the show is.      One thing I haven't heard mentioned:  The Bare Witness MTV2 thing is a new edit that is only 14 minute long.  The broadcast version without commercials is 22 minutes.  A lot of stuff mentioned during \\"Where did you sleep Last Night?\\" was pretty powerful.  It's all gone.  Some of it is now overlapped on the last song in the clip..  so now it's totally ot of context.  It's a nice little bonus feature.. But 8 minutes are missing and they don't tell us why.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|...and because I love Zeppelin I will love everything product with their work in it. Nay-sayers - go say nay else where. I'm a fan and I am very devoted. They could produce a new compilation every week and I would love it. For me, its kinda like a good steak. I don't complain because the great steak I just had is no better than the great steak I first had.    I assume after the Dec 10 concert there will be new audio and video. I will buy it and I can almost guess that I will give it 5 stars. I can hardly wait.    BTW - I remember laughter. I saw Zeppelin in concert in Denver in '73 (OMG, row 11) - but it had no effect on my opinion. ;) Maybe I should get a new tattoo.....
B000H5V8DG|4.0|This series is fantastic. Especially Season 1-3 were my favorites, but 4 and 5 were good also and I was very glad for the happy ending. The chemistry between Michael Vartan and Jennifer Garner was mesmerizing. I loved this show from episode 1. The bad experience I had was when I bought this complete collection, most all the disks were bad. I returned it and had another shipped and the second set was just the same condition. I received a refund with no problem from Amazon, however, I really want this set. If anyone knows how I can find this set in fantastic condition, I will be eternally grateful. =) All in all, once I find a set in perfect condition, I will definitely buy it again. This was defintely not Amazon's fault, they did everything to try to resolve this for me.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|Clearly the best of the \\"Bourne\\" series so far.I was of the opinion that this film was to be the finale of these fast paced 'chase\\" movies. However, the picture's final scene,added to the highly positive public response,strongly suggests otherwise. In this edition, Matt Damon has again lost a key portion of his memory. He's out to rediscover who's converted him into a blatant assassin.It's all here: pacing, background music, implausible escapes, plus a car chase scene to rival \\"Bullitt\\",and 'The French Connection\\".Often overlooked,it's perfectly possible to view one or all of this series without becoming at all lost. At a reported $10 million per picture, how could Damon possibly refuse another \\"Bourne\\" film (or ten)? Better to be cast in these movies than in the horrendous \\"The Good Shepherd\\" which may have caused Damon fans en masse to jump off Cape Cod's Bourne Bridge.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I admit I wasn't a fan of The Song Remains the Same live album when it was released back in 1976 (was it that long ago?). The concert seemed flat. When the CD was first issued, I thought it sounded even worse. Hardly any highs or lows -- sound-wise and performance-wise.    But Jimmy Page and Kevin Shirley have waved a magic wand over the master tapes. This isn't the same album any more. It's dynamic, vibrant, blistering. The bass guitar is there now! The guitar rings out clear as a bell. And Plant's voice is right up front where it belongs.    I've been listening all afternoon to this remastered edition of The Song Remains the Same. There have been projects around the house I was supposed to get to. There was another new CD I wanted to hear. But I couldn't take this 2-CD set out of my player. It held me in its grip for the entire concert.    Led Zeppelin continues to astound some 25 years after they broke up, and a full three decades plus after this concert was performed at Madison Square Garden in 1973.    If you've held off buying this because the original version left a bad taste in your mouth, rest assured this is a unique experience now. It's crisp as a new can of Pringles and twice as tasty.    I highly recommend The Song Remains the Same remastered 2-CD edition.
0393327655|5.0|It would be a tremendous waste of cognitive effort to explain why people who believe Harris is either a god-hating waste-of-time infidel who will roast in the fires of hell for his intolerance or a wishy-washy mystical soothsayer who only marginally opposes dogmatism are sorely misguided. This is a book that deserves deep contemplation and does not read like many others. Treat it as a very long conference, as a very learned man conferring upon his listeners some very important bits of wisdom. Harris approaches this topic in a manner that makes the reader thirst for more information and question some deeply held beliefs about one's own faith, morality, and happiness.     It's easy to write a good review of a book whose premises you agree with. I must say that I found little in this book that did not accord with either my intuition or biases. Still, this is an excellent book, a masterpiece, and should be required reading for all in the West.
B000UR9TQO|3.0|I'm a Zeppelin freak. I own everything they've ever released. Probably twice. I bought this the minute I saw it.    Now I wish I hadn't.    The T-Shirt inside is very thin and not at all an XL as it states on the tag. If it were an XL, I'd wear it with pride. As it is, my wife can wear it. (What kind of material is that, anyway -- gossamer?)    But once the T-Shirt is removed...    That's where the problem with the packaging comes into play.    The T-Shirt is what held the DVDs and the extras in the box, which is a very thin cardboard to begin with. Take the T-Shirt out and you have a large space in the box. When you put back the DVDs, they rattle around in the box.    If you take them out of the box, they're packaged in their own little sleeve, but the cardboard of the sleeve is very thin, too. If it was a heavier slipcase-like cardboard, it would be okay. But it's not. It barely stands up on its own. By the way, one item in the sleeve is the 2-DVD set. The other item in the sleeve holds the bonus materials. But, together, they're only 1-1/4\\" deep. The box is 2\\" deep. The T-Shirt took up the remaining 3/4\\" to make the box full.    So, okay, minus the T-Shirt and despite the wafer-thin cardboard, what do we have left? What are the bonus materials?    Again, no great shakes. There are numerous postcards (most pictures are blurry and oddly cropped) and movie promotional items, plus a couple of other pieces of colored cardboard meant to look like tickets. Big deal. Interesting, perhaps even cool. But worth another $10-$20 over the price of the 2-DVD set by itself? You be the judge.    So, okay, minus the T-Shirt, despite the wafer-thin cardboard, and aside from the assortment of passable postcards and promotional items for the movie, what's in the box?    When all is said and done, what's really in the box that I care about is the 2-DVD set of the remastered The Song Remains the Same concert (one DVD is the concert, the other DVD is bonus materials) -- which, last timeI looked, was only $13.99 on Amazon. So the Zep movie not only costs less, but the standard 2-DVD set of the remastered The Song Remains the Same is a traditional DVD box. In other words, it's sturdy. It'll stand on your shelf without falling over, getting crushed, or scuffed up. And to watch it, you don't have to yank apart a box, fumble around for the slipcase, extract it, and then attempt to get it back in when you're done -- all without further damaging the cardboard. Sounds like a losing proposition to me.    In short, although the remastered The Song Remains the Same movie is outstanding  (and the 2-CD audio set is stunning!), this Collector's Edition DVD set is flimsy, not well thought out and surprisingly unspectacular. I didn't get the \\"Wow!\\" factor when I opened the box. I got the, \\"Gee? Now what do I do with these parts now that the T-Shirt (which served as a spacer in the box) is removed?\\" factor.    I say save your money on this Collector's Edition DVD set. Buy the remastered 2-DVD set of The Song Remains the Same instead. You'll get what's really important and you'll avoid the headache of trying to figure out how to carefully store the \\"bonus\\" items without damaging them.

B000W1V5VU|1.0|I have a new Samsung 1080p HDTV and an Onkyo A/V receiver which upconverts video to near HD quality using the Faroudja processing chip.  Every other Standard Definition DVD I have watched on this system looks fantastic. However, Oceans 13 looked awful.  The picture was very grainy and the colors were distorted.  The actors all had orange skin which made them look like they slathered themselves with some cheap tanning lotion.  I could only stand to watch about 45 minutes of this DVD.      I did some research online and found that a few DVDs don't look good when processed by an upconverting DVD player or receiver. Oceans 13 was specifically mentioned on one A/V forum as a DVD which looks awful when upconverted.  Very disappointing to say the least.  If you have an upconverting DVD player or receiver, don't waste your money on this movie.
B000WGZGNS|3.0|This concert was okay, but I think her Beyonce - Live at Wembley (DVD with Bonus CD) was a lot better.  But even better is Destiny's Child farewell concert DVD.  If you want to see her and her girls at their best, get that one.      She didn't seem to give the same energy we've seen her give before.  It's like she was holding back so she wouldn't tire herself out through out the concert and it seems like her back up singers did most of the singing. Maybe because she looks a little more out of shape than she did in her previous concerts.    Also, the video is streched to make her look thinner (like Paula Abdul's Promise of a New Day Music Video).  It kind of disturbs the eyes after awhile and makes you think you got a bad copy.    Beyonce is a great artist, one of the best of her time, but this DVD did not deliver what I hoped it would.
B000PDZJ1W|4.0|Originally released in the Spring of 2001, this lighter sounding album features the singles \\"Dream On\\", \\"I Feel Loved\\", and \\"Freelove\\". A fourth single,\\"Goodnight Lovers\\" was not released in the US. The emphasis is on electronics giving the album a techno sound even lighter than some of the material they put out in the 80's. After \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Songs of Faith & Devotion\\" it might be hard at first to adjust to this album but after a few listens you'll find yourself enjoying it. The DVD features alone will make this a worthy addition. By the way, jazz percussionist Airto Moreira plays on two of the tracks.    On the DVD:  -album in 5.1 & stereo  -A short film:Depeche Mode:1999-2002 (Presenting the intimate and delicate side of Depeche Mode) (32 min.)  -Live in Paris,Oct. 2001  The Dead Of Night/The Sweetest Condition/Dream On/When The Body Speaks/Breathe/Freelove  -Additional tracks:(stereo only)  Easy Tiger (full version)  Dirt  Freelove (Flood's Radio Mix)  Zenstation  When The Body Speaks (acoustic version)
0446310786|5.0|This book is simple enough stylistically for a child to read and enjoy, yet rich enough to satisfy and reward adults.  The characters draw you in and are developed well as the plot progresses.  This is a story that will stay with you for years and make you reflect on stereotypes, judgmental attitudes and how we should treat each other as members of the human family. Highly recommended.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|This movie was absolutely terrible. Every character was a whiny self absorbed crybaby.  Venom practically non existent. Eddie Brock completely miscast. Venom looked like a scrawny wimp.  Silly \\"bad Petey\\" scenes. Sandman the killer of Uncle Ben - LAME.    Messing with Spiderman's origin for no reason.  Sandman misunderstood instead of the cruel villian he is in the comics.  Goblin II, cheap costume, both Goblin and Spidey kept taking off their masks. Lame  Symbiote suite, simply the normal suite \\"colored\\" black, yeah, real innovation there.  This movie was simply a ploy to sell badly mad toys - WHICH AREN'T SELLING!!!  Because this movie totally sucked.  Transfomers had the balls and spine that this movie seriously lacked.  They need to go back to the drawing board. New writers and actors. Tobey Macguire is obviously sick of doing it and it showed.  Total suckfest.
0142000655|5.0|While this book is a little rough around the edges (I believe this was Steinbeck's intent and therefore part of its beauty), it delivers with amazing insights into theology, human nature and psychology.  Steinbeck writes in such a way that you find yourself not just reading a story but experiencing the events as if you were there witnessing them.  This book drew me in from the beginning and satisfied at every turn.  It is a wonderful look at the nature of God and humanity from an unorthodox perspective.  Very enlightening and rewarding.
B00005JPCF|1.0|I found this to be very boring. Most of the characters looked alike. No diverse characters like a polar bear, seal other animal than a penguin ect.  The plot was extremely weak, basically a penguin tries to stop humans from eating fish in the antarctic.  With the exception of ONE funny scene, the rest of the movie got boring fast.  The movie was cute for 3 minutes and just dragged on until the revelation of the ridiculous plot. Preachy anti religious and just plain boring.  It tried so bad to be a Disney movie but sunk beneath the ice on this one.  It was propaganda disguised as a kid's movie.  Go get Ice Age instead.
0812550757|2.0|After reading Ender's Game (which I give 3 stars), I was just curious enough to try the next installment.  This book was a major disappointment.  The plot never seemed to get off the ground and I just couldn't get into the characters.  This is a relatively flat story and nothing to get excited about.  I will not be reading anything further in the Ender saga.  There is too much good reading out there to spend any more time on this series.
B00000IWVS|5.0|These Chopin recordings of Martha Argerich from 1965 are an example of staggering virtuosity of the highest order. She is one of the few pianists I've heard that could rival Michelangeli for technical ability(though both could be erractic at times, with the Italian being the more so of the two.) This cd is one of the crowning achievements of Argerich's career. It is, indeed, a shame that it took so long for these performances to be made available to the public. Given that they were made at Abbey Road in 1965, one wonders if the powers that be didn't want to embarass some other well known residents of that venerable recording studio in those days. While the quartet from Liverpool could produce some great pop songs, none of them, or just about anyone else from any other genre of music, could produce musicianship of the caliber that Martha Argerich displays here. Another must have in any classical cd collection.
0812550706|3.0|Everyone raves about this book, so I was eager with anticipation when I began to read it.  I struggled to get into the story from the inital few pages.  The style is average, the characters are relatively flat and undeveloped, and the action is nothing special.  The ending is very good and redemptive, but even this doesn't warrant a higher review.  I know this borders on sacrilege for some, as this book won both the Hugo and the Nebula (something 17 other books have done, by the way!), but this book just didn't deliver as promised.  That being said, it is worth reading; just temper your expectations.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Here's my five cent's worth... I prefer this album to Black Holes & R. Won't sway my allegience to Radiohead though. But boy can these guys swing a tune and throw it like ten buckets of mixed color paint on the blank canvas of your sonic landscape. Track 11 a bit of a dud. The rest is just a-ok. I like their intensity, their over-the-top full-frontal-attack attitude. A solid record for those who prefer melody with a kick in the pants.
0553278223|5.0|I typically don't like short stories because I find that they are usually over before I am drawn into them.  However, Bradbury delievers short stories in such a way that I found myself unable to put the book down.  This stories are tied together thematically in that they collectively tell the story of the colonization of Mars.  There is humor, tragedy, social commentary and more in this amazing collection.  I appreicate how Bradbury uses the sci-fi genre as a platform to make some profound observations about human nature.  This was my first exposure to Bradbury and I can't wait to try out some of his other works.  Highly recommended.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Four years it has been now; four years since The Return Of The King graced our theatres, destined to become the second most successful film of all time, garning eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Peter Jackson. And, not least of all, two for Howard Shore and his never resting mind. Four years full of studying Tolkien, labouring over dozens of different cuts and scrutinising every thematic approach in each scene, making absolutely sure it relates correctly and pushes all the right buttons, Howard Shore's labour of love comes to a glorious, and well- deserved end.  The End? Not really. For three years now, Howard Shore himself supervised the production of these Complete Recordings, and it speaks for his character that he didn't give this project out of his hands.  So, here we are, holding The Return Of The King in our hands, and the question is today as relevant as it was four years ago - maybe even more, since we can now judge the full vision of Howard Shore: does it hold up? Did Shore do justice to his own brilliance, did he actually manage to bring the full spectrum of themes to a logical, conclusive, satisfying end?    If the last 20 years of film making have taught us anything, then it's certainly a strong reluctancy to set our hopes for sequels or prequels too high. How many times did we have the highest hopes for a single project, and it didn't only fail, but also had that uniquely ability to not only tarnish the film itself, but all previous entries as well?  That is the most important lesson, and it also reveals a very important aspect of creativity: dazzling the mind with a lot of flash is easy; illuminating the mind with structure demands far more from any artist. That today's movies fail to give us amazing eye candy can't be expected anymore, but amongst all the FX artists doing their magic and sound effect guys blasting the theatre's speakers, where's the story, the gravitas, the ingenuity?   So, am I trying to ease you into the message that Howard Shore actually didn't really deliver this time? No. I want to show you the vast deepness of the chasm on whose edge Howard Shore stood.    Obviously, Lord Of The Rings is not the first movie series with sequels that are better than the original. Motion picture history is littered with improved second parts. The difference, however, is that usually, when a composer delivers an improved sequel, it feels like revisiting the previous score. The composer develops themes by reconsidering the first installment. He might take the score from film one from A to B, and the second score from A to C.  In Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Shore went from point A to B and B to C, respectively. Themes continued developments without a recap, drawing fresh connections while pushing the old in new directions; the palette widened, incorporating a grander sense of scope and advanced realisations of the styles.   Return of the King takes us triumphantly to point D, which logically expands the compass even further. Shore has built his emotional arc through nearly eight hours of music before reaching this score, and now, as we reach the destination, everything is touched with a sense of gravity. We've earned this voyage; we've come to its conclusion naturally, and the effects are nearly overwhelming.  Nowadays, it's an easy task to find film scores with beautifully soaring themes and powerful action. Nearly every film score today appears to see its task in creating music that is soaked with emotional highlights, moments of pathos and orchestral clashes of almost orgiastic proportions. But in 90 % of those cases, an essential element is lacking: the music and the film don't *earn* these moments, resulting in an atmosphere of fakeness and emotional pretentiousness.    This isn't the case with Lord of the Rings, and especially not with Return of the King. Two scores and six hours of music steadily, subtly and systematically build into this archetectural masterpiece.   Return Of The King has a different vibe from the very first bar. Orchestrations and compositions are a lot more diverse and intricate, and even the palette of soundscapes is more elaborate.  This is largely due to the fact that in Return of the King, Howard Shore combines and collides his themes to bring them down to a common denominator, to bring the stories to their logical climax. For instance, in \\"A Coronal Of Silver and Gold\\" or \\"The Land Of Shadow\\", the 5/4 beat of Isengard meets the Fourth Age Of Mordor theme, and the Orc theme of Isengard meets the Threat Of Mordor motif, indicating that Isengard's power and creatures have now been fully consumed by and integrated under the eye of Sauron.    From the very beginning, Return of the King builds on The Two Towers' maturity, and adds an amazing layer of thematic and textural developments. The bridging is absolutely seamless - the first 30 seconds of \\"Roots and Beginnings\\" sound like a direct continuation of Two Tower's end credits.  This score has a distinct touch of understated grandesse, which roots in Howard Shore's inherent subtlety, and which is perfect because the movie isn't about heroic, uplifting battles, it shows a world in decline and its hope of revival.  Everything builds into this, and the true meanings of all themes are revealed. Right in the opening sequence, \\"Roots And Beginnings\\", the essential meaning of the Ring's Seduction theme is presented. Or the ringwraiths; listen to Fellowship's \\"The Nazgul\\", Two Towers' \\"Wraiths On Wings\\", and then \\"Shieldmaiden Of Rohan\\", and you will not only see, you will understand. That's also a feelings very few scores can create.  When Aragorn bows to the four hobbits during the coronation scene, you hear the exact same short piece that plays when Frodo says \\"I will take the ring\\" during the Council Of Elrond; these are the moments that reveal a true genius of musical storytelling.  And amongst all these intricacies, Howard Shore never loses the focus on the heart of the tale. That is why the emotional climaxes reaches their full blossoming in the listener's mind, and each one stabs right into your heart, unfolding a deep satisfaction.  As you know by now, this gem includes four CDs, one DVD with the score in Surround Sound, and a more than intriguing booklet by Doug Adams, who guides us through the soundscapes of Middle-Earth.  Also, like Two Towers, this release includes countless additions that didn't make it into the film. These additions are sometimes of bigger, often of shorter nature, but they all glue together some score parts that appeared incoherent in the film. In the best sense of the word, they give the score even more time to breathe and to shine.    I don't think there has ever been a film score that lived and breathed quite like The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, and The Return Of The King especially. Every piece of music has its meaning, talks to you, and leaves you deeply satisfied.   Unlike the Ring films themselves, their scores, or more precisely their themes, may never become part of popular culture, and in times where this is considered the knighting for any film score, Lord Of The Rings doesn't need to, since it has an entirely different goal, and works on an entirely different level.   If you wanted to place \\"The Return Of The King\\" in film music history, you will have to go back to the glory days of film music in the 50s and the 60s, when there was no difference between classically trained composers and film composers, when those great musicians didn't need to worry about sales or becoming part of pop culture, but instead created music through which their films lived, breathed and acquired true greatness. Spartacus, El Cid, North By Northwest, Ben Hur, Jason and the Argonauts, that is the royal company in which The Lord Of The Rings does not need to feel ashamed.  You could even say that The Return Of The King goes back to 18th/19th century opera in terms of how dozens and dozens of meticulously interwoven motifs not only shape the actors' performance, but also tell the story on their own. In this light, Shore's Ring trilogy has even an advantage over scores like Ben Hur or King Of Kings.   Howard Shore's masterpiece combines genuine opera with a glimpse of Golden Age, and this is an achievement for the ages.

006113399X|5.0|In 1999 Norwegian Police Inspector Harry Hole is assigned to the Norwegian Security Service undercover surveillance of the neo-Nazis as a form of punishment for embarrassing the brass.  The recovering alcoholic knows this will be tedious but also realizes until he is forgiven he must contend with the ennui of watching skinheads act like pompous bullying idiots in Oslo and cannot use a drink as badly as he needs one to dull the boredom.<br /><br />However, the firing of a rare gun wakes him out of his stupor.  His junior partner Ellen Gjelten links the weapon to vicious Neo-Nazi Sverre Olsen and WW II as murder in 1944 ties to a diabolical assassination plot in 1999 with only Hole in the way of preventing the first step of a brilliant plan created over five decades ago.<br /><br />The story line never loses its fast-paced while switching eras back and forth between 1944/46 and 1999.  Police procedural fans will appreciate the 1999 obstinate efforts of acrimonious Hole, ignoring the brass and to a degree his partner, in order to prevent a catastrophe that could be his nation's second darkest hour.  However, the fascination in the tale is back in WW II where author Jo Nesbro paints a dark dismal picture of much of Norway sympathetic with the Nazis and that tie still exists with a Neo-Nazi crowd.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0743270754|2.0|An 83 year old who is a very discriminating reader told me that she loved this book because it made all the historical actors seems so human.  I, on the other hand, could hardly get through listening to the audio tapes. I couldn't figure out if the author wanted to write a social column history of events and family relationships or tell the story of how Lincoln and his cabinet related to each other as they dealt with the civil war. While the social goings on is a legitimate arena for a historian, and Goodwin does a good job with it, I wouldn't head for a book which focused on e.g. Seward's letters to his wife or Kate Chase as hostess or Mary Todd Lincoln's gowns.  In contrast, the  author's portrayal of Lincoln and his cabinet addressing the issues of the day left me dissatisfied and feeling that much of what made the civil war the kind of struggle it was was omitted or glossed over. We are told little of the bitter sectional hatred, the devastating casualties, the economic development of the north, the internal violence of the south, or the corruption. From Goodwin's book I can't quite figure out how and why slavery was abolished.  The transition from Lincoln as unionist to Lincoln as abolitionist needs more explaining.  The focus on Lincoln's personal relationships with his cabinet members was interesting but had the feeling of a hagiography. (I could sure use someone who is a paragon of virtues, humor and social grace like Lincoln as a friend.)  Lincoln appears larger than life with few human flaws.  The reader is never given a good explanation of Lincoln's relationship with McClellan.  We are told that his patience with incompetent or subversive underlings always turned out to have been the best strategy of dealing with them: that Lincoln managed to finesse situations which otherwise might have been personally confrontational or politically divisive.  William Freehling's vol. one of \\"The Road to Disunion\\" gives a much more nuanced picture of the opposing forces on the eve of the civil war.  It would have been nice to learn more of how Lincoln and his cabinet dealt with them.  There is always a tension between writing history as collective biography or history as the outcome of underlying factors.  This book would have been more interesting to me if these perspectives had been brought together more.

B000Y179KO|2.0|There are a few good tracks.. but this is nothing like the genious that came before. Was this a contractual obligation? When the music isn't ridiculously trite and sappy (think of Schmit's \\"love can keep us alive\\" from \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" on estrogen), it is overtly political name calling. When are \\"artists\\" going to understand that they are the last people I would listen to for political advice; not sure why this segment of society believes that they are the \\"center of the universe.\\" I respect Don Henley's effort on reasonable issues like Walden Pond, but please.. On top of all that.. the musicianship is a weak effort; where is Don Felder? He was the best guitarist/musician .. by far... If there is a next, I will buy the next CD on hope because I am a huge fan, but this is the low point musically and lyrically. If you want some good music from an old band, check out Deep Purple with Steve Morse... BTW, I would give every other CD by the Eagles 5 stars.

If you appreciated Casino, Heat, Goodfellas, Donny Brasco, etc., you will really enjoy this film. Best of all, it is a film that you will want to watch again and again, and what better format to watch it in than high definition? The video transfer is among the best I have seen and is suitably matched with Dolby TrueHD audio. Worth every cent.
B000W4HJ44|3.0|Our story opens in 1962 Baltimore.  Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a high school student with a passion to dance.  Every day, she rushes home from school with her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) to watch The Corny Collins Show.  On it, a group of teens dance to the latest hits.<br /><br />When the show has an open casting for a new dancer (one of the regulars is going on a nine month vacation), Tracy wants to go audition.  Her mother Edna (John Travolta) is against it.  See, Tracy is a plus size girl, and Edna is an even bigger woman.  Edna hides in the house because of her size and fears the rejection could crush Tracy.<br /><br />Tracy does get rejected at first, but a second chance gets her a part on the show.  She's an instant hit and her star power rises.<br /><br />This doesn't sit well with Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Velma is in charge of the show, and uses her power to build a career for her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).<br /><br />Even more dangerous, Tracy has some ideas about the once monthly Negro Day.  She thinks that instead of being the last Tuesday of the month, it should be every day.  Is this a good cause?  Can Tracy's new found star power help with integration?  Or will the show stay segregated?<br /><br />Obviously, the movie has a serious message, but it is never preachy.  It never forgets its first mission is to entertain us.  And it is very entertaining.  Well over half the movie is made up of songs, and they are all fun 60's pop.  The choreography was wonderful, featuring some truly imaginative stuff that expands beyond the stage, even when the song was part of the Corny Collins Show.  And all but one of the actors was great.  This is especially true of Nikki Blonsky is who perfect as Tracy.<br /><br />So what was the bad?  First, there's John Travolta.  I know it's a tradition of this musical that Edna is played by a cross dressing man.  But I'm sorry, I just never bought John Travolta as a woman.  Either way, every time he was on screen was annoying.  Like fingernails on chalkboard annoying.<br /><br />One of the characters is a bigoted Bible thumper.  Fortunately, she's a minor character, but you can bet how well that went over with this Christian.<br /><br />The movie skips around just a little too much.  I actually felt like the movie could have been a little longer with just a couple added scenes to better develop the characters and story.  It just felt like a piece was missing.<br /><br />Finally, there are the sexual innuendos and racial slurs.  I understand the racial slurs were acceptable for the time.  While they did bother my modern ears, I could accept them for the sack of accuracy.  But the innuendos really bothered me.  Why?  Because they felt out of place, especially when said on the squeaky clean TV show.  The movie definitely would have been stronger if they'd been taken out.<br /><br />In the end, this movie is a mixed basket.  Its fun with mostly great acting, but the flaws are fairly serious.gernails on chalkboard annoying.    One of the characters is a bigoted Bible thumper.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Up front I'll say that I am very right wing conservative.  Michael Moore's political views are generally reprehensible to me.  With that being said, Sicko is a pretty good attempt at showing how bad our health care system can be at times.  It also makes obvious what many of us really already know; that insurance companies run health care these days.  My experience is that most insurance companies are reasonably fair, but there are situations where they truly do decide who lives or dies.  The movie delves a little into other topics such as free education.  It's definitely a liberal, socialist agenda that Moore is pushing here, but even for the most staunch right-winger the movie is well worth watching for the ideas that it brings up and for many nuggets of truth.  Some of it is a bit absurd, such as pointing to Cuba's outstanding health care system.  Would anyone really want to go to Cuba to get free health care since everything else there sucks big time?  Would Moore himself go there for treatment?  I'll bet he wouldn't.  We do have things that need fixing in our health care system, but I don't think that letting the government take it over is going to be a good thing.  Have they ever done anything that well?  Anyway, watch the movie; it's thought provoking and well worth the time to see it and think about whether or not socialized medicine is going to really solve all our problems.  I saw the movie described as Michael Moore's funniest movie.  There are amusing moments, but I wouldn't call it a funny movie.  It's a documentary/editorial.

The truth is, that the man-made greenhouse gases caused from our current forms of energy harvestation and implementation (as well as a host of other industrial pollutants routinely unleashed on our envoirnment) are an unnecessary abomination.<br /><br />One has but to do a thorough historical study on Nikola Tesla and his remarkable discoveries and inventions to understand what has brought us to our current state of affairs.<br /><br />Tesla is known as \\"The Father of the 20th Century\\" and is regarded by those in the know, as the greatest scientist and inventor of all time, far surpassing, and in many cases directly contradicting the revered Edison and Einstein. Yet most of us learned little or nothing about him in our history books. This is no coincidence. Tesla cared little for monetary gain, but instead had a passion for using his technological discoveries to further the harmonious co-existance between Man and Nature. Some may know that he discovered the principles of alternative current (AC) and created the AC motor back in the late 1800's when Edison was still heavily invested in his direct current (DC) system. But Tesla had many other revolutionary ideas, most will go unmentioned here, (do your own research, I implore you) but his main idea was this; harness the natural electricity contained in the earth's magnetic field and the ionosphere in order to provide free wireless (i.e. clean) energy to the planet.<br /><br />Had Tesla been able to facilitate his ideas, the antiquated, dangerous, and polluting energy sources such as coal and petroleum would be completely unnecessary. Not to mention nulear power. When the atom was split in the early 1900's, Tesla was horrified and warned of the inherrent dangers and the horrible consequences for the earth and mankind such technology was sure to bring about.<br />Now is where you ask how \\"free wireless energy\\" could possibly fulfill our incredible modern demands.<br /><br />First a little background info of great import. Of the many important inventions Tesla was never allowed to get to the masses, two stand out as being particularly key in this discussion. First was his Wardencliffe Tower which was an amazing forefather to the internet. This tower could wirelessly transmit photos, music and communications across the globe, BEFORE the turn of the 20th century! With this tower, Tesla planned to transmit free wireless electricity in full harmony with nature, the world over! (Research this please!)<br /><br />Also, in the 1930's, Tesla took the gasoline engine out of a Pierce Arrow, and replaced it with an electric motor. This motor was then powered by wireless electricity (not batteries) and easily achieved speeds in excess of 90 miles an hour! (see website [...] and click on the \\"Tesla's Electric Car\\" tab for more amazing info.)<br /><br />These inventions are quite incredulous indeed, especially considering how \\"advanced\\" we all think we've become technologically.<br /><br />Tesla's main problem, however, as I previously stated, was that he cared not for economic gain, (aside from that which enabled him to pursue his inventions and discoveries) yet he was dependant on the industrial investors of his day for financing. (Had he wished, he could have easily made trillions on his myriad of inventions crucial to the \\"Industrial Age\\".) J.P. Morgan (name sound familiar?) was the one who pulled the plug on the financing for Tesla's Wardencliffe Tower, once it was found out that there would be no way to meter this energy, thus no profit could be made. Morgan's infamous quote was, \\"Tesla, if you had your way, the only thing we'd be able to sell is antennas!\\" (Tesla's idea was that everyone would have their own antenna to stick into the ground to harness this free, clean, unlimited household electricity, and thus power all their household amenities and appliances, not to mention their vehicles.)<br /><br />In short, if things hadn't been sabotaged by the industrial capitalists and profiteers, our world today would be incredibly different. A virtual utopia where all modern technology worked seemlessly together, and was supported by its' envoirnment, instead of in direct opposition to it. We wouldn't be enslaved to the gas pump, our air would be clean and safe to breathe, and wars (which are fought over energy, let's not kid ourselves with patriotic falsehoods) would be completely unnecessary, as all earth's nations would be equal and there would be no \\"have-nots\\".<br /><br />Feel free to disagree, but please do your research first. Prove me to be a liar, if that be your motivation. Yes, find the truth, and it will set you free. Maybe someday we will have enough enlightened folks that we might be able to eradicate this unnecessary, antiquated and oppressive system. Escape slavery. Escape self-imposed retardation. Thanks for your attention. Now go and find the truth my brothers and sisters.

B00006J9OT|5.0|Last week I received this CD as a gift. I think I finally know why I like Ms. Krall so much.<br /><br />Besides the given that Ms. Krall is a wonderful Jazz pianist, and that she is very attractive, what I think is her real talent, is that she delivers on the emotion of a song so well that I feel that as she is singing, it is meant just for me, with a touch of wit just below the surface, like you are sharing a private joke. I don't know if that was articulated well enough to make sense, but there you go.<br /><br />As to this CD, it is wonderful! Case closed!
B000XR49VQ|4.0|I will not comment on the technical merits of the DVD pressing as other reviewers have done.  As a piece of art, this movie is truly outstanding.  The Tempest is one of Shakespeare's lsat plays, and its themes are love, compassion, the quest for knowledge & power, and finally subduing the ego and finding peace.  Greenaway's version is \\"arty\\", maybe, but it is gorgeous, well-written, intellectually intriguing, and unique.  Gielgud narrates and he is incomparable.  Watch it!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This album is phenomenal!  Very progressive and way ahead of it's time.  This album is unlike any 'hip-hop' that i've ever heard.  Complete with synthesizers and futuristic beats.

Read my review of the book, watch the DVD, and *then* read the book.<br /><br />I actually played the DVD on background while paying bills, and that persuaded me I needed to give the DVD my full attention a second time.  And then the book.<br /><br />The seven laws that sum up the wisdom that this important author shares and explains in detail:<br /><br />1.  The law of pur potentiality<br />2.

This book hit me like a ton of bricks in a way, because all of what I thought was random becomes priceless.  ONLY a former spy who ALSO founded a military analysis center could credibly publish three edited books on Collective Intelligence, Peace Intelligence, and Commercial Intelligence, and look CEOs and Presidents and Prime Ministers in the eye and say \\"The problem with spies is they only know secrets.\\"  (We spend $60B a year on the 4% we can steal, which is both lunatic and criminal).<br /><br />So on a very personal level, the book and the DVD gave me closure on my failure to reform government intelligence, and validated my move to Wall Street, where \\"names\\" in the spy world will fail miserably precisely because they refused to listen or understand \\"open sources\\" since I and the Commandant of the Marine Corps started pressing the point in 1988 (the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals was formed in 1986, 21 years ago).<br /><br />The DVD and the little book are going into my travel bag.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000NO1XHW The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success]]<br /><br />See my many lists, especially the one on Collective and Commercial Intelligence, but a few books I want to mention here to help others find new points of view:<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:0977098303 Escaping the Matrix: How We the People can change the world]]<br />[[ASIN:1576752585 The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter]]<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]<br />[[ASIN:0787943118 Democracy's Edge: Choosing to Save Our Country by Bringing Democracy to Life]]<br />[[ASIN:0609808451 The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World]]<br />[[ASIN:0971566119 The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption]]he book and the DVD gave me closure on my failure to reform government intelligence, and validated my move to Wall Street, where \\"names\\" in the spy world will fail miserably precisely because they refused to listen or understand \\"open sources\\" since I and the Commandant of the Marine Corps started pressing the point in 1988 (the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals was formed in 1986, 21 years ago).

B000VWYNNW|3.0|The new remastered version of this set also contains new versions of some of the songs that were released on the original version of the album.  I presume they culled them from the same 3 night stand at Madison Garden but the liner notes don't say.  Some versions are better, some versions not so better.  I prefer the old \\"No Quarter\\" to this new one, although very good, but the old version has Page pyramiding on his solo - slowly going into it, then exploding, and then calmly fading out of it, whereas this new version has him tearing right into it and getting right out.  The old version is also 2 minutes longer than this one.  Also, the new \\"Rock And Roll\\" sounds like it might be the version used in the film (which was okay).  Having said that, this is still NOT Zeppelin at their best, but a decent document, nontheless, of an amazing band (a bad Zeppelin night was still infinitely better than most bands on a good night).
0679720200|3.0|Camus is here proponing his absurdist theory, as something of a counterpoint to existentialism. The amoral main character, Meursault has a short attention span and an utterly lazy approach to life - not that he doesn't work hard, but that it doesn't make any difference to him what happens. His catchphrase is that things and events are \\"of so little importance.\\" \\"It's common knowledge that life isn't worth living, anyhow,\\" is what gets him through the day.<br /><br />The novel begins as Meursault's mother dies, and then takes us through his daily activities, culminating in a rather inexcusable murder. The second half of the novel traces Meursault's trial.<br /><br />Ultimately, Meursault rejects God repeatedly, although it certainly didn't help that the minister (along with the one other Christian in the novel) is something of a buffoon, and has a very poor approach. Meursault is content to put his fate in the hands of \\"the benign indifference of the universe.\\"<br /><br />Considering the implications of some of these philosophies, it remains baffling to me that some people are content to die and then to cease to exist. Put another way, some people have so little regard for their own existence. Certainly both existentialism and absurdism are anti-Christianity in this and many other aspects.<br /><br />The novel has a little trouble getting out of the blocks, but it picks up nicely and it's a quick read. Ultimately, the degree to which one enjoys this book is dependent on how one feels about its philosophies.<br /><br />TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT
0143039881|5.0|\\"It was sheer thoughtlessness that predisposed him to become one of the greatest criminals of the period,\\" political theorist Hannah Arendt observes of Adolf Eichmann, who was in charge of the logistics behind the mass deportations of Jews and other so-called asocials to ghettos and extermination camps during the 2nd World War. The face of evil, she suggests through her portrayal of the high-ranking SS bureaucrat at his trial in Jerusalem, is not necessarily that of a radically perverse pathological mastermind, but instead and more frightening still, can come in the form of a banal and unimpressive caricature of normalcy.     In his testimony, Eichmann characterizes himself as a blameless cog who was only following orders, and even goes on to cite instances where he tried to help certain Jews who were friends of his escape their inevitable fate. His tone is that of one regaling a run-of-the-mill human sympathy story of hard luck, and his telling is rife with contradiction, blanks in memory, and ridiculous cliché. According to Arendt, this \\"created considerable difficulty during the trial - less for Eichmann himself than for those who had come to prosecute him, to defend him, to judge him, and to report on him. For all this, it was essential that one take him seriously, and this was very hard to do, unless one sought the easiest way out of the dilemma between the unspeakable horror of the deeds and the undeniable ludicrousness of the man who perpetrated them, and declared him a clever, calculating liar - which he obviously was not.\\"    Also relevant for its criticism of the shaky legal foundation upon which the trial was conducted (Eichmann was illegally abducted in Argentina, then was brought to Israel and prosecuted there using an outdated framework that was unable to properly address the problem of genocide as specifically carried out by the Nazis).     This book is very smart, very elegantly written. The questions it raises about ethics and preconceived notionsof good and evil are universal and remain relevant to the times. If it were a person, I'd sleep with it on the first date.

It's mainly about Anthony Kiedis and his life. and all I can say is, \\"WOW\\"!! What's he's been through and where he is at now is truly amazing. It's really amazing and remarkable the struggles, trials and tribulations he's been through. This book is easy to read and makes you just want more and more. I'd love to see him write another book in about 5 years and continue where he left off. I'm so interested in his life now and I hope he continues his success in sobriety and RHCP.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|The release of this DVD sparked huge relief for me. You have the option to watch the Theatrical Version or the Unrated Version.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|'Live Free or Die Hard', number IV in the 'Die Hard' series revisits the basic outline of the first film only in a much more grandiose stlye expanding beyond the confines of one high rise building to encompass the entire eastern seaboard. Bruce Willis reprises his signature role as police detective John McClane and does a fantastic job breathing new life into this now iconic character.<br /><br />Following in the footsteps of another iconic prototype established in the first film, Timothy Olyphant does a superior job as the Alan Rickman-ish, highly intelligent villian as does Justin Long as computer hacker/sidekick to Detective McClane.. Then of course lets not forget the enchanting Maggie Q, sigh...<br /><br />The action is fast and furious, the cast excellent and the dialogue witty especially Justin Longs lines). The only thing keeping this film from a five star rating is the sequence with the jet fighter which was a little too unbelievable for me.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars.

1582701709|4.0|I think the issue that people have with \\"The Secret\\" is that we are a society built off of simplicity and instant gratification. For example, Faster technology, toll tags, microwaves, broadband, drive through ANYTHING! Whatever saves us time and work, we establish. The problem with our society being such a way is that it forces us to take readings like \\"The Secret\\" too literally. The premise of the book is one that is expressed through out the Bible...\\"Faith\\". Did the good Lord not say \\"Ask and you shall receive\\"? The purpose of books like \\"The Secret\\" and speakers, such as Tony Robbins, is to tap into an inner faith that we either; don't recognize that we have OR need instruction on how to put it to it's use. Many times readers want a direct sign or literal terms because we have a \\"Seeing is Believing\\" mentality. All \\"The Secret\\" really does is motivate you to find that inner strength and faith in oneself to accomplsh your dreams, goals and attract those good things to you. It's not a manual or instruction book...interpret it as you will but it works! It tells you that time and faith is all you really need to receive the good you deserve. Yes, it takes time and yes it takes work. It's very easy to get discouraged and that is why I think people have a problem with books like \\"The Secret\\" because it requires you to have patience and faith, which can be hard work at times. No one likes that!

As a child of the 80's, I was a crazed-Madonna-fanatic. I literally grew up with Madonna. Everything she did was always such a huge, world-wide spectacle. Because, Madonna was once, arguably, the most famous human being on this entire planet. I always loved how Madonna would disappear for a few years and then come back as a totally different person; she always sounded so different, acted different and of course, she looked completely unique. Some say that Madonna cannot act; I tend to disagree. The most difficult, challenging and intricate role she has ever played was \\"Madonna.\\" Who knows, maybe she had Dissociative Identity Disorder...?     Out of all of the incarnations that Queen-Madonna possessed (or should I say possessed Queen-Madonna?) I prefer the relatively short-lived \\"American Life\\" phase.

With her jet-black hair, form-fitting military fatigues and now-trademark \\"American Life\\" beret, Madonna resembled a fighter who was out to \\"change the world\\" so to speak.     If you're unfamiliar with Madonna's impressive musical resume and do not know where to start, look no further, because you are home with \\"American Life.\\" This is truly Madonna's best record in years. Because (maybe for the first time?) she wasn't just playing a part. Yes, I know she got all dressed up for the cameras. But her music and lyrics were so real and fundamental. She revealed so much of herself on this CD.     Of course, I love the title-track, lead-single and most controversial song on this album, \\"American Life.\\" Madonna sings about all the clichés that society thinks about her, but she is nothing more than the \\"American dream.\\" In staccato, she even raps forus. You might remember Madonna had the music-video pulled before it even débuted within the US. This was one of the only times in Madonna's 20+ year career where she publicly showed a sense of contriteness and humility.     \\"Mother & Father,\\" \\"Hollywood,\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" are three first-rate songs that I also especially enjoyed. On these songs alone, Madonna brings the listener into her lone world. You will be able to look inside Madonna's intricate mind and actually see what makes her tick. You don't have to like what you see, and you don't even have to respect her; but you can't deny that she was (is?) a bona fide, unabashed iconoclast.     My favorite track on this CD and one of (if not my favorite song, ever) is \\"Nobody Knows Me.\\" It is pure artistic poetry. And, I was always disappointed that \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" didn't come out as a full single. Like a cat holding onto her last breath, Madonna starts this song out by singing, \\"I've had so many lives.\\" She goes on to tell us that she isn't \\"that kind of guy.\\" Nope. The real Madonna is shy and introverted. She may have once sung about \\"expressing yourself,\\" and telling him where to stick it, but in the end Madonna's just a shy housewife that's content on standing behind her man. (Incidentally, does anyone else believe that Madonna was once a g-a-y man in a past life?) Madonna also sings about a \\"social disease.\\" This phrase is so funny, because there was once a time that \\"social disease\\" was a euphemism for HIV/AIDS (when society was too bigoted to actually talk about this ;) and everyone knows how Madonna was always such a teacher as far as AIDS-prevention/education was concerned. On second thought though, maybe Madonna's social disease isn't sexual? Instead it is more deep-rooted. The \\"social disease\\" that she is singing about is personal intimacy. The day this album came out, I went to a release party in celebration of Madonna's latest work in Greenwich Village. But Madonna took off early. Like Greta Garbo, Madonna just wants to be let alone; maybe that's why nobody knows her?
0800111680|5.0|If you judge a war movie by constant explosions, digital effects, and fast action, this half-a-century-old epic may disappoint you. If you'd rather have an intelligent script (co-authored by Michael Wilson, Carl Foreman, and Lean himself), complex characterization, superior acting by some of the stalwarts of the old-time screen (including a superb William Holden), then you may decide to sit through this nearly three-hour long epic and revel in its mesmerizing photography, a musical score that captures the rhythms of action, and an intiguingly wrought double plot that relentlessly drives towards a powerful resolution. But The Bridge on the River Kwai is already a movie that has achieved mythical dimensions and, if you are reading this review, you probably have already seen it. If you haven't, give it a try,or another if you have, and measure it against its modern equivalents and find out how it has withstood the test of time. One of the all time greats.

0440238609|1.0|I read this book because of the movie publicity and out of curiosity due to all the hype about it being anti-religious. Not only was it not really anti-religious, it was also not good. It is really poor writing. Nothing really makes any sense, the characters kind of come and go with no closure, the ending - well there is no real ending. When religion is mentioned, it isn't negative, it just makes no sense. The book is a waste of time. It's almost a decent adventure story but because it has no point and no ending it just left me mad that I had wasted my time reading it. I won't be reading any of the others.

I can sincerely tell you that there is absolutely no need to get this specific CD, unless you're another obsessed fan, too.     As a child of the 80's, I was a crazed-Madonna-fanatic. I literally grew up with Madonna. Everything she did was always such a huge, world-wide spectacle. Because, Madonna was once, arguably, the most famous human being on this entire planet. I always loved how Madonna would disappear for a few years and then come back as a totally different person; she always sounded so different, acted different and of course, she looked completely unique. Some say that Madonna cannot act; I tend to disagree. The most difficult, challenging and intricate role she has ever played was \\"Madonna.\\" Who knows, maybe she had Dissociative Identity Disorder...?     Out of all of the incarnations that Queen-Madonna possessed (or should I say possessed Queen-Madonna?) I prefer the relatively short-lived \\"American Life\\" phase. During this \\"era\\" (Winter-Spring '03,) Madonna was the catalyst. She talked about nuclear testing and was very interested in the peace-effort. With her jet-black hair, form-fitting military fatigues and now-trademark \\"American Life\\" beret, Madonna resembled a fighter who was out to \\"change the world\\" so to speak.     If you're unfamiliar with Madonna's impressive musical resume and do not know where to start, look no further, because you are home with \\"American Life.\\" This is truly Madonna's best record in years. Because (maybe for the first time?) she wasn't just playing a part. Yes, I know she got all dressed up for the cameras. But her music and lyrics were so real and fundamental. She revealed so much of herself on this CD.     Of course, I love the title-track, lead-single and most controversial song on this album, \\"American Life.\\" Madonna sings about allthe clichés that society thinks about her, but she is nothing more than the \\"American dream.\\" In staccato, she even raps for us. You might remember Madonna had the music-video pulled before it even débuted within the US. This was one of the only times in Madonna's 20+ year career where she publicly showed a sense of contriteness and humility.     \\"Mother & Father,\\" \\"Hollywood,\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" are three first-rate songs that I also especially enjoyed. On these songs alone, Madonna brings the listener into her lone world. You will be able to look inside Madonna's intricate mind and actually see what makes her tick. You don't have to like what you see, and you don't even have to respect her; but you can't deny that she was (is?) a bona fide, unabashed iconoclast.     My favorite track on this CD and one of (if not my favorite song, ever) is \\"Nobody Knows Me.\\" It is pure artistic poetry. And, I was always disappointed that \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" didn't come out as a full single. Like a cat holding onto her last breath, Madonna starts this song out by singing, \\"I've had so many lives.\\" She goes on to tell us that she isn't \\"that kind of guy.\\" Nope. The real Madonna is shy and introverted. She may have once sung about \\"expressing yourself,\\" and telling him where to stick it, but in the end Madonna's just a shy housewife that's content on standing behind her man. (Incidentally, does anyone else believe that Madonna was once a g-a-y man in a past life?) Madonna also sings about a \\"social disease.\\" This phrase is so funny, because there was once a time that \\"social disease\\" was a euphemism for HIV/AIDS (when society was too bigoted to actually talk about this ;) and everyone knows how Madonna was always such a teacher as far as AIDS-prevention/education was concerned. On second thought though, maybe Madonna's social disease isn't sexual? Instead it is more deep-rooted. The \\"social disease\\" that she is singing about is personal intimacy. The day this album came out, I went to a release party in celebration of Madonna's latest work in Greenwich Village. But Madonna took off early. Like Greta Garbo, Madonna just wants to be let alone; maybe that's why nobody knows her?
B000MV8ABS|5.0|I've been watching this movie for 12 years now, and it doesn't cease to entertain me.  I admit that I am not, and never was, really scared by the film, but it's highly entertaining nonetheless.    The Tall Man, his Silver Balls, the Dwarves...it doesn't get any better than this, people!  I especially love how in this movie, and ONLY in this movie, The Tall Man has the power to change into a woman and back.  Why in the world does he actually go ahead and mess around with the guys in the graveyard?  Shouldn't he just kill them on the spot?  And why is Mike, a 13 year old, always driving the car (and fixing it!), while his 25 year old brother Jody rides a bike?  And why do The Tall Man's fingers squirt mustard?  Is that some freaky dimension-X replacement for blood?    These, and other equally important questions remain unanswered, which is why Phantasm is the amazing movie and phenomenon that it is.    Angus is creepy - \\"The funeral is about to begin.......SIR!!!!\\"    Great philms, highly recommended!
B000GW88QK|5.0|If you're a collector, you may want to get the Japanese release of \\"American Life.\\" Although it doesn't have any extra tracks, it does include the lyrics to all of the songs in English and Japanese.

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I grew to love Annie Lennox only a few years ago but have been reluctant to actually buy her CD's fearing maybe I would only like one or two of the tracks. Clearly the risk and gamble I took with Songs of Mass Destruction paid off. Each song is special, unique to only Ms Lennox, mixed with meaningful lyrics and soulful spirit. I'm actually short for words for once in my life...just buy this, you won't be sorry you did, and you will surely get many years of listening pleasure.    PS. Isn't she beautiful too? The Britneys of the music scene today can never come close to this kind of raw talent in my humble opinion.
B000OVLBFS|2.0|I kept waiting for this picture to get moving, but it never did. There is a lot of atmosphere and a lot of meaningful brooding, but nothing ever actually happens. As a result, the pacing of this film is painfully slow. We don't get anything like a story until nearly the very end, when Stone stumbles across the money-laundering scheme. Of course, part of the reason everything is so slow is that the filmmakers jettisoned the biggest part of Robert B. Parker's plotline. The money laundering is strictly secondary in the book. It's as if they did \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" without the mutiny. On the plus side, Selleck is excellent, and so is the rest of the cast, but they are torpedoed by the molasses-in-January pace and excess atmospherics. It's hard to believe the same director made the other two Jesse Stone pictures. Those two are excellent; \\"Night Passage\\" is not.
B000H305U0|1.0|Who gave \\"these people\\" the right to re-classify what R & B is?  This stuff is hip/hop and \\"hip/hop\\" is NOT Rhythm and Blues!  This, and the rest of this drivel that these no-talents are dumping on the market, would best be described as JUNK, period.  Timberlake and all the rest of this crowd, are NOT singers.  A real singer doesn't need 25 voices singing along, plus he doesn't need 25 dancers prancing behind him  -- all in an attempt to hide the fact that \\"the singer\\" CANNOT sing and has NO TALENT.   Just ask yourself, will ANYBODY be covering Justin's music 30 years from today?  Will any classics or standards come out of his work?  Will he look back at his discography and find ANYthing worthwhile?    This hip/hop stuff all sounds alike!  The same beats, the same kid-like rhymes repeated over and over and over.  The lead singer has so many backup singers, he/she can hardly be heard (but that's okay, they can't sing anyway).    Mr. Timberlake just won BEST R & B ALBUM from the 2007 American Music Awards a couple of nights ago for this, voted on by 12 and 15 year olds in the United States, who have never heard of Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Etta James or Bettye LaVette, four AUTHENTIC rhythm and blues singers.  These \\"expert\\" voters weren't voting for this \\"music,\\" they were voting because they \\"love\\" Justin and want to be his girlfriend (he has money, right?)
B000YABIQ6|5.0|this was by far the best show in a long time. being close to the ad game, only added to my addiction. the bad news is i deleted from my dvr b/c i thought the dvd would be out as soon as the season was over. but no!!! stupid shows are released on dvd a lot sooner. i wanted to put this on my xmas list, but i can't.    p.s. i'm still waiting for molly dodd to be released too! what's up with that?
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I finally saw this movie with 2 friends last month after waffling about it for awhile. I'm so glad I did. It's visually intimate -- the camera work makes the environment seem more real. The relationship between Guy & Girl is also wonderful as they don't cross that line that from friends to more -- its not some mushy happily ever after ending in the way most romantic films end.<br /><br />But the best and most important part of all is the music. It's stunning and moving -- I bought the soundtrack immediately after watching the movie and just saw Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova play the Beacon Theatre last night -- its even more amazing live.<br /><br />Highly highly recommend this film and its soundtrack! :)
B00042YBTK|5.0|How come Eric Burdon never got the recognition he deserved?  He was an individual.  He faced down the record industry, lost money, but not respect.  There never was a singer from England who sang better than Eric.  This album is a masterpiece.  Who else could put together ,blues psyschedelia, jump r&bs, and a fun, great song dedicated to Tina Turner and pull it off? Only Eric.  Buy this CD and wonder,\\" Why was I listening to the garbage out there when I could have been freaking to this?  Ask MGM.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|Hey, theres never been a u2 concert offically on dvd from under 1992, so to have a pro shot from 87 is a real treat. The picture looks really great and the sound is excellent too. If you compare this performance to the lousy 2005/01/ 97 92 stuff , its like night and day. Bono is in excellent singing voice here. The performance is great and lots of rare stuff, i mean the unforgetable fire live!!! nuff said. Compared to those later 2000's dvds all shot terrible with quick shots not staying on any member for more than a second or two. THis dvd is what u2 is right before they went bad and bonos voice got shot.. Get it just for this is the earliest u2 live performance on dvd...  when they were in their prime.. rather then them being all old. and uninspired..
B00005JPAO|4.0|The last 20 years has seen a growing Hollywood infatuation with English history, especially that concerning the crown.  Examples included \\"Elizabeth\\", \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", \\"Braveheart\\", and now \\"The Queen\\".  The last takes place in the present, the 1990's specifically, and chronicles the personal experience of the royal family after the death of Diana.  The story is told from multiple points of view, with the Queen and Tony Blair being the two main protagonists.  He is in touch with the British people; she is not.  She is in touch with England's past, they are not.  She feels the best way to get past Diana's death is in private; the public want a public ceremony.  So opposites collide and as a sign of a modern country, the monarch gives way to the people's will.  As an American, I found this to be quite an insightful movie, in that it very realistically portrays how a real person in power relates to the masses as part of a real historical event.  Few movies exist that do the same for American leaders; the last great one was probably \\"Nixon\\" by Oliver Stone.  Though all dialogue, this was a captivating movie, and worth the two hours to watch it.
0671027344|5.0|Originally printed in 1999 by MTV Books and Pocket Books, this epistolary novel is written as a series of journal entries to an unnamed friend by a kid who calls himself Charlie.  A coming of age book, it centers around Charlie and his transition from being a wallflower and observer to an active participant in his own life.  The story deals with such issues as homosexuality, teenage suicide, child abuse, and drug use.  The readers of the story follow Charlie's tales of him and his new friends as they put on productions of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, throw parties, and experience the awkward times of adolescence.  We, as the audience, are drawn into the story and taken along for the ride as Charlie experiences his first kiss, is mentored by his English teacher, deals with the suicide of a friend, and experiences his first high. It is a moving story that I love to quote from.  The most entertaining of which is after his first pot-laced-brownie experience where his friend and love interest asks,   \\"Are you seeing anything, Charlie?\\"   \\"Light.\\"   \\"Does it feel good?\\"   \\"Uh-huh.\\"   \\"Are you thirsty?\\"   \\"Uh-huh.\\"   \\"What would you like to drink?\\"   \\"A milkshake.\\"   And everyone in the room, except Sam, erupted in laughter.   \\"He's stoned.\\"   \\"Are you hungry, Charlie?\\"   \\"Uh-huh.\\"   \\"What would you like to eat?\\"   \\"A milkshake.\\"  As Charlie's life progresses in high school and he becomes more extroverted, we begin to see the causes in his former disassociation and psychological issues; which I will refrain from stating to avoid exposing spoilers.   It truly is a deeply affecting coming of age story.  Chbosky did an excellent job of writing this so that the reader is literally pulled into the story, feeling as if they are one of the Characters in Charlie's ever eventful and interesting life.  The vocabulary and diction is spot on and could be believably be written by a slightly socially awkward high-schooler.  I am even still amazed with the research Chbosky didbefore writing this.  All of his cultural references are fairly accurate, down to the shadow cast costumes of Rocky Horror Picture Show.  He even references the socially relevant works of literature, music, movies, and television shows.  He has Charlie reading and becoming a fan of many of the books that I fell in love with at that age- To Kill a Mockingbird, This Side of Paradise, The Great Gatsby, A Separate Peace, Catcher in the Rye, Naked Lunch, and The Fountainhead among others.  He also included music references to The Smiths, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Ride.     It is an intense read that I think most people can relate to.  Anyone who has been or is currently going through adolescence has experienced many of these issues and dealt with their own inner struggles of how to come out of their shell and interact in the world as a well-adjusted person.  Chbosky's passion for Charlie, the story, and the other characters make this a book that you can't put down and silently cheer for.  I've re-read this book many times and each time I find something new that I love about it.  Each new read offers me a different perspective on the book for every point of my life that I'm in.  The honesty, attention to detail, well developed characters, and unpredictable plot have turned this book into one of my all-time favorites.  It is now even a custom in my social circles to annotate a copy and give it to a friend who has never experienced the wonder that is Charlie.
1596912855|4.0|I enjoyed the plot line. What woman has not thought of finding her own Fitzwilliam Darcy?  I would sign up for such a vacation in a heartbeat.  The story line was fun; yet, there were some \\"gaps\\" in the development.  A reader will be satisfied overall.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Deja Vu lingers just below the surface of being a great movie. Its superb cinematography and A-List cast save the movie from being just 'okay'. There are several vivid and emotional scenes that definitely make the movie worth watching. As for plot, don't take your logic hat in with you. You will need to suspend your knowledge of  physics, space and time, and sometimes even your common sense in a way similar to how you have to do to enjoy movies like \\"Frequency\\" and  \\"The Matrix.\\"      But in Déjà Vu, the logicalness is too haphazard. Yes, you do have to let your mind imagine the possibility, but you can't discount logic altogether. Even in the sci-fi world, things still have to make sense for that world. And Deja Vu fails for me in that regard. There are some gaping holes in its presentation of time travel. For example, from some of the statements made by Caviezel's character (he's the evil bomber), one would think that he is aware of the government's time travel capability, which he indeed is not. For instance he makes a comment like, \\"Destiny -- Anyone who tries to stop it from happening will only cause it to happen.\\"  In an earlier scene, we see where this was true -- attempts to change the past didn't work and in fact, may have caused further trouble. But how does Caviezel know this?  Also, toward the end, there is some business with a gun that Denzel takes from Paula that I still don't understand. Without giving too much away, the gun scene just doesn't jive with some things that happened earlier.     Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, and James Caviezel give good performances in spite of a mediocre script in which the dialogue is sometimes overplayed. Adam Goldberg as the wise-cracking genius also gives a noteworthy performance. And Paula Patton as the victim Denzel's character becomes attached to gives, I think, the best performance of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie and though I may be guilty of too much logical analysis, it was quite entertaining.    5 stars for great cinematography, 3 stars for dialogue, plot cohesiveness
B000WQW988|5.0|I got the DVD today!  I've been waiting for this DVD for 14yrs!   I saw Nirvana at the Omni in Atlanta, Nov,1993,   little over a week after they recorded Unplugged.  Why has the machine waited soooo long to release this???   This \\"uncut\\" version of Unplugged totally kicks butt!   Hopefully, someday, some exec they might get the idea   to put ALL of Nirvana's videos on DVD, then everyone   can throw away their crappy bootlegged copies (LISTEN UP DGC)   Dave and Kris, we love ya.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|There's not much I can say about Jaws here that has'nt already been said before, so instead I will talk more about why Hollywood used to be cool and why now....IT IS NOT.<br /><br />Jaws is pretty much a perfect movie in every way possible. The casting and acting are perfect. The actor's and actressess in this film all seem like normal people you would see walking down the street and you can really realate to (the average Joe), and I think it really help's the movie quite a bit. Their performances are not too over-the-top, and not only do the actor's give great performances but you actually start to care and feel for them unlike many movie's nowaday's. Personally I think I know too much about big Hollywood actor's personal live's now to actually take them seriously (if I just seen Brad Pitt on the cover of People magazine the day before crying about his fight with Angelina Jolie, how am I supposed to beleive his role as a bad-a** secret agent? Nothing against Brad Pitt, just an example). It's not necessarily the actor's or actress's fault, it's just how pop-culture and Hollywood is nowaday's.<br /><br />The dioluge in Jaws is perfect but not too perfect, there is awkward pauses, sometimes character's are uncomfortable, and don't alway's say the 'right' thing.......like real life. Not like actor's now with corny catch phrases, perfectly timed scentences, and that ALWAY's know the 'right' thing to say. My point is, Jaws is a realistic film that, like real life, is not alway's perfect.<br /><br />Now I will talk about my favorite thing about Jaws; THE SPECIAL EFFECT'S! Speilberg uses a mixture different technique's to pull off a real (and very angry) killer great white. Mixing shot's of real life footage of shark's, puppetry, prosthetic's, and editing to make a very scary and beleivable shark. That's right folk's...no GGI here, the actor's and special effect's are actually on screen with the actor's and actresses, they are not in front of a green-screen reacting to something that is not even there like so many movie's now. In other word's....it actually took some talent to create realistic special effect's.<br /><br />My other favorite thing about Jaws that I think help's a lot is the music. It add's a lot of suspense to an already suspenseful movie and is some of the best music in movie history.<br />On a last note, one of the greatest thing's about Jaw's is that it can either be veiwed as a horror film, an action film, or a thriller and there is not many film's you can say that about. It is in the eye of the beholder and personally, I veiw it as horror.<br /><br />* I notice a lot of people complaining about this 30th anniversary edition because of the realease of the 25th special edition a 5 year's ago with basically the same special feature's, except for the DTS audio track's and a 2 hour documentary. STOP WHINING, they are alway's going to re-release movie's with more and more extra's as they come along. For myself (a person who has not purchased Jaws until now), why would I buy the 25th annivarsary edition when I could buy the 30th anniversary edition with DTS (better audio), and more features? It's a no brainer. If you already purchased the 25th edition then this release has nothing to do with you and that suck's for you, but for people like myself who have not purchased it yet, of course I would like to have the 2 hour documentary and best audio of one of the greatest movie's ever made. So stop whining about a release that has nothing to do with you and please stop writing bad reveiw's for it. It can be very misleading to people like me who have never purchased it and are looking to, or people who have never seen it.there like so many movie's now.

B000VNMMQ6|3.0|The three stars is for the PG-13 version thats on this blu ray.Live free or Die Hard I think is the best one yet.As for the PG-13 version first its more than just a couple curse words Its more like 25 curse words.Second if your a fan of Die Hard you know that profanity is part of what John McClane is,I think the movie loses a little bit of that raw edge without it,come on this is DIE HARD.I first bought the blu ray version at midnight at wal-mart,I thought oh well so its not the unrated version.I thought the unrated version was probly just a curse word or two maybe some extra violence.After watching the blu ray two things hit me the first was that the blu ray does look really good and sounds great but I also thought it may have lost a little bit of that rawness from the previous films becouse of the PG-13.So today I bought the unrated DVD version  and yes it makes a big diffrence on the movie it has the crazy,raw John McClane like we are use to.Just get the unated version now they'll release an unrated blu ray soon enough.I guess the studio thought they would lose some money if teenagers with Playstation 3 couldn't buy this so they left the blu ray PG-13.Thats to bad
B0000DJZB9|5.0|This is an absolute must for any Guns N' Roses fan! It is a fantastic collection of almost all of their popular videos from 1987 on. The line up includes the following songs: Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, Patience, Don't Cry, Live and Let Die, November Rain, Yesterdays, The Garden, Dead Horse, Garden of Eden, Estranged and Since I Don't Have You. This is the group that showed even metal could have top hits. It's too bad that personalities caused the group's collapse with the original members when their music was at its best. Long live the old Guns N' Roses, my personal favorite band! Have a brew, sit and relax in your home while watching these fine and classic videos.
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|This movie was typical Michael Moore.  Fundamentally, he's raising an issue that needs to be discussed.  I agree with the basic thesis, that American healthcare needs to be reformed.  But, like other Michael Moore films, his work is sloppy.  Rather than present the case of the average American, Brit or Canadian, he does his best to show you the worst-side of American healthcare, and the best side of all others.  There are many articles available chronicling Moore's sloppiness in this movie.  I guess the man's point is to raise the issue, infuriate many and entertain his fans.  He loves the spotlight and being a controversial figure.  Hopefully, this leads to a serious policy discussion in the '08 election...the American system needs reform, but adopting the Canadian or British model is not the simple solution Moore presents.
0751532711|1.0|There are over 300 reviews giving it 1 star, and 1,000 giving it 5 stars. Can that many people be wrong, or that many right? To put it bluntly, more people are wrong. If you want to read it, fine, read it, Get it from a discount book store, that way you are paying THEM and not the publisher or this man.    This book is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. When finished, I felt motivated to \\"escape\\" the rat race, only to think \\"Where do I begin?\\" You can't take this advice and expect to come out on top. That is just stupid and unreal. The most you will get from this book is some fuel to go \\"Alright, time to think about my investments.\\" Then thats about it.    In all honesty the book started well. After about 100 pages I was wondering what was going on, why I wasn't getting advice. By the time I finished it, I was already walking towards the trash can.

B000WTZ784|3.0|With Genesis reuniting this past year with Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks as a whole of the original era of success, they've brought down the house to a whole new era of fans, who seem to be more into acts like Britney Spears and Beyonce'. That wasn't the case wioth fans back in 1997 with Genesis. After Phil left the group because of trouble within his personal life with his second marriage ending, the group recruited Ray Wilson to take the lead for their final studio album Calling All Stations. Sadly, though it didn't catch on with die hard fans, but sounded well for anyone who hadn't heard Genesis yet, with that never say die appeal. Now, the album has been reissued again, and it sill sounds really well.<br /><br />The 2007 re-release of Calling All Stations, 10 years after Ray Wilson took over the lead from Phil Collins sounds very well from the depths of the voice, to the deep sadness and darkness of the album. The songs here have all been restored nicely within the sounds of a new 5.1 surround sound mix, as is shown with the sounds of the album. The collection includes the overlooked tracks Congo, the somber If That's What You Need and the haunting Shipwrecked. The album also includes a DVD of extras that blend in well to the album, including the videos for Shipwrecked and a rare live performance of the soulful and emotional tracks There Must Be Some Other Way and The Dividing Line, and a new set of interviews from the group.<br /><br />While the album hasn't seen the light in record stores in nearly a decade, Calling All Stations is a good buy for those who haven't yet heard the album. Even though the album doesn't feel like it is a must buy for die hard fans, unlike the recent re-releases of We Can't Dance or Invisible Touch, it still adds some muscle to a overlooked Genesis era that should would try to take notice, and a attitude of music that sounds well to call all stations to.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />DVD Extras: B-<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: C+Overall: C+
B000VNMMRA|4.0|I bought this Unrated version thinking there would be better fight/action sequences.  But the only thing the unrated version gives you is more profanity (curse words).  The action is still the same.  So if you have Blu-Ray, I would buy that version instead, even if it is PG-13.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|When it has came to classic rock reunions, there have been very few this past year that really have delivered from the heart like the ones from Britain. That has really maintained being true from the success of The Police and their big reunion which was most of the main hype. But believe it or not, the big reunion cam mainly from Genesis. After 15 years on stage without their main star, Phil Collins, Genesis mainly felt like they were left in the dark. Nevertheless, the group had a big reunion with all the fans excited. That has been said very well, after their live reunion on VH1's Rock Honors back in May, which was the big talk of the show. Now, the group has proven that well with a big reunion tour, and this is the Europeans saying they can't truly dance!!<br /><br />Genesis's 2007 live album, Live Over Europe is a collection of 21 of the groups big tracks, recorded during many of their live performances from the European leg of the groups acclaimed reunion tour. The double album takes some of the performances from places like Helsinki, Italy, Paris, and Germany. While the collection wasn't made as one simple live concert, the feeling that matches the mood of the album is well-measured, and showcased from Phil's tireless soulful voice. The album includes some of their best songs performed for the first time in years to a new generation of fans. The album contains live rendiditions of tracks No Son Of Mine, the somber Hold On My Heart, their first hit as a threesome Follow You Follow Me, the deep and dark Home By The Sea, and other great classics like Invisible Touch and the haunting Mama. While the sound is different than the key we used to hear them play as whole, the songs feel just like they are fresh as the day they performed together in years.<br /><br />Sadly though, while I wish that Genesis could've performed some of their other favorites like In Too Deep and Jesus He Knows Me on this live album, but Live Over Europe takes the feeling of reintroducing Genesis well to a new era for die hard fans, but nicely as well for anyone who seems to be more into acts like the crazy screwed-up Britney Spears and Fall Out Boy. It is great to hear Genesis as a whole for the first time in years, and the heart is right on with Europe.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2-<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B-ew era for die hard fans, but nicely as well for anyone who seems to be more into acts like the crazy screwed-up Britney Spears and Fall Out Boy.

B000VNMMQ6|4.0|The only difference between the 2-disc Unrated DVD version of this movie and the original version is a lot of profanity (curse words).  Other than that, there's no difference in action sequences.  If I had known, I would have bought this Blu-Ray version instead.  So buy this!  It's in Hi-Def!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|What a delightful movie!  A family movie that is fun, has a story that is engaging for children and adults, and is quite fresh.  I mean a story about a rat who cooks?  Rats around human food are most everyone's nightmare, but Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat whose food you would want to taste.  He is a rat you would like to get to know.  Remy is a rat we want to see in at least one sequel!<br /><br />Remy's father, Django (Brian Dennehy), is the leader of their huge rat clan.  They scavenge where they can and stay out of sight of humans as much as they can.  Emile (Peter Sohn) is Remy's not too bright brother who is happy to eat anything almost constantly.  Remy has become a fan of a once great French Chef named Gusteau (Brad Garrett) who died of a broken heart shortly after his masterpiece \\"Anyone Can Cook\\" was published and panned by the feared food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />By the time fate gets Remy to Gusteau's restaurant, it is an institution for the tourists, although the cooks there care in their own way.  Chef Skinner managed to take the place over and is gearing up to market Gusteau's image on a variety of frozen foods.<br /><br />This is as far as I want to take you in setting up the story.  Well, one more thing.  A young man named Linguini shows up looking for any job.  His mother has died and she was a friend of Gusteau's, so he gets a job cleaning up.  Remy and Linguini form as close a friendship as a rat and a young man can have, given the language barriers and all.  However, it does help that Remy can understand humans and can even read.<br /><br />This is a movie I have watched several times already and is still very enjoyable.  Superbly done in every way.  The animation is wonderful and the voice characterizations are great (there are many more fine performances than I could list).  Enjoy it!<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI
0143038419|2.0|I was dying to read this after all the hype and had to special order it because my bookstore deemed it too hedonistic.  That just increased the hype.  Well, I was so bored.  Poor lady rambled on endlessly and I took ages to finish it only because I was determined to get to Bali.  I had to cheat and skim a lot while in India.  Bali was much better but overall very disappointed.  Year of Pleasures was a much better book.
B000O1799U|3.0|While the Oscar snub was certainly shocking I can't say that it wasn't justified (not that the lineup for 2006 impressed me in the least).  `Dreamgirls', while probably one of the most entertaining films of the year, was far from the best.<br /><br />It delivers in many ways.  It's visually stunning, from the set pieces to the beautiful cast.  It's very easy on the ears.  The musical numbers (for the most part) are all brilliantly structured and add layers to the film.  In fact, the films biggest and key emotional scenes are in fact musical numbers.  Both `And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going' and `Listen' are the most emotionally connected scenes in the film for through music they convey the very feelings of the singer.  It also delivers, to an extent, in the acting department as well.  Eddie Murphy is fantastic as James \\"Thunder\\" Early and delivers a career best performance.  Beyonce Knowles shocked me with her delivery of Deena Jones and Anika Noni Rose beautifully captured the immaturity and naivety of Lorrel Robinson.  In fact everyone delivers decently here except for Jamie Foxx who was, without a doubt, miscast.<br /><br />Sadly, with all this delivery the film fails to deliver in the one area that matters the most; substance.  By the time the credits begin to roll `Dreamgirls' is nothing more than a fun time.  The characters, while superbly acted, lack any real depth and the film fails to evoke any real emotion in the audience.  With all the hype surrounding this film you'd expect to be really moved, really taken-a-back by it's magnitude but in the end it doesn't really do any of that.  One may be blinded by the glitz and glam upon a first viewing, as I was, but upon second and third viewings it becomes apparent that the film feels kind of empty, especially when the music has stopped.<br /><br />The film tells the story of aspiring musical act `The Dreamettes' who finally get their big break after aspiring music manager Curtis Taylor Jr. sees them perform in a talent show.  He persuades them to sing backup for R&B sensation James \\"Thunder\\" Early and thus their showbiz life begins.  The group suffers from internal struggles when lead singer Effie is pushed aside so the slimmer, more socially termed `pretty girl' Deena can sing lead vocals.  This seemingly small gesture drives a wedge in friendships and relationships, working and social, and creates a whirlwind of tragedy and in the end justice.<br /><br />Now, I left off one key element to the film for a reason...and that is the fact that arguably there was no bigger star in 2006 than the beautiful and talented Jennifer Hudson.  I don't necessarily agree with her Oscar win, but I was so happy for her because she delivered on all fronts and was so gracious with all the accolades she was receiving.  She handled herself like a true star, and that is commendable.  As Effie White she truly breathed life into this film and serves as one of the only actors here to actually flesh out her character.  With all the `lack of depth' found in `Dreamgirls' it is refreshing to see Jennifer grab a hold of Effie and make her real and relatable to the audience.  So I am here to tell you that Jennifer ain't goin nowhere, and that is a fact!<br /><br />So, the film is, like I said, extremely entertaining and a truly fun filled time.  Parts are corny (that whole \\"Steppin' to the Bad Side\\" part was dreadfully painful to watch) but as a whole it is just good ol' fun.  But that is it.  It is a fun film, but not a deep one and not one that deserved to win Oscars (aside from some technical, musical and acting recognition).  So, do I feel that the Oscar snub was truly a `snub'?  No, but I don't feel that that really takes away from the appeal and the good time that a film like `Dreamgirls' brings to the table.uades them to sing backup for R&B sensation James \\"Thunder\\" Early and thus their showbiz life begins.

1602830452|5.0|I don't think there is any better audio production than this set of dramas. It easily compares with the best radio drama of the 40's and 50's when you had Orson Welles, Arch Obler, Norman McDonnell, William Spier and Carlton E. Morse producing alot of sterling work. This set harkens back to that kind of quality.  Before everybody moved to television. The writing,the acting, the sound effects are superb. Audio is unique. I think it is the best medium for creating atmosphere. With this set,you are literally transported back in time to late 19th century London and it's environs and colorful characters(including our two heroes). There is no doubt with this set. The BBC simply does audio drama the way it's supposed to be done. SUPERB!!!
6305692572|4.0|It's a little heavy-handed and comes off a bit syrupy at the end, but `When a Man Loves a Woman' is an effective tear-jerker of a drama that accurately handles the tragedy that is alcoholism.  It manages to take no sides in the matter and portray both spectrums of the disease, looking objectively at the alcoholic themselves as well as the sober mate as he tries to pick up the pieces.  It refuses to really place any blame, even when it tells you that it is and I think that was a wise step since there really is no blame to be placed in situations like this.  You get better, you move forward.  When you stop to point the finger you regress.<br /><br />The film takes a look at a middle class suburban family torn to pieces because of the wife's battle with alcohol.  Alice Green seems to be the perfect mother and spouse from the outside but she harbors a dirty secret.  She hides her problem from her family; her husband included, but when things really hit their bottom there is no denying what needs to be done.  Alice enters rehab in order to clean up, to get sober and stay there to protect her family.  This leaves a strain on her husband Michael to take care of their two daughters Jessica and Casey, as well as work and take care of the home.  The stress of having his wife away from him, not knowing how she is doing at all times, eats away at him and causes divisions between him and others that he comes in contact with, like the Green's housekeeper Amy.<br /><br />What I love so much about this film is that it exposes the fact that the disease is not the only problem causing agent.  Most people feel that when one suffers from a substance problem they can fix it and move on and everything will be better but the fact remains that that is not the case.  When Alice returns home, sober and clean, her fights with Michael intensify to the point where they start to loathe one another.  It casts a light on the fact that the rehabilitation process is just as painful sometimes as the disease itself.  People change when they are sober, and that is brought to the forefront too.  It's clear that, while he doesn't want to admit it, Michael misses the woman his wife was when she was drunk.  He misses her wild side as well as his ability to put her back together when she fell to pieces.  It's a time of adjustment, not just for the `sick' mate but for the entire family.<br /><br />Meg Ryan is astonishing here.  It sickens me to know she was snubbed of the Oscar nomination (she's my personal winner this year) for her performance is so accurate and effortless.  She manages to display every confused emotion you'd expect to see from an alcoholic going through rehab.  She manages to capture her character brilliantly.  Andy Garcia works here, but his performance doesn't carry the same weight as Ryan's.  He manages to capture the confusion and pain of the worried spouse well but he's almost too subtle at times, so subtle that his outbursts seem a bit theatrical.  Tina Majorino is amazing as the eldest daughter Jessica.  She was quite the star in 94 with `When a Man Loves a Woman' and `Corrina, Corrina' coming out back to back and showcasing this young girls talent.<br /><br />In the end `When a Man Loves a Woman' delivers.  It really works as a dramatic film to capture the harsh realities of alcoholism and even teaches the viewer of the consequences that come from all sides of the equation.  Like I mentioned in the beginning, the film is a bit heavy handed.  It tries really hard to make this as tragic as can be.  It also comes off syrupy at the end, as in `let's make this as devastating as possible that way when everything gets fixed the whole audience will burst into tears'.  Sadly, I hated the ending.  It was too corny for my taste and took away from the film's feeling of reality, at least in my opinion.  But, the entire film leading up to the last thirty seconds is phenomenal and deserves major attention.  Even if `When a Man Loves a Woman' is not you cupof tea you must admit that Meg Ryan chews up the scenery like it were candy and delivers an orgasmic performance worthy of much praise and admiration.Ryan chews up the scenery like it were candy and delivers an orgasmic performance worthy of much praise and admiration.
0765357151|4.0|Many people have rushed out to read this 'book' due to the upcoming movie. Frankly put, the movie will not be close to the book and great liberties will be taken. Most people know the basic story, as noted everywhere, Neville is the last man on earth... but he's not alone. Everyone else has succumbed to the vampire-like plague. This is his story. Neville is just a guy, he's not a doctor, cop, athlete, or military. He's just Mr. Anybody and that is what helps make this 160 pg story work.<br /><br />Even better with the current release of the story, is the collection of other short stories written by Matheson. There's a good variety and some stunk (Witch War), some were borderline (Mad House), some were mildly amusing (The Funeral), and some were quite good (Person to Person)  but most of the extra stories are interesting and light horror. My favorite in the book is actually PREY which does have a movie adaptation in 1975's [[ASIN:B000FFJZO2 Trilogy of Terror]] . I saw that movie as a little kid and it scared the bejesus outta me and still bothers me now.<br /><br />Buy it for I AM LEGEND, but enjoy the surprisingly decent short stories afterward.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I would definitely rate this movie in one of my top 10 all time favorites.  I am not a mushy person and I really don't care for love stories but this is absolutely one of the best love story(ies) movies ever.  I think all the characters have depth and you can truly feel their emotions when the highs are high and the lows are low.  There is definitely at least one character that everyone can relate to.   Make it one of your must see movies this season.
0743496728|1.0|I cannot fathom how so many people gave Nineteen Minutes good reviews. It is complete emotionally manipulative trash. This story was nothing more than an attempt to pad Jodi Picoult's bank account than give us something thought-provoking to read.    I did read it through to the end and was absolutely **disgusted** at its completion. There was no resolution. There was nothing new to think about. It was pointless telling of tragedies just to make a buck.    Let's also talk about the formulaic storylines. Jodi picks a tragedy that is sensitive to most people, exploits it in a story, throws in some \\"good\\" parents and troubled kids to increase the emotional manipulation and then ends it with a completely unbelievable quick tie-up.    I'm sick of hearing about jail, prison life, court room dramah, kids killing eachother, raping eachother or being raped. There are people who say she \\"tackles\\" serious issues. I don't agree. She uses serious issues to fatten up her wallet.    This book is a waste of paper. I have read four total now of her novels. The first being My Sister's Keeper which I enjoyed thoroughly. The rest were garbage. I won't be reading anymore. Apparently My Sister's Keeper was an anomaly.
B000VR824S|3.0|It's good for what it is, but it is missing the best tracks of several of the performers.  Many people have mentioned A day in the Life by Jeff Beck, which I agree should have been included.  Also, I Don't Need No Doctor, the Ray Charles cover that John Mayer did was one of the top 4 songs of the show and should have made the cut as well.      Also, I hope they fixed the awful sound that was on the webcast.  For example, Eric Clapton only played lead guitar for two of his songs, for the rest, Derek Trucks played lead.  However, Eric Clapton's guitar was miked about 5 times louder than Trucks.  Same with Buddy Guy's \\"All Star\\" set, with Buddy Guy and Clapton's guitars the only one's audible, even when it was Hubert Sumlin, Robert Cray, or John Mayer playing the solo.

0143038583|5.0|Mr. Pollan does not attempt a scientific treatise on nutrition or an economic analysis of the food industry.  However, he found an important niche as a \\"reporter\\" on the food beat, a topic that has not been popularized to the extent it deserves to be.  His framework for a tour of the U.S. food (and quasi-food) supply is really ingenious.  He starts with three very different kinds of meals - fast food, organic, and natural - and takes the reader back to the roots of the food supply for each of them.  You will visit expansive cornfields, sickening feedlots (no slaughterhouses as they barred his admission to observe), no-pesticite/no-hormone operatins, a grass-based farm, an outdoor chicken killing gathering, a feral pig hunt, a mushroom hunt, and other venues far beyond your daily routine.  The author lets the story tell the story and does not overtly press any particular viewpoint.  Nonetheless, unless a reader is already well-informed on our food supply chains, this is a real eye-opener that will not leave your thinking unchanged.  Rather, it will pull together a lot of disparate thoughts that have already occurred to you and confirm many of your suspicions about the root causes of our health/obesity/nutrition/disease problems in America.  I recommend reading the Omnivore book before moving on to Mr. Pollan's more recent book, \\"In Defense of Food\\".  Together they begin to equip the you to navigate the dangerous shoals of the modern supermarket and also train you to think about what you are eating, where it came from, and whether it will improve or degrade your health.  Mr. Pollan has done a great in turning what could be a dry topic into a fun and engaging series of stories that are vivid and relevant.
0739350463|4.0|This is a review of the audio CD narrated by Alfred Molina.<br /><br />Mr. Molina has a pleasant voice for narration but I had expected more in the way of vocal characterizations from an actor of his stature than I heard in this narration.  He did a good job with the pirate voices (and the pirate parrot) but it was not always easy to distinguish among them when several pirates were talking.  And because sections of the book are told by different characters, I'd have liked more distinction between the voices of Jim Hawkins, the doctor, the squire and the captain.<br /><br />Although it was not as inspiring a narration as I had hoped it would be, it was an enjoyable listening experience and I didn't regret the time spent on it.
B000W04S6U|5.0|I just received the Halo 3 Soundtrack today and I have to say it is hundred's of times better than the previous soundtracks. Halo 3's OST \\"Finishes the Fight\\" just like the game does and does so in high quality sound and \\"in game\\" continuity that leaves you wanting more.    Regretfully, the only hinderance to this wonderful soundtrack is the addition of the hidden track (#17) on disc 2 \\"Love Your Friends\\" by Princeton... truthfully, while it may've won the contest, it isn't very good but, thankfully, can be skipped since it is at the END of the CD.    A wonderful purchase for ANY Halo fan and hope this isn't the end...
B00003CXDV|5.0|While GalaxyQuest starts off a little slowly, it quickly recovers to be one of the funniest movies around. That said, it's a lot funnier for people who watched the original Star Trek. Many of the gags reference situations from Star Trek episodes. Beyond that, Tim Allen's character is a parody of William Shatner, and the relationships are a lot funnier if you understand how they reflect the real-life relationships of the Star Trek cast.<br /><br />That said, this is a movie that even non-Trekkies will enjoy; it's probably just more like a 3.5-star movie for them.
159102594X|3.0|Abercrombie's \\"The Blade Itself\\" could best be described as \\"Dark Epic Fantasy\\". Really dark. You get the requisite wizards, barbarians, and a quest. But there are also sudden bursts of gore, cursing, and seriously flawed anti-heroes.  Among the more interesting characters are Logen Nine-Fingers, a contemplative barbarian who is haunted by the people he has killed, and Inquisitor Glotka, a zealous torturer who practices dentistry on his prisoners without the courtsesy of anesthesia.       Abercrombie's day job is that of film editor, so it should as no surprise that he knows how to write pithy, crackling dialogue.  The action scenes are also very well done.  The action is well-described and briskly paced, with copious amounts of bloodshed.  Read the first two pages and see for yourself.      \\"Blade\\"'s primary weakness lays in its lack of a clear antagonist. I wasn't sure who I was supposed to be rooting against or what the bad guys wanted. There are villains but they didn't get enough screen time for me to hate them. Without clear villains to propel the narrative, the plot seems to meander and drag in spots.     Still, Abercrombie is a smart writer and this is a promising debut.  If you want fast-paced, bloody fantasy, Joe Abercrombie's \\"The Blade Itself\\" is just what the doctor ordered.
0316067598|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  The author is a true American patriot and a hero.

When the authorities find out that Shay is missing however, they know that Tally is the key to finding her and now Tally must face a choice: Betray her friend, or stay ugly...forever.<br /><br />I was sad when this book ended. I can't wait to read the second book and I would totally recommend it to any teen who is having issues with how they look or with society's idea of what beauty is.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|This is the first album review I have ever done and obviously because I feel strongly about this gem of an album. \\"The Final Cut\\" is an amazing piece of music and easily my favorite Pink Floyd production. Yes,  I own the others but \\"The Final Cut\\" speaks to the listener like no other. The way Rogers spills his heart out on this album is much more impressive than \\"The Wall\\". From the chilling \\"The Gunners Dream\\" to the energetic \\"Not Now John\\" the sorrow and strength of this album continue on. While \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" is one of the best closers in Rock N' Roll. Do yourself a favor and pick up this treasure if you have yet to and if it is already in your collection, dust it off and give it another listen. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|FOR  MANY  YEARS  IT  WAS  A  TRADITION  IN  MY  FAMILY  TO  WATCH  THIS ON  CHRISTMAS EVE.  U  CANT  GET  ENOUGH OF  THIS  MOVIE.  ITS  LAUGHTER  FROM  BEGINNING  TO  END.  IT  SHOWS  CHRISTMAS  REALLY  IS  ABOUT  FAMILY  AND  NOT  PRESENTS.  ONCE  MY  DAUGHTER  IS  OLD ENOUGH  TO  UNDERSTAND  THINGS  I  WILL  MAKE  THIS  MOVIE  OUR  CHRISTMAS EVE  TRADITION.  THIS  MOVIE  IS  APPROPRIATE  FOR  ALL  AGES.  ANYWAY  JUST  BUY  IT  FOR  YOUR  COLLECTION  U  WONT  REGRET  IT.
B000009RC2|5.0|Yes, it's perhaps more of an 'instrumental rock' than a jazz record, but those are just labels.  This is powerful, deep music performed by a stellar band, and it demands to be played loud. This album stands at the very top of Jazz-Rock recordings from the 70's.
0767821769|5.0|I  CAN  RELATE  VERY  WELL  TO  THIS  MOVIE.  AS  A  CHILD  MY  STEPMOM  AND  I  DIDNT  REALLY  SEE  EYE  TO  EYE.  THAT  HAS  DEFINATLEY  CHANGED  SINCE  IVE  GOTTEN  OLDER.  KIDS  REALLY  DO  HAVE  A  HARD  TIME  DEALING  WITH  DIVORCE  AND  A  PARENT  SEEING  ANOTHER  PERSON.  IT  CAN  AFFECT  THEM  IN  WAYS  NOONE  COULD  IMAGINE.  THIS MOVIE  DEALS  WITH  THE  EVERYDAY  DRAMA  OF  A  SPLIT  UP  FAMILY  AND  ADJUSTING  TO  A  PARENTS  NEW  RELATIONSHIP.  I  THINK  THE  12  YEAR  OLD  IN  THIS  MOVIE  WAS  MORE  AFFECTED BY  THESE  EVENTS  THAN  HER  YOUNG  BROTHER.  SHE  WAS  VERY  HOSTILE  AND  DEMANDING  BUT  TURNED  OUT SWEET  AS  PIE.  I  HOPE  THIS  IS AN  ISSUE  MY  DAUGHTER  WILL  NEVER  HAVE TO  DEAL  WITH.  IF  YOU  CRY  DURING  MOVIES  BE  PREPARED.  I  THINK  EVEN  THE  STRONGEST  PERSON  WILL  SHOW SOME  EMOTION  TO  THIS  MOVIE.  IT  GETS  ME  EVERY  TIME  I  SEE  IT.
0525950079|5.0|This is a fabulous story. The characters are well drawn and keep you turning pages far into the night.  This book stands on its own but there are references to Pillars of the Earth which I enjoyed.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This is a magnificent film well worth owning your own copy, dealing with perhaps the greatest person of the 20th century and many other centuries as well.    It has just one flaw, small or large depending on your taste in such matters.  One of the most remarkable features of Gandhi's character was his resilient serenity and fidelity to his purposes in the face of tremendous odds and considerable personal suffering and failure.    This account of his life shows us this trait but gives us no idea of its origin in his experience.  Instead, it offers us a glimpse of a young Gandhi being thrown off a train in the middle of the night by a racist conductor.  Ben Kingsley, playing Gandhi, simply picks himself up, dusts himself off and begins the first of many successful strategies of non-violent but extremely active resistance.    His response to the religious turmoil which threated to strangle his infant nation in its cradle was heroic beyond belief.    From what reservoir did he draw this tremendous strength?  The movie hardly provokes that question, and it certainly does not attempt to answer it.  Probably because the answer involves no great spectacle.
B000Y179KO|5.0|It's very simple.  If you liked the Eagles previously, you'll like their first new effort in, like forever.    The outstanding guitar work, the harmonies, the precise clean sound; all that you've come to expect from the Eagles, it's here.  There are ballads, there are rockers, there are smooth vocals and snazzy riffs.  Personally, I think it's maybe their overall best effort and that's saying a lot.  Regardless of my opinion, any Eagles fan should find plenty to like in this 20 song collection and even a non-fan can probably agree that it's a polished and professional effort.    Simple is as simple does, sir.  Get this CD, you won't be sorry!
B000026HGT|5.0|The new release of the old vinyl is as good or better than the original. My adult son and I are playing it endlessly.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|This is a cute and safe movie for any age.  No inappropriate language, no nudity and Katie Holmes is very likeable.  Michael Keaton comes across like you'd want him for a dad.  All the characters are credible and believable.  I've watched it several times.  I love the ballroom dancing scenes.  You like to think guys can still dance like that.  The bonus features are fun too.  This is very G/PG feeling so if that's what you are looking for, this is it.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Yes, it is slow but my taste is just that.....slow and steady. A good story with depth, not in a hurry to get it over with.<br /><br />A ships commander leads his men on a trip around the world trying to capture an enemy ship.
B00005MP58|5.0|Absolutely outstanding.  I can't see Colin Firth in any other role after this.  It's beautifully done in every way and all the actors are perfect.  I've watched it again and again.  It's definitely a chick flick but then it is Jane Austin.  The outdoor scenes are so amazing.  Only in England can you find this amazing historical architecture and scenery seemingly untouched.
B000LE0TGA|5.0|Okay there is considerable debate on this version verses the Joe gastwirt version. No comparison-especially in the bottom end-and no wonder it's only been 18 years since the original was done. This is the way it was meant to be heard, and the bonus track Latitude North is nearly worth the price alone. Buy and enjoy!
B000VI70X6|5.0|This woman just gets better with time. She is still so strong lyrically, vocally and musically, and she puts on a show better than she ever did. She wipes the floor with all her other pop contemporaries, who are miles behind her gorgeous dance moves, her poetic lyrics, and her powerful voice. And on top of all this, she is an incredible entertainer and performer! Watch Antología and try not to cry. I recommend this DVD not just to Shakira fans (who, sadly, are the only ones buying it) but to anyone who wants to see a great show.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Let's just say that this has become as much a part of our household as the Holy Bible (not really), but HEY this is it! My family thinks i wrote most of this, and my 26 year old son still remembers what I was wearing, and what we had to eat at the consession stand when we saw this in it's first week at the theater back in December 1989! I start quoting lines in about October, and the big question is how early we will \\"pop it in\\" the DVD player. That it is Clark-that it is!-my new favorite line after my best friend quoted it for me! Okay I'm just having fun-I just hope I get that Christmas bonus!
B000002KO3|3.0|Whilst the first half of this album contains the CLASSIC Once In A Lifetime and excellent The Great Curve, Crosseyed And Painless and Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On), the second half of this album is rather a snooze fest, with slow, moody songs with sparse instrumentation.    The first four songs are worth this purchase, though be warned about the last four. I particularly recommend the 2006 CD/DVD remaster, the two videos live from German TV show RockPop are great, but the 5.1 remix doesn't do much for me.    Overall, weak compared to their superior previous album, 1979's Fear Of Music. Get that before getting this one.
B000002618|5.0|This is such a great album, from beginning to end.  It's a classic and one of Julio's very best.
B000053V7Q|5.0|This is a must for all Elvis fans, and anyone else who wonders, what made Elvis the King of Rock N Roll.      Great behind the scenes footage, and fantastic concert footage.  I highly reccomend this to everyone.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase the whole CD, but for 10 bucks I did it and was very pleased.  I love all 17 tracks even the songs I've heard before.  The abbey road version of Sam's Town is captivating. The killers have their own unique sound and are multi-talented making the two covers better than the originals.  IT's WORTH IT
B000V6BE6M|5.0|What can you say?  I've also been waiting for it since the release of Fellowship 2 years ago.  Now to listen to it all as a whole.  Howard Shore has created an entire tapestry that not only serves the picture but stands as music on it's own.  Speaking as a classical composer, it's rare to see anything written for films on this scale.  Obviously it ranks up there with the greatest John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith scores or epics from the Golden/Silver Age of film music.  Bravo to Rprise Records for three finely packaged sets!
1594489505|5.0|I was given this book title to read for a book club and not being an avid reader, I was hesitant to get the book, knowing that I hadn't read the first novel by Hosseini, The Kite Runner.  Once I started this book, however, I couldn't put it down and was really educated about the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan as it exists today.  I cried for the women and children, thinking about it long after I read it. I was anxious then to read The Kite Runner. Hosseini has a real knack for writing that makes his books very readable.
0765357151|1.0|With the upcoming release of the new movie starring Will Smith, I really wanted to read this book.  I saw the Omega Man starring Charlton Heston and thought it was great.  But I HATED this book.<br /><br />I know it was written in 1954.  I know it is considered a classic of horror.  But that is not the reason I read today.  I read to be entertained.  50 years ago I am sure it was cutting edge, but today it is slow and borderline boring.<br /><br />The story itself only takes up 154 pages.  The remainder of the book is filled up with other short stories by the author.<br /><br />If you want to know what was scary back in the 50's, good luck.  If you are trying to pass the time with something that is exciting and fun to read, look elsewhere.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|I'm a huge Led Zeppelin fan.  I have their entire discography sitting five feet from me as I write this review, including the far superior How the West Was Won.  I picked this up the day it came out in hope that it fixed the overall poor performance that was on the original album.    The short answer: it didn't.  Although there are merits to having the entire performance (including a newly released decent rendition of Since I've Been Loving You), the underlying problem is still there: this is not a very good performance.  Immediately when they start off with Rock and Roll, you can feel the lack of energy, and seldom does it go away through the entire album.    There are some highlights, including the (expanded) version of Dazed and Confused, clocking in at 29 minutes, No Quarter, Moby Dick, and Since I've Been Loving You, but for every highlight, there is a lowlight, including mediocre versions of Black Dog, Rock and Roll, and Stairway to Heaven (Jimmy's solo is horrifically muddled).    Bottom line, is go pick up How the West was Won first.  They capture the Led Zeppelin live experience much better.  This album is for collectors only.
1563899426|3.0|Fables Vol. 1: Fables in Exile is among the latest in a long line of postmodern interpretations of fairy tales - Shreck is probably the best-known of these. Here, we find that all of the favorite characters from fairy tales, nursery rhymes and (strangely enough) fantasy fiction have been exiled from their lands in their own magical realm, their money and titles null and forfeit, and are now living as incognito refugees in \\"Fabletown,\\" a section of New York City set aside for them. The community, meeting in secret and keeping themselves hidden from the regular humans (here called \\"Mundanes\\") is ruled by King Cole, who administrates through his able (ad bitterly divorced) major domo, Snow White.    Immediately, I know what you're thinking - it sounds pretty silly. And, on its face, it is. However, once you get into reading this volume, you'll actually be pleasantly surprised by what you'll find. What we end up with is a murder mystery: who killed Rose Red, Snow White's sister? The Big Bad Wolf (here a human who can transform himself - he's named, predictably, \\"Bigsby\\") is the community constable, and he and Snow White begin a rather medieval process of interrogation to get to the bottom of the case. As they move forward, we learn a lot more about the fable universe and the evil \\"Adversary,\\" who drove out all of the enchanted folk from their lands. There are actually some fairly interesting ideas here, and its worth a read.     An additional note: the pencils, provided by Lan Medina, are a revelation. Medina's style - especially in his rendering of the faces of female characters - is exceptional and will remind discerning readers of the great Dave Stevens. This exceptional quality truly elevates the story as it unfolds.
B00005JPS5|4.0|Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) is not a conformist like other bees.  He yearns for something more, and that yearning leads him out of the hive into the world.  After almost getting killed, he is saved by Vanessa (Zellweger), a human that owns a flower shop.  She is surprised that Barry can talk, but then they develop a friendship.  Accompanying her to the grocery store, he discovers that humans are stealing honey from bees and decides to file a lawsuit against the human race<br /><br />\\"Bee Movie\\" is an odd but enjoyable film.  The humor is geared more toward grown ups, but is flashy and eye catching which will appeal to kids.  Also, there is no real moral to the story that is applicable to kids.  Yet, somehow \\"Bee Movie\\" works.  Fans of Jerry Seinfeld will not be disappointed in the humor he brings to the film.  The voice talents do decent jobs bringing their characters to life.  \\"Bee Movie\\" is a nice movie that will provide enjoyment for kids and adults.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is a fun book and educational as well for children.  It's an adventure-filled journey with Mowgli as he makes his way to the village with his panther friend.  Meet King Louie, the hypnotic snake Kaa, and the bear Baloo.   This is the last film to receive the Walt Disney personal touch.  It's a well known classic and every child should start their library with this.
0812550757|3.0|It is worth reading, if one has read the prior book in the series.  However, it is no an excellent book, and has a few flaws.  I find the whole Catholic church angle irritating, and frankly a bit uncomfortable; like someone going on and on about some inside joke or obsession.  It did not work for me at all.      Most of the characters are frankly not all that interesting to me.  The family which the book focuses on, well... They are not all that easy on the nerves.  Their quirkiness also wore on my nerves.    It is a nice story of retribution however, and I did like that quite a lot.  The scenes where Ender and his close \\"friend\\" worked together were very good.  And the idea of a speaker for the dead is an excellent one. So there is a lot in this book that is good.    But all in all, a letdown and the last book of the series I will be reading.
B000UR9TQE|5.0|November 20, 2007, marks the release date of The Song Remains The Same 2-disc DVD package from Warner Home Video, an upgraded and updated version of the the 1976 Led Zeppelin movie centered on Zeppelin concerts at Madison Square Garden on July 27, 28 and 29, 1973. While the movie itself (Disc One) has not been visually re-edited due to legal restrictions, the 2007 re-release offers several never before seen or heard features: a superbly re-mixed and re-mastered soundtrack (including Dolby 5.1) and (Disc Two) four songs missing from the movie that round out the complete Led Zeppelin 1973 Madison Square Garden set: \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" (previously unreleased); \\"Celebration Day\\" (cutting copy - previously unreleased); \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\"; and \\"The Ocean.\\"<br />Disc Two also includes news venue footage and the band's Tampa, Florida, airport arrival for the 1973 concert at Tampa Stadium; a vintage BBC interview with Robert Plant and Peter Grant (Led Zeppelin's manager, the movie's Executive Producer, and an actor in the movie); a vintage interview with Peter Grant regarding the robbery that took place during Led Zeppelin's stay at the Drake Hotel in NYC in 1973 in which almost $200,000 of the group's touring pay went missing from the hotel's safe - a still unsolved mystery; the original theatrical trailer; and a 1976 radio profile spotlight by Cameron Crowe (who also penned the package's liner notes).  Recommending this reissue With it's cheap t-shirt and bits of paper goodies is not a problem for me. If it was a ZEP fart in a bag I'd buy it. That's because I'm a collector!
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I've always been skeptical when it comes to remakes of great films and \\"Hairspray\\" was no exception, but I enjoyed the stage play and this movie (even different from the play) had me bouncing out the door wanting more.      Yes, Travolta was terrible.  Yes, Walken should shoot his agent.  Yes, Amanda Bynes wasn't gawky enough for Penny.  The rest of the cast, however, was outstanding.  Even the end credits are entertaining.    When I went to the theater to watch this flick, I took a 12-year-old girl.  Her mother still thanks me for introducing her to a movie with old-fashioned values and a melodic soundtrack without a warning label.  The only reason I felt a need to see it on the big screen was the fact I own the Corny Collins Top 10 Board and I had to check it out.  I went back again.      If you lived during the early sixties, it will bring back memories of those days of \\"Camelot.\\"  If you didn't, it will give you a little sugar-coated lesson in history.  People of all ages will enjoy it.  No one needs an excuse to see it.  Simply put, it's the best feel-good movie of the year!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is fun, scary, exciting, visually stunning, and very creative. Each actor/actress plays and fits their parts perfectly. I saw this movie twice at the theatre and always enjoy watching it. It's pretty intense and may be a little to scary for young kids. This is one of the movies that is rated PG-13 for a reason. It has the perfect mix of comedy and action, and the story line is great. A definite must see.
1932100660|2.0|This book came highly recommended so I bought it. I was very disappointed in it. It is just a study and you can make a study say or show anything.Very wordy. Not the answer to America's health crisis.I am not saying that the real answer is simple or that it is even out there but it isn't this.
B00005JPS9|4.0|This is a good film -- a little draggy at times but the animation and 3D special effects make it more than worthwhile.  The first half of the film follows the story of Beowulf fairly closely in its interpretation of the story.  Grendel is a monstrous monster.  Hrothgar seems a little weaker than portrayed in the story but the original Beowulf is short on details and plot so clearly something had to be done -- hence the Queen is introduced and Hrothgar is cursed through his sexual intercourse with Grendel's mother. These are all additions to the story along with the water demon mother. The fact that Beowulf had supernatural strength is never mentioned so his epic wrestling match with Grendel comes across as weird and the nudity as gratuitous but this actually follows the story. I will say that this sequence is some of the weakest animation and reminded me of Yoda in his classic duel with Duku(sp).  Grendel is more pathetic and sad in this movie but still remains grotesque and evil.  Even though the original story has been bent and added to it still is a good movie, Beowulf was the braggart supperhero as described in the original but he truly was heroic there. The sea monsters were added clearly for the special effects although Beowulf does brag that he killed them in the original story.  The Vikings and the Mead Hall really brought the story to life and were a good interpretation of how it must have been and certainly follows the description in the original.  In this version Beowulf succumbs to temptation and lives a life based on a lie so his heroism is tarnished and he never redeems it because he only kills the spawn of Grendels mother.  In the original story of course he kills the Dragon who is Grendels mother.  So the movie deviates dramatically from the original story but like 300, it is action packed, exciting, great special effects, and overall a good movie, but students shouldn't rely on this for a book report.  A couple of draggy spots and a couple of animation gaffes but worth the price of admission.  I only gave it 4 stars because of these flaws.tion gaffes but worth the price of admission.

0525950079|5.0|The book is as good or better then any of Ken Follett's books. As a fan of history I enjoy the research that was done to write this book
B00005JKCH|5.0|Was great in the theater, and my sons now enjoy it in our living room!
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Some people would probably think that I'm a biased fan that thinks everything her favorite band does is great and flawless.. but I don't care.  I've been waiting for this album ever since I found out about them back in March.  Most people connect with Apologize immediately and rightly so.  It's an amazingly beautiful song that most people can relate to.. but as I was standing at the House of Blues last night hearing the entire crowd scream with delight as they started to play the song.. I couldn't help but be frustrated at their lack of enthusiasm for all their other songs.      The album (and the band) is definitely something you can't categorize.  Yes, they are a rock band, but after listening to the album in its entirety I've come to realize that they are just a combination of pretty much anything and everything I've heard of musically.  They say this themselves too.. that they've been influenced by \\"everything under the sun.\\"  So if you're thinking that the album is going to be all like the remix of Apologize.. get ready for disappointment.  That's not them.. it's them but with someone else's interpretation of it.  Be open minded to this ground breaking band and give it a chance.    My absolute favorites:  1.  Say (All I Need)   This song is breathtaking.  Definitely a continuation of Apologize in relation to its beat driven core.  All the instruments.. from the drums exploding the in background, the keyboard with the unique sound it makes, the AMAZING guitars, and the lyrics that always reach inside the soul.. it comes together in this song so, SO beautifully.  I wish this would be their second single.    2.  Mercy   A song of hope and something that everyone can relate to.    3.Stop and Stare   Their second single off the album. I fell in love with it as soon as I heard it and is also a favorite to many.    4. Apologize  The most poetic and deeply moving lyrics I've ever heard. I can't get enough of the cello and drums. Sheer GENIOUS.    6. All Fall Down  Another song with the main theme being hope.  Cello is a main feature and is simply amazing. The cello (and the cellist, Brent) is one of the main reasons I love this band.    8. Prodigal  Probably my most favorite song. It speaks to my heart and the things I keep hidden in it.    10. All We Are  I think this is the second most popular song. I absolutely love the chorus.. it makes you want to sing at the top of your lungs.    12. Come Home  About a friend of Ryan's who got sent to Iraq soon after getting engaged. The song is beautiful despite the sad content.    I highly recommend seeing them live.  They keep getting better and better as they play more and more shows.
B000YAF4OS|3.0|Frank Darabont's drastically changed adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Mist features interesting creatures, recycled characters and a sacrifice of satisfaction for unpredictability. The film is more than just a mindless monster movie, although the creatures are on display within the first half hour. Delving into social structures, morality, and a Lord of the Flies coup of religion, The Mist attempts to make the audience think, and yet much of the all-too-familiar story feels forced and unsatisfactory for those whose main goal is simply to be entertained.<br /><br />After a vicious storm, David (Thomas Jane) and his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) head into town for supplies, but find themselves trapped in a supermarket as a thick fog engulfs the land. When the mist produces several hellish monstrosities and people begin to die, the survivors split apart into multiple factions to determine the wisest way to escape their horrifying predicament.<br /><br />The Mist draws many parallels (or perhaps steals) from other films including The Poseidon Adventure, in which a group of survivors must debate on whether to seek escape or merely wait for rescue. Additionally, Lord of the flies immediately comes to mind, since the religious fanatic attempts to create a monarchy amongst the group, and then decides that human sacrifices are necessary to keep the creatures at bay. Hints of the reasoning and thought processes from characters in Rosemary's Baby also surface, especially when David contemplates acting on decisions he would presumably never make.<br /><br />Initially evoking concern about poisonous gas or some other understandable predicament, The Mist gives away its secret right off the bat. We are immediately subjected to the horrors of a tentacled beast and are then left to wonder why the monstrous insect-like creatures don't simply barge through the flimsy windows of the grocery store. It's a great setting for chaos, and with fast zooms and handheld movements, such calamity is quite well depicted. But ultimately the film is about faith, and the monsters are just a layer of horror placed over the morality tale to convince audiences that it is indeed a monster movie. Marcia Gay Harden's character has too much faith - to the point that she insanely proclaims herself as the chosen one from God, and David, on the opposite side of the spectrum, has too little faith - in the end we are made aware of that insufficient balance that belies tragedy for all involved.<br /><br />While the most evil beings in the Mist may not be the aliens, great care is taken to present several uniquely terrifying monsters, most borrowing features from common phobia beasts. The flying insects and larger pterodactyls all sport top notch digital effects and their interaction with the environment cements their believable existence. Spiderlike creatures provide more gore than realism but the CG never falters. The largest beasts receive the smallest screentime and are truly awesome, though they would feel right at home in Spielberg's War of the Worlds. Perhaps the weakest monstrosity visually is also the one shown first, a truly massive squidlike abomination. Adding to the inventive array of mysterious lifeforms populating the mist are their respective methods of attack, from stinging and biting to eating away from within. Voracious tentacles and acid web-spewing mark a few of the creative highlights that decidedly heighten the already violent display of carnage.<br /><br />Despite the sacrifice of closure for unpredictability in its resolution, Darabont's fourth adaptation of a Stephen King story manages to astonish and entertain as a horror film, but doesn't fare nearly as well in its examination of the degradation of humanity under adverse situations. It's a shame the film focused more on the latter, and while originality has its virtues, denying the audience any glimmer of hope is just as mystifying as the origins of the nightmarish creatures in the fog.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins
B000ROALCG|5.0|I highly recommend this album.  Marc Anthony is an amazing singer and his interpretation of Hector Lavoe songs is really fabulous!
630469654X|5.0|Great escapist movie.  Also, has something to do with the Friesien being my favorite breed.  Watch it again and again.  Just have to ignore the social propaganda (Catholic church bad, Jewish main character good).
0143038419|5.0|This book has received mostly grand reviews, as it should.  I have sent or recommended this book to eleven friends so far and all have been delighted.  I lived a year in Bali, Indonesia and found Gilbert's description of that neck of the woods very much on target.      A journey toward personal freedom and enlightenment is necessarily esoteric and reviews that complain about such self \\"centeredness\\" are missing the point.  Resentful reviews of this well written work of art reveal only the deficiencies of the reviewer.    I recommend and will continue to recommend this piece of literature as a great study of the human journey.
B00006879E|5.0|If you're a fan of Maroon 5, you will LOVE this CD!!   Highly recommended!!
B000002LIX|5.0|With international fame and over 100 reviews I felt that there was really noting more that needed to be said about this magnificent masterpiece but a recent conversation lead me to post the following theory - it was really Jane's Addiction that began the early 90s music revolution, NOT Kurt Cobain and Nirvana!!<br /><br />The reason I say this is simple - it was the shocking appearance of this, formerly \\"underground\\", band's 3rd album at the top of the Billboard charts that sent record companies everywhere scrambling to sign their own \\"independent\\", \\"underground\\" band!! And, as a DIRECT result, Geffen signed, and more importantly promoted, Nirvana while Sony/Epic grabbed up Pearl Jam, Atlantic signed the Stone Temple Pilots and A&M signed Soundgarden! And those are just the best known examples!!<br /><br />I also feel that the original Lollapalozza tour in the summer of '91 primed audiences all over America for all these various styles of music, which also aided the assimilation and acceptance of \\"Alternative\\" music into the mainstream.<br /><br />But, all that aside, this is simply one of THE greatest albums EVER recorded and, as good as Nothing Shocking is, it was merely a promise of things to come! For all the hype surrounding the so-called \\"Alternative\\" music scene - these guys were the REAL DEAL!! There's not a bad song on the album though \\"3 Days\\" is clearly the centerpiece and high point of the album and \\"Then She Did...\\" is just as clearly a part 2, meant to be heard immediately after 3 Days, not separately! And what to make of \\"Of Course\\"...well that's the alternative part!<br /><br />An all around great band, containing the man I personally feel was the best guitarist to come out of the late 80s/early 90s, Dave Navarro! Also one of the best, most entertaining live bands I have seen in over 30 years of attending concerts and, although it took 12 years for them to release another album of all new material, it was definitely worth the wait and Strays proved that they had lost ABSOLUTELY NOTHING during the intervening years. I did find the 97' tour with the Chili Peppers Flea on bass quite interesting and wonder what the possibilities of that team up could produce in the long run!!<br /><br />Bottom line.........an absolute MUST-have addition to any music collection and here's hoping they are FAR from done with the Jane's Addiction story!!HING during the intervening years.

B000001Y2U|5.0|Dont listen to the people who say he is a satanist. Dont listen to the christians who say repent now. this album is a true masterpice. go buy a copy now and then buy another! support a great artist for once...
B0000009TT|5.0|If you were from the planet Mars and wanted to know who Zappa was, and what he was about, I would tell you to start right here! Back \\"in the day\\" I would always have difficulity in introducing someone to Frank's work mainly due to how much is actually out there. Short of making them a mix-tape (and even that would depend on what I knew of their taste in music) I would usually recommend 5 or 6 albums to start with. But, even then, I would inevitability leave something out!<br /><br />With the release of this long awaited collection, the Zappa family has almost done my work for me! Originally released as 4 albums; \\"Live in NY\\", \\"Sleep Dirt\\", \\"Studio Tan\\" \\"Orchestral Favorites\\", (and a few tracks off \\"Sheik Yerbouti\\") this triple CD box has a little bit of everything. Biting satire (Titties and Beer, Greggery Peccary), Blues rock (Illinois Enema Bandit, which contains one of Frank's better guitar solos), Orchestra (Naval Aviation in Art), hard rock (Tryin to Grow a Chin, Broken Hearts) and blistering jazz/rock that would stand against the best of Beck, McLaughlin, Di Meola, et. al. (Filthy Habits, RDNZL and the brilliant Ocean is the Ultimate Solution, though the latter, at 8 minutes, is almost cut in half compared to the original 13 minute version on Sleep Dirt!?!). It also contains many of the between song spoken interludes that later ended up on Sheik Yerbouti and Shut Up and Play Yer Guitar.<br /><br />Barring a few omissions (I'd still buy \\"Sheik Yerbouti\\" on it's own for Flakes, Jones Crusher and `Yo Mama), this is the perfect example of the wide variety inherent in Frank's music, the brilliance of his talent and backing bands, should please any fan of Rock and/or Jazz music, is the perfect place to start and is a TRUE 5-star release!!
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I was at the Lake Tahoe show just two weeks before this DVD was filmed and I must say BEYONCE is one of the Greatest entertainers AND she IS hands down the most BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in the entire world. The Lake Tahoe show was GREAT and usually I can't swallow LIVE DVD's in just ONE sitting, but THIS ONE...I could, in fact THIS IS the perfect souviner if you went to one of her shows this past summer. Whatever I did miss when I saw her live due to TALL people in the way obstructing my view, I was finally able to see it on this. I give this 5 stars, the energy, the performance is GREAT and I recommend this to ALL, the ONLY thing that would have made it better was if Kelly and Michelle would have been out there for the Destiny's Child medley, rather than just at the end of SURVIVOR, I STILL hope that they RE-UNITE one day in the future. My favorite Highlights of the DVD for me is when she does BEAUTIFUL LIAR...which I personally thought was GREAT (But NOT long enough)and the closing number \\"IRREPLACEABLE\\" with the crowd singing the entire first verse, I got a case of goosebumps when we did that in Tahoe, it was the same feeling watching it happen on DVD...GET THIS!!!! It's GREAT!!!!
B0000062GE|4.0|While I like all of Stabbing Westward's work this 3rd release is probably my favorite, followed by their debut, Ungod, and then Whither, Blister, Burn and Peel. I also have to admit that I was greatly let down by their 4th and final release, which hardly seemed to be the same band. And, for all of the hype several years ago, I always felt that Evanescence was nothing more than Stabbing Westward with a Female singer. This year in Atlanta was also the best of the 3 times I caught them live, and took 2 friends who had never heard of them with me!<br /><br />I like almost every track on the disc but my single favorite is probably \\"The Thing I Hate\\" (before various games darn near made me sick of it!!) and I also feel that those final 3; \\"Thing I Hate\\", \\"On Your Way Down\\" and \\"Waking Up Beside You\\" should ALWAYS be heard together. Other good tracks are \\"Haunting Me\\" and what was, by far, their biggest hit - \\"Save Yourself\\".<br /><br />After the success of that track, and this CD as a whole, I thought Stabbing were on their way to greater things but, unfortunately, it was 3 long years until (what turned out to be) their 4th and last release and now all we have are these memories. Oh well, reunions seem to be happening all the time these days, though usually among older bands, so I can always hope!

B00005JNEI|4.0|I don't know why I didn't go see this film when it first came out.  Probably a combo of being tired of politics and thinking it could not tell me much more then I already knew at the time.<br /><br />For the most part it's a good film.  Moore does a great job in that it's a great vehicle for questions, discussion and debate.<br /><br />I am only knocking it a point for some of the \\"antics\\" Moore did for the film.  I didn't care of the bit with the ice cream truck where he drove around reading the patriot act since congress didn't read it.  The ever<br />present \\"ambush\\" of congressmen is a rather tired bit and overused.  I think it took away from a well crafted film.  I liked the cabinet people going through makeup, the bit where Ashcroft was singing and the<br />Bushisms.  One thing that was really well done was the seven minutes where Bush sat there doing nothing or reading to the children.  I remember it when it happened and it showed the difference between a leader and this man.  A leader acts.<br /><br />Other parts of the film where sad and gave me an impression of exploitation.  Such as the woman talking of the loss of her son and later appears at a protest upset and can only mention loosing her son.  Even though there are hints of exploitation, Moore didn't go full into exploiting the collapse of the twin towers.  There is only a couple after shots and a blacked out image with sound tracks.  Very effective I found as even though I had seen it; I still listened.<br /><br />One thing I found interesting was his section involving homeland security and the Oregon coast.  One man for a large territory.  There was even an extra about old volunteers trying to patrol South Florida.  Very pertinent info when thinking of the current reports of the lack of security on our borders.<br /><br />Probably one of the most provocative things was his explanations of molding the people by instilling fear.  The use of the terror alerts and reports of eminent attacks.  I think it did mold people for the war.<br /><br />The addons are interesting.  I found the axis of evil comedy troop interesting and yet alarming how people are treated.  There were interviews of Bush and Rice which do offer support to the claims of cover up.  The PDBs and the \\"Hairsplitting\\" of definitions.  Politics I guess.<br /><br />Overall; I can put of with the bit's that were pandering and I would recommend the film as it's a good provocative piece that will cause discussion and debate..

B000008JI1|5.0|This album was a very controversial one when it came out in the nineties, because the band changed style with Native Tongue, passing from a very cheesy, bubble gum, party type of hair metal to true, serious music. Serious that by no means means boring, but on the contrary \\"music with serious value\\", with serious quality. It was controversial even because it came out in a difficult decade for the music, the one that saw the end for a lot of hair metal bands and the beginning of the grunge era. So I guess that a lot of people who loved hair metal took a position against this album because they tought that Poison, the epitome of hair metal sold themselves to jump on the grunge winner wagon. So it is an album that was born in a very hard time. maybe it was not the right choice for the band I don't know, but at the time probably it was the only thing they could do with CC that was almost a Junkie unable to play anymore and grunge rapidly overlapping their original style. So what could they do? Probably one of the wisest thing to do could be to invest in the quality of their music, on the true value of music trying to maintain their identity, but injecting in their formula a sort of hyper fuel. And they did. It was the only serious thing they could do to survive. Try to imagine if they chose to release another album like \\"Open up and say ah!\\"... probably the whole world would have judged them CLOWNS in those years. So they took one of the guitar youngest and brightest stars, one with a killer look, the ability to write killer songs, incredible guitar chops and with a bluesy style that could take them to new places, to new more serious, more value music. A very good idea it was. And which kind of album cam out from this chance they took? A very strong album, made entirely by Richie Kotzen's songs at the point that now that we have a lot of Kotzen songs albums, now we know that Native Toungue came out entirely by his pen. A very strong blues infected album with killer songs and more that few true ANTHEMS that sold very well and had great hairplay and videoplay if I remember well by the way (Stand, Until you suffer some). And the album stood the test of time, a lot better than any album of their no matter what the die hard fans of the band may say. It is a killer album that trascended the genre boundaries and took the guys in a land they never were legitimate to enter, the true value music. I love all the albums from the band even the cheesiest ones, but Native tongue stays way way above the others in terms of songwriting qualities, musical values, attitude, musical chops, consistency. By the way in my opinion this is even one of the best album from Richie Kotzen ever in my opinion, a lot better than his albums from Mr Big era and a lot better than some of his solo albums (very good albums by the way). This one and Mother Heads (the best form Richie in my rating) stand on the same very high quality level. I think a lot of people who hate hair metal could love this album and a lot of people who love it could love it too. But this album is not a bi**h. It has value, personality and integrity. Too bad the guys decided to fire Richie for a stupid story. The band could do very good things if they continued to be together. The next guitarist the band decided to try (the fabolous Blues Saraceno) for different reasons didn't success in taking a comparable contribution to the band. Native toungue is a true treasure for me.and more that few true ANTHEMS that sold very well and had great hairplay and videoplay if I remember well by the way (Stand, Until you suffer some).

B000V1MMLI|5.0|Within its simplicity and original aesthetics this is what an album SHOULD BE LIKE. Now days getting mp3 songs is so easy that it has become hard for artist to sell their albums and I say this as an artist myself. Now, as a listener I have to admit that albums like this one is what makes me want to buy them. The art work on this album is exquisite and meaningful, the lyrics are more focused on Serj's mind rather than political issues, yet it lets you visualize different aspects while keeping you interested and entertained; all this concept is well kept throughout the entire 12 tracks of Disk 1, Disk 2 is a bonus feature. The music in this album is well organized. It contains a solid base sound and rhythmics resembling somewhat to system of a down however not the same. In my opinion it has a more mature and refined sound and its simplicity makes it even more of an amazing album. This is somewhat irrelevant to the album but I'd like to mention the fact that the marketing strategy of this album was properlly done and this might not be important to some people but it actually reflects the goals of the artist and his label. totally worth buying the limited edition, plus it gives you access the premium website.<br /><br />Talented Artist. Great Music. Excellent Lyrics. Amazing ArtWork.

B000002LIR|3.0|I have owned this since it first came out in 1990.  Other reviews cite the great sound, but to my ears, it has always sounded extremely hissy for a high-end boxed set, and I notice the price is now about half of what it was in 1990.  Has this been remastered?  If it has, it might now be worth replacing my old copy.  If it hasn't, what's wrong with all your ears???  For this reason, I can give it no more than three stars.
B000PC8AFU|1.0|save you cash, this is just another gimmic to make bucks off what belonged on the shelf. I'm sure there is something in the archives that could better this, but this is shameful to release...
B00006I53S|5.0|I've had this lens about a week, to bolster my fledgling wedding arsenal.  People may poo-poo this, but I say that at $409, the quality this thing puts out is surprising.  Stop down from wide open, and it is tack sharp, beautiful color and detail, with nice bokeh when zoomed.  Wide open is ever so slightly soft, but nothing that sharpening in P/S or GIMP can't fix. The IS works as advertised, though not too well for moving subjects like kids.  Focus in low light is terrific, as long as you have a contrasty object (like an eye) to focus on - that's common to all lenses.  Those who don't like the lens are either receiving a bad copy, or are too busy with their eyes one inch from a shot for three hours, trying to pick out imperfections.  If money is an issue, get this lens, and then sell and buy an L lens when you profit...which you will, using this lens.  Enjoy.

B000UR9TQO|5.0|I will never understand the belittling of these performances. This was Zep at their peak. Yes, Plant had lost a bit of his primal howl (but not at the end of 'Whole Lotta Love', that is just ferocious...), and that late-60s energy had dimished a touch, sure (those BBC shows are out of control, just astonishing). And yea, Bonham got better and better, so that by the time Plant and Page were spent in the late-70s, he was on a whole different planet (so sad). Sloppiness? If anyone has the secret non-sloppy Zep recordings, I'd love to hear them. I LOVE their mess, that's one of the many things that makes them so special. They jumped and fell and jumped again. Anyway, here is when they were all alive and happy, mature and graceful but not too burnt yet, just on top of the world. There are too many moments to count, but the interplay between JPJ and Bonham in the uptempo theremin bit in 'Whole Lotta Love', and just the band energy they all have for that whole tune, that is the zenith of Zeppelin.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Great album, was quite different when it was released, and still sounds great.  If you're going to buy one Pumpkins CD, make it this one.  It's the most \\"Even\\" of the early stuff, I think.
B000002JS6|5.0|i am writing a reveiw for ac dcs back in black 27 years after it was released and im writing it with the same awe and admiration as when i first heard it. it really is hard to beleive it but some music is just this classic. on this album you have 4 of the best songs ac dc have ever wrote hells bells. back in black. you shook me all night long. and rock n roll aint noize polution. but the album as a whole is amazing. have a drink on me has a surging groove and is a great party song. shoot to thrill is good enough to be a rock anthem it has classic riff work and one of angus youngs best solos. shake a leg is damm good it has that surging sound too it and theres a lot of bass and drums to keep you occupied it has a very distinctive and memborable sound and maybe angus youngs best guitar solo peformance ever! let me put my love into you is a very romantic but still heavy rock classic it has shades of kiss in the singing department but dont worry if you dont like kiss its the only song on the album where they even resemble kiss. all in all back in black is a classic album. i cant say phil rudd and malcom young are the best rythym team. nor can i say brian johnson is the best singer. nor can i even say angus young is a great guitar player though he is a very very good one. but together they all create an essential sound and this is them at the top of their game. if you like have an intrest or wanna be apart of popular 70s rock you cant start with a getter album than back in black. i was all ready to give jimi hendrix are you experinced the title of best rock album ever but hnow i think back in black is seriously threatning that title. the bottom line is this whether you like ac dc or not youd be a fool to not adleast give back in black a try.

Fot those of \\"OUR\\" generation, there is no finer copy of all our favorite Zep songs on CD or vinyl. For the Kiddies out there, just listen to \\"Ramble On\\" and you too will be saying with your parents and grandparents (!)  \\"Hey, this stuff is GREAT!  What have I been missing all these years!\\"<br /><br />For fans of Megadeth, Def Leppard, Cannibal Corpse and Subterranian Fecal Root, time to ground yourself and hear the band that started it all!<br /><br />GET THE LED OUT!
B00005UKKF|5.0|I am a huge fan of high production tours, and Britney Spears delivers!  This is a filmed version of her widely successful \\"Dream Within A Dream\\" Tour to promote '...Baby One More Time', 'Oops!...I Did It Again', and 'Britney'.  Alot of people claim that Britney ripped off other artists to create this tour, I highly disagree.  Britney took parts of her favortie artists' tours and mixed it all together to make her own.  This tour is not a ripoff of anyone, but a tribute at certain points while being strongly Britney's own show.    I purchased this expecting it to be cool, but not AMAZING! I never thought that anyone could equal any of Madonna's concerts, but in terms of entertainment and fun, I think Britney surpassed Madonna's tours.    You won't be dissapointed if you buy this.
B000YENUI6|5.0|I can't wait for this to come out on DVD. I saw it at the theater and so far it's the best movie of the year.

B00007FOMP|5.0|From the first time i purchased this music in record form when it was originally released, i have loved it...  The message and the music have remained true to the times and successfully traveled into the 21st century. Now for the bad news. Why must CD editors of old recordings find it necessary to add out-takes... they are out-takes... or shall we say--take it out. The artists, editors, and producers knew what they were doing, and worked within time constants to make masterpieces. On this project, they have added, what appears to be \\"ideas\\" and musical concepts for many of the songs. Very interesting if those cuts were on a separate disc--jarring when it follows what is suppose to be the last cut. Editors: everything you find in a dusty vault is not gold, And... just because there is space on the CD, one does not have to fill it.  Typically, a full heady description of what went on is added into the liner notes. More often than not, these new bright ideas insights appear to be inflected on artists that are now among the dead and can't complain.  On concept albums, which is What's Going On is, it is simply bad judgment and taste.  So, to everyone that purchases this CD, and has never heard the music before, please make sure you can stop you player before the bad old stuff appears. Otherwise, you will not have a clue as to what's going on with this music.

Yet, as the book illustrates, with example after example, our subconscious plays an extremely important role in our lives.  For those who want facts, this book has facts.  For those who are easily bored with this sort of thing, don't worry, you will be thoroughly entertained.  The blend is delicious.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin makes history come alive with her excellent writing.  Seldom does one come across a book of history that is so exciting to read that one cannot put it down.  I found this so with this book.  I knew a lot about Lincoln but little about Seward, Chase and Bates.  She created an avid interest in all four men in reading this book.  I think it is one of the very best I have read.
B00005B1W5|5.0|Almost as full of life as the music is on this DVD, the included bonus of the documentary \\"No Borders\\" is fabulous.  If you love India, China or the making of a documentary this bonus is for you.  Full of great shots of the people, scenery and color of India, this charts the set up of the concert as well as introduces Yanni's homeland and parents.  A great narrative addition worth the price in it's own right.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|The original release had some great highs and great lows. Tracks like No Quarter, Dazed and Confused, and Moby Dick have a \\"you had to be there\\" kind of appeal to them. The shorter tracks were much more listenable and to this day I prefer these live versions of Stairway to Heaven and Whole Lotta Love. The new tracks are fantastic. Finally, the Celebration Day/Black Dog tandem that works so well in the film is preserved on CD. The sound is, of course, greatly improved. Without the extra tracks the CD is three stars. I give it four stars here because of the aforementioned tracks.<br /><br />When I saw LZ perform in '77, No Quarter and Page's theramin solo included laser lights that enhanced the performance and at least gave you something to look at while Jonesy noodled away on the organ and Pagey fooled around with the theremin. Without those visuals, just listening to them isn't the same.
0439882826|5.0|Bought this book for my nephews (ages 5 - 8) and they LOVE it.  The pop-up, lighted (battery powered) lightsaber has cemented my status as favorite uncle.  If your popularity among the under-10 crowd is waning, buy this book.
B000W04S6U|5.0|This is by far the best Halo score ever!    I woke up at the sound of the doorbell, my package having just arrived.  What a treat to wake up to! It was great to listen to first thing in the morning.  The orchestral pieces are amazing, particularly the new arrangements of the classics.  Follow the music along to the imagery in your mind once you've played this game.  Superb!      I really don't care for the hidden track, and I dare say it may be the only blemish on the set, but marketing wise I guess it served it's purpose.    This 2 CD set is a must for any Halo fan.  I couldn't wait to receive it, and I'm glad to say it does not disappoint.
B000W04S6U|5.0|If you thought the previous Halo soundtracks were home runs, Marty O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori hit this one out of the known galaxy (or three radii from the galactic core..).<br /><br />The switch from MIDI instruments to a full, live orchestra has made an already outstanding musical journey completely amazing. Many familiar themes make a return, but they sound fuller and more thematic this time around.<br /><br />The track layout plays in the same order you would experience the music in the game, which I thought was a nice touch compared to Halo 2, v.1. My personal stand-out track is #12 on CD 1, \\"Follow Our Brothers\\", the music takes me to the exact memory of that part in the game. Truly outstanding.<br /><br />I cannot rate this high enough, I could not have desired more from this soundtrack!
B000XPU5NY|4.0|As a fan of Genesis, I was eager to hear the first new album with Phil Collins in the lead in over a decade.  I thuroughly enjoyed this live album.  Even though it was recorded over multiple dates to get the best performance out of each song, it sounds like it was a continuous recording.  Kudos to the engineering crew.<br /><br />I liked the fact that they played different songs on the record.  Except for Abacab, there is at least 1 song from every record starting with Selling England By The Pound (1973).  So there is more of a \\"timeline\\" feel to this collection.<br /><br />My only complain, I suppose, is Father Time.  A lot of their songs were played on a different key and at a slightly slower tempo than in years past, partly due to Phil Collins' aged vocal cords.  But musically, they haven't missed a beat.<br /><br />So for any true Genesis fan, especially for those who grew up with Phil singing lead, I would say that this is a must.
0060594896|5.0|Canfield and Switzer have captured and compiled the ultimate quotes, comics, and titles for each of it's 64 chapters. You can turn to any page, at any time, and get all the knowledge you need to get you through the day. This is a \\"yellow highliter\\" book for sure ( don't use any green, blue or pink ones, you don't want to blot out a single word.) My cover is tattered and pages dog eared, and I did not want to stop reading it. If I'd had this book 5 years ago, I'd be a millionaire by now, not only monetarily, but rich in ideas, and ripe in ideals and goals!
B00007LTIC|5.0|Going for the One has always been my favorite Yes album since it came out in 1977. I'm not fond of the title track but the other music on this album is truly sublime, including the beautiful \\"Wonderous Stories\\", the passionate \\"Turn of the Century\\" and what Jon Anderson himself regards as Yes's masterpiece, the magnificent \\"Awaken.\\" \\"Parallels\\" is a great song too. This album proves once and for all that truly great music can be made in a rock format.
B00000255F|5.0|This is probably my most favorite of All Things Bruce.  I remember clearly when the album first came out.  I loved it.  I still love it.  I first saw Bruce on stage in Tampa when he was just a scrawny little fellow with a lot of hair jammed under a little knit cap.  He and big old Clarence blew me away.  Absolutely nothing has changed since then.  They have a wonderful sound and Bad Scooter has plenty of true things to say.  Bruce may have packed on a few muscles since then and I've packed on a few pounds, but Baby We Were Born To Run!!!!
B000RW3VD4|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. I think this is the only movie which I have seen multiple times . MD is perfect in his role.
B000069KGM|5.0|We were dating when this album came out and every bar we went into was playing it on their jukebox (yes, jukebox) or in a more sophisticated bar, on their \\"sound system\\".  All the songs bring back so many memories.  Fast forward to the next year when we did get married and frequented a place called Mulligan's in the Allentown section of Buffalo, NY - more wonderful memories of this playing in the background while we drank with hustlers, hookers, \\"little people\\" and whatnot.  In love, newly married, no longer living at home and out until 3 a.m. -- those were the days.  This CD, which replaces our old vinyl record (yes, a record) just floods me with a reminder how much fun we had back then.  We're still married but sadly our days of being out at 3 a.m. drunk and eating hot ears of buttered corn on the cob at Jimmy Oates Goodfellows Club next to Mulligan's are well over, but this music, and the unique stlye of it, will live on forever.
0440238609|5.0|I'm sure that plenty of people have already reviewed this series, so I'll keep it simple.  It's a great fantasy read for all ages and I would definitely recommend checking it out if you have the chance.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|I´m a Dream Theater fan since 2000, and the first thing I want to say is that Systematic Chaos is not one of my favorite albums. Contains virtuous and exceptional instrumental passages, and also tremendous climatic moments, (In The Presence Of Enemies Pt.1, the JEWEL of the álbum), Forsaken is a strong and powerful ballad, and Repentance is amazing and hypnotic, but at other tracks, the arrangements sound predictable and little surprising. It´s a horrendous nightmare that the band sounds like Metallica or Panthera, when Petrucci, Portnoy, Myung, Rudess and LaBrie are musicians of excellent quality and level. With all this, in my opinion, the result is simply good. I´m sure (and they have shown), which can make an album much better than this, and I hope that what is coming.   My favorites are Images and Words, Scenes From A Memory and Octavarium.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|i loved this movie! when it first came out i saw it three times. the move stars Channing Tatum and Jenn Dewan. Channing plays Tyler Gage who is a streetwise kid who gets in trouble and takes the blame for his friends when they get caught trashing a school for the Performing Arts. he has to do community service at the school where he meets a beautiful girl Nora played by Jenna Dewan. Nora is in her last year at the school and she has been trained in classical dance and she needs a partner when hers hurts himself. tyler and nora are different in alot of ways. tyler hip hop dance and from the wrong side of the track and Nora classical dance and privlaged. when they first meet they cant stand each other. this is a must see.
0316067598|2.0|I went into Lone Survivor expecting to totally focus on Operation Redwing, similar to Roberts Ridge, and in that regard I was disappointed. Totally full of jingoistic dogma which I found offensive as well as unprofessional, really, really distracts from any story line.  Many times I found myself thinking that the level of prejudice evident in the author's attitude has little place in a counterinsurgent - the basic precept being \\"Win the Population\\", I can certainly understand someone copping an attitude though which I think highlights one of the reasons we may be in over our heads in the Middle East.  This set the tone for me throughout.     As with the other reviews one will find on this book I do not wish to denigrate Petty Officer Luttrell and the lost souls of Seal Team 10 - these guys put up a helluva fight and I have the utmost respect for them -truly highlights the superior training, however, having said that the book boils down to maybe seventy pages - from the insertion to full contact compromised, to the loss of the Team, the rest of the book is wasted pulp - blather!!.  I would think the fault here lies with the editor.            Those seventy pages left me filled with questions relating to the Team's SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) such as why a four man team was used when the intel was telling them there were up to a couple hundred hostiles in the area.  The six man team has repeatedly been shown to be more effective - two more guns may have made the difference, especially if a SAW and grenade launcher had been included (google Squad Automatic Weapon & M 203 grenade launcher), a few white phosphorous rounds might have bought some breathing room.                  Marcus describes the reconnaissance point as a promontory which is the last place where someone hiding wants to be, they were on a ridge with at least one high speed trail, there was at least one hut in the area, the way it is written when they turned the goatherds loose they nonchalantly followed them up the mountain to another hide in full view of any observer. This whole section made me think fubar.  SOP dictates the Team leader to do a fly over rather than just a photo and map study - this may have been out of the question for one reason or another, regardless there was no mention of an E&E plan (escape and evasion) and why did comms fail?  Blah blah  blah - one thing after another that may or may not have been done properly but the book definitely reads like it wasn't.  Why is there no mention of Mako-30 and Neil Roberts? these are the things that jumped out at me during the read. The skeptic in me wonders if the media is scrambling for another Jessica Lynch story coming into an election year.                  One thing that the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have in common is the difficulty in remaining undetected during reconnaissance missions (Bravo Two Zero for instance 1st gulf), patrol technique has got to be highly modified, one would think this may have been addressed in detail or at least hypothetically somewhere in the book, maybe this is possibly classified - one would do well to study the movements of the snow leopard native to the mountains of Afghanistan, camouflage is critical - not a mention? Patterns exist for the alpine environment -google roggenwolf.             I don't know, the way the book reads is smelly to me -not killing the goatherds was the proper choice - it appears that SOP was not adhered to.      We have many experiences to learn from going back well over two millenia -Soviet in particular but the British experience in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as well - both were losers, if we do not seriously get on top on the Taliban insurgency soon we may also end up as a loser - they and we do not understand or appreciate the tribal mentality we are up against - we are the bull in the china shop, I firmly believe that without thoroughly studying and appreciating what caused these past failures, call them lessons learned, our mission is handicapped.  Please read the Seven Pillars of Wisdom and Gertrude Bell -Queen of the Desert, and even Xenophon's Anabasis - also many accounts from climbing expeditions to this area have good insight into the Pashtun mentality.

B000007U6V|5.0|[[ASIN:B000007U6V Autobahn]]  I had an original (8track) back in 1975,'wore it out,just searched for this and could not resist the purchase. SO good to hear it again. Excellent music before the days of computers and MiDI interfaces. My boys loved listening to it while we traveled. Buy it. you'll love it!
B0001XAS1W|5.0|What an outstanding record. Originally purchased this record in 77. Played it over and over. Bought a cassette of it. Played it until it wouldn't play anymore. Now I can enjoy it all over again. Crank up the volume on Year of the Cat.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I honestly do not feel the need to review this product.  As anyone who truly wishes to see the full feature as it was intended to be viewed knows, seeing the standard theatrical version is not at all rewarding in comparison with the extended edition.  I wasn't so concerned with the extra features, as quite often, for myself, they tend to take away from the film in some light.  I tend to enjoy the commentary, but beyond that I prefer not to know the technicalities of how it was filmed.  Thus I have not previewed all the additional footage on the other 2 discs included in this 4 disc set.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I just can't say enough about this movie!  All I can say is, watch it, you won't be sorry.  Of course, that's just my opinion.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|I much prefer the fullscreen to the widescreen edition for non-HD watching.  I originally bought the combo HD/regular edition of this DVD but discovered that \\"regular\\" meant \\"widescreen,\\" so I exchanged it for this one and am much happier.  The movie itself is really great - so nice to see a story about an unconflicted hero who makes a choice and sticks to his principles without whingeing and complaining about it the whole time, like some other comic book superheros we know and love.  It's not Shakespeare, nor is it a particularly accurate history lesson, but it's good fun with awesome special effects (esp. those rippling cgi-enhanced abs!).
079073804X|5.0|In my opinion, this movie was way ahead of its time.  Personally, I don't think they could've done any better with this particular movie.  If you've never seen this movie before, I highly recommend buying it and watching it right now!  A word of advice, to get the biggest impact while watching this movie, watch it at night with the lights off, and if you have a home entertainment system, crank that baby up!  If you're a wimp though, this is not recommended!
0805079831|5.0|Our government is out of control but we can read books like this and then vow to band together and change things.  One person in every household needs to turn off their TV and curl up with this book.  There is power in having this information.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Highly recommend!  This movie has so many good parts, I don't know where to start.  Definitely worth watching!
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I am a huge Beyonce fan so I may be a little biased, but she really did her thing on this tour. I love how she has an all female band and women of all shapes and sizes dancing with and behind her and singing as well. She takes our old favorites and spices them up with mixes of current songs and dances. (My favorites would have to be the \\"Crank That\\" Soldier Mix...Beyonce does what she does best...and the other would have to be the new version of Baby Boy with the extended reggae mix). She finally performed Flaws and All and I love how the camera is on her and she connects with her fans. The entire set, theme, and flow of the show was great. I am still questioning some of her choice in set outfits, (like the sequins on the swimsuit...?) But overall it was an incredible experience, and I wish I was there to witness her in action-her stage presence and the way she interacts with her fans is incredible. There is no other performer like her right now who can sing, dance, and truly give you your money's worth of an entertaining show.     The flip side...is Kelly and Michelle came out for a chorus of Survivor-which was hilarious to me because she had just finished an ENTIRE set of Destiny's Child songs by herself! Just watching Bee perform only reflects the superstar that she is and she is deserving of that title-I think Kelly and Michelle are nice, but they are mediocre they are not on Bee's level and its not because her dad put her in the spotlight SHE works her butt off and is smart and when you watch this DVD of her concert you will agree. She goes out on the stage and leaves her blood, sweet, and tears with the audience and you can fill that passion...that always makes for an incredible artist. This DVD is worth the money whether you are a Beyonce fan or not.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I went to the Beyonce Experience on September 1 and it was amazing. This DVD is the best. This is the best concert I've been to. Beyonce hits every dance move every note she's amazing. She knows how to put on a show. This is a must have.    My Highlight Performances  Crazy In Love   Greenlight  Flaws in All  Destiny's Child Medley  Get Me Bodied  Ring THe Alarm
B000W1V5VU|3.0|Number three in the (modern) Ocean series brings us to once again, yes, Vegas, which involves, yes, another robbery/scam, with, yes, a great ensemble cast.  (though it would have been nice if one of the women had agreed to sign on).  Despite the efforts to make the heist concept on the third try fresh, it is starting to feel a little stale.  The other problem is while there are some parts of the story that are quite entertaining, this time around the plotline is awfully fractured, in not a fun puzzle sort of way.  Too many cast members going in too many directions.  The DVD, sadly, also had some production problems.  It's awfully dark at times.  There is a few times when the soundtrack (which is quite wonderful) is a little too loud and the dialogue a little too soft.  I have family members who love Clooney and company and love this series, all three of them.  I own the first one, which I still consider the best of this run (even though it's a remake of a older movie).  I would say this is as good or better than the second, but I'm not sure if I would buy this at full price.
1401207529|5.0|Even though Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" is the more widely-acclaimed classic, \\"Batman: Year One\\" is my preferred favorite. I consider Miller's TDKR a major classic and enjoy it, and I feel the same way about \\"Year One:\\" It's a classic.<br /><br />\\"Year One\\" is my favorite origin story next to \\"Batman Begins.\\" The tone is perfect, the writing is strong and memorable, and Mr. Mazzucchelli's artwork is fantastic and atmospheric.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of this epic is the dynamic of the relationships between Batman and then-Lieutenant Jim Gordon, and Batman and the entire G.C.P.D. Batman/Gordon learning to trust each other, and Batman/G.C.P.D. trying to stay one step ahead of each other. It's the stuff of legends.<br /><br />This is Batman, ladies and gentlemen. Who he is, and how he came to be.<br /><br />Highest possible recommendation.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|- Veronica (investigating Piz's car, from which his moving-in stuff had been stolen): \\"It doesn't look like they jimmied their way in.\\"<br />- Piz: \\"It wasn't locked.\\"<br />- Veronica: \\"College campus. All your worldly possessions. Where are you from? Brigadoon?\\"<br /><br />Nope, Neptune in Cali isn't exactly as  magical as Brigadoon. Neptune, like most places, hides its share of festering secrets and nefarious intents, which keeps busy the hardworking Mars Investigations agency, staffed by Keith Mars and his ever resourceful 19-year-old daughter Veronica. So for this 3rd and final season, we again say hello - and bid farewell - to these folks up in Neptune. With high school flush in her rearview mirror, part-time shamus, now full-time college student Veronica Mars turns her sardonic attention to life at Hearst College. But some things simply don't change for our feisty heroine. She still helps out her dad in the gumshoe department and still suffers an exhausting relationship with her emotionally fractured bad boy of a boyfriend, Logan Echolls. And she still touts a rep for ferreting out, and digging in, and nosing about. And, since she does get results, she's soon up to her neck putting out fires and solving campus dilemmas.<br /><br />Some plot SPOILERS follow.<br /><br />VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is still very good, but it's the weakest of the three seasons. This time the main ongoing story arcs revolve around Veronica hunting down a campus serial rapist and sleuthing another baffling murder. On a smaller scale, her mystery plate is heaped with servings the likes of a stolen team playbook, some missing tapes, an accusation of plagiarism, a vanished heiress, a secret society, a holdup at a costume casino party, etc. So add that to her freshman woes. And, being Veronica Mars, she also doesn't take long to alienate an activist sorority and a raunchy fraternity, as well as the weasely assistant of her criminology professor. But at least her crime solving is made easier by her gigs as Library Helpdesk girl and as the photographer of the college paper. And she's always got her buds to lean on, Wallace, Mac, and Logan, even if their onscreen appearances are sporadic (just one reason this season isn't as good).<br /><br />But the show's not all about Veronica (it's just mostly about Veronica). My second favorite character in the show is Keith Mars, and he has his own messes to muddle thru. Logan continues to have his own issues and comes close to overdoing the tortured soul thing; Wallace juggles basketball with his mechanical engineering aspirations; Weevil is now out on parole (from his misdeeds in Season 2) but must maintain a job; and Mac, well, she's still shy. Meanwhile, Veronica's clique widens in the forms of the happy-go-lucky, kinda dull Piz (Wallace's roomie) and party girl, kinda dull Parker (Mac's roomie). So, hello, new loves and old loves, and there's even a hasty wedding. As usual, it's a blending of heartbreak and mystery and life lessons and surprises. Just life in Neptune.<br /><br />SPOILERS end.<br /><br />So I managed to blast thru all 20 episodes (plus extras) in one sleep-deprived - but worth it - marathon viewing session. Something to be said for watching your favorite shows on dvd instead of television, the dvds lending an instant gratification and an immediacy which suck in the viewer even more. Having said that, not only am I bummed out about the series's abrupt demise but pretty upset that there wasn't even a proper ending to the series. Again, only 20 episodes here, with the last one leaving its audience hanging off a cliff. Not cool, CW.<br /><br />Two paragraphs now about the plentiful bonus stuff, which can be found on the 6th disc (there are 6 discs in all in this set). Most interesting and quite bittersweet are the two segments devoted to what would have been Season 4: one's a 12 minute clip giving us a feel for what the next season would've been like (Veronica in the FBI), the other has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show. Both segments, to me, feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff (ie: the town of Neptune, the school backdrop, Veronica's father and circle of friends) had been taken away. A whole new mess of characters are introduced, all of whom I felt a bit hostile to.<br /><br />Under the banner \\"Going Undercover with Rob Thomas\\" (and with his sycophantic right hand man Dan Etheridge) we get 9 ho-hum featurettes: \\"Main Titles: Why the Change?\\"; \\"Rob's Directing Experience\\"; \\"Favorite Guest Star Moments\\"; \\"Veronica Mars: Mean Girl\\" - in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3; \\"The Politics of Veronica Mars\\" - concerning the negative reactions to the show; Thomas goes over his \\"Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments\\" and his \\"Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments\\"; \\"Do-Overs?\\" - scenes of which Thomas wasn't too fond; and \\"Highlights\\" - more of Thomas's fave moments. Then 24 minutes worth of 16 unaired scenes with Thomas's intros; a 7 minute gag reel (best was Enrico Colantoni's many takes of \\"I finally got the police report on the ****'s suicide\\"). The Webisode gallery offers 5 clips, the most fun of which is Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell Q & A-ing each other. There's also a guidebook which breaks down the episodes. A ton of extras here, so I shouldn't gripe; yet I wish Kristen Bell and cast had done an interview or even an episode commentary.<br /><br />For three years VERONICA MARS has delivered the goods, consistently bringing it with the clever and the funny, with the heartwrenching angst and the occasional melodramatic twist. Once in a while, my thoughts were even provoked. Along with the crisp plotting and snappy banter, the show presented relationships that were complicated and fluid and real and multi-faceted mysteries which perplexed. But by this season's end the show had kind of broken away from its normal pattern, that of each episode being pivotal and acting as chapters to one cohesive storyline. The last five episodes instead tended to be self-contained ones, and that's when the show really began to feel fractured. There are less gems here than in the first 2 seasons, although most of the episodes are still darn watchable. If I had to pick favorites, three episodes instantly spring to mind: \\"Debasement Tapes,\\" in which Paul Rudd guest stars as a rumpled, near alcoholic rock star living off his old glory; \\"Postgame Mortem,\\" in which a moping Logan ends up babysitting a cheerful 11-year-old girl; and episode 20, which ends the series just as things begin to get darn good.<br /><br />In the acting department, Jason Dohring (the ever moody Logan) again stands out. Enrico Colantoni continues to make a case for his character Keith Mars as being the best dad in the universe. My most cherished moments in the series have to do with Veronica and Keith doing their daughter-dad thing. There's just this amazing level of understanding, caring, and humor between them, and conveyed wonderfully by Bell and Colantoni. Whenever they're in a scene together, the world is good. And, as always, Kristen Bell, playing that spunky, tenacious girl detective, effortlessly carries the show.<br /><br />But, well, the show's done now, and the superb cast scattered, with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring, to MOONLIGHT. But it's still gonna take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain: \\"A long time ago, we used to be friends.\\" VERONICA MARS, you see, it was a very good show. And, to echo Keith Mars on his daughter Veronica, \\"I find her nosiness charming.\\"er has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show. Both segments, to me, feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff (ie: the town of Neptune, the school backdrop, Veronica's father and circle of friends) had been taken away.

And, as always, Kristen Bell, playing that spunky, tenacious girl detective, effortlessly carries the show.<br /><br />But, well, the show's done now, and the superb cast scattered, with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring, to MOONLIGHT. But it's still gonna take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain: \\"A long time ago, we used to be friends.\\" VERONICA MARS, you see, it was a very good show. And, to echo Keith Mars on his daughter Veronica, \\"I find her nosiness charming.\\"

140120306X|1.0|I just received this book and found it very disappointing.  The movie was such a hoot this is just gross.  It is a huge waste of paper and not a book I would want my teen to read.
B000W4KT64|3.0|For the most part, I found this movie to be very enjoyable.  I was already familiar with the stage musical and the original movie when I saw this version.  At first I was a little hesitant when I saw the cast, mostly because of John Travolta and Amanda Bynes.  Being familiar with the show, and with previous work of both actors, I felt that these casting choices were based on a desire to sell tickets rather than to make a good movie.  I was pleasantly surprised when Amanda Bynes nearly pulled off the character.  While not quite as good a singer or actress as the usual types for the role, she still did fairly well.  John Travolta, on the other hand, did not surprise me at all.  There is no way that a casting director sat down and thought that he was right for this role.  It was merely a publicity stunt; a way to sell seats.  \\"Come see John Travolta play a woman!\\"  Sadly, I know many people who fell for this marketing ploy.  I felt, that he ruined parts of the movie.  He made the majority of the parts that he was in, nearly unbearable.  The role of Edna is traditionally played by a man in order to get a deeper, rougher voice, as though the character has smoked too much, and lets face it, a man can project that kind of voice better than women in most cases.  John Travolta didn't do that kind of a voice.  I honestly can't place what he was trying to do.  The show takes place in Baltimore, however, his accent kept slipping from New York, to Southern, to Surfer boy, and none of the accents that he sounded like he was attempting were actually done correctly.  When he sang, he sounded like Danny from Grease, which only made him look more ridiculous in the role.  In my opinion, this could have been a really good movie.  I love seeing Broadway shows become available to the masses, only if they are done justice.  With the exception of the poor choice in casting John Travolta, I believe that this movie did just that.
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|I bought this CD on a friend's recommendation and I was NOT dissappointed. I am a fan of many genres of music but Goth/Symphonic Metal is my favorite. In my opinion, Never Enough is the best song on the CD followed by The Obsessive Devotion and Sancta Terra. I found the CD to be very listenable front to back. If you like a layered metal sound with haunting vocals (Simone Simons has a beautiful voice and range) you will like this CD. I plan on seeing them when they come here on their tour.
B000W04S6U|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing. I've been a Halo fan since the beginning. I've loved the music as well. When I first played through Halo 3 I loved every second of it and the music really stood out to me. I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack. I had to wait whole month! Oh well, I got to listen to my Halo and Halo 2 scores a bunch in the mean time. Well I finally got it yesterday. Every bit of music from the game is on the two discs. They've been arranged into concert suites like the previous Halo scores. Like another reviewer on here said if you've played through Halo 3 you can listen to the score and close your eyes and relive the adventure. Or if you haven't played the game, the music stands alone and is very enjoyable. I think track 12 is my favorite, and was also my favorite part of the game, story wise as they land on the Ark. It reminded me of when they landed on the original Halo in the first game. The mystery and excitement was all there and the music perfectly orchestrates that moment. Anyways, great score and well worth the money for 2 hours of music! Even the music from the game menus is on the CD.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Lives of Others is an extremely moving film. The integrity of the writers, producer, actors and composer are beyond what I ever saw. The honesty, the sense of reality, the humanity and in general the treatment of such a, still actual , problem for the Germans is  overwhelming.  Made on a low budget. So far removed from \\"Hollywood\\" I am sure many people will not be able to relate to it. It's their loss.  For those who do this movie will be of enormous emotional impact and it stayed with me for weeks. Mind you, one should see it at least twice and also view the comments of the artists involved in order to get the full picture.  At the level of 'Sophie Schol' and \\"Kolya\\". See it!
B00004STDN|4.0|Outstanding action and tension.  One of the reasons I bought the movie is because of my fear of heights, and the opening scene in the movie, which makes me squeemish, however you spell it.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|Great image,awesome picture and sound,Shooter ( Blu-ray ) just gets you into the action from start to finish,it's a must have for anyone's video collection.
B000W4HFY8|1.0|I am a hardcore fan of twin peaks.  anything that is out there dealing with it, i try to get.  Like this.  However, the only good thing about this one is a remix of some musical numbers which is track 1 and the trio with james, donna and maddy.
0375758992|5.0|I was stunned to see a series of negative customer reviews in and amongst those of readers like me who adored this book unreservedly. \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" is an amazing coming-of-age memoir of life in pre-revolution Rhodesia. Hilarious, furiously intelligent, and profoundly sad, Fuller's vibrant passion for her beloved Africa overrides all. I can only imagine that those who were bored with this book weren't up to the challenge of Fuller's dynamic and gorgeous prose.
B000002LMM|5.0|Back in 1992, my younger brother kept insisting I listen to the soundtrack from Twin Peaks. I resisted. I gave it a cursory listen. It was too dark, too sinister! But I kept coming back and listening. And listening. Suddenly, I was in love. I couldn't STOP listening. I've worn out one cd already and am on my second cd. If I could listen to one cd only, it would be this one. Fortunately, I don't have to limit myself! I own \\"Fire Walk With Me,\\" and am about to buy \\"All New Season Two Music.\\"  Yes, it IS dark and sinister music. But it is also great jazz and haunting melodies. It speaks to the dark side in all of us.
B000UR9TQO|4.0|I've always loved this movie, but the main problem I have with this new release is that the 4 previously unseen songs (Celebration Day, Over The Hills and Far Away, Misty Mountain Hop, and The Ocean) are not part of the movie at all! WTH? The first disc is the original theatrical release and the second disc is the bonus features including the 4 songs. I was under the impression they had been integrated into the concert and we would finally get to see the show the way it actually happened! Just for that I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5. Why couldn't they recut it and put the songs in the right place?
B00006JSS8|5.0|For the person who has not purchased each and every single record that this marvelous human being has made (there must only be three or four such people on the planet)this compilation is perfect.    Or maybe you've always wanted to go back and replace your vinyl and cassettes with the crisp,pure sound of compact discs but it is too expensive. I had begun to do just that and then this boxed set came out.  I was very, very pleased with all the songs. EXCELLENT BOXED SET.
0345479092|4.0|This is a good book to get to know your baby and learn about their cries and how they communicate. I have been using her theories and it's great to anticipate what she will need and able to plan our day. Highly recommended!
B00005M91K|5.0|I highly recommend this film! It is a beautiful video storybook telling stories of places all over the world past and present.
0736063684|5.0|great, detailed pictures!    (stop wining about naked people - it's an anatomy book!!!)    although, some comments to some exercises should probably be treated as an opinion rather than absolute truth.
B000YAF4OS|5.0|Just saw the movie this morning.  It was stunning.  Unlike many King adaptations, this movie really rang true.  The effects were wonderful, and the acting better than expected.  The ending was very powerful.  Can't wait until the DVD comes out so I can watch it a million times!
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna's return to prominence with the correct amount of elements from pop (to appeal to general audiences), electronica (enough to make it an outstanding and trend-setting album) and spirituality (yes, she's still a pop icon).  Ray of Light put Madonna in the spotlight once again with rave reviews from critics and people in general.  You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this music journey through Madonna's best accomplished album.
B000NA28I4|3.0|Eragon is not a bad movie - in fact, when judged on its own merits, it is both a respectable film and one that I enjoyed watching. There's action, likeable characters, believable special effects (the opening scene hooked me instantly), and an epic plot that will keep most in the audience interested. Younger viewers will probably be especially entertained, as they can see themselves in the roles of Eragon and/or Arya.    Criticism of the movie really comes from two areas. The first is that the film attempts to pack too much into too short of a time frame, and thus fails to properly develop itself. Dragons grow from hatchlings to adults in the blink of an eye, and powerful magical spells appear to be learned in a day. Characters become best friends almost instantly, making viewers wonder how the bonds of trust were formed. Readers of the books received a much more detailed version of this adventure, so they can see the discrepancies more easily than those exposed to the material for the first time through the film (this is probably the reason so many are writing such negative reviews here). The film SHOULD have been expanded to incorporate more details/depth, but there are also limits as to how much can be transfered from a book.    The other big criticism of this movie is that, as it is has been cut and edited, the story almost completely parallels Star Wars: A New Hope with a few Lord of the Rings elements thrown in. Does this description sound familiar: \\"A princess is captured while attempting to get an important item into the hands of the rebellion. During her capture, the princess is able to transfer the item from her possession to a random location. The item falls into the hands of a farm boy, who's uncle (that raised him) is killed by those searching for the item. The boy meets an outcast old man that teaches him about a mystical power he can control, as well as his special destiny.\\" The similarities don't stop there, but that's as far as I'm willing to go in my explanation due to possible spoilers. Needless to say, if you know the plot of one film, you know the plot of both.    I recommend Eragon to those looking for a fun fantasy film. Fans of the books will probably be disappointed with it, but those looking for something fun to watch during an afternoon could do a lot worse. Three stars.
0743486285|5.0|What a relief.....rock stars are human and recover too! If I had kids I would have them read this book, it is amazingly honest. What Sixx has been doing since is amazing and benefits many. Thanks for taking the time to write and publish this personal (ad)venture.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|If you are a Zep fan run to your nearest cd supply store and buy this set. I would have to say that the layers of detail and sound are without  peer. This is the DE FACTO release of all these songs. I suggest you listen to this on quality audio equiptment. I have spent many hours with this set since it was released and I must say I am amazed.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|I too have been purchasing version of the starwars trilogy for going on 15 years.  I just wish that, finally, Lucas would release a properly formatted version of the original films.  I don't know if anyone's noticed, but the original unaltered versions aren't in the correct aspect ratio.  In fact, I can't even zoom them into the proper ratio, so they look fairly terrible.  I wouldn't mind if Lucas re-digitized the video from the original film as he did for the special editions, but after that, he needs to drop it.  Cut this cord, you've milked this cash cow for all it's worth.  Please, George, do it for all of us fans who enjoyed your films as children and want to have the original version in the best format available.
B000WQW988|5.0|THE SOUND IS GREAT-THE PICTURE IS GREAT. THIS IS HOW ALL MUSIC DVD'S SHOULD BE MADE. SO GREAT TO GET THIS AFTER THE REM-LIVE DVD MESS.
B000TUXL2A|3.0|Have been listening to MK for close to 30 years and have close to everything that he has recorded commercially.  Though always a Dire Straits fan, I have really enjoyed MKs solo efforts, great quality recordings, guitar playing, and creative lyrics.  I was even hesitant to buy his last effort with Emmylou Harris, as I don't care for country, but was pleasantly surprised and can't stop playing the CD over and over.  I was excited when I heard KTGC was coming out and eagerly preordered the CD.  Listened to it immediately upon receiving and was disappointed in the \\"sameness\\" of all the songs. Nothing really inspired me to listen again and again.  I missed some of the creative and sometimes cynical and sarcastic lyrics found in some of MKs other lyrics.  I missed some of the more upbeat songs found on some of the other solo CDs.  Plus not too much inspirational guitar work on this CD.  I have given it a few more listens, and a few of the songs have grown on me, but overall, it will probably be a disc I put on the shelf and select other MK discs when I'm in the mood to listen to him (which is almost a daily thing!)  While all of MKs characteristics are found on KTGC, it is overall not one of his best.  I do realize that something like \\"Telegraph Road\\" only happens once in a lifetime, but it is almost like this effort was done by a different artist.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Every song on here has its own vibe and is just PURE GREAT REGGAE! I cannot tell you how many people I have given this album to, and they have just loved it. You never get tired of hearing it!
630463949X|1.0|Very disappointed... this DVD is NOT in 5.1 and sounds dreadful. A waste of money by my standards.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|I have to say I was truly dissapointed by this movie.  I had heard how great it was.  If you like sad stories you will like this too.  The movie had some good points but all in all I can't recommend it.  The actors did a great job but the story was lacking.
B000WZB944|5.0|The Joshua Tree is one of those rare albums that came at the perfect time in a band's career, when everything that made them an excellent band converged to make them rank among the best of all time. They had certainly had fine albums before: The excellent debut, Boy; the underappreciated October; the brilliant War; and the more experimental album, The Unforgettable Fire (plus a couple decent live albums along the way). But this is the one that launched them to the stratosphere, both artistically and commercially.<br /><br />The opening suite is about as good as it gets in music: Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, and With or Without You. All of these are more than just great rock hits: they're part of the fabric of our time. Outside of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band, I can't think of a more amazing beginning to an album. The instant those echoed notes of Where the Streets Have No Name start to fade in, you know - whether it's the first time you've heard it or the thousandth - that you're in for a transcendent musical experience. There aren't many songs or albums that deserve this kind of excessive praise (Sgt. Pepper, Blood on the Tracks, Automatic for the People, Exile on Main St., Songs in the Key of Life, to name a few) and this is one of them.<br /><br />Not only are the opening tracks incredible, and well-known to all, but the album continues with series of songs both hard-hitting, stunningly beautiful, totally heart-felt, and wonderfully pure, sometimes all at once. The production by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno is textured, nuanced, and completely appropriate for every song. This new, remastered version only enhances the production.<br /><br />The second disc gives an even fuller picture of the band's sound from this peak era, expanding what was hinted at on the b-sides disc of their 1980-1990 greatest hits collection.<br /><br />This edition exists for those who are unable or unwilling to shell out the money they're asking for the super-deluxe edition, which includes a concert dvd. For some of the more visually-oriented fans, that's definitely the edition to get. Others, who tend to watch a concert dvd only once or twice, but listen to cds (or ripped music on their computer or mp3 player) may find this the better deal. I, for one, think it's fantastic that the option exists. Rather than force people who want the second disc of Joshua Tree-era songs to pay a rather high price for the full cd/dvd package, fans can opt to buy only the remastered album and second disc.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that this is one of the greatest albums of all time, and this new edition has found a way to improve its presentation. With any luck, this deluxe edition will become the new standard for how artists release anniversary editions of their classic albums.e edition, which includes a concert dvd.

1400062756|5.0|I now view difficulties differently after this book.  In fact, I look for them in my area of expertise because it is nothing more but an opportunity to grow, to improve.    I may have missed a few decades of my life not being able to use the concepts here but I am pleased that the author talks about how to apply it to children a lot.  How I talk to my kids from now on has changed forever.
006097625X|5.0|I happened across this book in the library, and was _that_ close to putting it back on the shelf. I was looking for art books to teach sketch drawing. I went back to the shelf for a second look, then couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The comic book method of combining words and pictures to convey a message was amazingly effective in this book. It's a book about how to understand comic books, and it is itself a comic book. What opened my eyes was just how powerful a medium it is.<br /><br />The medium hasn't even remotely been explored completely. It's wide open. This book is itself an amazing poster child for the art itself. McCloud's artwork is beautiful, and absolutely effective in every line. His range of capabilities is astounding. It's a pleasure experiencing this book. When my kids get older, I want them to read it and I hope they'll get excited about drawing.<br /><br />Anyway if you're interested in creating comic books of your own, or are interested in learning about comic books themselves, this book is a must read. It is certainly McCloud's best work. The drawings are clearly drawn by hand with pen and paper. McCloud's later work is clearly done on computer, and something precious is lost in the translation. I'm sure the computer saves a great deal of time, but the end result is...just not the same. This book spoke to me in a very profound way. Get a copy for yourself.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|You may have a tons of critics for the movie, but the Soundtrack is superb.    This edition, much more extensive than the regular edition of the soundtrack, and almost fully covers the whole soundtrack of the movie (just for the omissions of \\"Why Don't We Do It on the Road?\\", \\"I Want You (She's so Heavy)\\").     The new versions of the old-time favorite Beatles hits, are truly well-worked. The whole cast from the movie, unknown to must of us, have truly great voices and they show here that they can sing. The \\"famous guest stars\\" (Bono, Joe Cocker, Secret Machines) also do a great job; making the Beatle song to sound like their own. So, don't fear, believe me, the songs don't sound like a cheesy Broadway musical.
B000PKG7I4|4.0|After falling in love with \\"Back to Black\\", I had to hear what else Ms. W had to offer. And in some moods, I like \\"Frank\\" even better than \\"Back to Black\\".  There's nothing quite so immediately catchy as \\"Rehab\\", but jazz is almost always less accessible than pop, isn't it?  And this is considerably more jazz-oriented than \\"Back\\": covers of \\"Moody's Mood\\" and \\"There Is No Greater Love\\", even a tantalizing scat-break in the opening track.  \\"Cherry\\", \\"F-Me Pumps\\", \\"Love Is Blind\\", and \\"Take The Box\\" are the standouts for me -- though I also find myself absently singing \\"Amy, Amy, Amy\\" from time to time.  Here's hoping Ms. W pulls her personal life together and doesn't end up the fastest complete burn-out in the the history of pop music: much as I love both \\"Back\\" and \\"Frank\\" I'd hate for them to be her entire oeuvre.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I am addicted to this cd!  I just got it yesterday and I have already listened to the entire thing about 4 or 5 times...  basically any chance I get.  I highly recommend this cd.

B000AARKOO|1.0|I would give this movie one star only. It was well done, but historically incorrect. It completely distorted the cause of the Crusades - turning the Crusaders into villains while giving the Muslims a free pass. Most westerners are under the misconception that the Crusades were started by the Europeans, when in point of fact they had begun some 500 years earlier with the Muslim invasions. Their object, spread Islam at the point of the sword or die trying.     By 1099 A.D., Europeans were in the position of either accepting Islamic civilization and faith or stand up for their own culture and Christian faith. If there are any bad guys in all of this, it is clearly the Muslims who lack social and religious tolerance.     This film makes Christians out to be rapists, murderers and thieves; while making the Muslim leader out to be some noble leader who was tolerant and respectful of Christianity. This is just one more horrible Hollywood hack job on western civilization and more directly Christianity. Another example of blaming the victim for having been victimized.     Don't waste your time and money, it is time and money you will never get back. A little historical perspective dating back to the mid-600s A.D. would put the issue of the Crusades into historical context, which is badly lacking in Hollywood and western education today.

B000WCDI5K|3.0|I find it kind of amazing that a band only two albums into their career is at the point where a batch of leftovers constitutes a new CD. But hey, it is the holiday season, and I guess The Killers need to strike while their collective iron is still hot. After all, last year's genius (the terrific [[ASIN:B000GY729M Sam's Town]]) could be next year's has been.<br /><br />From the sounds of the material on \\"Sawdust,\\" that is a fate I doubt will befall Brandon Flowers and company anytime soon. The two new songs here shore up the maturation apparent on \\"Sam's Town\\" and the demos/B-sides chronicle the evolution from post-new wave [[ASIN:B0002858YS Hot Fuss]] ravers to Springsteen disciples in the band's relatively short existence. The main attraction is \\"Tranquilize,\\" a duet with eternally cranky and creaky Lou Reed, who sounds so natural here that it's downright spooky. Reed and Flowers trade off verses and sound so in-synch with each other that you can almost miss the fact that it's a duet.<br /><br />The Killers' contribution to the Ian Curtis bio-pic, \\"Control,\\" is also revelatory. Taking on Joy Division's \\"Shadowplay\\" is daunting enough, and the band makes it sound like a tribute and not at all like the karaoke you dreaded might be lurking in the background. The other two cover tunes are telling, as well. Playing Kenny Rogers' \\"Ruby (Don't Take Your Love To Town)\\" as a bit of a lark is good fun to hear, but the reverent version of Dire Straits' \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (recorded live at Abby Road in a very subdued fashion) shows a facet of the band that's pretty darn sweet. Same goes for slowed down piano take on \\"Sam's Town,\\" which really shores up those Springsteen ambitions.<br /><br />After that, the songs range from pretty good (\\"Where The White Boys Dance\\") to demos that still needed work (\\"Daddy's Eyes\\") to unnecessary (a who-cares remix of \\"Mr Brightside\\"). Unless you're deeply into The Killers, you can probably pass on this and wait to see where Flowers' muse leads him next.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|\\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" is a masterful compilation of music filled with beautiful rhythmic pieces. Everything is awesome about this album. It captures the essence of melodic beauty and every song is a surprise of talent and incredible display of musicality. If you are an eclectic individual you will enjoy the relaxing melodies of OneRepublic!!!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|We saw this CD reviewed in a major hi fi magazine and wanted to try it on our new speakers. The sound reproduction is excellent and the disk well worth buying. The commentary doesn't disappoint, either.
B000VBP38C|5.0|My wife picked up this title (from amazon) and I was actually surprised that I liked it.      It's one of those titles that a person like me would do a pass on, and that is often a shame.  I'm sure I'm missing many films that are quite good.    The acting is excellent, the sets are very British, the whole movie is actually very well done.    As for the story...well done as well.  I'm not a fan of Jane Austin so I had no idea how things would work out, but i figured they would work out and they did.    I can draw a line from this narrative to movies like Love Actually or Four Weddings.    enjoy.
0060763892|3.0|Sigma Force is once again plunged into deadly intrigue when strange, churning white seas near Christmas Island, north of Australia, create a bizarre sickness.  Operatives Monk and Lisa are sent to investigate and assist with the afflicted when they find themselves and an entire cruise ship of refugees hijacked by the Guild, the same rogue organization Sigma has come up against in their last three adventures.  Meanwhile, the action literally crashes Commander Grayson Pierce's party when Guild operative Seichan, his nemesis, crashes her motorcycle into his parents' driveway.  She's been shot, and she's on the run from the Guild, having fallen out of favor after stealing an obelisk that shows a pattern of strange glyphs when held under an ultraviolet light.  These glyphs are keys to solving an ancient puzzle dating back to Marco Polo.  Nasser, the agent who wants the obelisk back, ambushes Seichan's rescue and manages to get his hands on Gray's parents, whom he then threatens to kill if Gray and Seichan don't do what he wants.  They meet up in Istanbul with Bishop Vigor Verona of the Vatican and start following a trail of historical clues, trying to find a cure for the disease that's spreading on Christmas Island.<br /><br />At the same time, the pirates who hijacked the cruise ship there captured Lisa, but Monk got away, letting them believe he was dead.  He sneaks back on the ship to rescue Lisa, but before he does more than clamber aboard, they set sail for a chain of thousands of islands, where they hide in a deepwater cove under a huge camouflage net.  The pirates are forcing Lisa to work as a doctor and a scientist, studying a special patient who was not afflicted in the same way as the others.  Instead of degenerating, Susan Tunis is getting better, and when the lights go out, Lisa notices she glows.  When Monk and the cruise ship owner contact Lisa to plan their escape, Lisa insists they take Susan along, as she is the key to finding a cure.  Most of them get away from the ship, but the island they escape to is inhabited by cannibals.<br /><br />The action jumps back and forth from Gray and Seichan, following Marco Polo's historical trail, to Monk and Lisa, as they try to escape the clutches of both pirates and cannibals.  They follow clues and dodge the bad guys, all while trying to save the world from certain pestilence and death.  While I can't complain about the action, I just can't quite all the way warm to our friends at Sigma.  They don't push believability any more than other adventures I've read, but I still can't quite get carried away.  There is a slightly mystical aspect that conveniently fills any scientific gaps, but that is not an unenjoyable angle.  Maybe it's because the bad guys always seem to have Sigma agents under their thumb, seeming far too invincible for my liking.  In all, though, this is a novel packed with action from beginning to end, played out in exotic locales, utilizing science and history to weave an intriguing tale.

They don't push believability any more than other adventures I've read, but I still can't quite get carried away.  There is a slightly mystical aspect that conveniently fills any scientific gaps, but that is not an unenjoyable angle.  Maybe it's because the bad guys always seem to have Sigma agents under their thumb, seeming far too invincible for my liking.  In all, though, this is a novel packed with action from beginning to end, played out in exotic locales, utilizing science and history to weave an intriguing tale.  He's not Cussler, but I'll always read a Rollins adventure.
B00003CX9W|5.0|The 60th anniversary DVD of Fantasia is a gem and a great find. The DVD has the original narration, not the 1962 re-release narration (which is on the VHS version), and everyone who has seen both has preferred the original.<br /><br /> The sound and video quality, while not exactly Pixar quality, are never the less impressive considering the age of the original.<br /> This film is one of those timeless classics that endures very well.
B000003TAW|2.0|The best songs on this album were the ones I've heard on the radio a million times. Don't waste your money on this CD. Just flip on your local rock station or rip it off the net.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I saw this movie three times while it was in theaters and than read the book. It is faithful to the book and in many ways more satisfying. The acting is top notch, but Robert de Niro as a \\"gay\\" pirate has to be seen to be believed. Michelle Pfiefer really does a great job too, in a way playing against her age. I strongly recommend this movie.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|I saw her show in Phoenix back In February and let me just say, I was impressed! I loved her stripped tour so much that her topping that seemed impossible! She did it though and this time there was whips! First off the show opened with two of the hottest act in R&B, Pussycat Dolls and Dainty Kaine! who got the crowed pumped then Christina opened the show with her first single AINT NO OTHER MAN!Through out the two hour concert you see great special effects a few pyros and like Christina fashion, a bunch of confetti. Speaking of fashion, her costumes designed by DSquared and Roberto Cavoli were stunning! She did a little circus act mid way through which in my opinion was very original and entertaining! Bottom line is Christina proves over and over she is an amazing singer/song writer and her performances on stage just comes to show the world &#34;she aint going no where, no sheÃ¢ÂÂs' here to stay&#34;!BUY IT!!!!
B000V1MMLI|5.0|I am a huge System of a Down fan; therefore I was some what hesitant to buy this album. Being a solo album I expected it too be no where near as fulfilling as another System of a Down album. Needless to say this CD rocked just as hard as a SOAD album. I gave this five stars because Serj Tankian does a masterful job on mixing keyboards, drums and guitars/basses on every single album. Again this makes me reminisce all the way back to the first two System of a Down albums. I'd say this is a must for any System fan.
B000F5GO0A|4.0|Beirut is further proof that the future is not what it used to be. Too many people have been announcing the death of rock music, or even worse that heavy metal will save rock. Instead, the latest generation of musicians - Sufjan Stevens, Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom, Rufus Wainwright, the National - have shown a different path: excellent melodies, sometimes inspired by obscure folk music and other musical traditions. Beirut is in good company, and is pointing in a new direction.<br /><br />This album plays like a reverie of sorts. It suggest melancholy, travel, places that are far, but not *too* far to the point of being hopelessly exotic. There was a time, say 20 years ago, when balkan tunes sounded too unearthly even to european ears. Now, they have become one of common denominators of popular music from Ukraine to Serbia to Southern Italy all the way to Spain (think Mau Mau). And now, across to the Atlantic to the US. The latest validation comes from Zack Condon, who absorbed balkan music while in France for a few months, and regurgitated his own idiosyncratic version. It's more subdued and simpler than the original, and contaminated in many nice ways. For once Condon's voice reminds David Byrne, minus the irony. Second, there is a hint of mariachi here and there. It's music written by a 19-year old, with its generic lyrics, but also with the honesty and urgency that only a teenager can have. Still, this is a little gem, a mini-treatise on longing and traveling.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Most of what I would say has, I believe, already been said.  Let me just say that I think this may be one of the first times I can ever remember A. not being able to turn off the DVD player, and B. not being able to find fault with a book-to-screen adaptation. And I don't mean this as damning with faint praise.    It is glorious. The casting is perfect. At last: a production that shows Jane's passionate, fiercely independent nature without making her a 2007 heroine in petticoats.  She is also, importantly, young-- a strong, intelligent, strong young woman discovering herself. Her motivations are believable, as are those of her Mr. Rochester. Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens could not be better in their roles, as can be said for the rest of the cast. Claudia Coulter as Bertha Rochester--a character so often given short shrift-- is dead on: neither dissolving into histrionics or underplaying her madness. The scenery is perfectly lit, the interiors rich, and the costumes a marvel of subtle story enhancement.    Best of all, of course, the screenplay takes only the necessary liberties to translate from a written to a visual medium. Charlotte Bronte's work is the true star, and the story sings. This is an unmissable set of DVDs, and when the enhanced version comes out, I'll pounce on it, saving this copy to pass on.

B000V6BE6M|5.0|Howard Shore's Academy Award winning score for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of King was released in 2003. That was a typical standard release, only containing a fraction of the film's actual music. Finally, the film's score takes its rightful place in cinematic music history with this 4-disc masterpiece recently released from Reprise Records.<br /><br />Shore's brilliant blending of themes occurs in this final chapter of the film trilogy, more so than either of the two previous releases. The Fellowship theme, after forming and then breaking, must draw itself to a new level of focus as they reach Mount Doom. The Elves' theme bestows its final gifts to Middle-Earth, receding into the West. Isengard's theme must meet its fateful demise, but not before incorporating those themes into Sauron's theme near the end of the story.<br /><br />The themes of men, Rohan and Gondor, each given isolated themes in the previous releases, now join forces assuming lead roles in the preparation for war with Sauron's forces. The theme for the Ring itself is also brought to its climax as its fate is decided on Mount Doom. The three main Ring themes now interact with each other, creating a musical fusion that beautifully haunting.<br /><br />As Middle-Earth survives the War of the Ring and enters its Fourth Age, Shore grants the surviving culture's themes peace and prosperity and maintains the aesthetics of each society. Men are granted respite; the Elves, peace; Hobbits, wisdom; and Ring to its fate, destruction.<br /><br />Released in a beautiful boxed set, Shore's score is recorded on four discs. Disc five is a DVD audio disc that contains the entire score in Dolby Digital Surround Sound, Dolby Digital Stereo Sound, Advanced Resolution Surround Sound (24-bit), and Advanced Resolution Stereo Sound (24-bit). The set also comes with a detailed 45-page booklet about the score for the third film, along with Shore's inspirations for some tracks, new instruments used during the scoring process, a list of performers, and much more.<br /><br />It's really difficult to say which tracks are standouts over others because the entire score is fantastic. Disc four's \\"Days of the Ring\\" (which is actually the film's end credits) features Annie Lennox's Academy Award winning song \\"Into the West.\\"<br /><br />This is truly a fantastic piece, I've been waiting for its release ever since the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Complete Recordings came out two years ago. It's hard to express just truly how moving this music really is. If you're a fan of Lord of the Rings, or even just a fan of score music like me, then you'll definitely want to pick up this set.much more.

B000WGZGNS|3.0|I Saw this show in phoenix and when i left I was in awe!She looked amazing and she soundedgood but i noticed one thing in particular! I could not put my finger on it but then it hit me...&#34;AIT I seen this before!&#34;Thinking back it was from her first solo tour! For most of her older songs, she used the same dances and also she used the sqame back ground video. The stage was nothing to be proud of just a flat lit up stage with a few stairs. where was the special effects? Get this guys she still is useing the same dance that DC3 used for soliger! She added too many songs to her set list she kinda pushed her way through them...IN HER DEFENCE THOUGH i LOVE THE FACT THAT SHE HAD AN ALL GIRL BAND AND THE NEW DANCES WERE WELL PERFORMED!
B000VI70WM|3.0|I can understand why this album is so divisive. Rather than make grand pronouncements or add to the din, I will attempt to break down, as objectively as possible, what you'll get here.    This is not a return to the classic Duran sound. Think about the old hits we all love so much, and there's a lot of guitar on there. Not so much here. This one is very beat driven.    If you like classic new wave (like Missing Persons), there are a lot of synth sounds here that I think you'll enjoy.    The modern beats -- there's no denying they're here, and in abundance. To my ear, though, when paired with the new wavy synths it sounds retro instead of like a grab for current chart cred.    Simon's voice is mixed loud and clear, which goes a long way to making this still sound like Duran. He's got a really unique voice and it sounds great here.     I'd go so far as the compare this to an update or sequel to Big Thing, though that may not be completely accurate. Just say this, you can draw a straighter line from Big Thing to this album than you could from Rio.    I loaded in three stars because I don't want to shove an opinion down your throats -- but I really like this. Even more than Astronaut (and I really like Astronaut). Somehow, as strange as it seems on paper, I think it works.    But I totally get why it's not for everyone.
B0002ZMJ5M|4.0|As 'the season to be merry' now approaches, perhaps you are thinking of buying some music that reflects the more traditional aspects of Christmas; well this album should certainly 'fit the bill' and, at the same time, offer something a little different. Not only should 'The Jethro Tull Christmas Album' appeal to fans who prefer the band's 'folksy-medieval' sound, it could well be a revelation to others - those who find JT's edgier music either too strident or too complex, or those who haven't even heard of JT. Also, fans of Fairport Convention might want to give this album a listen.<br /><br />The songs all have a strong Christmas feel, yet they still offer variety : modern arrangements of carols and classical pieces, with remaining songs being Ian Anderson originals; the album includes 7 instrumentals and 6 songs which are re-makes (not simply re-mixes) of earlier JT songs. Ian Anderson returns to strong form vocally and with a somewhat smoother delivery. The musicianship is first class (featuring flute/piccolo, piano/keyboards/accordion, acoustic/electric guitar and mandolin, bass guitar and percussion - also, the Sturcz String Quartet on one track). Ian Anderson's flute playing still employs a 'fluttering' technique but he also uses a more fluent style; the guitar playing (both acoustic and electric) by Martin Barre, and the keyboards of Andrew Giddings on 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen', are truly outstanding. All the hallmarks of Ian Anderson's creativity are here - elaborate arrangements, frequent tempo changes and 'interesting' lyrics occasionally laced with some wry humour. I have 5 JT albums from the 1970s and, whilst the sound quality is reasonably good (if a little variable), it simply does not compare with the balance, clarity and consistency to be found on 'The Jethro Tull Christmas Album'.<br /><br />This album will be highly effective played only as background music to enhance the general atmosphere of a 'family' Christmas, but I hope you can also take the opportunity to listen to the music and lyrics more attentively (it is music you can listen to all year round) - but, at 16 tracks and over one hour, maybe not all 'in one go'. If you decide that you rather like this music, I would recommend the following JT albums also : [[ASIN:B00008G9JN Songs from the Wood]] (although 'Pibroch' may not appeal), [[ASIN:B00008G9JO Heavy Horses]] and, to a lesser extent, [[ASIN:B00070DK14 The Broadsword and the Beast]] (perhaps I should add - an album not well thought of by some music critics, but one that I enjoy a lot) - on these albums, the music is a little edgier, Ian Anderson's vocals are quirkier and the sound quality is not as good (but you could try the re-mastered versions); nevertheless, they share some similarities with 'The Jethro Tull Christmas Album'.<br /><br />JT's music divides opinion - even amongst fans, but I think this is one the best albums produced by the band for many years. Subjectively, I would have preferred a couple less re-makes in favour of some new material - but this might not bother you so much if you don't already have the original versions.the opportunity to listen to the music and lyrics more attentively (it is music you can listen to all year round) - but, at 16 tracks and over one hour, maybe not all 'in one go'.

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|This series is well cast, well written, and thoroughly enjoyable. The characters and their interaction are fun to watch. This is perhaps the best work that Belisarius Productions have done. I even like these better than JAG or Magnum PI - two of my other favorite series. I rank this right up there with Boston Legal as my top two favorites.
0060974176|3.0|This book, though a revolutionary look at manufacturing (especially when it first came out) and specifically automotive manufacturing, is full of useful information, but dry as a cracker and boring to read if you're not an avid automotive industry enthusiast.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|Ready. Set. Action!<br /><br />Action being the key word here. LIVE FREE OF DIE HARD (aka Die Hard 4) is an action-fest filled with wonderfully similar themes we've all seen in the first DIE HARD film. Bruce Willis ([[ASIN:B000FFL2G6 16 Blocks]]), of course, returns as officer-cum-detective John McClane.<br /><br />He's beat. He's tired. He's beat tired. But family always comes first, and McClane is first seen spying on his college daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, [[ASIN:B000MEYJI8 Bobby]]), trying to protect for the wiles of the world. Naturally Lucy despises his attempts to protect her and storms off. Later, she will come to respect her father and proudly announce that her last name isn't Genero, but McClane.<br /><br />John then gets an assignment as a taxi. He's told to pick up a computer hotshot named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, [[ASIN:B000HCPS94 The Break-Up]]) and bring him to a special FBI task force that's tracking a string of computer crimes targeted at the American infrastructure. Once McClane and Matthew meet, it rapidly becomes apparent that somebody wants Matthew dead. Bullets fly. Bombs go off. McClane, again, is in way over his head ...exactly where Die Hard fans want him.<br /><br />A computer heist known as a \\"fire sale\\" is taking place in which everything vital to U.S. survival gets shut down. Traffic. Television and radio. Electricity. Everything that is currently run by high-tech computers is going off-line. Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) is the bad-guy who is initially seen as a terrorist but is later found to have financial aspirations (sound familiar?). When McClane becomes a pest, Gabriel soon turns to kidnaping someone close to the detective's heart.<br /><br />McClane and Matthew race to save America (and a family member) from a devastating computer meltdown. Car and helicopter chases, semi-truck and harrier jet encounters, all build upon the other until the final, fateful end.<br /><br />The dialogue between the computer illiterate McClane and the gurus of the internet are hilariously pulled off. The geeks can't get to where they need to be unless McClane blasts their way through, and McClane doesn't know what to do unless he's told by the geeks.<br /><br />A great fight sequence between Bruce Willis and Maggie Q ([[ASIN:B000XPU66U Balls of Fury]]) is something to watch for, especially since Willis' character ends up back in an elevator shaft (homage to [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard 1]]). It's also entertaining to see Willis' McClane get his butt stomped by the sexy Asian woman ...for a while.<br /><br />And let's not forget one of the coolest stunts seen on celluloid in some time: a car launch and crashing into a helicopter. Although completely unrealistic, it was amazingly awesome to watch.<br /><br />This is something Die Hard fans have been waiting for; another film that is overly-audacious and loaded with nonstop action scenes.

Deep in the heart excellent in the set-list alaround.   the one real blow away is if they showed the first show from ASU in Tempe,Az on the bonus dvd  parts of that concert are in the \\"Outside it's America documentry\\"  true AZ history on that   know  for a fact that u2's management has that locked away in a vault.................    the b side selection is as great  rise up & desert of our love   just a true vintage great must have  this complete box set is       Tyler     Phoenix,AZ
B000PC8AFU|2.0|I just finished listening to this CD for the second time and I actually liked it less the second time than the first. It was hard getting through all of the songs completely as I would listen as long as possible and then just skip to the next. I have to agree with the reviewers who feel this is just another attempt at the record labels to try and squeeze every last dollar they can get out of us using a deceased artist. The couple of ok unreleased songs on this CD surely do not justify the $13.97 price tag. If it was $7 or $8 maybe. But basically full price is not justified here. The versions of the songs that you have already heard are not the best versions out there. \\"Goin Down\\" with Jeff Beck is my favorite but a similar version is on the box set. That being said if you are a SRV fan like me you will probably buy it anyway. Maybe after a dozen more listens it will grow on me (I hope!!)  Please note, Stevie does not sing on most of these songs and in some instances it is very difficult to pick out his guitar due to the poor editing of this cd.
038073186X|5.0|Shutter Island was my introduction to Mr. Lehane. I was not disappointed. You realy do not know what is going on until the last hand full of pages and even then you are left wondering.<br /><br />Just an all around excellent psychological thriller, one of my most favorite of all time. Superior story telling. A psychological drama second to none. Definitely in a class by itself.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Hilarious dialog. Excellent cars (a 1970 Nova, a Dodge Charger and Challenger in the same movie, plus a Mustang before they got stupid). Stunts that make my long for my teenage years. Tarantino's music is always good, but this sound track is superior. Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike is one of the best characters yet. Folks need to lighten up - this is fun from the menu on through the closing titles.

B000X3KZVI|4.0|I must be one of the biggest Mariah fans out there.  Having never had the chance to see her live (Mimi never comes to South Africa) I jumped when I saw that this DVD was being released.  As usual, Mariah does not disappoint.  Her voice is perfect and she hits every note on all her fan favourites.  My personal favourite is \\"My All\\".  Not only is it my favourite Mariah hit, but it's this concert's best performance.  The stage is also great and the Californian crowd rocks.  There's a great segment during which Mariah sings a couple of songs on a small stage in the middle of the crowd.  This girl sure loves her fans and it shows, that's what makes seeing her live so special.  Other big stars such as Mary J Blige and Alicia Keys sure could learn something from that.  My only problem with this concert is the diva's costumes.  I'm not the conservative type at all, but Mariah was a little bigger than usual at this stage of the tour and the costumes doesn't do her justice at all.  During the opening sequence she wears an outfit similar to Britney's MTV Performance and it just doesn't work.  But that's just my personal opinion.  If you're a Mariah fan you'll love having this DVD and watching this amazing vocalist and performer over and over.  Viva Mimi!
B000WMEAKC|5.0|If you have ANY doubts about buying this album....DONT HESITATE! I absolutly love every single song on the CD! I can almost count on one hand how many albums I have that I can say that about. They are an awsome group. It's one of  those albums you can put on and just let play, sit back and enjoy! I almost didn't buy the album, espically after buying Timberland's CD since their breakout song \\"Apologize\\" is on his album as well. But that is actually a remix. On OneRepublic's album is the original version, which I actually like better! I am VERY happy that I decided to pick up this album. AWSOME! You won't be disapointed!
B00000IMYA|5.0|Not just the famous solo, the REAL Newport concert lives up to it's legend in every way. And the CD engineers have made it sound indeed like a genuine time capsule to yesterday-when giants did walk the earth. (To even concieve of taking two surviving recordings of a 50 year old jazz concert and creating TRUE STEREO) is true genius, and to actually be able to pull it off... They turned an abomination into pure gold. Should be in the collection of every jazz and/or blues fan. So it has a few bum notes.. big deal, it's a LIVE recording of a genuine event of historical and legendary proportions.

0140182829|5.0|John Fowles once wrote that \\"'Le Grand Meaulnes' belongs to, and is the finest example of, a category of fiction that has no name, but exists.\\"  Indeed, describing this book as a story about growing up or the pains of love, while apt, would be somewhat inaccurate and misleading.  If I were to compare it to anything else, the only other work which comes to mind is Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby' - the two novels feature (to a certain extent) similar themes and \\"great\\" characters faced with similar challenges.  Yet, what makes this work so unique is the way in which it beautifully captures the bitter-sweet and almost surreal transition from childhood to maturity; that fleeting time when the lessons of adulthood are the most poignant and most difficult to bear.  One of those lessons, which the characters of this book struggle to come to terms with, is that sometimes the things you loose are gone forever.  'Le Grand Meaulnes', Alain-Fournier's only novel, is a beautiful and haunting masterpiece, definitely worth reading.

B000ULQV0W|1.0|This CD is billed as \\"the soundtrack\\" to the movie.  Not so.  Key contributors have neen excised from the CD and it's left pretty much as an Eddie Vedder solo project.  The movie benefited greatly from the terrific harmonica work of Charlie Musselwhite, for exemple.  Charlie's nowhere to be found on \\"the soundtrack.\\"  This may be a very good CD, but I'm disappointed that other musicians who made significant contributions to the film had their work treated so cavalierly.

I had the book for a week now, so far, I made Janice's baked ziti (I didn't have time to make the Sunday Gravy that's why I made Janice's it was quick and the sauce was good (minus the peas), however, I added more basil and garlic--you can never have enough garlic), then I made the roasted chicken with lemon, garlic, and oregano--finger-lickin' good; and the Biscotti Regina Cookies--we made total pigs out of ourselves, afraid to make another batch; and the pastina with ricotta and the Pineapple ricotta pie--pure comfort food and simple. When I get some nice peppers, I will make the egg and pepper sandwich. Need I say more? This cookbook compels you to make food and enjoy with friends.... thanks Carmella, thanks Artie

B00005JPS9|4.0|If you're talking about something that's fun to watch, this 3-D retread of the ancient legend of Beowulf will fatten your eyeballs.  Every scene is designed to pop, each bloodied lance, or spurt of drool, or lashing claw will jerk you back in your seat.  And, miracle of miracles, the glasses, once removed, don't leave behind the optical ache that was caused (in me, at least) by the typical blue-red lenses.  Oh, the swoops through snow-crusted limbs!  Oh, the spinning vertigo of a mid-air dragon battle!  Oh, how sumptuously do Jolie's lovely lady lumps rise, laminated in what looks like golden pancake syrup!<br /><br />Other than neat-o special effects and about as much titillation as you can get in something rated PG-13 (the moral of the story seems to be that even the most powerful and bravest men are no match for a strategically nude Angelina Jolie), does the movie have much to offer?<br /><br />The story, to anyone familiar with \\"classic\\" literature, is your typically post-modern retread of the hero-legend Beowulf.  Aging king?  Natch.  Unearthly monster?  Check.  Young, proud warrior?  Ditto.  Complex internal struggles?  Eh, well, not so complex, but, yeah, they're there.  People interested in authenticity, in whether the film stays true to the original tale, will be delighted to know that there's a lot here you can complain about.  Light up the blogs!<br /><br />The rest of you will probably be entertained.  The movie capitalizes on the captured-movement technology employed fruitlessly in \\"The Polar Express.\\"  The humans are still the least realistic thing about the movie, but they have a bit more fluidity to their expressions than you'd expect.  Character actors, like Hopkins and Malkovich, bring a handsome amount of energy to their parts (the portly King Hrothgar and his right-hand weasel, Unferth, respectively).  Others don't fare so well.  I didn't recognize Robin Wright Penn until halfway through the movie (her Queen Wealthow seems to have lockjaw), and Jolie (as Grendel's morphic mother) relies exclusively on that pursed, come-hither look she's perfected over the years (she could probably get a patent on it).  But who's looking at her face?  (She puts the [ahem] back in \\"classic!\\"  Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!)<br /><br />The story tries to explore all the avenues of misunderstood pain (Grendel's monstrous motivations are pitiable and make him less a villain than a tragic figure) and natural human weaknesses (the dragon has a single weakness above its heart; Beowulf's weakness is a little further south).  The exploration is fun although a bit too thorough; the movie runs about fifteen minutes longer than it needs to.<br /><br />That's okay.  Gaiman's script is as florid as everything else Gaiman has ever written (Roger Avary, Tarantino's long-time artistic foil, is co-writer).  Zemeckis's directing is as scrumptuous as (most) everything else he's ever directed.  And, like I said, even when the story gets long in the tooth, 3-D viewers can still amuse themselves with the perfect roundness of the pebbles, the layered beauty of technology, and Jolie's smooth, flawless, perfectly arrayed ...<br /><br />Uh.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|Al Gore has the talent of public speaking and presenting problems in a way that the public can understand.  While I do believe we have a problem called Global Warming, I also see that this documentry was enbelishing a bit for the sake of drama.  I was glad that I watched this show, but was sorry that I actually bought it, since I won't really have a reason to watch it again.  Worth a watch, not worth the ownership.
1582701709|4.0|There is wisdom in this book. The first chapters are great mirrors to hold up against your own thinking. Are my views expectant of good? Or negative and limiting? The noble qualities are mentioned later, that are needed in life to empower these principles. Mere selfishnes,or inordinate greed for more material goods don't cut it. The author says that the book is based on the New Testament. The chapter on visualization borders on will, not faith.   \\"The most important question any human being can ask themselves is 'Is this a friendly universe?'\\" quoth Albert Einstein. (Is God really Divine Love?)  Are all things possible, and are there really no limits to good ?

B000PHX8C0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Devildriver. They are truly one of the best modern metal bands out there today. Their latest album 2007's &#34;The Last Kind Words&#34; is without a doubt the band's meanest, heaviest, and best album thus far, and it's also one of the best metal albums of 2007 that I had the pleasure of purchasing and I don't regret it one bit. I bought this album a couple of months ago, and I just love it, I can't stop listening to it. This album is without question an absolute menacing, thrashing, pure headbanging metal assault on your senses from beginning to end. I also like to consider this album to be the final nail in the coffin of Dez Fafara's nu metal band Coal Chamber as well. Everything on &#34;The Last Kind Words&#34; is just simply awesome, the lyrics, the musicianship, the vocals I mean everything on here is awesome. The production by Jason Suecof is just flawless. Dez Fafara's vocals on here are just absolutely menacing, vicious, visceral, and all out raging throughout. I'll be honest, I've always liked and admired Dez's vocals alot better here in Devildriver than in Coal Chamber. Guitarists Mike Spreitzer and Jeff Kendrick are definitely at the top of their game on this album. Their riffs and leads are absolutely ripping and highly technical, and YES they even fire off solos too, and they both do really good at it too. Jon Miller's bass is good, and of course John Boecklin's double bass drumming is just flawless and downright pummeling. Every song on &#34;The Last Kind Words&#34; are just excellent especially the fierce, pummeling opener &#34;Not All Who Wander are Lost&#34; (my favorite song) which features some fast breakneck drums, raging riffs, menacing vocals, and a pair of awesome melodic solos, while the next track &#34;Clouds Over California&#34; has driving riffs and double bass drums, an addicting chorus, as well as another great solo. Other favorite songs on here include &#34;Bound by the Moon&#34;, &#34;Horn Of Betrayal&#34;, and &#34;These Fighting Words&#34; which starts off with a slow, mounting energy build up before blasting in with a barrage of headbanging riffs, scorching leads, and killer double bass drums. The chorus is very addicting too, while track six &#34;Head on to Heartache (Let Them Rot)&#34; features an absolute catchy driving drum beat and catchy driving riffs as well as some more awesome solos and another catchy chorus to boot. Another one of my favorites &#34;Burning Sermon&#34; has a bouncy, moshing drum beat with some machine gun like double bass patterns, booming riffs, and some brutal visceral vocals from Dez to boot. &#34;The Axe Shall Fall&#34; is an excellent closing track that features some catchy chugging riffs, a killer melodic solo, some more solid double bass drum patterns, as well as some nice soothing bass, plus a nice organ in the background, and a nice rocking drum beat near the end.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. Not All Who Wander are Lost - 10/5 My favorite song<br />2. Clouds Over California - 5/5<br />3. Bound by the Moon - 5/5<br />4. Horn of Betrayal - 5/5<br />5. These Fighting Words - 5/5<br />6.

B000VR824S|5.0|I attended the Crossroads Guitar Festival in Chicago this past July.  In fact I know the people who worked on the DVD of the show, editing it and mixing the audio.  In answering the comments about the exclusion of the Jeff Beck version of \\"Day In The Life\\", they were not given the track by Beck and his manager.  It's as simple as that.  The track may have burned on the day and the edit of it was awesome but, in the end, that didn't matter. The choice was out of the hands of the producers, promoters, record company and laid squarely in the hands of the Beck camp.  Maybe someday it will wiggle it's way off the shelf onto a future DVD release of \\"Crossroads Guitar Festival - The Rehearsals\\".  There is a whole other day of footage of these artists working up the material for the next day that is simply amazing material.  One can only hope...
B000NDEXOI|5.0|I grew up listening to Skid Row, Cinderella, Ratt, Motely Crue, etc. Anyone who listened to such bands will love this album. It has the greatest songs, plus some of the others you may have forgotten about. It definitely brings back the great memories of the 80's hair metal scene.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|Sean Penn's adaptation of Jon Krakauer's book Into the Wild retells the story of 22 year old, college graduate Christopher McCandless.  In a journey that took him to the farmlands of North Dakota, the rivers and mountains of Colorado, the sand beaches of California, and finally, the wilderness of Alaska, McCandless searches for life's deeper meaning. Drawn to the powerful story, Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder wrote and performed the soundtrack.<br /><br />Most motion picture soundtracks feature songs from a variety of genres and performers. Into the Wild is one of only two exceptions that I can recall that feature only one musician (the other being the acclaimed soundtrack from The Life Aquatic with songs performed by Seu Jorge).  Inspired by the story of McCandless, Vedder captures the feeling of the film with eleven tracks that he wrote specifically for the movie.<br /><br />With none of the first six tracks exceeding three minutes, the first half of the album breezes by. Despite the briefness, the first half is quite good as it unfolds the story of our heroic wanderer McCandless and shares the experience of escape while offering an explanation of why he abandoned his past life. The first song, Setting Forth begins the journey with the chorus ringing with hope, \\"setting forth in the universe.\\"  #2 Ceiling and #3 Far Behind offer an upbeat look at McCandless' journey as he stands high atop mountains and paddles his way down rivers.  Track #4 Rise resonates of past regrets and future hopes with lyrics such as, \\"...gonna rise up, turning mistakes into gold.\\"  Track #5 Long Nights offers the listener its first glimpse into regret.  Vedder's steady and deep voice resonates heartfelt despair and loneliness reminding us that McCandless' journey was a fatal one.<br /><br />The album is capped by the upbeat and inspirational seventh track Hard Sun. Corin Tucker accompanies Vedder with her beautiful voice that makes the listener feel that McCandless is going to be ok and the world is a beautiful place full of hope and opportunity. As bright and cheerful as Hard Sun is, the next song Society is the polar opposite. Making a statement that sounds more like a question Vedder sings melancholically, \\"society, you're a crazy breed. I hope that you're not lonely without me.\\"  The dark mood continues on End of the Road.  By now, we know of the fateful end McCandless faces. Yet, even with death hanging overhead, End of the Road has a bittersweet ring to it. Although simplistic, the lyrics are somehow deeply philosophical stating that, \\"(I) won't be the last, won't be the first....it's alright and all wrong...we come and we go.\\"  The album's last track, Guaranteed, is the perfect ending as it offers hope and promises of a future that will undoubtedly be troubled, yet still worth the journey.<br /><br />Vedder's emotion-filled voice, carefully crafted songs, and inspired performance make this album well worth the price of purchase. It is rare that a song can make you feel an emotion so real that you feel the experience is your own, however Vedder's compositions do exactly that...eleven times. Through heartbreak, despair, sadness, hope, love, and death, the songs tell the journey of a young man that sought a higher and deeper meaning to life. I think that we can all relate to that on one level or another.ul place full of hope and opportunity. As bright and cheerful as Hard Sun is, the next song Society is the polar opposite.

B000X9PNOG|5.0|This version that was released in the US is only one disc and unfortunately does not contain the bonus documentary, In Search of Paradise.  The documentary gives an amazing and informative look at his creative process.  I would recommend buy the European version for the documentary  This concert video is excellent.  It is clear to see from this DVD why he is selling out shows after 30 years. He is an amazing singer and performer.  He puts his heart and soul into every song that he sings.  He performs all of his greatest hits from the Bat Trilogy albums.  The entire band, Neverland Express rocks.  This is definitely a must have for any fan of his music.  Anyone who loves rock and roll performed at its best would also love this DVD.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Excellent.  The real pleasure I get from this albumn is passing it onto my younger friends and family.  There's just enough creative lisence taken, along with the selection of songs to catch me and those I take great pleasure in influencing, by surprise.  As time goes by, we realize just how lucky we were to be there when the Beatles arrived on the scene.  They truly are remarkable masters of their art.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I just bought the album and I got to say that it's quite upbeat and different Duran has ever done. Although I admit that there are times this looks like a Simon Lebon solo album it reminds me how catchy the musical arrangement is. We're in the 2yk decade and there's a lot of pop rubbish on airwaves and this music perhaps better and more playful than the pseudo emotionless lyrics other generated bands can come up with. Tho I'm not a Timbaland fan because of his sound he did produce interesting computerized sounds in tracks like: Nite Runner and Skin Divers. Kudos, it's catchy and now I think I'm going to check out his previous projects (this is coming from a rock music fan).   Danja Hills has a very similiar style to Timbaland but I think in some of the tracks Danja did do on his own showed (Dirty Great Monster, Tricked Out) sounded raw with a bit of pop sound to it... quite a treat... I do hope the scrapped Album \\"Reportage\\" comes out next year.
B000BHHVPO|3.0|This is a 4-DVD set, which takes some of the performances from most of the Live 8 venues.  Performances by a number of the \\"big names\\" who performed at the nine Live 8 venues appear here (there's about 10 hours of material).  This is a good set for a starter, to get a good cross-section of the artists and venues.  However, DVDs have been issued for at least some of the individual venues; so if you're more interested in getting a whole DVD of one of the venues, it's worth checking to see if the venue you want has been issued individually.
B000QUCNP4|3.0|While the movie was okay. I thought that it could have been 45 minutes to an hour shorter. It just seems to me that they dragged the conclusion out too long. I have to wonder whatever possessed anyone to make a movie about a murderer who was never caught anyway... I mean, there is only so much \\"meat\\" you can put into such a movie to make it interesting. To be honest, I really didn't like it, but it was okay.
B000005Z0G|5.0|The reason I say 2Pac shouldn't have released this album is because I think if he knew how much it would have been passed over he wouldn't have let it out. There is so much raw and real effort and emotion 2Pac infused into every track on this album from 'Holler If Ya Hear Me'-the video raised pores back then; to the interlude 'Something 2 Die 4' into the prophetically named 'Last Wordz'. DJ Akshun and Special Ed add one of the most ill tracks for 'Pac to spit on:'Guess Who's Back'. 'Keep Ya Head Up' is the perfect prelude to the murderously dark title track, 'Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...' that is easily the gem of the album...Here 'Pac gives a glimpse of the Makaveli on the threshold within threatening to emerge- akin to Anakin Skywalker beginning to give way to Darth Vader- following with the exquisitely crafted 'The Streetz R Deathrow' that leaves the listener winded from the killer one-two 'Pac serves up before he pulls a cold one from the fridge for you with 'I Get Around' with tru homiez Money B. and Shock G of Digital Underground. 'Pac next stuns you to tears with 'Papa'z Song' that embodies a piece of all our childhood fears and disasters and is in my personal Top 3 Hip-Hop tracks. All in all I consider this album the beginning of the end of the 2Pac who could be diverse as the humanity he was trying to change on any subject and the prelude to the ascendance of 2Pac/Makaveli who saw enemies in the mirror of All The Eyez On Him; plunging him deeper into inner isolation and workaholicism. After this album I mourned the loss of such an individual that touched so many and couldn't save himself from himself.
0743486285|5.0|I was in my teens when Motley Crue first came out and for whatever reason I wasn't into them too much and did not until a few years ago when their bio \\"Dirt\\" came out respect them as a metal band but after reading Sikki Nixx's  (as he refers to himself) bio I was blown away by this totally honest, hell raising autobiography. I didn't even know he and Vanity were even an item and back then I was all \\"Princed\\" out and thought I knew everything about him and his gaggle of gals. But her cracked out burlesque whooping it up nature indeed matches his own. I loved this biography - it's sad to think of him shooting up in the closet but anyone with a drug history will not be able to help but laugh and think of their own nightmarish experience's as will \\"straight heads\\" who may be too horrified to read on...ROCK ON Sikki NiXX - I have a newfound respect for you and your sobriety - you are a true success story - which goest to show you - if he got out of it alive - anyone can - now go out there and JUST DO IT!! I cannot profess enough love for this autobiography - it is remarkable!
B000VI70WM|5.0|I was a little apprehensive when I first listened to this new Duran Duran CD because I am not a fan at all of Justin Timberlake and I was concerned that he would ruin Duran Duran's sound.  I needn't have worried.  This seems to be a new and re-invigorated Duran Duran.  Simon LeBon's vocals are stronger than ever.  Both John and Roger Taylor seemed to have added a few tricks to their already impressive bass and drum playing skills.  Nick Rhodes continues to amaze me with his synthesizer wizardry.  I have been a fan of this band since the very beginning and continue to love all of their music to this day.<br /><br />I love every track on this CD.  I must have listened to it 10 times or more since I bought it.  If I had to choose, the standout tracks would be Red Carpet Massacre, Zoom In, Skin Divers, Nite-Runners,In The Valley, Tempted and of course the awesome first single, Falling Down.<br /><br />This CD is a must for any true Duran Duran fan, but the kids listening to the latest hip music would also love this CD as well.
B000NVL9FQ|5.0|Having worn out many LP copies of this album, the Shout Factory cd is a sonic emprovement over the previous Victory or Rhino versions. Only thing better is the Japanese reissues mentioned by the other reviewers, if you can still find them. If not, this version sounds great to me, although the other Shout Remasters sound much better than this one for some odd reason.This album totally was a revelation to me as a teenager in the 70's. It still is. Emerson was the Beethoven of our generation. A+++       Ricky in KY.

B000NVIXFK|1.0|Is this the last Rush album?  I don't hear any passion or technical excellence from Alex Lifeson's guitar or Neil Peart's drumkit.  And Geddy Lee is bulking up on keyboards again, tsk tsk.  His vocals have a whimper & whine that gets on the nerves.  The mastering & mixing is below average.  The sound is mushy, the songs are featureless.  Vapor Trails signalled a downward trend.  Snakes and Arrows confirms it.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Fantastic \\"blue background\\" cinema-- taking real actors and making them inhabit \\"bodies to die for\\". Lots of fantastic action scenes; basically true to what really did happen, as far as historians can be sure, and visually stunning.  The movie's success laid the background for \\"Beowulf\\", now in theatres.  Great fun!
B0002XNRG4|4.0|I have owned this lens for a year. It has amazed me that coupled with instant ISO changes, I can take virtually any photo in natural light without flash. IS is the true beauty of the lens. I recently traveled to the south pacific and there discovered that I am able to take photos after dusk at sub 1/40th sec. exposures with absolutely no blurring. The results are stunning. Optically it is not the best lens I own, but this IS the workhorse lens for my EOS XTi. Once you experience the superior IS there is simply no going back to std lenses.

THANK YOU FOR A GOOD WONDERFUL  READ!!!!
0385339100|3.0|I just got done with this book and though I found it captivating, I somehow got the impression that Grisham hurried it through.<br /><br />*WARNING*: If you havent read the book (and want to), dont just read on... this review WILL spoil it for you<br /><br />First, I am not a lawyer, so.. can somebody explain to me how the tapes are admissible in court? Arent they protected by attorney-client-privilege. The lawyers werent co-conspirators in the plan to defraud the company and the government, they simply schemed to cover up the truth as any lawyer is entitled to. Just Sandy's word (admissible? \\"Mostly yes!\\") wasnt good enough for me.<br /><br />Second, if Lanigan was tired of running and wanted out, why the hell would he scheme to get caught by Stephano's goons and almost get killed? Why not just dial up the FBI and negotiate like he finally did anyway IN CAPTIVITY. Did he actually plan on using the shock therapy as ammo in his negotiations? Oh well, that would make for a 200 page book... never mind.<br /><br />Third, (remember WARNING above), if Grisham wanted to throw in the shock at the end he could have atleast made it a bit twistier. I was expecting it, but I thought it would be something like... they dig up the grave and lo and behold there IS a corpse badly decomposed and all (and Lanigan's credibility is so badly hit that he's hardly in a position to argue or prove that it isn't Clovis)<br /><br />Basically, the book was unbelievable as somebody else here pointed out. Atleast the end could've been different.
B000E33VWW|4.0|I liked the movie so much that I purchased it, and I also read the book \\"In Cold Blood\\" because of seeing the movie.  Both ended up really sad to me.
B00009W0WM|5.0|There are so many reviews on this movie, I'm not sure why I feel the need to add my two cents worth, but I'm going to, anyhow. This is possibly the greatest American made movie ever produced. Humphrey Bogart is, well... he's Bogey. If that's not enough you can skip this now. Everything about this movie is outstanding. It's the \\"perfect\\" movie! The DVD quality is excellent with a ton of bonus materials that will give you more information than you would ever think imaginable. This is a great movie for men & women, so bring a date along with you!
B000025OTV|5.0|This is my first experience with this singer. He obviously has been around. He is a great interpreter, and even though I don't speak French, the emotion is solid.  Better late than never.
0736063684|5.0|This book is simple to understand and the illustartions are great.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B000WMEAKC|2.0|I really like Apologize...i found it on Myspace a year ago and just fell in love. I think the great thing about this song is the strong melody and straight forward arrangement. The album could have benefited from more of this kind of direction. However the rest of the album is horribly overproduced.  The lyrics are cliche, overlydramatic, or unmemorable. It's like 12 songs about basically nothing. I never really noticed how much his voice sounded like Chris Martin's...and stretched out over the course of an entire album it's painfully annoying. really dissapointing. sorry.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I haven't seen it with my father yet but I plan to because it really means a lot to me and I expect he'll like it as much as I do.<br /><br />This movie tells a wonderful story of a sons love for his father. It's a story about family that grows into a murder mystery plot similar to what you might see in one of the Law and Order shows with only a minimal Science Fiction flavor.<br /><br />Wow, thank you for letting fall into another world and be entertained for a couple hours. Every time I see this movie I walk away with a new sense of love and peace with the world.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a very moving movie. With all that is happening with global warming these scenes might never be available to us again.  I will treasure these wonderfull epic scenes forever.<br /><br />Thank you......<br /><br />Shanara
0066620996|5.0|I have read several books on this topic, but this one stands out. Jim Collins academic background is very apparent in his approach. It is refreshing to see a more rigorous approach, compared to many other books that are based on personal experience, intuition, and opinion. Highyl recommended.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|There are some albums out there that are so good you tell all your friends about it, and this is one of them.  The songs are different, interesting, and energizing.  The last thing I want to hear is the same song with different lyrics 10 times.  I hadn't heard of this band before, and hearing this album made me go back to their previous albums which also had some great tracks on them.  The only oddity on this CD is the last two tracks.  The second to last seems kind-of like an experiment, and the last track is country I think.. It's good, but I'm not sure it fits with the first two tracks which are AWESOME if you like heavy metal.
B000VNMMRA|4.0|Upon the release of Live Free or Die Hard I refused to see it. I have no problem with movies being PG-13. A great movie is a great movie regardless of the rating. But the previous 3 Die Hard movies were R-rated and when FOX decided to have the latest Die Hard movie PG-13 I refused to see it. My $10 didn't mean anything; with or without my money the movie would be a hit or flop, but for me it was just the point. The DVD release, which is Unrated is the R-rated cut.<br /><br />It's been 12-years since Die Hard: With a Vengeance and I was a little worried how Live Free or Die Hard would come out, whenever a franchise is resurrected after a long period of time it doesn't always seem to work. Of course there are always gonna be exceptions, but I can't help, but get that feeling of unease. With Live Free or Die Hard I personally found it to be a mixed bag. The biggest problem for me is it feels like every other action movie out there since the Michael Bay era started.<br /><br />Ever action scene has to be bigger and better and storytelling seems to take a backseat to the action sequences and CGI. The first 3 Die Hard movies were very well done. That was back when Hollywood was still able to produce great action movies. At the end of the day the Die Hard movies are mindless fun, but they actually have a plot to go with the action scenes.<br /><br />The screenplay by Mark Bomback was alright, but it lacked the creativity and originality of the previous 3. The script feels like the typical Hollywood blockbuster and the Die Hard movies were more than that. The first half of the movie actually doesn't really feel like Die Hard. It seems like the script was written as another action movie and the executives at FOX decided to make it Die Hard 4. Just change the name of the lead character to John McClane and there you go. The 2nd half though the screenplay improves a bit and starts to feel like a Die Hard movie. But the wisecracks McClane says in my opinion seemed a bit forced, Bruce Willis sells them, but they just seemed a bit forced from a writing stand-point.<br /><br />Director Len Wiseman seems to be hit or miss with the audience, a lot of people say how bad of a filmmaker he is. I have to disagree; filmmaking is more than just storytelling. Obviously, that is the most important part of being a director, but a lot more goes into it. Len Wiseman is the perfect Hollywood filmmaker. He knows how to craft a movie for the mass audience. Live Free or Die Hard might lack in storytelling, but the movie is well made. What he lacks in storytelling skills he makes up for in being able to craft a well made movie.<br /><br />The action scenes are a mixed bag. They don't come out nearly as well as the previous 3 and at times a little too over the top. Now I know you're probably thinking I must be an idiot for saying that since the previous 3 weren't exactly realistic. That is true if you want realism the Die Hard series aren't the movies to watch. But the job of the filmmakers is to make us believe the unbelievable. And to be honest I just couldn't buy into some of the action scenes. They were over the top like the previous 3, but I just couldn't buy into it like I did with the other Die Hard movies.<br /><br />That's not to say the action scenes were bad, by no means were they at all, but I just felt they didn't work as well and maybe a little clich&eacute;d. The action is mostly good and they are fun to watch, but I just feel as if they didn't work nearly as well as they could have.<br /><br />The acting was quite solid and honestly that is what elevates Live Free or Die Hard. Timothy Olyphant makes for a good villain. His performance was solid even if his character was lacking a little bit. And Maggie Q also does a solid job. Her fight scene with McClane was classic. The villains were good, but not as interesting as the previous 3.<br /><br />Mary Elizabeth Winstead was excellent in a small, but vital role. Her character of McClane's daughter Lucy appears early than is MIA until the final act. Originally Britney Spears was a possible choice and Jessica Simpson had an audition. Thankfully neither of them got it. I would have liked to have seen Winstead in a bigger role, but regardless I greatly enjoyed her performance. Cult filmmaker Kevin Smith has a small role and nearly steals the show.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is still giving it his all as John McClane. His performance was excellent and Justin Long steals the show as Matthew Farrell. The reason this movie worked so well was due to Willis and Long. The two really worked well together and give a lot of life to their characters. Willis and Long are a bit clich&eacute;d, even though Justin Long isn't a cop in the movie it does sort have that buddy cop vibe going for it. But the two really do great together.<br /><br />The main reason I'm giving Live Free or Die Hard 4-stars is simple; there are flaws and I personally think it's the weakest of the series. But the movie is entertaining. There is enough action and wisecracks to keep the viewer entertained. Live Free is never boring something is always happening to keep the viewer interested. Even though I feel Len Wiseman may not be the best storyteller out there his scenes do run at a good pace. The pacing never lags and the plot always moves forward. Another reason for the 4-stars is also due to Willis and Long who really do elevate the movie.<br /><br />In closing, while Live Free or Die Hard might lack in overall storytelling compared to the previous 3 and while the action scenes are good they do lack compared to the others, Live Free or Die Hard is still a well made and entertaining movie that moves at a good pace. While as a fan of the series I have to say it was a major letdown, but there is enough going on to keep the viewer entertained.Spears was a possible choice and Jessica Simpson had an audition.

B000F7CMRM|2.0|Sound sucks. Plot sucks and hard to follow story.  How hard is it to produce a well known plot? (Oil companies own the governments of the world.)
0060555661|4.0|very good and I liked it alot i'm just start investing and I' throughly enjoyed it........
006112429X|5.0|Kevin.  The emblem of what.  Of a side of today's society gone wrong?  Too easy an explanation.  Or perhaps too simplified.  The \\"truth\\" is a prism with different sides, depending which way and by whom it's looked at.  The way I perceived this whole story, he was born feeling unloved and misunderstood, even in his baby's days.  His parents, from the very beginning, even before conception, had different ideas about starting a family, but it is extremely hard to pinpoint the multiple issues which led to the final, tragic events, precisely because there are so many (issues), many of them subtle.  Also, it's harder still to \\"understand\\" because, after all, Kevin had everything.  A good family, home, background.      It is through his mother's words that we learn his tale.  This book is written in a letter form where Eva, the mother, desperately tries, painfully but squarely, to analyze the past in the hope to find an answer.  But, is there an \\"answer\\"?  It all depends.  It is for the reader to try and draw a conclusion, just like Eva did.  She tried.  But that's all she could do.  Because what her son did, deliberately murdering so many people, so viciously, just goes beyond comprehension.    There's only one thing that I personally did not understand about Eva and Franklin, her husband.  Both cultured, and aware of their own antagonizing perception of Kevin's problems, why didn't they seek any help?  Not in view of the tragic magnitude of what happened later on, which probably nobody could have foreseen, but because it was CLEAR that Kevin was emotionally disturbed, throughout his infancy and whilst growing up. I cannot but wonder.    Something in the opening notes touched me and I quote \\"A child needs your love most when he deserves it least\\" (by Erma Bombeck).  I think it is so true.  Yet, how does one find the strength after something like this?  The fact is, these things happen (as we have too often learned from real-life stories).  And to try and \\"make sense\\", anysense, is just incredibly hard.  My conclusion?  There are many answers, many reasons.  Yet there are none.    A tough, immaculately written book that I won't forget easily.
1580176941|5.0|Totally beautiful! Fantastic colors and ideas! Got this for my sister for Christmas, I know she will love it!!!
B000UFAURI|4.0|It's classic Foo Fighters.  If you like the other Foo albums, you'll like this one.  It's that simple.
B000VBJEEG|1.0|This movie really draaaaaaaaaags in spots and is boring.  Too many monologues by the main character.  My kids get bored with it.
B0009X766Y|5.0|Great depression era story of grifters (Robert Redford), con men (Paul Newman), crooked cops (Charles Durning) and mobsters (Robert Shaw).  Throw in an FBI agent (Dana Elcar) to twist the plot and complicate things for the con men, and you have a great movie.  Lots of Scott Joplin rags played the way they should be.  Mobsters don't like it when their numbers runner gets ripped off and the grifters vow revenge when one of their own is murdered as revenge for the ripoff.  Great sets and music and keeps you guessing as to who's conning whom.
032147404X|5.0|Very \\"user friendly\\" book. If you don't have the time to read through a lot of theory and just want to know how to get a certain type of shot this is the book to keep handy. Great for beginners!
031286504X|5.0|This is a GREAT book. Mr. Matheson really draws you into the bleak and terrifying idea of being the last \\"normal\\" person on earth. What a great writer!
B00026W82U|5.0|THIS IS THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU PUT ON WITH A CUP OF COFFEE AND SIT WATCHING THE SO CALLED LIFE YOU WERE CALLED TO.    IN SHORT IT IS A WONDERFUL ALBUM.
B000ZK3YDK|4.0|I saw this on HBO one day when I was bored and couldn't find anything else to watch.  NOT a Justin Timberlake fan(in fact, I really didn't know who he was!), I expected to be amused, maybe.....instead, I was totally impressed- by an incredible production on the scale of a major Broadway musical: the staging; the choreography....and yes, the songs. This is an extraordinary performance, by an extraordinary talent. It took my breath away. I no longer \\"laugh\\" at Justin Timberlke.
B0000041ZT|5.0|Good price, item arrived as described and very promptly. I would buy from this merchant qgain.
6305161879|5.0|This is probably Cleese's best work, post-Python and post-Fawlty Towers.  It's still hilarious today, and it has something that most modern comedies don't even come close too...consistency.  Almost every joke works.  There isn't a dull moment in the entire film.  It is meticulously done by John Cleese and Charles Cricton.  Cleese wrote the screenplay, and Crichton directed it.  Crichton is best known for the great Ealing comedy The Lavender Hill Mob (which is a wonderful film starring Alec Guiness).  I really like the digs that Cleese gets at the expense of Otto, here portrayed brilliantly by Kevin Kline.  Kline is so reminiscent of the pseudo-intellectual babbling that permeates many parts of our society today.  The scene where Wanda (Jaime Curtis) berates him for pissing off Archie Leach (Cleese's character, and Cary Grant's real name) is my favorite scene in the film.  Jamie says the line \\"apes do read philosophy, Otto, they just don't understand it\\".  Many read, many watch art films, important films, read big books, but don't understand a damn thing.  But Otto is so naturally stupid that his pseudo-intellectualism is funnier.<br /><br />All of the players here are excellent.  Kline won a best supporting actor Oscar for his role (one of the few times a comedic performance won), and Palin is wonderful as K-K-K Ken (as Otto affectionately calls him), the killer who loves animals.  The film gets a bit nasty, but then it's British, so this is to be expected.  This film, despite a modern setting, is really reminiscent of Crichton's Ealing comedies, and I think that's what makes it very funny and special.  There's a real craft at work here, and it makes all modern comedies look like amateur theatrics.
072325804X|5.0|This is hours and hours of great reading and all for a fair price.  It is so expensive to build a library for your children these days.  This is a great way to get dozens of books as one.
B000U1ZV44|4.0|not critically acclaimed but i found this movie entertaining none the less. i like movies to take chances and this one does mixing a who donit suspense thriller with a sci fi twist. the blu ray video transfer is excellent and the audio will not disappoint.
B000ZBEOF6|5.0|This movie is one of the most creative musicals I've ever seen.  Julie Taymor has produced, what will surely become one of this decades most celebrated and cherished musical love stories.  Across the Universe is a somewhat subversive and yet heart touching story wrapped up in a package of timeless Bealtes classics, all sung by the cast on screen.  All of the actors are phenomenal singers, and each cast member weaves their way through the story perfectly.  A MUST SEE and MUST BUY for beatles lovers and art lovers alike!
B00005JLPK|5.0|This is one of the best films of the decade: unique, passionate, brilliantly acted, directed and designed. It is a stunning masterpiece from first to last, a tribute to the magnificent painter and the superb actress who plays her. The cast is beyond great. Each plays his or her part with gusto. Selma Hayek plays with all her heart, a brave actress with rare skill and beauty. Molina is terrific, of course, as are all the players, large and small. I loved Rush as Trotsky, but the real star of this film is the director who, with her design team, has made one of the most visually stunning films of the century. It is so gratifying to see Mexico so well represented on film, so glorious in all its facets. The Kahlo house, of course, is a palace. What an enchanting little masterpiece of architecture. The music, the food, the clothing...it is a great advertisement for a life and a way of life.
B000006TRV|5.0|[[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall (Deluxe Packaging Digitally Remastered)]]-------What can I say? This double CD is really a top musical document.It's a reference which all musical lovers and investigators should have.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|Many songs I've never heard before.  That's the best part for me.  The second cd is the best.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|November 21, 2007- just received this in the mail and had to watch immediately. WOW - a fantastic restoration that takes your breath away - the picture's clarity is truly amazing.  You can tell painstaking efforts were taken to restore this historic piece of silent era German cinema.  Combine this with the original score rendered in 5.1 and I can honestly say this is an awesome experience to watch and listen.  The film score adds so much to this film it's hard to believe the difference.  I have seen this movie so many times with various scores, including the very good BFI version with a great James Bernard score(Horror of Dracula fame).  This one outshines it.  If you love this movie, you owe it to yourself to get this version....you won't be disappointed.
B000UK73QO|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing.  If every human being read this- and acted as such- our world would be utopia.
