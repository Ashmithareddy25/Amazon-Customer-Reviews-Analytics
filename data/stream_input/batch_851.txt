B000E41MRC|5.0|I am a huge fan of early Documentaries.  Like the internet is doing now, Film was the first way to truly unite the masses.  Film allowed someone with a message to distribute it to as many people as they could.  The biggest difference now is that the Internet can allow you to reach the masses CHEAP!!!      Leni Riefenstahl was a female Film Director in Nazi Germany.  This film was commissioned by The Fuhrer himself.  The techniques that she used were later duplicated by Legendary American War Documentary maker Frank Capra.      This movie chronicles the 6th Nazi Party Congress at Nuremberg and is clearly meant as pure German Propaganda.  It does not depict ANY scenes of violence against any persons.  Instead, it is aimed at the German people and it's youth as a device to draw support.
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Clint Eastwood reminds me of wine.  The older he gets, the better he becomes.  This is certainly the case for \\"Gran Torino\\".<br /><br />The essence of the film is that Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a curmudgeonly old man who has just buried his wife.  He now lives alone in a Detroit suburb that is changing before his eyes.  Most importantly, a new wave of immigrants from South East Asia, the Hmong, have come to prominence.  Walt can neither  understand their language nor their culture.  He is steadfastly stuck in an earlier era.  He has also become estranged from his two sons  who see their father as needlessly difficult and unyielding.  He is alone except for his father Labrador dog.<br /><br />Walt is drawn into the Hmong community when he settles a neighbourhood dispute.  He does this through the  barrel of a gun!  Shades of Dirty Harry.  But Walt is more than such a one dimensional character.  With time, he comes to appreciate his Hmong neighbours and grows closer to them than his own family.  Coinciding with the above, Walt is an ongoing dispute of sorts with his late wife's priest who is a naïve young do-gooder with little knowledge of the real world.  Walt has no time for his late wife's faith.<br /><br />The contrast between Walt and the Hmong is handled well.  It leads to Walt being a better man.  He is happy to assist them and they return his efforts with gratitude.  It wasn't always like this as a young Hmong man, Thao, was instructed to steal Walt's beautifully maintained Ford Gran Torino.  The young man repents and the relationship with Walt grows from this point.<br /><br />If I was to have one criticism of the film it is that its end is somewhat overdone.  It could even be called corny.  This is a pity.  \\"Gran Torino\\" has so much to offer.  Yet, despite this point, Cline Eastwood has excelled as produce r, director and star.  And this from a man of 78!  May his future years continue to be so productive.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|I missed this in theaters, but this dvd is well worth watching for its procedural approach to a famous case I knew nothing about. The performances are first-rate, but the sound is a little muddled. The period soundtrack is cool. There's the usual serial-killer vibe going on, but the movie overall maintains its pace and intensity without overkill or gross-out scenes that go on too long. Intelligent movie.
B000002OX5|3.0|Snaked this ALBUM out of the old man's retired record collection because and only because of the cover one of the best band covers in rock and roll history which is saying something, anything.

A little nostalgia for the old folks: happily jack odor oh no as a song bed to humm her and insert a product link.
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|Much has been written about Elbow since the release of their Mercury Prize winning 4th release 'Seldom Seen Kid', that I just had to buy this album out of curiousity. Many say that they are underrated but surely the masses vote with their feet and the cream always rises to the top. I cannot speak for their first three albums as I have not ventured that far as yet, but the 'Seldom Seen Kid' collection definitely has me yearning for more. For a start, the album is well produced and the songs well crafted. On first hearing, two tracks stood out - the brilliant 'Grounds For Divorce' and the beautifully arranged 'On a Day like this'. But, the album gets better with every listen and I find it rather infectious. This album is better than good and maybe Elbow are getting the deserved praise that was long overdue.
B0006L0LOS|3.0|CATWOMAN    When I first heard about this movie I was excited to say the least, I mean Halle Berry as Catwoman who would not want to see that? So I waited to see the film wanting for it to hit theaters because up until that point every Catwoman in film, TV show, animated, and comic has been great and wonderful characters. So with that knowledge I just knew this was going to a good movie, once again Halle Berry as the Catwoman. Of course like most people I was a little disappointed with the outcome of the film and the over all finished product. I feel like this was not the movie that should have been made but at the same time this is really not a bad movie. Take away all prejudice and expectations and what you get is a fun little new take on Catwoman and a fun little movie.     The film is about a struggling over worked yet very good looking woman named Patience Philips [Berry], did I mention that she is attractive, really a beautiful woman. She is stressed out along side her friend Sally [Alex Borstein] who encourages her to find a man, it shouldn't be that hard. One day she notices a cat out on a ledge outside her apartment and decides it is up to her to save it, while on the ledge a detective is driving by a sees her on the edge. Of course he thinks she is suicidal and goes up to save her, this sets up our romantic ach of the story. One day while at work she forgets to take something to her boss so after a deliver service says they can't do it she heads to the address on her own. When she arrives at said place she hears something she should not have and is literally flushed away, she dies under water. The cat that she tried to rescue sees this and calls upon the cats of the city to help revive her, much like previous Catwomen. So the hunt is on to find her killers and bring them to justice, DC Comics style, or something.     Much like people have said about this movie I agree that there are problems with this film, key word being film, as in filmmakers. The scriptby Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and John Rogers was lagging in a major way. The first problem with it is that most of the characters seem flat and that is most likely due to the even flatter dialogue. Plus I am never one to hate on a bad story line [just check my other reviews] but for something that had a theatrical release with a big budget and stared an Academy award winning actress I kinda felt like it need more then this. For those who don't know this movie is about an evil cosmetics company that is releasing a product that will not kill you but it will mess up your face. I don't know about you but that seems like a police matter not a super hero thing, that's just me though. Also director Pitof just seems like he didn't know what to do with this movie, of course that could also fall back to the script which every director has to sign off on. Another thing that I just can't let go of is the CGI scenes of Catwoman running on the walls, don't know why but I don't like it.     Of course I did say that I kinda like this flick though right? Well the answer is yes and that is for two reasons, Halle Berry and the rest of the cast. I will start with the rest of the cast and save the best for last, so here we are. I really believe that the cast saved this movie from being a total waste with the performances they gave, which I feel were not that bad. Take into account the script they were given to read off of and then watch it; they actually pulled off some good performances. Benjamin Bratt as the cop she falls for does a good job with what he is given and same can be said for Lambert Wilson as her boss. Alex Borstein is excellent as her best friend is one of the few characters that seems to be some what three dimensional or at least very entertaining. But I have to say that Sharon Stone steals the show with a very nasty mean performance, hope that doesn't spoil it for you. Now on to one Halle Berry who can never do wrong in my eyes, at least not do ahorrible job. I do have to say that I think she did a good job with what she had, she strikes me as the type that reads as written [I think I said that right]. The first half of the film when she is normal she does a brilliant job and every thing seems natural [all except that not being able to get a boy friend thing] but it is in the last half as Catwoman that the cracks start to show. Of course she does a good job and is extremely sexy as the cat, but her lines they gave her are straight horrible at time. Of course I can forgive that because she is gorgeous and probably the hottest Catwoman ever, although I can see the argument for others [when they played the character]. But over all she did a great job and looked great doing it, man she is beautiful.     Over all this actually better then most people give it credit for, even with its flaws that are many. I know I made this sound pretty bad in an earlier paragraph but with no expectations going into this and you will enjoy it. Sure it was far from a classic but so are other movies that seem to be enjoyable, this is one of those. A movie does not have to be great to be good it just has to be good enough to be entertaining.

B001GKJ2E8|4.0|\\"Wanted\\" was a movie that I really wanted to see last summer, but didn't get around to it. When I finally got the DVD last week, I was really excited to watch it. Then I snuggled down with my wife to watch it, she had me turn it off after a few minutes, so there are some down sides. First, the laguage is terrible. Second, there is some absolutely meaningless to the storyline sex scenes that we could have done without. Third, (and this is what I expected to be the only downside) it was a long way past being farfetched and silly, but I didn't mind that.<br /><br />So what did I like? When the story got going (when I watched the movie later) it was a lot of fun and the effects and stunts were very cool and exciting. The plotline, while silly, was interesting after the hero was finally ready to accept his destiny. And; of course... A.J. is always so amazing to look at, that believable comes in a far distant concern.<br /><br />3&½*
0679721037|5.0|Haunting.<br /><br />There are no simple conclusions to reach, regarding the use of the atomic bombs against Japan. This is still a highly controversial and painful subject for citizens of many nations around the world, as the effects of war remain with us for so many generations afterward. The very attempt to discuss the events of Hiroshima (and Nagasaki) is like traversing a path mined everywhere by trip wires which are difficult to avoid and easily triggered.<br /><br />Hersey's work here recounts the experience of Hiroshima survivors, the horrors of what the people in Hiroshima lived through, on that day, a horror the world rightly continues to grieve and mourn, and to fear greatly the potential for repetition. Hersey's Hiroshima was the first to personalize the experience for Westerners, the first to tell the story to the West from the perspective of those who lived and worked in Hiroshima at the time of the bomb.<br /><br />Moving. Disturbing. Highly recommended.
B00102F5WK|4.0|How much you enjoy rendition will largely come down to your political and ethical feelings about the war on terror.<br /><br />As for the acting and the writing and directing, it is a great movie, and perhaps I am an old paranoid patriotic American, but I found the message, that America is evil, not quite accurate or helpful while we are at war. But I am sure that there are millions of people who will resound with the message.<br /><br /> 4* for effort and execution, and 2 1/2* for the message.<br /><br />But that's just me.

B001OLY03W|3.0|Having successfully put the Cold War to rest, John le Carre has now turned his attention to the War on Terror.  In many ways it is an interesting book; in others it is unsatisfactory.  Well-written as one would expect of this author, it really skirts the issue of Muslim militancy and terrorist acts.  It is more symbolic than a penetrating insight into the subject, as has been previously demonstrated in his espionage fiction.<br /><br />The characters are wooden puppets, symbols in a preconceived plot.  There is a has-been banker, an idealistic young female lawyer, a Muslim illegal from Chechnya who escaped prison and torture in Russia and Turkey by way of Sweden and Denmark, and all kinds of representatives of German, British and American intelligence services: all playing a role in a drama that is only barely explained.<br /><br />The story takes place in Hamburg, the city from which (a) the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers was plotted and (b) at least one mastermind left for New York City.  The setting is selected to demonstrate that steps must be taken to counteract acts of terrorism.  But, however harsh these steps may or not be and whether or not they are necessary, the novel addresses the problem in a perfunctory manner.  Not up to the usual le Carre standards, but a fairly good read nevertheless.

1439102813|5.0|In this powerful debut novel, Alice Howland is a 50-year-old cognitive professor at Harvard and a world-renowned linguistics expert. One day while out jogging, she finds herself lost in Harvard Square unable to find her way home, though she is just a mile from her house on a route she has traveled every day. This is just one of the memory disturbances that she has noted she is having on an ongoing basis. Soon she can tell that these moments, which are coming with increased frequency, are not ordinary --- and they are disturbing.    Trying to figure out what is going on, Alice does a quick Google search for \\"menopause symptoms\\" and quickly sees that scattered thinking and memory lapses may be caused by a lack of estrogen. She notes to schedule a doctor appointment and shuts down the computer, thinking she has this solved with some relief that there can be a quick fix. Alice is used to confronting problems just like this: identify the problem and find the solution.    But somehow it feels like this might be something a bit more. While she muddles on trying to keep her life on course, the fractures and fissures in her memory become more real. In one chapter, she stands before her class to give the lecture she just spent 45 minutes preparing for and realizes she cannot recall the topic she has prepped to deliver. An eager student answers her question about the subject from the syllabus, and she proceeds with the lecture. Thinking that the day is on course, she gets home and is relaxing when her husband comes in and asks, \\"Aren't you supposed to be in Chicago?\\" She had completely forgotten a business trip.    Though the idea frightens her, she knows this issue of her memory is far deeper than menopause and asks her gynecologist for a reference to a neurologist. After appointments and tests, she comes to realize that the diagnosis is far more dire than she thought, and it will not be cured with a few hormone pills: she has early-onset Alzheimer's disease. She is told sheneeds to bring someone to her appointments lest she not capture all the details of what is being shared with her. She also is told that she may not be the best judge of her own limitations and that someone other than her should fill out the paperwork on the state of her mind. Her world starts spiraling around her.    Struggling with these ideas, Alice fights these thoughts, not wanting to accept that she is losing control of her life. She thinks of filling in the paperwork on her own and shows up at meetings alone as her doctor chastises her for this. Suddenly, in a moment that she has not planned, her story tumbles out as she tells her husband John what has been going on. He is stunned for a moment and then recalls a party where it was clear she was not connecting on what was going on. He knows in a moment that life has changed with those two words, Alzheimer's disease, but also recognizes like a smack to the head that the world shifted a while back but he just chose to ignore it.    The disease progresses swiftly, leaving Alice and her family struggling with an unraveling of the world that they have come to know. Where she was the anchor who held the family secure, she now must lean on her husband and three children to keep her safe. They need to pull the threads of her life together. They need to know where to find her when she does not even know she has become lost.    In due course she must give up her work, which is closure on a particular thing she loves, a piece of the world that defines her. At the same time, John is offered opportunities that he feels he must take, which again remind her what she is losing. Frustrations build, and the tensions that were bubbling beneath the surface rise quickly. The emotions that swirl through these pages will tug at readers as they identify with Alice and her struggles. For Alice, the simplest pleasures like jogging and cooking become chores that need assistance. For a woman who valued her independence, her dependence nowis palpable.    Alice is bright enough to know that the end here is not going to be pretty, but she fights to keep control of her world, grappling for control as long as she can. In what becomes a ritual for her, she answers five simple questions on her BlackBerry each day. In answering these questions, she reassures herself that things are still status quo. But as the reader watches, a word changes in her standard simple replies, followed by the phrasing, and then the correct answer becomes completely muddled; while she feels the answers are right, we see she is losing her grasp. When the day finally dawns that she cannot even understand the questions, let alone give the answers, Alice moves to the next step that she has noted on her BlackBerry --- one that she wrote herself directions for back when things just had started to dim. She goes to her computer and finds the file called \\"Butterfly\\" and follows the instructions there.    STILL ALICE has an authentic voice and a pitch-perfect tone even as Alice loses control of her own words. Lisa Genova, the author, is a trained neuroscientist who understands the science behind Alzheimer's from a clinical point of view, but she also comprehends the personal tragedy that accompanies one losing a loved one who is standing beside them as her grandmother suffered through Alzheimer's. Told through Alice's lens, the book has a personal feeling to it that could not have happened as well in third person. I know what Alzheimer's is, but this story gave me a lot more insight into exactly what it feels like. While I have a better understanding of friends who are coping with their parents' travails with the disease, reading Alice's story where the disease struck someone so young made me want to live life and enjoy it with renewed gusto since I saw just how fragile the line between whole and broken can be.    In case you cannot figure this out, STILL ALICE grabbed me from the first page. I kept reading knowing I was not going to getmuch done until I finished it; I kept saying one more page, one more chapter, until the book was completed. A friend was traveling with me a few months ago and showed up late to cocktails. She walked in apologizing and saying, \\"I just could not put down the book I was reading.\\" When I asked what it was, she told me it was STILL ALICE. We started talking about it since we both had the same reaction. And I have thought of this story over and over these past months.    There's something else to note about this book. It's being simultaneously released in hardcover and trade paperback, a very smart move by the publisher, ensuring the opportunity to get this title into as many readers' hands as possible, no matter what format you prefer. Both versions have a reader's guide and an interview with Genova that gives terrific background to the book. STILL ALICE will prompt conversation; it's a perfect book club book. I dare you to finish this novel and not turn to someone to talk about it.        --- Reviewed by Carol Fitzgerald
1932907009|5.0|I have read all the classic screenwriting books, but this is the FIRST book I've ever read that has truly shed light on story structure for me. And it's fun and funny too!  Eureka!  The book uses clear examples from many kinds of movies to show how to create characters we care about, navigate through the thorny mass of act two, and create a great pay off in act three.  It explains genre, log lines and titles (and how to write good ones), and provides a concise set of beats to follow in strucuturing a story.  Far from being limiting, the rules in this book will set you free to create, all the while knowing that you have solid ground underfoot.  It's so inspiring, after reading so many dry and boring (and overly complicated) books on screenwriting, to FINALLY have someone explain screenwriting with such humor, clarity, and insight.  Reading this book, you'll suddenly realize that the \\"secrets\\" of story structure are now easily within your reach.  You'll feel like you have a funny, supportive friend guiding you through the process.  You'll be jazzed to get to work on a new project, or rewrite an old one using your new set of tools.  And you'll never write -- or watch -- movies in the same way again!
0312383320|5.0|One day, life is normal and you're a single, attractive female bounty hunter babysitting a friend's monkey and chasing down bail bond jumpers in a used Jeep armed with a can of mace and a set of handcuffs. You come home looking forward to a night of pizza, beer and TV with your boyfriend. The boyfriend has left a message on your cell phone that he is babysitting his kid brother who has been kicked out by his wife, so he won't be over. Then you spot a pair of strange men's boots in your living room and 6'3\\" of blonde, blue-eyed muscle sprawled on your bed.    Stephanie Plum is a hunk magnet. She already has Joe Morelli and Ranger, two of Trenton's most eligible bachelor law enforcement types, wrapped around her little finger. Morelli and Stephanie have been an item since they were in high school. His family and hers consider it a matter of time before they make it legal. They have nearly made it to the altar twice, but life gets in their way.    Ranger, the mysterious Cuban surveillance company executive, could be called \\"life\\" as in life force, but he's not really the problem. In fact, Morelli has Ranger pretty much pigeon-holed in Stephanie's life as a colleague. He's dangerous and great backup in emergencies and was a potential threat as a romantic rival at one time, but Morelli and Ranger have sorted things out where Stephanie is concerned. Mostly. Then there's Diesel. He has everybody spooked. Who is he? What is he? And how does he walk through walls? Diesel tends to show up around holidays. With Stephanie's help he defused some Christmas elves who got out of hand, a not-so-lucky leprechaun, and a romance writer with larceny in her lonely heart.    He is the designated plug puller on a class of super-human individuals known among themselves as the Unmentionables. There are rules of engagement among Unmentionables, but when one of them gets carried away, tosses the rule book aside and jumps the fence, Diesel is summoned to fix things. Since Diesel and Stephanie have worked together on a couple of incidents, he takes Stephanie's hospitality for granted. This time, it's Diesel's close relative, Berwulf Grimoire, aka Wulf, who has come up with a plan to control the world's climate.    One of Stephanie's bail jumpers is a nerdy physics whiz named Munch, wanted for stealing a magnetometer from a Trenton lab. When she and her sidekick Lula try to collar the skinny little guy, he nips out the pet door of his house and the chase is on. It turns out that the magnetometer Munch stole is exactly what Wulf needs to complete his weather control device, hidden in a secret facility in the Jersey Barrens, a wildland just outside Trenton.    Anyone who has read a Stephanie Plum novel knows that as soon as her latest set of wheels is introduced, something ballistic is in sight and her insurance rates are going up again. Using the Jeep to navigate the Jersey barrens in a monsoon storm proves to be an adventure for Stephanie, Carl, the pet monkey in her charge, Lula and a number of woodland creatures, leading to a classic Stephanie Plum demolition derby event.    Morelli quite literally phones it in during the three-day madness when Stephanie is in more danger than ever before at the hands of the murderous Wulf as she pursues Munch through the Jersey Barrens. Out of cell phone range and the car with Ranger's tracer left behind, Stephanie is left to her own devices in the forest primeval. If, after reading this book you are tempted to go out and get a pet monkey as cute as Carl for a pet, think twice. Just because Carl can play Super Mario Brothers on a hand-held computer doesn't mean they all can.

031606792X|3.0|Like many reviewers, I enjoyed the first three books.   Breaking Dawn held me at arms length. I just couldn't get lost in this book like the first three. *SPOILERS*  What I liked were the conversations between Jacob and Leah, the transformation of Bella, and part of the story told from Jacobs' point of view. Jacob has a distinct voice, and I loved the chapter titles.   I didn't like the fact that I couldn't relate Bella's life changing experiences to my own.   How many people have a baby and and look fabulous, have a more passionate love life than before, no in-law problems and show no stress of adjusting to parenthood?  Bella is dying while her body wastes away and is being destroyed, yet betrays no sign of despair, doubt, or fear. Jacob's presence was the perfect opportunity for her to express these feelings away from her too patient caregivers.  I did suspend reality, I really tried, but I couldn't believe Nessie. I couldn't believe Charlie's \\"need to know basis\\".   There was no touch of bitter to balance the sweet.

B000H7JD4A|4.0|Iron Maiden's \\"A Matter of Life & Death\\" is a very good CD, in my opinion one of the best if not the best metal record for the year it came out. But something is rather different in listening to this album. Musically, it's your typical Maiden, but gone are the energetic horse gallops heard in songs like \\"Run to the Hills,\\" \\"Powerslave\\" or \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\" - the songs seem to march instead of gallop. There's still plenty of great guitar riffs and melodies on this album, as well as Maiden's most progressive output to date with many of the songs reaching 6-8 minutes. For the most part, Maiden fans have something to enjoy on this album: solid up the irons heavy metal despite the band beginning to show age. Not really a too bad of a thing because these guys still now how to deliver after years in metal! UP THE IRONS!
B0013FSL3E|1.0|If you believe this is a kid's movie, then it clearly was made by people who don't have kids, and marketed by people who don't have kids.

B001KMB6X2|1.0|Maybe it was the fact that the movie did not meet my expectations, or maybe it was the fact that I wanted to see more in a Vin Diesel Sci-fi movie (like Chronicles of Riddick, Pitch Black), or in a action/adventure thriller (like XXX). Whatever the reason, I was very disappointed in Babylon A.D. You had everything that should have made this a fantastic movie...decent actors, a plot with potential and great special effects, but you didn't have a plot that was well executed and nothing really original. There were several bites off of other sci-fi movies, with no real twists or variations. And at the end of the movie, I just felt a little cheated.     Toorop (Vin Diesel) has been asked to deliver Arora and her guardian/protector, Neolite (Yeoh) from a convent to the US. Apparently the younger woman has something that everyone wants and what it is you have to sit thru several brilliantly choreographed fight scenes, sizzling special effects to find out. However, although you will find yourself mildly amused and entertained, you will also find yourself looking at the person next to you and saying,  \\"did I miss something?\\" or \\"did I fall asleep\\"?  Perhaps better plot execution would have made this movie more appealing to the average Sci-Fi lover.

The earlier translation used \\"mother\\", but that did not quite capture the less formal word used by Camus, and Ward chose to use the French word for lack of a good English equivalent.<br /><br />It is important to appreciate that Camus is not Meursault, the book's hero who opens himself up to the \\"benign indifference\\" of the universe.  Camus was a progressive who joined the Communist party in the 1930s and who heroically fought in the French resistance during World War II.<br /><br />But Meursault does represent the starting point of Camus' philosophy, which is existentialist in nature, though Camus did not like that term.  Meursault never lies; he's a faithful tape recording that accurately recounts the data of various events.  Everyone else attemps to inject all sorts of meaning into these events.  In the process they sometimes twist the recounting of events into lies, though all for some ironic purpose of higher truth.  Meursault rejects efforts to recast events into religious terms.  He rejects conventional morality.  He seems heartless about maman's death by not wanting to view the body, by leaving right away, and by immediately becoming involved with a girl.  Convention required more outward signs of grief and rituals of mourning.  Meursault is not indifferent about his mother, but he accepts her death as an accomplished fact and does not see the sense of mourning rituals and conventions.  He agrees to marry his girl friend not because he accepts that convention or because he loves her, but because she asks.  She seems to inject some meaning into that ritual, so why not accommodate her?<br /><br />All of this unravels when Meursault is involved in a shooting on the beach.  Meursault recounts the data surrounding the event, but he refuses to inject it with any meaning.  He actually had a very good self defense claim, as the glint of the sun may have given him reasonable cause to believe that the victim was flashing a knife.  But he refuses that easy route and, in what the world sees as a bizarre claim, attributes the crime to \\"the sun.\\"<br /><br />Meursault is a great device for demonstrating how meaning is entirely a human construct.  Existence itself is meaningless and even absurd.  But what makes us human is the never-ending quest to superimpose some meaning and purpose on the world.  Camus shares Meursault's appreciation for the absurd and his refusal blindly to accept the conventional meanings we tend to impose on the world.  But he does not share Meursault's passivity and is prepared to state a belief and to fight for it.  Perhaps even Meursault appreciates this at the end when he accepts his fate and hopes to be greeted with jeers of hate at his own execution.  After all, what he did was wrong, and perhaps his life will have some purpose as an object lesson for others.<br /><br />This is a great novel in a great format.it with any meaning.

B000002J0B|5.0|Houses Of The Holy is an absolute MUST!!! Don't believe those people with second thoughts about it... What can be said about stuff like The Song Remains The Same, The Rain Song, Over The Hills And Far Away or No Quarter other than \\"pure genius\\"? This is Led Zeppelin at their prime, which basically means unequalled artistry. Jimmy Page is THE guitar player/producer and what is there to say about the mighty magnificence of Robert Plant, John Paul Jones or John Bonham on this album? This is a band of musicians who dared climbing unimaginable heights. This album has been close to my heart for at least 25 years and it won't go anywhere out of reach any time soon...
B000EULJLU|5.0|Why is it that the main complaint is it that it's too long or not catchy enought, or too contemplative.  This album is like a fine meal, designed to be eaten slowly, consumed with pleasure over time.  Nothing Tool has ever composed was meant to be taken in at face value and tossed away after three minutes.  Every album has what we once use to have back in the \\"old days\\": a theme.  Every album they make has a theme.  Dowloading Tool is simply ridiculous because you will not digest it the way it is meant to be and you will never enjoy it in a day, nor in a month perhaps.  It takes time and appreciation and days where you sit in your living room for hours and just listen in quiet.  Beyonce can be downloaded, she has jingles, which is fine, but don't expect to enjoy such musicianship and yes, they are actually musicians who perfect their craft, to be dumbed down to quick enjoyment.  If you're a Tool, you know what you're getting into, if you're just getting into Tool, you may or may not have the patience for such endeavors, but then again you can always buy Aenima or Opiate.
B00000DD1S|5.0|\\"Live from Greenwich Village\\" is over two hours of rollicking marches, dirges, and triumphant wails recorded live in fantastic sound quality, as you would expect from a major label like Impulse.  For most of the pieces, a beautiful and unique foundation is laid down by the strings - the violin of Michel Sampson and/or the bass of Alan Silva, Bill Folwell, Henry Grimes, and/or Lewis Worrell.  Like Ayler's earlier work, most of these songs are structured around simple march-like themes, but the strings and Don's trumpet lead to a much denser sound.  The album starts at a pretty high intensity, with \\"Holy Ghost\\" and Albert freely improvising over what sounds to me like some sort of vocal droning (but perhaps something else?).  This is followed by a wonderful dirge-like march \\"Truth is Marching In.\\"  The third track is truly spectacular, a deeply emotional piece called \\"Our Prayer\\" that was written by Don Ayler.  Don takes the melody on trumpet, with the violins building and releasing the intensity of the song throughout and Albert lending short punctuated cries on the sax.  Most critics have blasted Don for his lack of \\"technical skill,\\" but the emotional power of this song and Don's ability to convey it are truly moving - I'll take this song over anything Wynton Marsalis has ever done.  \\"Spirits Rejoice\\" and \\"Divine Peacemaker\\" are both triumphant marches with extended, stratosphere-shaking free improvisations.  The final song on the first disc, \\"Angels\\" is a duo piece, Albert with Call Cobbs on piano - it is stunningly beautiful and it is fascinating to hear Albert in this kind of setting.  The second disc begins with \\"For John Coltrane,\\" a moving and fitting tribute to the legacy of John Coltrane, who died in 1967.  The piece manages to be mournful and jubilant at the same time, and for me is a real highlight of the set - although picking highlights from this collection is difficult.  The remainder of the second disc is just as good as the first, continuing to use simple march-like themes as a springboard for improvisation and emotional exploration.

0312360266|3.0|It took me a long time to decide on reading this book. I finally decided to pick it up after one of the teens I mentor suggested it saying she really liked the series.<br /><br />I wasn't really sure what to expect with this novel, to be honest. Which I think is a good thing because I wasn't disappointed once I finished. It was a quick, fun, and entertaining read. I liked Zoey and her group of friends. They were funny, trustworthy, and loyal and very much like the people I hang out with. Minus the whole vampire fledgling thing.<br /><br />I'll definitely check out the sequel(s) to this book.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|I don't write a lot of reviews for Amazon, but I have to leave one for The Fall. This movie is beautiful and boasts excellent performances. We rarely purchase movies and almost never buy Blu-ray. This movie warrants the Blu-ray purchase, though. It looks great and boasts a lot of cool extras.   If you are a fan of the movie, do yourself a favor and buy it on Blu-ray. If you are curious about the movie, definitely check it out.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Yes, it's true. Most of the cast of this (allegedly) musical... can't sing. Strangely enough this is exactly what makes it such a perfect feel good movie. It is quite apparent from the very beginning that they had fun while shooting the movie and some of this fun stayed on the celluloid. All you have to do is go with the flow. Don't judge. Don't count the moments when things go wrong vocally. Don't count the moments when the story-line gets thin. Just let it happen to you. It's OK if you always have full control of yourself and you would never do anything as outrageous as singing in public when you have no voice. Have you ever thought that you might be missing something in your life (OK - your near and dear may actually be quite grateful for your not trying to sing) just because you don't have the courage?<br />Buy this DVD now and keep for the rainy days - it will certainly bring smile back on your face when you need it!
B00006AW2L|4.0|I haven't heard the original U.K. cut, but the U.S. version of \\"Aftermath\\" was a real triumph for the Rolling Stones.  It was the first record composed solely of material written by Jagger and Richards, and it's great stuff--twangy, bluesy, oily, sharp, and crisp as hell.  Richards' guitar sounds like a carriage ride into the underworld.  And even if \\"Paint It, Black\\" sounds like a one-way ticket to that place--which means it sounds pretty darn great--the cat-eyed \\"Under My Thumb\\" is the highlight of the record.  They hadn't quite figured out how to channel their, for lack of a better term, bitchyness yet, so this cut of the album sounds a little too even.  Still, it was the first gem the Stones cut.  And for those who point to \\"Thumb\\" and \\"Stupid Girl\\" as misogynism, Jagger himself said it best: \\"Any bright girl would understand that if I were gay I'd say the same thing about guys.\\"
0446691437|5.0|Remember that classic Roberta Flack song, \\"I felt he'd found my letters and read them all out loud?\\" How this \\"young boy, a stranger to my eyes\\" knew her most inner thoughts? That's how I felt when I read Steven Pressfield's The War of Art.<br />I write about creative people and money, in my experience, my creative friends are often not inclined to pick up the Wall Street Journal or watch CNBC. Along with teaching them the money stuff, I have to convince them that it is actually OK to be good with money. Steven explains that fear of success better than I ever could and tells us how to get over it..<br />[...]<br /><br />What the War of Art does is pin point the reason for our artistic shortcomings, our blocks and fear of success. It names the enemy, exposes its tactics and tells us how to defeat the bastard. That Pressfield can write is a given, back when I was afflicted with golf, I'd read and loved The Legend of Baggar Vance. But who knew that Pressfield, who writes from the Gods, understands those of us afflicted with this creativity thing.<br /><br />Twice in reading this little book I had to put it down and go for a walk because Steven had nailed something holding me back, something I was relying on to hold me back. I hate when that happens. If you want to achieve more in your life creatively or not, just achieve anything, I highly recommend you invest in The War of Art.
B00005BJ9W|2.0|Words resurrected from the netherworld and assembled in a manner that could be called abstract, if Slick Rich could sing it like that.  Musical arrangements as flat and colourless as a razor blade.  Like a razor blade, it seems pleasing and smooth at first.  Then one really listens and discovers that, actually, this baby is nasty, sharp, and dangerous.  Since it's one of the best examples of the soulless, superficially-divine pop of the Eighties, the album's artifactual; but unless this became a personal favourite as you were growing up in that period, just leave it on the shelf--or better yet, in the closet.

0743298039|2.0|This was recommended to me by multiple people. Much like [[ASIN:0316067946 The Historian]], this book seems written to appeal to a certain kind of reader-- Academic Gothic? Something like that.<br /><br />I was distinctly bored and annoyed throughout the book. This despite Setterfield's obvious skill with prose. In fact, her skill made it worse for me, because I kept hoping for more. Her skill was willing, but the plot was seriously weak.<br /><br />What didn't I like about the plot? It feels sort of unfair to say: \\"everything\\", but that comes kind of close as a description. First of all, we are expected to believe that there is a literary fiction novelist who has somehow become a gazillionaire through her writing and who has managed to keep her background entirely mysterious. That's the first thing that we are expected to swallow. Second of all, we're meant to believe that said superfamousrich writer chooses a little known bookish academic to write her memoirs. It is very quickly obvious that these memoirs will include some Deep Dark Sekret which will unfold with the novel.<br /><br />Okay, so that's the set up. Which would be bad enough if the details weren't also so obviously unrealistic and annoying. For instance, the Internet doesn't seem to exist. Research and correspondence have to be carried out by post. This wouldn't be that bad if there were something to indicate that the book was meant to have happened in the past-- but we aren't given any sense of time. I was left with the conclusion that a Google search for information just didn't seem Gothic enough for Setterfield. There were several moments like this where I felt as though the book did violence to my sense of credulity. Just didn't buy it.<br /><br />And the ending-- I just won't go there. Suffice to say that to call it contrived is kind of an insult to artifice.<br /><br />This book is often compared to [[ASIN:0143034901 The Shadow of the Wind]]. I didn't love that book either, but it is head and shoulders above The Thirteenth Tale.<br /><br />I have no idea why so many people find this book so compelling. To my mind it is-- at best-- a reasonably good airplane book which is more or less ruined by its pretensions. Please, Ms. Setterfield, you clearly have quite a bit of talent-- please find a plot/subject more fitting to those talents. I love the Brontë sisters as much as the next person, but this book just didn't work.I have no idea why so many people find this book so compelling.

9569569387|4.0|Overall, a great book - it's one of the earlier versions of The Law of Attraction, so the language is a little stilted, as in books written at this time.  And yes, the reader isn't the best in the world, but I found it worth my time.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|THE ROCKER releases this week and offers a world where dreams come true. Passed over when it was released, never making the ranks of quality films for most critics, it offers nothing less than what most viewers are looking for. Pure entertainment, fun and a chance to escape the mundane world we all live in. Unfortunately, that is not what most critics look for in a movie. Their loss.<br /><br />Rainn Wilson of TV's THE OFFICE stars as Robert \\"Fish\\" Fishman, the drummer for heavy metal hair band Vesuvius as the film opens in 1988. The band has just been offered the big time if they will only dump their wild man drummer. The temptation is too great and after a hilarious dumping, the band heads to the big time and Fish heads to 20 years of drudgery.<br /><br />After losing his job, getting dropped by his girlfriend and having to endure the success of his former band mates, Fish retires to his sister's home until he can find work. His high school age nephew Matt (Josh Gad) plays in a band of his own with several friends called A.D.D.  When their drummer gets suspended and grounded, they find themselves in need of a drummer. Unable to find one on short notice, they elect Fish.<br /><br />All doesn't go well but eventually they begin working together. Songwriter-singer Curtis (Teddy Geiger) comes up with dynamite lyrics that Fish finds amazing. Bass player and attitude champion Amelia (Emma Stone) broods and pines for Curtis but never lets on. Matt dreams of losing his insecurity and meeting a girl. Things would be back to normal with the exception that Matt's brat sister puts in motion a video that will change their lives.<br /><br />Matt has a 4 way online video conference hook up allowing the band to practice at home in their rooms. Non-tech savvy Fish practices in the buff and once the video hits online, The Naked Drummer gets tons of hits as well as the attention of a record company.<br /><br />With the offer to record and then tour, things seem to be going great for both the band and Fish. The band because a young, fresh sound gets the chance to be heard. Fish because he now has a second chance to make his dream come true.<br /><br />But that dream comes with a price. Still trapped in his youthful ideas of the rock and roll lifestyle, Fish attempts to get the kids to be the bad boys (and girl) of rock. But they just want to relax and play X Box after a gig. A few weeks on the road and the bands parents are required to bail them out of jail led by Curtis' mom Kim (Christina Applegate). The only way they will allow the tour to continue is if she goes along as well. Hello mom.<br /><br />A smarmy record exec tries to put members of the band against one another, tries to shape them into something they are not and in general screws things up between this extended family. The result is Fish dumping the rocker lifestyle, cutting his hair and taking a responsible job. The band suffers with his loss. And eventually they come around to bringing him back in the fold.<br /><br />The only problem is that as popular as they've become, their next big opportunity is to open up for Vesuvius at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can Fish put aside his grievances with the old band? Can A.D.D. remain on top? Watch and see!<br /><br />There are a lot of clich&eacute;s in this film. The characters are pat ones. Wilson does a goofball like most actors these days resulting to gross out humor. But it doesn't matter! The film plays for laughs, for fun, for entertainment. Along the way Wilson's character adopts a fatherly attitude towards Curtis, offering great advice he never seems to be able to apply to himself. It makes Fish seem not only the wild man but an endearing soul as well.<br /><br />This is by no means a movie to make others pale in comparison. It is not a classic that will be treasured forever. Oddly enough, I don't think anyone involved ever intended it to be so. So why do critics, written and couch bound alike, choose to hurl insults and disgust at it? Because its not art. Tough luck. Rather than seek art in a film like this, sit back and enjoy the moment. Who knows, you might end up having a good time.is, sit back and enjoy the moment. Who knows, you might end up having a good time.

She flirts with sexual exhibitionism to attract the attention of her distant and uncommunicative father...<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" tries to make a point and the point is that when people can't or won't communicate, unpredictable paths can lead to tragic consequences...

B001C3KCSY|4.0|Each of the four Kings of Leon is distinctly talented. The vocals are powerful and emotional; the guitars sleek and soaring; the rythm section hypnotizing. Working together, the four brethren from southern USA bring all the elements - lyrics, music, instruments, production - into a harmonius whole.    There's real flavour and originality here. Each song has a story of its own, yet by the time you've played the album through, you feel as though  your part of its little world. There's hardly a dull moment.    How to describe the music? Sometimes it sounds like Radiohead, sometimes like Creedence Clearwater Revival. Most of the time its quite unique, especially when considered against the vast majority of current pop music.    Suitable for all.

The movie had some awesome action moments especially the climactic fight scene at the end of the movie.  The only thing that I found disappointing was that the comics described the hulk's power as something that grows exponentially along with his size as his adrenaline rises.  However, in the movie, his size never seems to change and he doesn't appear to grow stronger.  Anyways, it was just a minor detail.  Overall, the acting and CGI were top notch throughout the movie.  I can't wait for a sequel as well as Team Avengers to come out.

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I watched this film over the past weekend, and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm an action flick aficionado anyway, and I've seen every kind of action film you can name. But this one breaks the mold a bit.    There seems to be a tried and true action film recipe for action films, with slight variations in the plot. But Wanted takes the recipe and turns it 360 degrees and shakes it. I'm not going to go through the whole movie blow by blow, others have done that already.    Usually with action flicks you know what's going to happen after the first fifteen minutes of the movie. This flick kept surprising me after the first fifteen minutes. Things I kept expecting to happen didn't, and the things that did happen were given an interesting twist.    And about the 'looms of fate' people have commented on in prior reviews, perhaps the screenplay writer loosely based that idea on the Moirae, or maybe Arachne with her web of fate, found in Greek mythology, even though there was no explanation given in the film.      The special effects were very good. But the things that saved it from being just another action film were the acting, and the twists and turns in the plot. And there wasn't one sex scene in the whole movie involving the hero and the leading actress. That just goes to show you that the obligatory sex is NOT necessary to a good film.    I think they picked just the right actor James McAvoy to play Gibson. The ordinary everyday man who emerges victorious when extraordinary unbelievable things happen to him, and turn his life upside down. It shows us that true strength is not from size and muscle, it flows from the character of the individual.    I guess you can tell I enjoyed this film immensely. It'll keep you guessing until the very last scene.     But just like everything else, everyone likes different movies, so rent it before you buy and make up your own mind.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|What a staggering experience, this film. Like several of Woody's recent scripts it has its own ebb and flow, but his varied musings over the years come together into this sunny little tale that carries you naturally through a mishmash of quietly whimsical characters.<br /><br />And some characters they are! Javier continues to astonish with his versatility. After the eerie gravitas of \\"No Country for Old Men\\", he is sensational here in his buffoonery as an uber-suave artist, just as devoted to an epicurean life as he is cynically convinced of its worthlessness, his deadpan yet extravagant screen presence making him a perfect foil for his perpetual Flirt mode. Johannson is what only she can be, bemused and befuddled, although expect some distance from her usual sultry exuberance as her coolness seems oddly stunted.<br /><br />Rebecca Hall as Vicky, to me, seemed a bit grating in her attempt to fit the glove of a Woody Allen film too snugly, scattered speech patterns and all, but fortunately that seemed to go with the righteous ennui of her character. Penelope Cruz is fiery! I am sure her histrionics in the film will make critics buckle and heave, although I'd venture to suggest that shrieking tour-de-force parts are relatively easier to enact; embodying the ordinary on camera is what presents a challenge. But she is painfully convincing nonetheless.<br /><br />It's the natural groove of these protagonists that makes the film what it is. If I were to nitpick, a couple of aesthetic choices puzzled me. For instance, an omnipresent voice-over starts off giving the impression of being glib and satirical, but quickly becomes run-on, and then abruptly disappears for almost the rest of the film. And then there's the overuse of certain musical motifs that gets a bit repetitive.<br /><br />But the setting is gorgeous and makes up in spades. Spain gets its own visual paean, and what a lyric it is! No cultural stone is left unturned: photography, drawing, music, poetry, food, architecture, fashion. It's a fine ensemble.<br /><br />While it's not your garden variety \\"Juno\\" brand of comedy, there is wit in the evocative undertones. The film oozes something visceral. A comedy for grown-ups perhaps. Whatever your views about  menage-a-trois (or polyamory, or whatever they are calling it these days), the denouement is so natural and so untouched by pat pretenses that it is, well, sublime.<br /><br />I was amazed at how this film came and went so effortlessly, and still managed to turn something in me upside down. If you have an evening to spare it should make for a fabulous time for the tasteful. Highly recommended.chitecture, fashion.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|Saw this twice. Once at Fantastic Fest and recently at an art house theater and I loved it both times (I think I enjoyed it better the second time around!). This film is just too good. Instead of focusing on vampires, vampires play only a small role in this film about adolescence and loneliness... There is no reason anyone with a taste for good filmmaking would want to pass this one up. The cinematography and score were both brilliant. They truly make the often bleak and dreary settings beautiful. You will not want it to end!!    For those who enjoyed the film, the book is much, much better with two more main characters, a completely different climax (which I was hoping made it in the film), and more about Eli's caretaker...
1932907009|5.0|If you are a writer of ANY type of fiction, this book will help you to make your stories stronger. The caption for this book should really be: the last book on storytelling you'll ever need. Because it doesn't matter how well you write, if you don't have a compelling story you won't keep your audience engaged and turning the pages. Applying the concepts in this book made sure my stories are just that ... page turners. What writer could ask for more?    There are lots of books out there on story theory, but they fail to bring their concepts down into the real world and show you how to use them. That's how Save the Cat! is different, and why this book is so invaluable. Save the Cat! breaks down story theory and shows you how to apply the concepts through numerous examples, and with a great sense of humor.    Following Blake Snyder's method of story structure has personally saved me from months of tedious rewrites, because I didn't have the spine of the story locked down at the outset. Every writer should have a copy of this book on their desk. If this isn't the last book on screenwriting you ever need, it will certainly be the one you use the most.
031606792X|5.0|Stephanie Meyer has me wanting to be a vampire.  I don't know if it's the idea of impossible romance, the storyline, the amazing sensory writing or what, but at age 28 I'm in love with this series!!  I saw the movie Twilight with some friends over Christmas for something to do and was a little disappointed.  I thought it was magificently cast, I mean 110%perfectly cast.  However, there were important parts that were left out and or combined into other scenes.  This book was my favorite of the Twilight series!  Bella's transition and the last third of the book really made it for me.  I cannot say enough about the sensory writing that Meyer's does, it's amazing.  If you've read the other books get this one for sure, if you haven't read the other books - get with the program, this is some great writing!!
0312383320|3.0|The between the number books are supposed to be light and fun entries in the Plum universe and therefore I adjust my expectations accordingly. So with this in mind, I know that in a numbers book, Diesel just popping in and out wouldn't fly but this is like sci-fi/mystery/beach reading/shoe sale at Macy's kind of book, right?      Well, its supposed to be.      While this books is better than 14, and believe me that tain't sayin' much, it's still a disappointment.  I was excited to read a new full length Plum book so early in the year while waiting for 15 to be released this summer.  Sadly, this sucker is a novella padded out with fart jokes (two characters!) and Carl the monkey shrugging or giving people the finger.  Also, there doesn't appear to be a compound sentence in the entire book so it reads like an x-rated elementary school essay (complete with all those repetitive grammatical bits that a compound sentence or even pronouns could fix, but I digress).      Yes folks, it was so bad I was noting grammar and syntax.      Normally the between the number books are holiday focused: Plum Loving is set around Valentine's Day, Plum Lucky focuses on St. Patrick's Day, etc.  One would think that Plum Spooky would center around Steph's favorite holiday, Halloween, but they'd be mistaken.  While it's fall in Trenton, there is nothing spooky, ghoulish, or even pumpkiny about the story which centers on Diesel popping in to catch a diet milquetoast Lord Voldemort type bad guy who is employing one of Stephanie's wayward skips.  And the story goes downhill from there.     The characters are largely unrecognizable, caricatures of caricatures, and behave in wholly irrational and implausible ways to simply drive this skimpy plot in the general direction of forward.  Some folks are citing Tank as a prime example of this but since he is a man of so few words we really know so little about him.  In the reviewer projecting on the characters department, I'd like to note that I know guys like Tank - huge hunks of non-verbal muscle masses who see their size simply as a violence/bully/confrontation deterrence system - but are actually great big fluffy bunny rabbits at heart.  Truly, members of my Tank troupe crochet, collect Hummel figurines, bake wedding cakes, rescue & foster critters, and write Hallmark weepy greeting card type poetry.  As a result, seeing Tank in his cute new home with this little furbabies wasn't that big of a surprise to me.  And his passive aggressive treatment of Lula was keeping in the spirit of the whole \\"I hate confrontation\\" vibe of the guys I know.  But that could just be me and the people I know.       For those caught up in the Cupcake/Babe debate there is very little of interest here.  Like the rest of the between the number books, Ranger and Morelli are completely and totally in the background though their reasons for being absent from Stephanie's life are very weak (in the past, Joe's been deep undercover, Ranger's been working out of his Miami office, etc).  Instead we're left with Diesel, who started out his between the numbers career as a hot but somewhat socially inept otherworldly bounty hunter who cares for Stephanie but is now a bullying buffoon who can't take no for an answer and seems unconcerned with the danger or consequences he's bringing to her doorstep.         The only bright side is that we get to see more of Tank and Lula's relationship post engagement but these glimpses are only a few pages out of a 300+page book and hardly justify the price of admission.      Overall, I'd borrow the book and save your money for something else.  For those who feel the need to own the book to round out their Plum collections wait a few weeks and pick up a deeply discounted used volume.  Trust me, there will be plenty out there.
B000FSME1A|5.0|I wish this package came with the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" documentary about the making of the movie, but you can't expect everything.  As it is, this is a five star DVD--a solid five star movie, with compelling extras.  Don't think twice about this purchase; it's a valuable addition to any movie collection.
B000O76TA4|5.0|This was a gift for my future brother in law and he LOVED IT!! This is one of his favorite movies, but he did not own this edition. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who loves the movie or anyone who has never seen it. Why not get the best to start!?
B0013FSL3E|2.0|I got this movie based on the tremendously positive reviews it got.  From the previews the movie theaters showed, it looked like the most ridiculously stupid movie one could ever see. Because of the reviews, I figured I was wrong, so I forced my family to see it.  Surely it MUST be good, if so many other people loved it.  Someone even said it topped Toy Story. Sorry, but i didn't even come close to being as good, let alone topping it.  My whole family thought it was boring and would never want to see it again.  My kids range in age from 12 to 22.  My husband fell asleep, so it's not great for adults, contrary to reviews. We kept waiting for the movie to get better, but it never did.  There were a few scenes that were kind of cute and led you to believe it might get better, but it was one big let down. Not worth seeing.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen for a long while - quite an extraordinary story - one of the most moving I have seen as in some respects it is so believable - nothing is overdone here, and the twists in the plot come thick and fast.  All Suzanne Bier's films are good - The Brothers/Open Heart are two recent ones very much worth watching - but this is even better.  Watch it.
B001M5UDGS|3.0|I am a huge fan of musicals and also a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  After watching \\"Once More With Feeling\\" (the BtVS musical episode), I was compelled to watch Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog on hulu.com.  (I don't have the DVD so I can't comment on extras).    The story is basically a satire on the comic book superhero stereotype, with a few twists thrown in.  I'm not a huge fan of superheros or most comedy, so I wasn't really entertained.  I'm not the person to ask though.    Neil Patrick Harris (Dr. Horrible) and Nathan Fillion (Captain Hammer) were very good.  I expected no less from Harris, who in addition to being an actor, has sung professionally in Sondheim's Sweeney Todd and Assassins.  I was pleasantly surprised by Fillion's singing, as I'm not aware of him having any musical experience.  Fillion stole the show as the swaggering Hammer.  Felicia Day's voice seemed weak and thin to me.    The music and lyrics were decent (worse things have been put on in multi-million dollar Broadway productions), but not as good as \\"Once More With Feeling.\\"  A few songs seemed repetitive.  I would have liked some ensemble numbers, though I realize that was not possible with the scope and funding of the project.      I don't understand all the internet hype about this musical.  It's a decent musical and impressive for the small cast/crew/budget, but I'm who are all these people -- Whedonites?  I suspect that Dr. Horrible is a romp for comic book fans (in the same way The Guild is for MMORPG diehards).  Maybe that's what I'm missing.       I do appreciate Joss Whedon's efforts to bring musicals and small, independent projects to a wider audience.  It's sad but musicals are a dying interest in the US.  Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog is a good introduction to musicals for the superhero nerd but non-musical nerd in your life.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Oh, my gosh, this is the GREATEST movie.  Yes, it's a chick flick but the music from our era is the best.  Can't get enough of Abba!!! And of course, Meryl Strepp is the best actress ever in history and she gives a stunning performance.  The older she gets, even the more perfected her acting is.  There is no role this phenomenal actress cannot carry flawlessly.  And I'm not a Pierce Brosnon follower but he is great in this movie.  And I spent three weeks in Greece last summer ... and the waters are that blue!!! Most gorgeous place in Europe.  It's true:  There are only two kinds of people in the world - ones who are Greek and ones who want to be!  A must see!!!

B001GQ2TGA|2.0|I've been an Enya fan for a long time, and bought every one of her albums....sadly, this one sounded liked everything else recycled.  I didn't even make it all the way through before I turned off the CD player.      Blech.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|I might be making a bold claim saying this is the best Bill Murray film of them all. Many people would call me on that with films that showcase his sophomoric hijinks like Stripes or Ghostbusters. Some may look at his more slightly more refined character works like What About Bob? and Scrooged as their hits. To me Groundhog Day tops them all. This is because not only do you have Bill Murray doing a perfect performance, but also because the content itself (and the writing behind it) takes this movie to the next level.     Groundhog Day is a morality piece done in the vein of a classic Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episode. I kind of \\"what if...?\\" sort of tale that puts a generally successful and selfish man (played by Murray) into a hopeless situation of never being able to escape a single day in a small town. On the surface the story it looks like a situation comedy with Murray's character living the same Groundhog Day over and over. However the further you go into the movie you get some true and believable character development. The fact Bill pulls it off convincingly as well as with his classic entertaining wit is what makes the movie shine.     Don't think of the movie as just some lesson to learn and take with you. While it does have that they don't preach it to you. You figure the lessons out along with Phil (Murray), and that makes for a rather deep experience. The movie at its core is a comedy, and it's such a good comedy it's rating among the top comedies of all time by various film associations. It's not just a comedy either as it also has a healthy dose of romance in it. So much romance that it can pass off as a \\"chick flick\\" for those who are into that. So I guess you can say Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy/Twilight-Zonesque/morality play.     The other actors do great as well, including co-star Andie MacDowell, supporting actors Chris Elliot (as the cameraman), Brian Doyle-Murray (mayor of the city) Stephen Tobolowsky (old high school associate) and others. The movie was directed by Murray's cohort in Ghostbusters and Stripes Harold Ramis, which makes me wonder if the role was made for Bill. Production itself is very solid. You won't find it winning awards for costumes, sets or special effects. At the same time you won't find any production values detracting from the story; they only serve to enhance it.     This 15th Anniversary Blu-Ray Edition is a step up in the visual department from the latest DVD release, but don't expect any night and day differences. Some scenes are still a bit grainy and the color isn't as sharp as you find with newer movies on Blu-Ray. Then again this is a 15 year old movie. The Dolby 5.1 audio is the same as the previous 15th Anniversary DVD release. Then again the movie really wasn't meant to test your sound system. You get a lot of the same features as previous DVDs along with some new stuff. Here's a rundown:    - Needle Nose Ned's Picture-in-Picture Track: Old Ned the insurance dude pops up in the movie from time to time with either some tidbits about the movie or asking you questions about the movie. This feature is a Blu-Ray exclusive.     - Commentary by director Harold Ramis: It's the same one as the other DVDs. Informative in most places and a bit dull in others.     - The Study of Groundhogs A Real Life Look at Marmots: It's virtually a mini-National Geographic special on groundhogs.     - A Different Day: An Interview with Harold Ramis: This featurette has tons more information about the movie. Plus it's faster to sit through than the commentary.     - Weight of Time documentary: Making of documentary with interviews of the cast and crew as well as some funny outtakes by Murray.     - Deleted scenes: Six scenes that total out to about 5 1/2 minutes of footage. Most of the deleted scenes would have been nice to see on an extended mix. Although one 16 second deleted scene I am glad they did without.     - BDLive: For those of you who actually care about this function. It's justa way for you to send content over to friends and stuff about the movie.     This movie is a must have. Any Bill Murray fan should be required to see this movie. The Blu-Ray treatment is only a minor improvement to the previous 15th Anniversary DVD release, but it is a noticeable difference visually. Too bad they are still using the same butt-ugly airbrushed looking cover on the Blu-Ray disk. If you already have the 15th Anniversary DVD that was released earlier this year I don't know if the improvements are enough for the double (or triple) dip. If you have any version prior to that I would strongly recommend taking the plunge and go for the Blu-Ray (provided you have the high definition hardware for it).
B000PY52EU|5.0|I didn't know anything about this film prior too the, obviously, cheap marketing ploys.  I'm another one of those \\"not what I expected\\" blokes.  This is a really thoughtful movie.  Ricci is brilliant and Jackson too.  I've always appreciated Christina Ricci's affinity for the more quirky films (Pumpkin, Buffalo 66, Fear and Loathing, etc).  I thought this was gonna be an attempt at something like that, a failed attempt at that (because of the crappy marketing).  But there are so many different relevant themes permeating this movie is makes for something really fantastic.  It's quite an experience.  Like many, I think the only weakness was Justin Timberlake's casting.  I'm not big on Timberlake anyways, but sometimes I don't mind the guy.  But they could have done a little better with the role of Ronnie, even though Timberlake was okay.  This movie is so many things in one; sinful and saintly, silly and serious, trashy and theological.  All sprinkled with a little blues.  But on the whole, I'd say it's just a very good movie.  Watch it and be pleasantly surprised for yourself.
B000UJ48WC|1.0|Don´t get me wrong, the Shining is one of my favorite movies. I love Kubrick. But I´m sick of the new features that the studios feel they HAVE to include to justify the UPGRADE. In the case of classic movies, the improved video and audio is just enough. If they incluye a new documentary or long lost interviews is ok, but as the disc extras, not, please, as part of the feature film. Or al least, please put the option to play the movie without these escenes.     They include here i think at least 2 new disc chapters. These extra footage is not in the DVD or the theatrical version of the film. In result, the film lost of its timing and rythm. It´s now a little slow paced and has lost some of the mistery of the plot, because of this extra information depicted.    Even Kubrick after the premiere of the film decided to remove all this footage to make to improve the picture. Why the studio decide to incluye these footage after all?
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|DVD arrived in timely manner, and is great quality, good movie! is the latest version!
B000777J2S|5.0|I am a huge lover of music for such a long time and have used Amazon for at least 6 years, especially for the user's reviews of albums to help me decide whether or not I should but an album or artist, but after hundreds of music purchases I never left a written review, of course, until now. That is how much this album has impressed me.     I first heard Antony about 6 years ago in a movie penned by my favorite author Eddie Bunker (AKA Mr. Blue, READ \\"No Beast So Fierce\\") directed by Steve Buscemi called \\"Animal Factory\\", where Antony had a bit part singing a song at a prison talent show (\\"Rapture\\" from his first release). I was always moved by the song, but never motivated to follow through, until about 5 years later, where his voice still had left a haunting impression on me, and I did the research to find out who had that voice left singing in my head.     Again, I turned to Amazon for the reviews of listeners, where the jest of complaint goes towards his \\"vibrato\\", but I was still haunted, so I decided to start at the beginning bought the self-titled album, his first, which I enjoyed, though still on the fence on the \\"vibrato\\" factor, but blown away by the intesity and lyrics, so I was moved enough to buy this album... and then I was HOOKED!!!     Seriously, nothing short of spectacular.     If you have heard of his music and are wondering which album to buy or where to start, this is your album, then you become as obsessed and I have, and love that beautiful voice, as well as appreciate the long lost art of the EP the he has mastered, then onto the other projects that he has lent himself to like with Bjork, Hercules and Love Affair... even a cover of \\"I'm Knocking on Heaven's Door\\" on the \\"I'm Not There\\" Soundtrack.     If you have a soul, you will be possessed.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I saw this film at the theater the night it opened.  I had never seen the Broadway show, nor had I ever heard the soundtrack.  The movie was sold out, and at the exact second the closing credits hit the screen the crowd broke out in a thundering applause.  I don't remember the last time that happened at a movie theater!  This movie is fun for the entire family and if you get the DVD, you might as well order the CD along with it.
0132350882|3.0|I just finished Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. The book is compilation of patterns on writing clean/maintainable code and is written by uncle Bob and other folks from his consulting company Object Mentors including Tim Ottinger, Michael Feathers (author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code. This book is similar to Implementation Patterns by Kent Beck I also read recently. As opposed, this book is a lot more thick with seventeen chapters, however there are also lots of tedious listing of Java code.    The first chapter gathers thoughts on good code from a number innovators and authors such as Kent Beck, Bjarne Stroustrup, Grady Booch, Dave Thomas, etc. They mention various attributes of good code such as easy to read, efficient, DRY, focused, literate, minimal, error handling and warn of bad code that leads to messy code or broken windows mentality.    The chapter 2 talks about golden advice of using intention-revealing names to improve the readability and following principle of least surprise. This chapter denounces use of hungarian notation or member prefix such as _ or m_.    The chapter 3 describes functions and methods and advices to use small, cohesive functions. It suggests using one level of abstraction to facilitate reading code from top to bottom. It also recommends using polymorphic methods as opposed to switch statement, if-else or functions that take flag/boolean arguments. The chapter discourages functions with side effects or the one that create temporarl coupling. This chapter also mentions an aged old advice of command query separation, though it skips its roots from Bertrand Meyer's design by contract. Finally, this chapter urges use of exceptions as opposed to error codes.    The chapter 4 describes writing good comments that focus on intent and dissuades against redundant and misleading comments.    The chapter 5 illustrates use of good formatting such as identation, horizontal, vertical spacing, etc.    The chapter 6 describes use of objects and data structures. It encompasses advice on polymorphism, law of demeter, encapsulation, DTO/value objects, etc.    The chapter 7 discusses error handling. Again it encourages use of exceptions rather than return codes or error codes. It prohibits use of checked exceptions as it violates open/closed principle. It also discourages returning or passing null and recommends exceptions or empty collection instead of returning null.    The chapter 8 describes boundaries between components.    The chapter 9 describes advice on unit testing such as TDD, keeping tests clean, one assert per test, single concept per test, etc.    The chapter 10 is similar to chapter 6 and contains recommendations on writing classes such as encapsulation, classes should be small, single responsibility principle, cohesion, dependency inversion principle, etc.    The chapter 11 encompasses advice on building systems and managing complexity. It suggests dependency injection and use of factories. It also advocates use of AOP for managing cross cutting concerns.    The chapter 12 talks about emergent design, the concept I first heard from Andy Hunt. This chapter describes advice from Kent Beck: run all tests, refactoring, no duplication, express intents of the programmer and minize the number of classes and methods. This chapter advocates use of template methods to remove duplication and command/visitor patterns to express design to other developers.    The chapter 13 discusses concurrency. It suggests use of single-responsbility principle to keep concurrent code separate from other code, limiting scope of data, keeping threads independent, and use of immutable oobjects or copies of data. It recommends keeping critical section small. The chapter also holds advice on testing threaded code and suggests making threaded code plugable.    The chapter 14 encompasses an excercise on how to incrementally improve code.    The chapter 15 describes JUnit framework and walks reader through improving tests.    The chapter 16 walks reader through another refactor excercise.    The chapter 17 encompasses a number of smells, heuristics and antipatterns. It deters use of poolrly written comments, builds/tests that require more than one step. The chapter prohibits passing too many arguments to functions or use of output/flag arguments to functions. It encourages testing boundrary conditions and respecting overridden safeties. It also proscribes writing code at wrong level of abstraction, i.e., exposing low-level logic through interface. The chapter also forbids exposing derivatives to base classes, having too much information in interface. Other smells include artifical coupling (sharing constants), feature envy (coupling formating logic), flag arguments. This chapter also holds advice of Kent Beck about using explanatory (local/temporary) variables. The chapter recommends use of constants, structure over convention, encapsulate conditionals, avoiding temporal couplings, keeping functions at same level of abstraction and keeping configurable data at high levels. The chapter also contains Java specific is advice such as avoiding wildcards in imports, avoiding use of interface to inherit constants, etc. Finally, the chapter cautions against insufficient tests, use of coverage tool, testing boundary conditions, etc.    In conclusion, this book contains advice from wide range of authors on writing good maintainable code. Finally, I would also caution against using these practices mindlessly as another favorite rule of mine is that every practice or pattern depends on the situation. Unfortunately, there are lot of people in software industry including uncle bob who use these rules in draconian fashion such as always stressing on 100% test coverage or always keeping interfaces separate from implementation (DIP). Such advice may bring more money from consulting work or publication, but is disingenuous for practical use.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|If you are looking for this to be like the first \\"OZ\\" then you should look elsewhere. Very creative and an interesting story, but much darker and \\"over the rainbow\\" type singing. I personally really like it, but nothing like the original.
0312383320|5.0|I love Carl.  He reappears from the last book right at the beginning of this one and is delightfully with us all the way through.  I see the between the Numbers books as even lighter fare than the Numbered romps.   Deisel is always bigger than life and any book including Ranger is sexy to me.  These between books seem to be even more over the top than the regular ones, and crazier.   Suspend reality and enjoy the ride.

0671799320|5.0|The new edition costs the same.    Yergin's prize-winning history stretches from the first Pennsylvania oil rush in 1860 to the crash of world oil prices in 2008, and it all reads like a novel. Well, not quite. The epilogue, which covers the period after the Gulf war in 11 pages, skims along ten times faster than the rest and feels a bit more like a history lesson. But it gives you a balanced view of recent events.    I bought the original version as I started researching energy. Two full bookshelves later, I can tell you, no other book in this field holds a candle to it for fascination and information. I've read complaints about what it doesn't cover so here are some alternatives, but if you want tales of the way greed, ignorance, and cleverness respond to natural wealth and, in turn, shape world history and current global politics, this is your book.    For oil geology and exploration, read [[ASIN:0691141193 Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage (New Edition)]]. Oil industry nitty-gritty: [[ASIN:0767916972 Oil on the Brain: Petroleum's Long, Strange Trip to Your Tank]]. What to do about OPEC: [[ASIN:0981877508 Carbonomics: How to Fix the Climate and Charge It to OPEC]]. Alternatives to Oil: [[ASIN:0393330877 Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third Edition]]. Big Oil's power: [[ASIN:0061434507 The Tyranny of Oil: The World's Most Powerful Industry--and What We Must Do to Stop It]].     There's no summarizing such a book, but here's the sort of tales he tells. The 1930 discovery of the Black Giant in East Texas nearly destroyed the oil industry, sending prices down to thirteen cents a barrel. After a voluntary shutdown failed, the Governor of Texas sent the Texas Rangers in on horseback. They shut down production and sent prices back up. This led to the Texas Railroad Commission becoming the first government-organized oil cartel &mdash; a model for OPEC years later.    As an economist I really appreciate the fact that Yergin gets his economicsright. This is crucial for a book about price manipulation, and it's quite uncommon among popular books. For example he understands why the Saudis tried to hold price down in 1979 and why Bush Senior flew to Saudi Arabia in 1986 to try to get them to raise the price back up.

0783227434|5.0|I love this movie. It can get any better than Ash's cheesy one-liners and the awesome 80's special effects! If you liked the previous Evil Dead's this is even better!
1439110123|5.0|Yergin's prize-winning 1991 history stretches from the first Pennsylvania oil rush in 1860 to the crash of world oil prices in 2008, and it all reads like a novel. Well, not quite. The new epilogue, which covers the period after the Gulf war in 11 pages, skims along ten times faster than the rest and feels a bit more like a history lesson. But it gives you a balanced view of recent events.    I bought it as I started researching energy. Two full bookshelves later, I can tell you, no other book in this field holds a candle to it for fascination and information. I've read complaints about what it doesn't cover so here are some alternatives, but if you want tales of the way greed, ignorance, and cleverness respond to natural wealth and, in turn, shape world history and current global politics, this is your book.    &bull; Oil geology and exploration: [[ASIN:0691141193 Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage (New Edition)]].  &bull; What to do about OPEC: [[ASIN:0981877508 Carbonomics: How to Fix the Climate and Charge It to OPEC]].   &bull; Alternatives to Oil: [[ASIN:0393330877 Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third Edition]].   &bull; Big Oil's power: [[ASIN:0061434507 The Tyranny of Oil: The World's Most Powerful Industry--and What We Must Do to Stop It]].     There's no summarizing such a book, but this might give you an idea of the tales it tells: The 1930 discovery of the Black Giant in East Texas nearly destroyed the oil industry, sending prices down to thirteen cents a barrel. After a voluntary shutdown failed, the Governor of Texas sent the Texas Rangers in on horseback. They shut down production and sent prices back up. This led to the Texas Railroad Commission becoming the first government-organized oil cartel &mdash; a model for OPEC years later.    As an economist I really appreciate the fact that Yergin gets his economics right. This is crucial for a book about price manipulation, and it's pretty unusual. For example he understands why the Saudis tried to hold price down in 1979 and why Bush Senior flew to Saudi Arabia in 1986 to try to get them to raise the price back up!

B001HN697C|5.0|Rise of the Lycans is over the top and filled with high drama.    It is slightly different than the first two underworlds and dare I say superior. This one takes place in the middle ages.     If you enjoy time period movies and non-stop action and drama then you should really like Rise of the Lycans.    During the movie I wished for more character development of the Lycans.  Like in the other underworld movies you see the werewolves attacking haphazardly at random times. You also see a lot of focus on the vampires.    I think Rise of the Lycans is a bit more entertaining and dramatic than the first two and therefore deserves a 5 star rating.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been doing this workout On Demand for two weeks now.  I am overweight and still on level 1, but I feel great!  I decided to make a whole lifestyle change and try eating healthier, too.  With the video and the diet, I've already lost 8 lbs.  Just stick with it and focus on why you are working so hard.  You will make it through the pain of the first week.  Each day it gets easier, I promise.  I would definitely recommend this video for anyone trying to lose 50lbs or less.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I liked the broadway version better due to stronger voices and better acting.  However, I can't run to Mandalay Bay in Vegas often enough to see this production live.  Therefore, this is a close second which I highly recommend.
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|I don't know if was sent the wrong disc but the copy I was sent only had the director's cut on it. I'm noticing some other reviews that say this copy included both the theatrical and the driector's version, but the one I recieved had no ability to play anything other than director's. Unfortunatly I had to send it back; however, the return was easy and I was refunded in full as well as the cost of shipping.
B000059LGC|5.0|I received this DVD in good condition and have already watched it. The quality is good and no problems with receiving this product. I have ordered from Amazon before and have had no difficulties at all as yet. I hope to do business with you for many years as I have many items in my wish list!  Thanks, marialelia
0060557818|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I was a little sad to come to the end and have to say goodbye to the eccentric, amazing characters who populate it.
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|The only reason this has two stars is because the movie itself is so good. Otherwise, it's one star at best. First off, this is not a remastering. It looks no better than the DVD. In fact, the DVD may look better. You really see it in the credits type. In every other Blu-ray I have, they're crystal clear and sharp edged. Here, like in the DVD, they're very soft. The only other place I've seen type this soft is in the DVD of WKRP in Cincinnati, which was shot on videotape. In addition, the picture is frequently grainy and thin. Again, the DVD is the same way, but the Blu-Ray's higher definition makes the thin picture more obvious. The second problem is the extra features: Would you believe the Blu-ray doesn't have all the extras on the DVD? One of the documentaries from the DVD is missing.    In short, if you have the DVD, don't bother with the Blu-ray. If you don't have either, get the DVD. It's cheaper, the picture is just as good (or you can say the Blu-ray is just as bad), and it's got more extras.
B001NB8MKA|5.0|I consider this to be U2's best album. There are both catchy pop songs on it ( Pride was a big hit in it's day, and Wire is also quite catchy ) but most of all the songs are extraordinarily well written and totally their own. Of course they have influences but from what I have heard, there has never been another record that sounds like this one. Side two is far less accesible than one, but the patient listener will be rewarded with emotionally deep and passionate music if she or he listens to it enough to start to get a feel for the music and lyrics. I hope this review helps someone out there choose this album. If you enjoy it half as much as I have I think you will be richly rewarded.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I usually do tae boe, gotten a little bored with it so I thought I'd give this a try- WOW- I love this work out, for me being in shape, I found it a challenge, the side leg lunges in Level 1 were hardest for me. I broke a big sweat and was out of breath, Jillian is motivating and encouraging, she makes you not want to give up.. I did 10 days on level 1 and now I just started Level 2, which is much harder than Level 1, I feel my arms are getting stronger.. I also love this is 20 minutes, I feel you get a suffient work out. It makes you want to do it everyday as opposed to a 45 or a hour tape which you may dread doing.<br /><br />Buy this DVD, you dont need a gym or trainer
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great workout. I must say, however, that it doesn't matter if you're 400lbs or 150lbs (as Jillian said and another reviewer brought up) if you have bad knees like I do, you shouldn't be doing the high impact cardio portions of this workout.     I'm heavier, with an extensive history doing sports etc so working out isn't foreign to me by any means. My sister is a personal trainer (and agrees about compound movements, as in the video and agrees about using small and large muscles-multiple joint movements-at the same time to increase caloric burn) and my mother used to be an occupational therapist. Both cringed at the thought of my knees and jumping jacks. I had to ice my knees yesterday and didn't feel up to working out (kind of defeats the purpose of that daily workout idea if you're limping around). So as mention below, my modification is choosing another form of large muscle cardio entirely. Btw, I dig that muscle soreness (the good kind)as much as anybody else who likes to feel their body changing. This is simply about joint pain.    I am currently out of shape and trying to get back into shape. Due to years of straining my knees (add excess weight) my knees can only handle so much. So for the portions of jumping jacks, butt kicks and invisible jump rope I'm opting to hop on my mountain bike attached to an indoor trainer. It works out the same large muscles without causing joint paint. I hear what Jillian is saying though, her message is that everyeone, regardless of how large can manage a workout. She doesn't exclude anyone and says in the video that she doesn't think any modification for the jumping jacks is needed. I disagree.    I do love that this workout provides an end point and doesn't go on and on. I tend to over-do and this helps me focus. I gave this 4 stars because it kicks my butt. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the whole high impact cardio issue. :)
B001H5X7I4|1.0|This movie should be banned   It is Extremely distastefull and makes Fun of our troops   The last straw when I watched it was the be-heading scene which is suppose to get laughs.   I hope people boycott this movie   Hollywood should be ashamed for putting this trash on the market
B0013FDM7E|3.0|..but if the film was titled \\"I am Mediocre\\", \\"I am Ok\\" or \\"I am quite good\\", it might have lacked impact. If you have read the book, you had better leave it at the door. You will prefer this if you pretend the book didn't exist and view the film as a stand alone.    Personally, the film could have done with the books sexy lap-dancing vampires gyrating wildly on the front lawn whilst Neville glumly contemplates a box of tissues and a 3-year old copy of \\"Readers Wives\\".     OK, The Fresh Prince is besieged by his not so fresh subjects (hoho) in a Heston-esque manner by 28 Days Later mega zombies. I prefer the old lurchy ones, you know where you are with those. Anyway, the first half of the film (see Independence Day, War of the Worlds etc etc) is good, we get an insight into the deserted New York and some rather silly fooling about with tailors dummies in scenes probably pinched from The Quiet Earth (Kiwi Low budget sci-fi film.)     There appears to be some sort of mega-king zombie who is intelligent and plans a trap for the incredibly stupid Smith to fall into, but we are never told the motivation for this. Why did the zombie do it? All of these shenanigans fall by the wayside quicker than a sunbathing vampire when the love interest arrives. The wheels fall off the film, which lurches to a less dignified end than an old fashioned zombie with no underpants on.  Which is a shame because this film could have been pretty good. Now if you make \\"War of the Independence Day Legend\\", you would get 3/4 of a great film, Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood, you really have to work harder at those endings. Now, I'm off to review Waterworld.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Just like in the theatre, I really enjoyed this film.  The Blu Ray was my first Blu Ray movie and I found the details amazing.
1400076943|5.0|Adiche's \\"Purple Hibiscus\\" is a beautiful, startling story told through the heart and soul of a 15-year-old Nigerian girl, Kambili, coming of age in a turbulent and corrupt environment amidst a family entwined with both love and violence. Kambili's father, Eugene, is one of the most revered dignitaries of his community, working against corruption and liberally giving large amounts of money and goods to those less fortunate. Yet, at home, he rules with an obsessed and fanatical religious set of unyielding rules, severely beating his wife and children maliciously when he feels that they have not been completely Catholic or when showing what he perceives as heathen-like behavior. I found myself both compelled and horrified by this book, by the growing awareness and intelligence of young Kambili and her almost innocent unbelieving denial and fear at the monstrosities of her over-powering father whom she irresistibly loves and even adores, while also shrinking and wishing to slip far away from her life with him. I loved the young priest, Father Amadi, who believed in and inspired the youths. He had a vision beyond impoverishment and seeming limitations to innate talents and hopeful possibilities. I admired Aunt Ifeoma, who taught at a university and was open and liberal with a large capacity to feel, think and love deeply; abundant with a hearty laugh, quick wit and confidence, speaking and acting in favor of justice and truth. I liked the growing independence of Kabili's 17-year-old brother, Jaja, who openly questioned and rebelled against his father, if only in subtle and occasional outbursts. I cringed at the viciousness against Kambili and Jaja, as well as the mother, Beatrice, who had multiple blackened, swollen eyes, broken ribs and at least 2 pregnancies beaten out of her by her often savage husband. At one point, Kambili is brutally kicked and crippled near death after her father finds her with a picture of his \\"heathen\\" father who had recently died without his son's respect and love. I ached for Kambili and the others, even as they found release and new freedom after the death of the cruel and overpowering Eugene and a 3-year prison sentence of Jaja after he \\"confessed\\" to poisoning his father to death when realizing that his mother had actually done so. Very unsettling; yet very worthwhile in laying bare the harshness and dangers of over-zealous religious fundamentalism and the complexity and incongruencies in human nature where enormous good and generosity can run closely parallel with depravity and inhumanity.
B000007XUQ|3.0|I received the CD collection of the Carpenters Christmas music. It was one I had been wanting for some time, but never sat down to the computer to make the order. I have enjoyed listening to it. as you can see, It is January 26th and I am just now writing this review. Even though the CD's are great, they came so late that I thought I was not gong to get them. it was rather misleading as to how long it would be for delivery. Thank you again for the CD and attempt to make your delivery a bit quicker. Happy New Year and may God bless.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|The picture on the Casino Royale blu-ray dvd is much better then on a regular dvd. They cost more but the quality is much better.
B00007KWHG|5.0|20 songs of greatest hits, and they all are greatest hits!  Takes me back to my childhood.  These guys should be recognized as one of the stepping stones of rock and roll.
B0014XCMVM|3.0|I bought this CD as a gift for my wife. She is the Alanis fan of the two of us. She seems to like it real well. What I've heard sounds pretty good...a throw-back to the \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" days.
B0009UC7QQ|3.0|Jim Carrey is a great actor these days...He is producing a dark comedy with Lisa Lampanelli for HBO and he has found himself.      This movie is a great idea...A man's is adopted by CORPORATE America and his entire life is broadcast without his knowledge to millions of viewers...The problem is that his life is not allowed to progress naturally and he eventually comes to the truth...    The only problem with this movie is that Jim Carrey was in his goofy phase still and Laura Kinney is creepy perfect for the part...If he had done this after The Number 23...It would have been much darker and much better....Overall, worth watching
B001HN697C|5.0|I won't go into great detail as some previous revewiers did an excellent job. Underworld Rise of the Lycans is a must see for any Lucian fan like myself. I can honestly say I like this one just as much (maybe a bit more)then the first Underworld movie. Great Love scene between Lucian and Sonja and great fighting scenes as well. Excellent movie!  I can't wait for it to be on DVD!!!
0691131511|2.0|I'm still waiting for a readable history of Byzantium. It doesn't even need to cover the full thousand-year history of the empire. A great book on any random century would do.    This book jumps around randomly, going back and forth hundreds of years in one paragraph. The writing style is clunky. I could almost hear the professor delivering the lecture in a dry monotone.      I quit 1/3 of the way through in frustration.  I wanted a book that would give me a deeper background on some of the topics Lars Brownworth covers in his podcast. Instead, I needed the podcast to make sense of what was in the book.      Herrin's book could have been great if a firm editor had forced her to clean up and enliven her prose.
B001NB6IN8|5.0|It is a rarity that I like an album after one listen, but this one captured me and I have been playing it for weeks now. There is not a single song that I dislike on it.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I've been a James Bond fan for decades and believe it or not I actually liked every actor that played Bond previously in his own way. I liked Roger Moore the best but Sean Connery was very good too however neither compare to Daniel Craig's James Bond.     In the past Bond has always supposedly been the best of the best however he was also sort of a goof who got caught by people who shouldn't have been able to catch him and seemed more concerned about the women around than his mission(Moore), or a little too \\"woe is me\\" (Dalton), or maybe a little too smug and able to get caught by people who shouldn't have been able to catch him and a little too concerned with the women around him than his mission (Connery), cool but not cool enough (Brosnan), and just missing something but still likeable (Lazenby).     Alas, now we have the Bond we've all been waiting for. He's tough, resourceful, demanding, ruthless, funny but not too funny, driven and best of all, this Bond makes you believe he could actually be the best of the best. All the other Bonds were supposed to be tough yet were a bit soft at the same time. Daniel Craig's Bond is not soft in any way.    I went to this movie in the theater and when it was over I went outside, bought another ticket and went again. I bought the dvd as soon as it came out and have watched it several more times.     I would give this movie six stars if I could.
B00177YEFM|4.0|When we received it I was surprised how small it was but after getting the light on and charged, it  became a lot of fun for the person we bought it for.  He is 7 years old.  He immediately wanted to watch a Star Wars movie and then keep it charged for morning while he slept.     He also likes to take it in the car at night with him when we are driving.    The minute he woke up he asked if he could go get the light saber out of the stand.  It has definitely been worth the purchase  for the joy it brought to him.      Quality in a small package.................and lots of fun too !!
0385340567|1.0|I've read every one of the Jack Reacher books and this one is completely out of left field.  And I'm referring to the left wing politics of the author.  The book is Anti-Christian, Anti-War and Anti-American.  \\"There hasn't been any worthwhile wars since WWII.\\"  OK, tell that to the South Korean's who live in freedom, the Kuwaitis who aren't under the thumb of Sadaam Hussein and the author doesn't seem to realize we're winning the war in Iraq.  Well, at least until our current cult leader in America surrenders.  This book will serve Mr. Child well on the Literary cocktail circuit where he can engage in the hate Bush groupthink, but it doesn't serve any of his readers interests, many of whom are Christians who love America.  Mr. Child seems to hate both.
B0012GMVSU|5.0|Thescore for Gump is a sweeping instrumental score with inspiring woodwinds, synth. and piano.  The ONLY downfall is the Jeasus on the main line song...it just does not fit in there what-so-ever.  But still, the score is 100% a keeper!
031606792X|4.0|You know in the past, reviews were generally made for people who were thinking..Hmm, should I read this book or not? Is it good or bad? That is all I generally want to know. I don't want to know the uber spoilers or the reasons why this book sucked, was good etc. The people here claiming that they are \\"raving mad\\" because the book was bad. Well, go write your own book and then I can leave an 8 page message on amazon.com about how great or bad your book was. Guess what people? No one cares what you think!! Now back to the book. It was good. It is vampire fiction. Period. What else did you expect it to be? A message from the vampire Gods? Give me a break. Yes, I agree that books one two and three were \\"more interesting.\\" But no, they were not \\"bettter written\\" or all of that crap. It was just a different story in a different book. So, you have the same characters and its a series. It is still a series of events in an imaginary persons life. It is not supposed to be believable!! It is vampire fiction. Unless of course, a raging swarm of newborn monsteres has taken over Chicago or New York or the whole state of Arkansas lately. An imaginary creature can be what you want it to be, even if it is based on someone elses made up world. As for Bella, Edward, Jacob, Renesmee, etc. All of the characters are way too fictious to even believe that this story was made for truth. If a teenage girl is going to go get pregant because THIS PARTICULAR book had a passage about it in there, then please pray for her. Every day. Really, do you read any other books in the teen drama section? Please just be happy that your child is choosing to read and not play gun games on their numerous game stations. Really, people. People don't run at 100 miles an hour, they don't sparkle in the sunlight, they don't have eyes that change colors from gold to black to red to blah blah. This story was good, in its own nature! I don't feel the need to disect the author's writing style. I read for enjoyment! This book was good....not great....not wonderful. TWILIGHT was great - a phenomenon. But, even so, I devoured every single book of the serious. I will be honest, it took me a lot longer to read #4. But, it was good and it gave me closure!!!!!!! So, I will take that and keep living my life - I will keep going to work every day and I will keep reading books. End of story.
B00005LK94|5.0|I knew about this movie for a long time. We had a copy on VHS when our sons were small. Now that we have granddaughters, I wanted a replacement.  Jeff Daniels is known for comedy, but he takes on a serious role and does an excellent job! Dana Delaney and Anna Paquin are also very good. This movie shows what can be done if you really want to. Anna finds some eggs in a construction site, takes them home and hatches a flock of geese and trouble.     A very touching story for everyone!                          Rod Larimore
B001L5SXQG|5.0|As someone who was never a big Bruce fan, this record really bowled me over!!! I heard some previews and I actually couldn't wait to get the record. It is well worth the money. It's a wonderful album about time and the passage thereof and the song This Life really transports you back to the 60's.    Forget the naysayers! This is a great album folks!!!
B000002UAU|1.0|I just don't get why anybody likes this album! It makes everybody's best of all time list and it is unlistenable. Does anybody that rates this or judges this actually listen to it or is it just considered great because of what it \\"supposedly\\" revolutionized. There's only one song worth listening to more than once (We all know that's A Day In The Life). C'mon, Lovely Rita, I'm Fixin' A Hole, Lucy, Friends. This ain't Rock and Roll and I don't like it! Give me Pet Sounds any day! Give me The Village Green Preservation Society and I can listen to it for days on end. If I had to listen to Sgt. Pepper I'd probably have to be sedated. God Save The Kinks!
6305127646|5.0|It's been many years since I've seen this movie. Quite surprised to see it's still good. I love the many characters Kilmer plays in this. Well done.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|This came on time, and packaged very well.  I love this movie, and it was in great condition!   :D  Thank you!
0375826726|1.0|I am a fantasy lover and I admit I wasn't all that impressed with Paolini's first two novels, still they were at least passable for a young writer just learning his chops. Yes, they were pretty much LotR knockoffs but I figured after two previous novels and getting into his twenties he'd have learned a little. So HOW is it that he's gotten this much worse instead of better??!    It's full of ungrammatical writing, run-on sentences, filler fluff and some of the most boring, annoying dialog I've ever had the misfortune to slog my way through. There MAY have been a hundred pages of actual plot in there -- maybe.     I can say one thing. I won't even give the next one a try. My advice if you haven't yet purchased this novel? Run, do not walk, to another fantasy offering -- ANY other fantasy offering because it's hard to believe that another one could possibly be worse.
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|I can think of nothing about Celine that hasn't already been said.  Her voice is immaculate, and is the best of anything that has ever been!      As to why I only gave this DVD four stars definitely isn't because of Celine!  It's the French version of what is art. The two French-inspired dummies on stage at all times really distracts from Celine's performance.  The bald headed chalky white French mime is completely out of context to Celine's performance, and he seems to lumber into just about every song. The Phillip Morris-styled mime also adds absolutely nothing to the concert except to detract from it.  The choreography is, of course, also French, and has no recognizable relation to the songs Celine is singing.  Maybe I'm just being a typical American who isn't 'contennetial' enough to appreciate the French art, but afterall, it's in Las Vegas and not France. I would still buy this DVD to see and hear Celine.  The visuals and music quality is impeccable as is Celine's wonderful voice.  Celine can do no wrong in my book!!!!
0345479092|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  While you may want to take a few pieces of it and discard it (I must admit her breastfeeding facts are not all that accurate) the important parts for me were learning how to read and understand my baby--it helped me in such a way that I use it as a reference guide!<br /><br />Those folks who gave it a poor review are AP parents who can't fathom having their baby sleep in his/her own bed and being on a routine.  You can still do some AP with the methods in this book but AP makes for a tired and unorganized life!!<br /><br />I must attest that the methods in this book do in fact make a happier and healthier baby and gives you sanity during those newborn days that can be so exhausting!<br /><br />I can't believe anyone would dislike this book, it is so very helpful and I can help and understand my baby every day with the help of this book!  I don't know what I would have done without it!
B000A59PMO|2.0|\\"Veronica Mars\\" is a perfect example of a show that had huge critical acclaim, yet did nothing much for me. I bought this solely on the great reviews from noted critics as well as the extremely thought provoking and well-written reviews here on Amazon, but at the end of the day I have to say that I disagree with the general consensus that this show is a 'classic'.<br /><br />The primary problem for me was that the female lead did not work. Kristen Bell is functional, yes, but more than that she seemed purposely boisterous, with an arsenal of witty one liners out of \\"Juno\\" that no real person could possibly speak in real life. It felt as if the writers wanted to be hip so badly that everything eventually felt fake. The only recent show where this sort of writing worked was \\"Gilmore Girls\\" and sadly, the script here was disappointing, especially because I bought the show based on inputs that the script was 'to die for'.<br /><br />Add to that the storyline, which during the first season is not even riveting enough to want to watch the next episode. I am a fan of missing people and murder mysteries, etc, but the plot here seemed vague and not very gripping, and it seemed a task to want to watch subsequent episodes. While well directed, the show didn't quite appeal to my sense of dark humor either, but it was evident they were going for it.<br /><br />\\"Veronica Mars\\" is one of those impulse buys that I regret. As a fan of stuff like \\"The Golden Girls\\", \\"Six Feet Under\\" and \\"Dead Like Me\\", I thought this would also be an offbeat little series that would have repeat value. Unfortunately, I can't imagine ANYONE watching any of these episodes more than once, and for me, watching them only once was itself an exercise.<br /><br />I am sure there are people who swear that this is the greatest TV show ever made, but I beg to differ. This wasn't good or memorable at all, and all I remember is its tackiness.<br /><br />Two Stars.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I'm usually not into trendy or popular items, but this mobile is popular for a reason - kids LOVE it!  My son LOVES this mobile.  When he's crying and screaming we put him under the mobile and his cries turn to laughs and giggles!  My son examines every animal as it moves arounds and coos and smiles at all the animals.  I bought this mobile because the animals face down (seriously, I don't understand why the animals face OUT in a lot of other mobiles) and for the primary colors.  I never thought that the music was too quiet -- as a matter of fact, I keep the volume turned down -- he's only a few inches away from the mobile, I don't need to blast out his ear drums!
B000EOTAM6|5.0|\\"Aeon Flux\\" is one of those rare films that gets universally negative reviews from critics who are normally used to 'epics' such as \\"Out of Africa\\" or \\"Terms of Endearment\\". It takes a different sort of mind to appreciate science fiction, because the genre is rare at giving us true classics. That said, if you liked David Lynchs' dark and disturbing film version of \\"Dune\\", then you will certainly find much to like in \\"Aeon Flux\\".<br /><br />The film runs like the fractured tale of a universe in peril, and one woman seems to hold the key and the balance between two insane realities. Charlize Theron really brings it as the lead character, and they really prop her well with the choicest special effects and the most liberal use of CGI, though in an appropriate manner. Theron has always been a good actress, but her stiff, warrior-like role here will win over the most jaded of science fiction fans, simply because there is no comparison (Milla Jovovich in \\"Ultraviolet\\" comes close, but that was more pop-art than dystopian art).<br /><br />The storyline is bleak, yet hopeful, and the multiple realities really make the film work even in areas where the script might sometimes let it down. There are issues with it, yes, but I think that it only works in making the film truly a work of art, because unlike other films in the genre, it doesn't cheapen science fiction, but rather glorifies it as a true vision of the future, much like the classic SF novels of the 1960s (remember Roger Zelazny?)<br /><br />\\"Aeon Flux\\" deserves five stars, and a really good projection system, because the visuals in this movie are just so clear, stunning and memorable, and this is one movie you can watch again and again - which in my book is the hallmark of a true classic.
0060531053|4.0|They said they shipped right away, and I believe them, but the book arrived on about the last possible day.  The book had a cut on the back cover (about 1.5 inches long), probably from a box cutter, but for the price I paid, I wasn't about to complain.  I would probably buy from them again.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|I watched 6 movies this weekend and Tropic Thundar was the only one that kept my interest.  I was sure that I would dislike, I am not a Ben Stiller fan at all nor do I like Jack Black, but I heard the hype and I am a fan of Robert Downey Jr, so I thought why not.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise.  The plot was very original, the acting was top notch, and Tom Cruise's character made me laugh out loud and the fake trailers were genuis.  Even the bit parts like Matthew Mcauluny's charater were well done.  The special effects that the movie within the movie were very clever.<br /><br />I can not say this enough give Tropic Thunder a try it is a great movie.

0142000655|5.0|East of Eden is the reincarnation of Genesis 4. With a thrilling plot, Steinbeck retells the story of three generations and the constant struggle between good and evil, bringing his allusions to a more modern example that easily relates to the reader. Even though the novel begins with a brief and confusing introduction of characters, Steinbeck's unique and clever recipe fortifies the escalading moral of timshel, or \\"thou mayest\\". By describing the backgrounds of the character, Steinbeck asserts that each character had the choice to become whoever they became by the end of the novel.   The novel's powerful biblical allusions, discerned between its thrilling lines, engage the reader subconsciously in a battle between good and evil. From phrases like \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\" to Cal's desperate want to please his father, one can predict the fate of these characters based on the story of Cain and Abel and the original sin. Steinbeck, however, ends his novel with the word \\"timshel\\" to add a moral sense to the novel: one's choice of becoming good or evil.    According to the story of Cain and Abel, God chose Abel's gift over Cain's, causing jealousy to foment inside of Cain, resulting in the death of Abel and Cain's unbearable punishment. Steinbeck, however, ends his novel on a note that his reader does not expect. Instead of being punished for his jealousy and selfish motives, Cal is granted another chance when Adams, lying on his deathbed, blessed him, like Jacob blessed Esau, and he told him \\"timshel\\".    Steinbeck's unique characterization is a testimony to the brilliance of the novel. Cathy and Samuel Hamilton are polar opposites. Cathy, who makes others stumble, commits suicide with an overdose of morphine. Sam Hamilton, on the other hand, dies a peaceful death after raising nine successful children. Adam, who was first tormented by Cathy's betrayal, overcomes evil with the help of Sam Hamilton. With his last encounter with his former lover, Cathy is desperate to retain power over him. She even offers to have sex with him to prove that he is not better than she is. Adam, however, refuses and leaves with a serene smile. He has triumphed over evil.    Steinbeck's incorporation of Lee's speech about the varying Hebrew translations of \\"timshel\\", cleverly manifests the moral of his novel. The theme of Good overcoming Evil is a constant reminder of the individual's choice. Steinbeck's theme gives hope to the hopeless, peace to the restless, and light to the darkness, because fate does not apply in this novel.

0142000671|5.0|A powerful short story by Steinbeck that,like many of his novels, occurs in his hometown of Salinas, California.   Lennie and George, the protagonists have a mutual care for each other. Lennie is a flat charcter. He does not change throughout the story- introduced as an innocent naive man, he dies so too. George, on the other hand, changes. Despite his short temper and rough character, his primary goal is to protect Lennie. His fraternal figure grows at the denouement where he ironically kills Lennie out of love. While admitting to sometimes making fun of his friend, George shoots Lennie to spare him from the brutal killing of a mob. Out of mercy and compassion, George always cares about his friend. Always reminding him of their dream- a farm where they can live together away from the mockery and ruthlessness of the world. This was also the last conversation he had with Lennie. Instead of rebuking him for \\"doing something bad\\"-accidently killing Curley's wife- he talks to him about this farm. Steinbeck chooses the unrealistically innocent character of Lennie to foreshadow that his destruction is inevitable no matter how much George looked after him. The reader sympathizes with Lennie from the beginning but at the end George becomes the real hero- sacrificing even his friend to save him.  During the story, there are hints of George's constant care and sacrifice. The reader learns that the two friends have been roaming around and unable to settle because Lennie causes them to be fired constantly. George is always anticipating the worse, ordering Lennie not to talk on their job interview and designating a place for Lennie to resort to in time of trouble.   Overall, the touching story of friendship and companionship is another one of Steinbeck's strong and powerful books. George and Lennie were never able to realize their American Dream of buying a farm. Now that Lennie is gone, the reader wonders whether George will pursue this dream by his own or will he abandon. After all, Lennie was a big part of that dream.      The title of the book refers to Robert Burns' \\"To a Mouse\\", who while farming disturbed a mouse's nest.  But Mousie, thou art no thy lane,  In proving foresight may be vain:  The best laid schemes o' mice an' men  Gang aft agley,  An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,  For promis'd joy!    Clearer Translation:  But Mouse, you are not alone,  In proving foresight may be vain:  The best laid schemes of mice and men  Go often askew,  And leaves us nothing but grief and pain,  For promised joy!
B001HIJYR4|4.0|An action-packed movie that keeps the adrenaline flowing through-out.  The car chases, fights and shootouts are clever and captivating, although to be honest they are somewhat just variations of what we've seen before, with literally some new twists as trained assasins shoot bullets that travel around obstacles to reach their targets. The final plot twist is fascinating but I don't think the movie takes sufficient advantage of its tragic aspect.  The final message - \\"what have you done to take control of your life\\" - has punch, and you want to get up from your couch and take control but then the garbage has to be taken out, and the kids need help with homework, etc, etc. and we all can't become assasins, at least not full time.     McCavoy is convincing as the abused office worker turned trained assasin, who overcomes his fears and discovers \\"who he is\\".  Jolie is credible as McCavoy's recruiting officer into the assasin fraternity, though I will forever be unconvinced that her skinny arms and equally thin frame are capable of wreaking all that havoc on other humans. Morgan Freeman I suspect has played this role as head honcho repeatedly enough in various guises to do it flawlessly.    There are scenes where McCavoy's office supervisor spews foul language at a rate approximating the speed of light.  The mute button is there for a reason.  The cursing for some reason was written to target Christian themes, and there is a scene where an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is pierced with a sword.  I don't think the producers were trying to impart theological messages. I'm sure devout Christians would appreciate a littel more consideration.    All in all, however, the movie is captivating in its non-stop action, plot twist and in its portrayal of the evolution of Mccavoy's character.
B000071K5L|5.0|One of the best books centered on issues of racism and segregation.   To Kill a Mockingbird represents the major theme of coexistence of good and evil but does so by enhancing the plot with gothic elements and underlying events that build tension and suspense.  For example, the fire that destroys Miss Maudie's house, the children's superstitions about Boo Radley, and the menacing night of the Halloween party seem to be out of place in the normally quiet, predictable Maycomb. These elements create tension in the novel and serve to foreshadow the troublesome events of the major conflict- the trial of Tom Robinson and its aftermath.  The title of the book itself has very little literal connection to the plot, but it carries a symbolic meaning in the book. In this story, innocence, or \\"the mockingbird\\" is destroyed by evil. Thus, to kill a mockingbird is to destroy innocence. Throughout the book, a number of characters: Jem, Tom Robinson, Dill, Boo Radley, can be identified as mockingbirds.   In saving Jem and Scout from Bob Ewell, Boo proves the ultimate symbol of good.  At the beginning of the book, Boo is merely a source of childhood superstition. As he leaves Jem and Scout presents and repairs Jem's pants, he becomes gradually real to them. At the end of the novel, he becomes fully human to Scout upon saving her, illustrating that she has developed into a sympathetic and more mature individual. Even though she lost her innocence, she is now more understanding of her father's moral law that made him stand firm to his beliefs in the midst of raging storms of criticism from society for taking the case of Tom Robinson- a Black man falsely accused of raping a white girl.  With the main conflict of Robinson's trial foiled by the mysterious story of Boo Radely, the reader can't help but to sympathize with the characters and feel a sense of familiarity with the town of Maycomb.

B000GFLE1S|5.0|I managed to miss this movie for a long time and glad I happened upon it. It's just a fabulous story. Complete with \\"Rags to Riches,\\" \\"What do I do NOW?,\\" \\"What makes a man?\\", and \\"What is most valuable and important in our lives?\\" themes. Sounds esoteric when I explain it that way. But when played by the most excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor, it's not. Joel Edgerton and Sarah Jane Potts turn in excellent performances as do all the actors and supporting cast, across the board. There's singing at times too, if you like that sort of thing. You will, even if you don't! I don't, and I did. Like it. Go ahead and try this one. You won't be sorry.
B001GJ3VYG|3.0|I'm a huge Dido fan.  There is no question that she is an amazing artist with an incredibly authentic voice. However, while a couple of the tracks on this album were beautiful, her first two albums were, in my opinion, far superior.  I loved her first two albums immediately, w/o even listening to them twice.  But unfortunately, I've listened to this CD over & over again and I can't say that I find any of the title's particularly moving.      That's not to say that I discourage anyone from buying this album, especially if you are a true Dido fan.  All I'm saying is that you just may find yourself a tad disappointed.      I actually encourage you do buy this album & see for yourself.   Maybe you'll have a different experience.  And if you do, please fill me in.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I'm a big Radiohead fan so it pains me to say this, but.... this collection of tracks is the most uninteresting, unlistenable, monotonous music I could ever imagine a band like Radiohead recording. There's not an interesting track on this whole album. Boring from start to finish. Don't bother with this one. If you're a Radiohead fan Hail To The Thief will only diminish your regard for the band. Pass this one by.
B0000009RT|2.0|actually, no, not very freaky.  Just a little strange considering the year it was released (1966).    This album is mainly a bunch of pop songs that sound VERY dated and stuck in the mid 60's.  Even though I like most of the shorter songs, hey, this is not the Frank Zappa album that leaves me begging for more.  It has practically none of Zappa's trademark guitar licks, or if it does, they are few and far between.  It has ZERO in the way of diversity as well.  \\"The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet\\" is unlistenable thanks to it mainly being based around a psychedelic groove with a repetitive drum beat and radio wave frequencies during the first half, and eventually morphing into a collection of nothing but awkward sound effects that resemble a monkey on one occasion, and really, despite being over 12 minutes long, I fail to see the point of *either* the first or second half.  The Alvin & the Chipmunk vocals and pointless piano bursts at the end is really hard to tolerate.  It's not like Zappa is coming up with any creative lyrics either- constantly blurting out \\"Suzy Creamcheese\\" doesn't exactly reveal his genius side.  Maybe this was considered a creative work of art back in the day but nowadays it's honestly hard to sit through the entire thing.  \\"Help, I'm a Rock\\" is 9 minutes of crap, to be perfectly honest.  It's based around a pretty mediocre piano groove, deliberately horrendous vocals courtesy of Zappa where he frequently repeats the same line \\"Can't happen here\\" (which reminds me of the chorus from a Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow song from the early 80's- probably totally coincidental) and those dumb monkey sound effects are back again.  What's the point of this, seriously?  Where's the appeal factor?  Only around the 2-minute mark when the title of the song repeats a few times does my interest increase for a short time.  \\"Trouble Every Day\\" has some remarkably relevant lyrics pertaining to todays many worldly problems, so from a lyrical point of view it's agood song.  Musically it's still alarmingly lackluster, though.  \\"You're Probably Wondering Why I'm Here\\" is probably the best example on the entire album of early Zappa's distinct style.  The demanding, partial mockery verse melody delivery can be noticed here.  \\"Go Cry On Somebody Else's Shoulder\\" is typical doo wop- nothing particularly amazing about Zappa attempting this style (despite how much he liked it and would continue to write these type of songs in the future).  \\"Hungry Freaks Daddy\\" is kind of terrible to me thanks to the verse melody that never picks up and is probably deliberately sung in a way that seems to indicate Zappa doesn't really care about making pop songs (and of course, he didn't- this is all a huge put-on).    Anyway, slightly twisted pop songs are what you can expect from Freak Out!, with a focus on lyrics (actually the lyrics are really good) and small signs (very small) that the genius version of Zappa we'd all know very soon was just around the corner.  I'm just not floored with a mid 60's pop album from a guy who obviously was capable of much more, so why so many believe Freak Out! is a masterpiece is a gigantic mystery to me.
1400063515|2.0|Idiom: \\"Don't let success go to your head\\"    Dear old Taleb, what an ego, and such Cheneyesque arrogance.  This was my first Taleb book, and after the initial thrill of finding someone who shared my concerns about \\"statistical methods\\", I realized that this author, rather than being informational and thought provoking,  was on a tirade. Not simply an occasional rant, but a continual outpouring of ego and insults to many accomplished mathematicians and thinkers.  I'm sorry that Taleb failed to heed the idiom above, but too many of us do allow success to go to our heads.  As an engineer, I have successfully applied the \\"white swans\\" to the design of aircraft wings, aircraft engines, and several other products we use today.  Taleb, I'm sure, was grateful that the work of some of the people he criticised (indirectly) helped to keep his airplane aloft as he flew around the world promoting his book.    I am not ashamed to admit that I only discovered one black swan during my research years in England - a discovery which happily led to my being invited to work at three of the world's major aerospace companies.    Regarding this book, I would recommend saving your money - BUT if you do want to fund Taleb's comfortable lifestyle, then limit yourself to his first book (which I decided to borrow rather than buy - just in case!).

B000RG1DD0|5.0|\\"Bookends\\" is still the best cooperative effort by Simon, Garfunkel and Roy Halee, their producer. Side One is a concept while Side Two is a collection of their singles to that point. To my ears, speaking from the prehistoric days of LPs, the feeling shows in this album. An earlier review cited \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" as their best work, and they used their stardom to its best advantage in getting top-notch sidemen and string arrangers, but, by then, the triumvirate was a democracy. Simon began to explore, Garfunkel didn't want sing the title song, initially, and Halee was firmly in the elevator.

B001PPLIEQ|5.0|46 years, and who would have thought James Bond would have made it this far? We've gone through 6 different actors- Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig.<br /><br />Casino Royale was one of my favorite 007 movies- Daniel Craig sure puts Brosnan to shame. He definitely gives the darker feel to 007. He did so in Casino Royale, and does the same here. Sure he ain't Sean Connery, but he definitely is a great Bond.<br /><br />Now this one starts an hour after Casino Royale's ending. Bond is Vengeful, dspite Vesper having betrayed him in the last film. He is not himself and has yet his biggest challenge- Dominic Greene, an eco-power enviromentalist, who's planning to drain all of Bolivia's water supply. Along the way he meets a hot Russian chick named Camille, who is the only one who contains information about GREENE and the company QUANTUM, requiring him to put himself ahead of MI6, M, and everything else to unravel Greene's secret sinister plan and stop it... even if it means his life.<br /><br />THis film is amazing. Sure it's a bit slower than Casino Royale but it still does have great action in it, and even a cool opening credits scene. Oh, and the action scene towards the ending with the explosions and the collapsing floors was AWESOME!!!!<br /><br />Anyways, if you're a Bond fan, DO see this. Lower your expectations and have a blast!

One of my favorite statements is what we learn as we navigate our own lives, and that is:<br /><br />* Life is what happens to us when we are busy making other plans.<br /><br />The movie takes us through his entire life, from 1965 to the 90s and it is remarkable how it weaves viewers through the fabric of the turmoil of the 60's, the challenges of the 70s and 80s and finally to the time he is forced to leave the teaching profession because the music program at his school is canceled due to budgetary pressures.<br /><br />And here is where the movie made us cry. On his way out, he feels the nagging pressure of having given up his dreams for nothing, because now, he does not even have his job.

B001PPLIEQ|4.0|\\"Quantum of Solace,\\" the latest James Bond film and the second featuring Daniel Craig has its flaws, but is still a pretty spectacular film. The series is in full retooling mode, hardly recognizable when compared to the films of Sean Connery and Roger Moore. While closer to the darker sides of Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan's Bonds, it does have more in common with the popular Jason Bourne series starring Matt Damon, which is not a bad thing.<br /><br />This Bond pickes up right after the end of Casino Royale, as Bond takes a prisoner for interrogation to M, again played by Dame Judy Dench. The interrogation and subsequent events uncovers a global conspiracy named Quantum, with members of prominence and power, including an admired environmentalist who is obviously up to no good. The rest of the film plays out as Bond races to find out and foil the villain's scheme, partnered with a revenge-minded woman, played by Olga Kurylenko.<br /><br />The negatives - This film is much shorter than most Bond films, which isn't good or bad by itself, but the film plays in parts like it had a bit too much cut out, most notably the scenes between Bond and Strawberry Fields, a female agent played by Gemma Arterton. Like many women, she tries to resist Bond's charms to no avail, but as events unfold, it is obvious that Fields and Bond had quite a bit of time together, which is not reflected in the final cut. The villain, played by Mathieu Almaric, does not convey much in the way of danger or menace. He doesn't need to be the kind of kitschy, cartoonish villain that the old Bond films are famous for, but he should at least raise the audiences hackles, but he does not. Finally, the tension between Bond and M is understandable, but every film shouldn't have Bond being stripped of his license and having him act any more of a free agent than he already does. It would be more realistic to show the continued development of their relationship with disagreements and dialogue rather than rely on a plot device that has been used numerous times in the Bond series.<br /><br />The positives, which far outweigh the negatives - Daniel Craig continues to prove that his Bond is like no other. His Bond is nuanced, troubled, and truly, truly dangerous. This Bond seems like someone who has a license to kill and is more apt to use it than any other Bond save Dalton's Bond. His acting talent gives Bond the gravitas and good humor that provides a balanced character. The action scenes have been updated and are breathtaking, and the potential for future films seem limitedless.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace bodes well for the future of the series since even though it is flawed, it is at the same time a very remarkable film.ice that has been used numerous times in the Bond series.

B000OPOAM0|4.0|the terminator is absolutely one of the best movies arnold schwarzenegger made in his career. it is about a terminator disguised as a man (arnold schwarzenegger) who goes back in time to kill sarah connor, who will give birth to a baby that will eventually become the leader of a resistance in the future against the machines. i have only seen this one out of the trilogy. the terminator is a great film. it has a great plot, quotable lines, good acting, and, most important of all, great action. my biggest complaint was that the terminator effects were pretty bad. but oh well, it is quite impressive since this movie is from 1984 and was low budget. this is truly a great start for a series im sure will be awesome. this movie is quite impressive since it is a pretty smart flick, especially for an arnold schwarzenegger movie. so overall, i give the movie 4 1/2 stars and the dvd release 1/2 a star, since is has a good menu, a theatrical trailer i have never seen on youtube, and a lenticular, or 3-d cover, im not sure. this is not the version to get. there is a special edition here on youtube that you can get pretty cheap. i got this dvd from costco in a bundle that had this and robocop, for only 10 dollars.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|CG, models, and no emotard actors. No pretty boys -correct that- on the good guy side. And Explosions!!! Gibson, that Jew hating drunk was at his start and it shows in spades, but playing a gruff tired man worked fine for him here.    The director used a lame excuse for the settings, but the action and VIOLENCE more then compensates!    Blu-ray sadly shows the poor print unfortunately.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though some of the casting choices seem a bit suspect (Jena Malone is annoying as usual and Donald Sutherland is manifestly American), this is a fine adaptation of the Austen classic and a fine film.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|It is NoT a GAME!!!!     Just trigger caps that extend the two lower buttons on the PS3.    THAT is IT.
B0010AN7Z4|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though probably not as shocking as it was in 1960, The Apartment is still an entertaining and amusing romantic comedy with a sharper edge than most in the genre; though it runs a bit long at 2 hours, the 1961 Best Picture winner is well worth a view.
0515141429|5.0|I made a mistake and declared another book to be the first. that review should of been applied to this, the first one.
B000LC55F2|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The Prestige is an enjoyable enough and impeccably produced film, but the twists and turns are too many and too much to be believed, so much so that even the final \\"talking killer\\" revelatory moment doesn't tie up all the loose ends it's: fun to watch but increasingly frustrating to think about.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|A friend brought this DVD for us to watch and we were all enthralled by Andrea Bocelli and his performers. He calls this type of music \\"Pop Opera\\". He has Kenny G, Heather Headley, Chris Botti, Elisa, and more, perform duets with him. We found ourselves applauding, cheering  'bravo' in our living room. This video opera is so beautifully done, filmed in Tuscany, you just feel good through the entire performance. We loved it so much that we watched it 3 times the first time. Then we ordered a copy for all our friends and they love it! The whole neighborhood watched it and loved it too. This is the best music DVD out there. I've become a true Bocelli fan and want to buy more of his DVDs--but this one is the best. Before you start PLAY, go to SETUP and choose ENGLISH because there are subtitles when Bocelli speaks to the audience. If not, it's defaulted to ITALIAN. This saves you alot of setup confusion.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|The plot is a giant spaceship is supposed to deliver a bomb which is needed to restart the sun's pilot light. The first thing which will occur to you when watching this thing is why a future humanity capable of building a machine which can go to the sun and blow it up can only recruit a couple of hipster rejects from Apple Computer ads.  I mean, the crew of this space ship is completely despicable. They're incompetent, horrible, flabby dimwits. One of the characters is vaguely astronaut like, in a sort of working class incompetent way, but of course he fights like a girl and has the self control of ... a 20-something skinny hipster from Brooklyn who fights like a woman. Most of the time, the characters strut and pout exactly like weaseley Brooklyn hipsters.  I couldn't help but think, if this is the best humanity of the future can come up with, humanity deserved to die much more horribly than by \\"global cooling.\\" Roger Ebert, the old windbag, insists they're acting like real astronauts in the whole movie. Evidently, he's never socialized with an astronaut, and has a very poor mental picture of what such people are like. I'll give you a hint Rog: they tend to be competent, very methodical, team oriented and calm people. They don't tend to be weepy nincompoops with the self control of an adolescent chimpanzee. If astronauts were like that, every time something happened in space, they'd die. Everyone in the movie is completely self centered and amoral, and they all seem about as interested in doing their jobs as any hipster poseur working in a record store. Except they are all inexplicably willing to commit suicide for their record store.<br /><br />Pinbacker, the bad guy, is presumably a reference  to Pinback in Dark Star, though he was played with a Russian accent for some reason (I don't think Pinbacker is a Russian name). Pinbacker's motivation is that he's a religious nut, and of course, Russian religious nuts are very common villains in real life. It's funny how much the movie  resembles Dark Star: more than it probably wanted to. Despite taking itself very seriously, this movie ended up a kind of low comedy in the vein of Dark Star. This movie was really a scene for scene copy of many other science fiction and horror movies. The horror bits in the second half of it were all lifted from Alien and Hellraiser (the villain, duh: the Hellraiser villain). The dramatic space scenes were scene for scene copies from Star Trek the Motion Picture  and 2001. It was like the director went out to Blockbuster and rented a half dozen special effects movies, stuck them in a blender, and published his findings.<br /><br />Despite humanity being able to build interplanetary atom bombs the size of Manhatten, somehow they are forced to build computers that can be destroyed in a few minutes by removing it from a cooling liquid. While I'm complaining about the poor computer engineering: the computer evidently requires &lt;strong>gravity&lt;/strong> to keep the damn liquid in place. Even if the computer was on a dinghy or railcar, where there is actual gravity, it would seem this would be a bad idea. I mean, why not just stick the whole thing in one of those pieces of miracle technology: the plastic jar? Instead, they make the whole space ship rely on a piece of technology which explodes when some liquid sloshes around a little bit. The science in this movie makes less sense than most science fiction. I'm not talking about ordinary dumbness, like hearing dramatic sounds in the vacuum of space; this is magnificent dumbness. No, the sun is not so bright near the orbit of Mercury that it would light astronauts on fire. If it were, it would light Mercury on fire: duh. There is no \\"radio dead zone\\" near Mercury, and wouldn't be even if something weird happened to the solar wind. Also, why does it take 24 hours for packet radio to reach earth, when light only takes 8 minutes? When people go into space, the danger isn't that they'll freeze into meat popsicles, the danger is that their blood will boil out of their lungs. Also, when a square object tumbles around, all the occupants inside that square object will get turned into jelly which gets smeared around the edges, even if there is some kind of artificial gravity inside it. Finally, they made a huge deal out of having to send a bunch of people along with their big bomb to light it off, but at the end of the day, the only thing the people really needed to do was press a big red button to do the deed. Humanity has had reliable ICBM's since the late 1950s; it doesn't make much sense to me that they'd need to build giant space yachts with oxygen gardens to do the job of an ICBM, which only required vacuum tube level computing in the 1950s. The 'scientist commentary' with the DVD is beyond absurd; I'm a real scientist, and I'm not getting paid to tell you lies: this is real science commentary. The science in this movie is insanely, preposterously and gratuitously dumb. Liberal arts majors who care nothing for science should not make \\"hard science fiction\\" movies.<br /><br />The look and soundtrack of the thing is good. They did a very clever thing in keeping most of the interior of the space ship sort of blue greyish colored, so when you look at the shots of the sun, they look much more awe inspiring. The giant space ship is so big, you're unable to really keep it in your mind as one object. it also seems to resemble underwater drilling platforms in many ways. This is kind of absurd, in that it's all misty and dark and stuff; in space nothing can be misty: you'll either see it or you won't, because there is no gas in space to diffuse the light. But it's still evocative and pleasant to look at. I'd say it's fun to turn your brain off for 2 hours, but really, the first hour is insanely boring, so you'll probably fall asleep before you get to the exciting parts where the cast is mercifully and gloriously dispatched, putting them out of your misery.is that their blood will boil out of their lungs.

B001GQACGO|2.0|What the blank was Beyonce thinking. This CD  is below average/ subpar-(I love this word). Instead of sounding like it came from a music veteran it sounds like it came from a c-list fledgling artist. And dear God save us from the rapping of the totally reprehensible song \\"Diva\\". Double yuck. You married a rapper, now you have to unsucessfully try to be one.      I like Beyonce and feel that she is extremely talented in most aspects but this effort is lacking substance. Out of 16 tracks the only ones that are worth listening to are: Halo, Ava Maria and Single Ladies. The rest in my opinion are complete garbage. She has true star power and she should have used it to put out a classier piece of work. A person of her stature should never want to be associated with such tactless work.     Thank goodness I was able to borrow from a friend prior to trying to obtain my own copy. I would never pay money to hear this.  Please Beyonce I hope you take the feedback and have a better product on the next release.

Each year when I pop it in it sounds just as good as when it was first released. No one can carry a high pitched tune like the incomparable Mariah Carey. Add this to your collection today! All I want for Chritsmas and Holy Night are priceless gems.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A gentle, true story with many profound messages.  I bought a couple of DVD's to give as gifts.  Also, we enjoyed the music throughout the movie so much, we ordered the music CD.  May be a bit slow moving for children, but viewed with an adult, I feel it can be a learning tool.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Optimism and Springsteen haven't gelled well in the past. \\"Human Touch\\" and \\"Lucky Town\\", the 1992 two-fer that saw Bruce waxing truly optimistic for the first time in his career, rate among the least memorable efforts of his career; they weren't bad, per se, but they lacked a certain something. (The songs were recorded without the E Street Band, which was undoubtedly a contributing factor; but above and beyond that, the arrangements and lyrics suffered from a certain sameiness and genericism that left the majority of the tracks unmemorable.)    Fans will be pleased to know that, while \\"Working On A Dream\\" (Columbia, 2009) sees Bruce once again venture into the realm of the positive, he's both a) with E Street this time and b) kept his songwriting skills on top form.    The first thing longtime Springsteen fans will notice about this album is that the focus here is firmly on the music. The album is bookended by two of his more narrative-driven songs - eight-minute epic Western \\"Outlaw Pete\\" and Golden Globe-winning movie theme \\"The Wrestler\\" - but elsewhere, it's all about the sonic experimentation, rather than storytelling. The songs here hop across a veritable plethora of genres and styles: \\"My Lucky Day\\" is a foot-stomping rocker that sounds like it was written in the \\"River\\" sessions. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is a beautiful easy-listening tune that sounds more like the '50s than anything Bruce has ever written. \\"Working On A Dream\\" is an Orbison-esque plush pop tune. \\"Good Eye\\" is what can only be described as electronic rockabilly.    This variety makes the album one of the most enjoyable listens in Bruce's history. On first listen, you've no idea what will come next: harmony-laden \\"This Life\\" segues into the cacophonous \\"Good Eye\\"; the relentless joyful \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" - possibly the Boss' poppiest tune ever - fades into the melancholy, calliope-backed \\"The Last Carnival\\", a touching track clearly dedicated to dear departed ESB member Danny Federici.    \\"Kingdom of Days\\" is one of Bruce's finest ballads of all-time: the guy from \\"Born to Run\\" is all grown up now; no longer desperate to get out of this place, he's happy to lay on \\"the wet grass, as autumn breeze drifts through the trees\\", and \\"count the wrinkles and the grays\\" of his lover beneath the covers. Bruce's maturity pervades the album: reflecting on past lovers who were \\"life itself, rushing over [him]\\"; coming to recognise that \\"where the river flows, tomorrow never knows\\".    Not everyone will enjoy every track. Many have criticised the \\"trite sentiment\\" of \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\", and the \\"lyrical simplicity\\" of \\"Surprise, Surprise\\". These may be valid criticisms, but they did not hamper my enjoyment of the album even slightly.    The deluxe version of the album comes with a 40-minute DVD that includes some footage from the studio sessions creating the album, as well as the video for \\"A Night With the Jersey Devil\\", a Halloween song Bruce released for free via his website last year.
1934169544|4.0|Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.<br /><br />Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.<br /><br />Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters.  Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.<br /><br />The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.<br /><br />However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.<br /><br />Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read.sages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.<br /><br />The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book.

031606792X|5.0|I bought the first book Twilight and I was hooked. I then ordered the other three and have not been disappointed. I haven't seen the movie Twilight yet but I have pre-ordered it. I can't wait to see the characters come to life. Great work Stephenie.
0765318741|3.0|There is something  must say before I say anything else about this book.  Unfortunately I have been jaded by the fact that I bought and watched the DVD long before picking up this book.  The story I am legend in and of itself is neither spectacular nor a failure.  Regrettably, the story is unexceptional.  Having seen the movie first, I was surprised to find that the story line from the book is nearly entirely different from the movie viewing experiences.  This can't be blamed on Mr. Matheson though.  The production company and writers had their share in that scandal.  Had I read the book first, and seen the movie later, Perhaps I'd have enjoyed the book considerably more.<br /><br />As noted by others. The story I am legend is particularly short (Being only about sixty percent of the book), the rest being a compilation of short stories.  These range from brilliant to downright foolish to just plain strange.  All in all, I don't particularly feel that the short stories added any reading value to the book for no reason more than the fact that so many of them fail to deliver any sort of sensible plot.<br /><br />Overall, as I've stated earlier.  I must rate the book no better than \\"average\\".<br /><br />One piece of advice to those of you who may be reading this, if you are interested in this book, and have not seen the movie.  I highly recommend reading this BEFORE seeing the movie.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's new CD opens with the eight minute melodramatic epic tale of \\"Outlaw Pete\\" (who was \\"born a little baby on the Appalachian Trail / At six months old he'd done three months in jail\\"), my favourite song. Fast and mellow in turn with nice harmonica playing, it would be perfect on the soundtrack to some spaghetti western.<br /><br />\\"Working on a dream\\" is the follow up to 2007's #1 album \\"Magic\\" and sonically largely resembles that effort; loads of catchy upbeat rockers, and sombre ballads. Loads of fans complained about the mixing on \\"Magic\\", I doubt there will be any such complaints this time around as it sounds great to me. Lyrically, the Boss is back to singing about love, life, hard work and everyday things, leaving out anything political. The sound is warm and bright for the most part.<br /><br />Other standouts are the horn-sprinkled rocker \\"My lucky day\\", the gentle \\"Working on a dream\\" (with lyrics most dreamers can relate to), the retro sounding \\"Queen of the supermarket\\" (Bruce is smitten by some Supermarket checkout gal in this song), the more upbeat catchy rocker \\"What love can do\\", the Blues tinged \\"Good eye\\" (with very gritty, soulful vocals), the Country tinged bouncy pair of \\"Tomorrow never knows\\" and \\"Surprise surprise\\", and the mellow \\"Life itself\\".<br /><br />Closing is the bonus cut, \\"The wrestler\\" which is an acoustic ballad. Written for a movie with the same title, it has won a Golden Globe award.<br /><br />Nothing quite pushes the envelope, just another solid effort from the Boss.
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|This was a good movie.  Heath Ledger did put his spin on the joker.  I was surprised  about the change of MS. Daws but I can't complain she did a good job too.  I believe that Batman Begins was the better movie though. Dark Knight did not seem to have as much action in it.  I do recommend watching the movie.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|I had read so much about Franz Ferdinand's new sound for their third CD. At first, they had reportedly worked with Girls Aloud's poducers Xenomania for a Pop sound which they scrapped (phew!), then they were supposedly headed in a synth-heavy Giorgio Moroder-like direction.<br /><br />\\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand\\" has arrived, and is more of the same racuous Dance/Rock as its two predecessors. Opening track and lead-off single \\"Ulysses\\" (with its \\"la la la la\\" refrain) does start off with deep brooding but pulsing synths and an almost Club feel, but the guitars kick in soon enough.  \\"I found a new way\\" they sing, but have they? \\"Twilight omens\\" is another catchy song with a choppy/stomping feel. Other songs in that upbeat groovy/Rock mode are \\"Turn it on\\", \\"No you girls\\", \\"What she came for\\", and \\"Live alone\\" (nice Disco sounding synths),<br /><br />\\"Send him away\\" is a lovely faintly Ska-tinged song while \\"Bite hard\\" starts off deceptively sounding like a gentle piano ballad which kicks into upbeat Beatles-esque Pop (a similar principle to \\"Take me out\\" but it sounds really different). \\"Can't stop feeling\\" has a buzzing echoing feel and an incredibly catchy chorus. The almost 8 minute long \\"Lucid dreams\\" is brilliant with a buzzing feel set to stomping beats, ELO-style harmonies in parts, and a nice buzzing synth break. \\"Dream again\\" is a moody ballad with erie sounding synths and ghostly whistling, while closing is the uncharacteristic acoustic ballad \\"Katherine kiss me\\", which is simply lovely.<br /><br />So there you have it, not the largely touted change in direction, but another fab outing from the lads with some sonic variety. My second favourite CD of theirs after their brilliant debut.
B00111YM5G|5.0|A simply brilliant film; dark edgy and a cinematic master piece. It takes the feel of old noir films and translates it to color, as no other film has been able to do.   A simply brilliant film of the highest order, especially considering it was made with $200,000 which is less than Spiderman 3 had for its catering budget. But don't let that discourage you, it is not a cheap film by any stretch of the imagination.  Its films like this that make you want to go to the movies.
B0000542D2|5.0|For those of us that have lived in this era.... what a flashback! Love the Black and White, the campy movements, the silly plot, but the greatest thing about this film is the music.  The Beatles in there purest form. If you only have one of the Beatles films (we did not call these videos) then this is it!!
B0000245TE|5.0|I had to respond to the other review for this release. Many albums recorded around the time of SF Sorrow have a less than ideal mix; the Small Faces discography is full of examples. Nevertheless, this is a classic album, the admitted inspiration for the Who's Tommy. The songs are in the class with the best late sixties rock; in other words, the best rock and roll ever made. It would be a shame if someone missed out on this gem because of a negative review that doesn't even address the musical and lyrical greatness of the band's acknowledged masterpiece.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is an AWESOME, AWESOME game! It's a GREAT family game and fantastic mind booster! This game should have gotten a lot more press attention this past Christmas. I'd vote it toy of the year!
B000JJSJR8|5.0|This is basically a must own in your movie collection- why not buy it in HD?  Not much to say- movie is great and image quality is fantastic. Buy it!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Good, solid Metallica.  Something we have been missing for a while.  At times, some of the vocal melodies slip into the St. Anger/Re-Load era, but it seems like the overall intensity of previous years is back.  Also, I've never been a Lars Ulrich fan, but I can overlook his drumming for Kirk Hammett's technical precision.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|This is a no holds barred story about a Polish Jew living in the Ghettos set up by Nazis during WWII. It's got a great cast, fantastic acting, and the world they create for the movie is perfect. Much of the film is quite shocking, but of course the truth isn't always pretty. I did enjoy the main characters will and spirit through the film. Worth the buy!
B00000099Y|5.0|As another reviewer put it, \\"Tool is one of those bands you either love or hate\\".  Guess which category I fall into.  This CD has been at the top of my list for years.
B000OHZL1C|4.0|This is one of those films that didn't get the praise it deserved at the box office and as such is mainly overlooked. I really enjoy Brad Pitt as an actor and find this movie to be great. It does get somewhat drawn out and drab at times- after all it is 3 hours- but it's definitely worth adding to your collection.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I will admit that when it came to Renee Olstead's last self-titled cd I was a few years late in discovering it.  But when I did it was like I couldn't put it down.  It was the best vocal performance and arrangements I had heard in ages.  I vowed to be one of the first to get every album she would release after that.    And here we are... SKYLARK!  This body of work exceeded any expectation that I could have had.  Renee's voice is one of timeless beauty.  Such poise, such character, such depth, such soul, such passion, such style, such grace, such growth.  Utterly amazing.  Her renditions of songs like \\"Hit The Road Jack\\" and \\"Stars Fell On Alabama\\" have surpassed the originals in my opinion.    I wish Renee Olstead the best of luck with any endeavor she partakes on in her life.  She deserves it all.  And in closing I would like to say to Renee... Thanks for the boogie ride!    -- J-Dub
0375424474|5.0|Excellent review of the molecular evolution from the very beginning of life up to day. It is a kind of \\"archeology\\" of the human body. Remarquable, Easy to read.Easy to understand.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|The United States has produced more than a dozen great songwriters including George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, and Richard Rogers with his partners Larry Hart and Oscar Hammerstein. I think the number of truly great singers of these classics is less than this number, and include Frank Sinatra and Nancy Lamott. Renee Olstead has a voice, style, and inner spirit that make me believe she will soon achieve this status. Her latest album, Skylark, demonstrate just what an incredible and indelible singer she is. Her takes on Skylark, Ain't We Got Fun, Hit The Road Jack, Stars Fell On Alabama, Lover Man, and My Baby Just Cares for Me are classic, and may well be the definitive versions of those songs.    This album has been held up for years, and I'm glad it has finally seen the light of day. We need at least an album a year in the future from Renee. I hope she avails herself of other producers in the future. While I think David Foster is a genius and a great mentor, Renee needs to share her talent with other arrangers in the future.
0440238153|4.0|I read the second and third books of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy back to back, so I don't think I can really comment separately on The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass. I realy enjoyed the first book, The Golden Compass, finding it very creative and an exciting adventure. Finishing the trilogy, I realize that I didn't know the half of his creativity. The adventure kept on moving, keeping me gripped to the end, but the ideas he explores are bold and provocative. What happens when we die? Do we have souls? Does God exist, and is He good? I'd heard that these books were considered heretical by some, by I didn't realize the extent of it. From the point of view of organized Christianity, these books are profoundly heretical, far more so than the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons, even more than Satanic Verses is heretical for Muslims. The organized church in his book is a corrupt puritanical and power-hungry organization, with names like the Magisterium, the Consistory Court, and the Oblation Board making it a thinly veiled analogy of the Catholic Church. (The fictional church is based in Geneva, so it has Swiss Guards. Just how thin can the veil be?) His account of God, angels, and creation is revealed in the second and third books, and it is shocking. But what is most heretical is that he describes a world in which good and evil exist and people can be moral without needing a creator or an afterlife. Heaven is where we build it. All of this theology (or is it anti-theology?) is not dry philosophical prose, but is integrally woven into a fascinating fantasy of parallel worlds, intriguing characters, and a great battle between good and evil (though it's not always clear who is on which side until the end). One of the parallel worlds encountered is a very creative imagining of an alternate evolution. This trilogy is written as a fantasy for a youth audience, but like the latter Harry Potter books, deals with some dark themes that require a bit of maturity to appreciate. Unlike Harry Potter, where each of those books ended in a safe place, each of these books before the last one ends with things looking rather bleak. (In Hollywood's version of The Golden Compass, they had to twist the order of events to end on a more upbeat note.) But in the end, they really make you think about goodness and truth and self-sacrifice, and the meaning of life. I thoroughly enjoyed these books, but they are not for the theologically faint of heart.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|Having been indoctrinated into the fold in '84 after seeing them live for the first time (I've been to many, many shows since), I'm pretty psyched that they're playing the Superbowl. Here's my song by song synopsis of the new album, \\"Working on a Dream\\".   'Outlaw Pete'-Always a master of the epic story song, Bruce doesn't dissapoint here at all. We've been to circuses, carnivals, city streets and back alleys, front porches, and boardwalks with Bruce, but, this is the first 'old west' themed storyline I can recall. Being from Kentucky,  I find it cool that Pete comes from the \\"Appalachian Trail\\". This one's a little cornball at first, with Pete robbing the bank in his diaper and all, but, that just helps set up the story. The theme of this whole album, whether intentional or not, it 'time'. Here in this song, boys and girls, the lesson is: No matter what you do, you can't escape your past. You can't run from it. Instead you must find way to deal with it before you move on because like it or not, it becomes a part of who you are forever. Great song. Ranks among his best.   'My Lucky Day'-A great upbeat rocker. Wouldn't have sounded out of place on \\"Born in the USA\\".   'Working on a Dream'-Nice song. Used on a couple of late stops on the campaign trail.   'Queen of the Supermarket'-Lyrically, this one's a departure. Seems there may be more going on at the local Kroger than milk, cereal, and meat purchases. This'll be some folks' favorite. Not mine. I haven't really 'gotten' it yet. The surprisingly blatant \\"F\\" bomb he throws at the end is an intentional surprise. I'll have to skip this one when the kiddies are present.   'What Love Can Do'-Catchy hook. Some nice guitar work. Other than the \\"sunny\\" lyrics, this wouldn't have sounded out of place on 'Magic', musically.   'This Life'-Some critics will say this one's overproduced. I disagree. If anything, more of the Beach Boys type harmonies would have been welcomed. Wait'll you here this intro. It takes the layered sound that they were shooting for on 'Girls in their Summer Clothes' to a whole other level. In fact, the music on this is so much like the Beach Boys, it ain't even funny. Great song, and something different.   'Good Eye'-Now I know why Bruce counts Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters as some of his all time favorite singers. Bruce does the Delta Blues here. He's found a place for that fuzzbox vocal that first showed up on the D&D tour for \\"Reason to Believe\\". This one's awesome, and another musical departure.   'Tomorrow Never Knows'-Steve Earle doesn't sound this much like Steve Earle anymore.   'Life Itself'-I've been playing this one over and over for the past couple of weeks now. I love the jingle jangle Byrds sound they're getting out of the guitars on the breaks. Yet another musical stretch.   'Kingdom of Days'-Another one about 'time', and it's effect on our lives. Use it wisely. This one sounds like a lot of the stuff on 'Magic' as well.   'Surprise, Surprise'-This might be my least favorite so far. Nice hook, though.   'Last Carnival'-This one had to have been written with Danny Federici in mind. If you're a long time E Street Band fan, this one'll put a lump in your throat.   'The Wrestler'-Thanks to Mickey Rourke for asking for a song for \\"The Wrestler\\". Otherwise, we might never have gotten this one. Great. Very somber. But, danged if I ain't ever seen a one legged dog making it's way down the street. Maybe two legs, or three, yeah, but, a one legged dog? I'm going to youtube now.   \\"WOAD\\", in my opinion, is yet another sonic and lyrical masterpiece from the Earth Shakin', Soul Stirrin', Tongues a Waggin', Tail's a Rockin', mighty Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. I might add that you can hear Federici all over the place on this whole album. I've loved most all of Bruce's stuff over the years, and the \\"Tunnel of Love\\" album was no exception, but, I remember when it came out, I searched frantically for any sign of \\"the band\\" in there, and it just wasn't happening for me. Little did we know back then...
B001QD7SF0|5.0|The guy who gave this album 1 star can't even spell. Listen to the album before you believe his review. \\"Working On A Dream\\" is well-aged Boss that will LAST...an album you will enjoy 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now, unlike most other music released these days. Thanks, Bruce!
B001LF4IA6|4.0|From an objective point of view, Working On A Dream may not entirely please every Bruce Springsteen fan, but I don't think it will alienate many either.  From fun, upbeat pop/rock to intimate acoustic balladry, this collection takes off from where 2007's Magic ended, but also includes more than a hint of 'classic' Springsteen sound.  This is by no means a 'perfect' record, but it has more than enough substantial material to stand uniquely on its own in The Boss' discography.     Written and recorded quickly beginning immediately upon the conclusion of Magic, there's a 'raw'-ness at the core of many of these songs that no amount of production can cover up.  And yes, producer Brendan O'Brien has ordered up quite the majestic arrangement on many of the tracks...almost to the point of overdoing it at times.  The string orchestra is back in full force, and there are times where the music comes close to overwhelming Bruce's vocal.  For example, on \\"What Love Can Do\\" and parts of the second and third verses of \\"Life Itself\\", you lose a few words here and there due to guitars and/or background vocals that seem to share the same frequencies as the vocal.  But for the most part, you get to hear Bruce's one-of-a-kind vocals loud and clear.  On a few songs, we get a very 'up-front' vocal sound...especially on songs where the arrangements aren't as big, like \\"The Last Carnival\\" and \\"The Wrestler\\".  On \\"Carnival\\", I love how Bruce's voice cracks and breaks at the end of many of the lines...most tracks were recorded in only a couple of takes, and that adds up to a high 'human' factor...very real and pure, like he's singing live right in front of you.    A few tracks haven't done a lot for me yet in the short time I've been listening to it...\\"Good Eye\\" seems to be just another run-of-the-mill blues rocker, and the 'almost-country two-step' \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" hasn't had me doing any cartwheels either.  Then again, I initially wrote off \\"My Lucky Day\\" as overly simplistic and repetitious, but it's grown on me a bit now (and it's fun to dance to), so I think its possible to change your tune on some of the songs that don't instantly strike you.  Several did have an immediate impact on me however...the bottom of the lineup is especially strong starting from \\"Life Itself\\" (I love the different, almost eerie mood) all the way to \\"The Wrestler\\", the Golden Globe Award winner and my personal favorite song here...that one's all emotion with a wonderful vocal delivery.    \\"Outlaw Pete\\" paints a picture of the American west with guns ablazing with a bottom line message of learning to live with the sins of our past in order to move forward.  The absurd 'controversy' over Bruce stealing this from Kiss (\\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\") has me smelling 'publicity stunt'...while the melodies share the same notes, NOTHING else is remotely similar.  Several tunes focus on a personal relationship theme...a line from \\"Kingdom Of Days\\" tells us \\"I don't see the summer as it wanes, just the subtle change of light upon your face.\\"  \\"The Last Carnival\\" remembers keyboardist Danny Federici, who lost his battle with cancer last April.  \\"Queen Of The Supermarket\\" almost seemed silly at first...grocery shopping is a unique topic...but Bruce has said this song is to remind us we can find beauty where it's often ignored or passed by.  No matter how trite the lyrics may seem at times, you know the wheels were turning in Bruce's head when he wrote it...there's always a message or deeper meaning there, even with all of these pop songs he's doing now.    In any case, it appears Bruce really enjoyed making this record...I don't believe he set out to break any new ground musically or to make any grand statement here either, but that doesn't diminish the enjoyment of listening to it...minor flaws aside, Working On A Dream works well.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Christian Bale is by far the best actor to play Batman. A completely believable telling of how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman. Christopher Nolan is a wonderful director who chooses, whenever possible, filming the actual effects instead of leaving it up to a special effects studio. A great movie and almost as good as The Dark Knight.

I don't have time to go out to gyms and things like that so I purchase Jillian 30-Day Shred about 1 week ago because of someone else advice from this site. I am loving her workouts and so does the children! I recommend this for any one that is waiting to change their life. My hubby is loving my figure just to mention [...]. Its natural herbs that tones a female body. They have a free trail so what the heck, give your life the best chance it has!
B001AEF6CW|5.0|I bought this for my dad for Christmas because he is a huge Big Lebowski fan, and let me tell you that it is probably the best idea ever. He loves it so much! The box it comes in is a little flimsy, but not too bad. Other then that, it is a GREAT gift [Christmas, Birthday, whatever] for the Big Lebowski fan in your life :)
B000M9BPEY|4.0|This is a great movie.  Tim Burton making a love/family movie is just the best idea for a film to keep in your DVD/Blu-Ray collection.  It's even more fun in HD.
B0000025L0|5.0|I don't get why the confusion, but Jeff Beck is not on this album. However, John McLaughlin, the most advancing musician on the planet, does appear on acoustic guitar, not to mention Steve Gadd, Billy Cobham, etc. Imagine the best of the two best fusion groups of that time: Billy Cobham and John McLaughlin of the Mahavishnu Orchestra (although not appearing on the same track), as well as Steve Gadd and Stanley himself from Return To Forever. However, there seems to be a confusion about Chick Corea appearing on this disc. He doesn't.<br /><br />It's still one of the greatest fusion discs ever. Stanley is brilliant, not only in his playing, but in his leaving the opportunity for the other brilliant musicians to say their piece.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This DVD is great and enjoyable for the whole family - no matter what age you are it a great movie for all ages!

B000LC4CVA|5.0|I gave this DVD to people as Christmas gifts.  Absolutely incredible!  There is an amazing amount of talent in this group of performers, and I enjoyed this DVD more than any Broadway show or other concert I have seen....EVER!  I highly recommend this for an uplifting and enjoyable experience.
B001DE29SS|4.0|Chaplin tugs at your heartstrings and keeps you interested every step of the way. The acting is superlative and Robert Downey, Jr. in particular does a tour-de-force performance as Charles Chaplin. We really get to see the man Chaplin as a human being, both successful and sometimes victimized as he works in Hollywood; and the cinematography is excellent.<br /><br />The film begins with Robert Downey, Jr. all made up as The Little Tramp--but it quickly breaks away to Chaplin as an old man giving a bit more information about his life story as the editor of his autobiography (a partially fictionalized character George Hayden played by Anthony Hopkins) asks Chaplin questions. Thus we see Chaplin's story primarily in flashbacks.<br /><br />Chaplin tells the story of how he became a star in vaudeville not long after he got his first break; and he could always make the audiences laugh. But already not everything has gone well for Charlie--although he has his older brother Sydney for support, their mother Hannah (Geraldine Chaplin) is in an asylum for insane persons and his father is very absent. Charles also relates to the editor of his autobiography how he rose to fame at Mack Sennett (Dan Aykroyd) studios and how within just a couple of years was directing his own films making more than Sennett ever did. We also see Charlie's attempts at love--his first crush never married him and it took him a forth try at marriage to a lady named Oona (Moira Kelly, who also plays Charlie's first crush Hetty Kelly) to make a true love last. Along the way we get good performances by Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks and Marisa Tomei as a fearsome Mabel Normand who fell into obscurity after a scandal broke loose involving her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie takes liberties with the telling of Chaplin's real life. In the movie Charlie barely mentions anything about his father and Chaplin indicates that his father was rather absent when prompted to talk about him from his editor. In real life, Chaplin's father took care of Charlie and Sydney for about four years when their mother could not do so. In addition, the creation of The Little Tramp character was done gradually over a couple of months perhaps; but in the movie it happened spontaneously with Chaplin's first flick at Mack Sennett's studios. The movie makes no mention of the eight children he had with Oona; and although he never lived an especially fancy lifestyle in later life, the movie depicts his home in Switzerland as being rather opulent.<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras; I liked the interview with director Richard Attenborough the best.<br /><br />Overall, Chaplin is a great film; but the inaccuracies take away one and one-half stars to make this a three and one-half star review. There are no references to the jumps Chaplin made between Sennett to Essanay Studios, Mutual and First National Studios. Ouch! It's a great tear-jerker at times, especially at the end, but if you're looking for real life in its purest form Chaplin is something more of a fanciful biopic than an accurate one.er took care of Charlie and Sydney for about four years when their mother could not do so.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|This movie is actually very entertaining; much better than I'd expected.  I recommend it for family-friendly viewing.
B000089Q9G|5.0|I've seen this movie many times since 1995, but last night I watched it for the first time as an artist and single mother, and I realize I hadn't appreciated before the costs of her liberty, the value of the liberty, or the cruelty inherent in the art that carried her along after her daughter's death, the genuine death of her marriage, even (to twist the knife) the loss of her mother's memory.  He went right to the joint, Kieslowski did.  I couldn't watch it all, this time.    I don't think the blue mobile was her daughter's, by the way. I accept that she was the composer, and that for her there was a synaesthesia with the music and the blue lights.  I expect the blue room was her composing room, and that the mobile was a thing from her art, which is why in the end she took it along.  She had to; she needed it.  The music needed it.

B00129H7VS|5.0|This production is one the very few great miniseries. A must see. Visually is just one of the reasons it's so good. After seeing it on blu-ray, there's no other way to see it. I noticed some complaints about dark scenes being grainy, but any amateur photographer knows that low lit scenes use film that has a higher sensitive to light (ISO), making it more grainy. Graininess and pixelation are totally different and obvious to tell apart. I have a 52\\" 1080p and I see no pixelization. These movies look great.
0312567448|5.0|Once I started reading this delightful book, I couldn't put it down. It sheds light on the private lives of such great men as Benjamin Disraeli and Pierre Curie -- who knew they were such romantics?    The book made me wish that I live the pre-email era where men actually wrote lengthy, sincere and effusive letters to the women they love. The only downside to this collection is that it sets the bar high (perhaps too high?) for my husband...        The only pitfall
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I love this movie!  It has so many different interesting characters that are developed.  It is touching, serious and delightfully funny!  Hugh Grant plays a very updifting and likable Prime Minister! A real person.   The cast is outstanding as well - so many good actors and actresses - recognizable and new.  I loved it when it came out and I still do.  Fun movie for anytime of the year.
1840225564|5.0|I have never owned a more beautiful book in my life. The hardcover is covered with a sturdy dark blue (almost black) cloth with texture. The words and patterns are engraved in gold into the cloth. The cover picture is also sunken in, smooth and laminated. Every aspect of this book is elegant and sturdy.<br /><br />The edges of the white pages are colored blue-grey, complimenting the cover.<br /><br />This book is roughly just as thick and as heavy as a bible, so most people should not have trouble reading it in bed.<br /><br />This will certainly be one of my most prized books. I highly recommend this edition, if not for the content, for the beauty of a collectors item of a classic novel.<br /><br />Ordering this from the UK to east coast U.S.A., it took less than 2 weeks to receive.<br /><br />I showed the book to a friend and she even WOWed over it, saying the appearance alone made it a very striking coffee table book. It is worth way more than the 5.86 pounds I paid.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Westerns, but every once in a rare while a film (or in this case a TV miniseries) comes along that you realize has changed your world view and you know that you'll be able to watch over and over again for the rest of you life.  The Lonesome Dove series is one of those films.  This is one of the best Westerns and best films ever made.  This is the kind of film that actors work towards and dream about and aspire to in hope that they can make just one film like this during their entire career, and most actors will never achieve it.  Some actors (like Kevin Costner after Dances With Wolves) will, after making one film like this, futilely dissipate their acting careers in silly movies trying to recapture whatever made that one film great.  A very, very few actors, including Robert Duvall in Lonesome Dove, are fortunate enough to find this more than once.<br /><br />This film is about the Old West, it is about friendship, hard work, sacrifice, love, regret, choices, family; it is about life.  This is definitely not just another `cowboy' movie, although it does share many themes with the conventional horse opera or adventure story.  The scope of this film encompasses ageless themes about life and the human condition:  people will be watching this film hundreds of years from now and no matter how society changes, this film will still be meaningful.<br /><br />Two aging Texas Rangers, Capt. C. W. Call (Tommy Lee Jones) and Augustus McCrae (Robert Duvall) decide to drive a herd of cattle from their small south Texas plot to Montana.  What follows is a complex, multi-threaded tale of life and death in the old West as the rangers and their companions (some old comrades and some new acquaintances) drive the cattle north.  Many new faces are encountered along the way, some peripheral to the plot, some taking more important roles.  We learn about the Captain's and Gus's past, their loves, their courage and bravery.  More importantly we learn about their failings and their regrets.  We see life unfolding for individuals and families, and things don't always work out well in the end.  But as in real life, one must keep going and do one's duty.  Like most of the great Westerns, Lonesome Dove is long on atmosphere, plot, and character development and relatively short on action.  There is certainly plenty of action in the film, but it is widely separated by long segments of essentially dialogue.  This isn't a feel good film either where all the bad guys are vanquished in one great battle at the end.<br /><br />Bottom line is that is is a great movie/miniseries/whatever.  There are (as of 27JAN09) more recent releases of this series, I'm writing the review of this version because it is the one that I currently own.  I also think that in many ways this film is America.  If a foreigner (or a space alien) asked me which one film best portrayed the American spirit, I think I would recommend this one.  It isn't really historic or patriotic, but for me this film epitomizes what life in America and being an American is about.  Facing the challenges of life and accepting the good and the bad with a spirit of humanity and compassion that can't be broken.  Judging from the other reviews, I'm not the only one who thinks this a great film.  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  If you watch this film once, you'll quite likely be watching it many times again during your life.s.

B001A3AA0G|5.0|Harmonies and pitch perfection to be appreciated listen after listen, after listen.  Listen to this album through high quality speakers/earphones/earbuds and its difficult not to foster a deep appreciation for the aptitude of these guys.  Highly recommended.
B00009MGGI|5.0|Grabs your attention and keeps it from begining to end. Great surprises and twists to a fast moving story. Actors are teriffic.
B00000373U|5.0|On a deserted island, with only 5 albums, which would you prefer to have with you to listen to over, and over and over?  The songs on this album have serious emotional resonance and staying power.  A true work of art, skillfully capturing the essence of Portland.  I love you Portland!!!

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Junior High School students brutally murdering each other for the sake of their own survival... What more can be said. Blood, gore, suspense, passion, fear. So many emotions that are so well portrayed. That's what made me enjoy this movie so much. The way it's done helps you to get inside the head of most of the students and actually start to think they way they do. It was really cool.  This version of the DVD was great. There were a ton of special features, and it wasn't most of the lame stuff you get with the average DVD. A lot of it was pretty interesting.
B0000027RL|5.0|Not since Led Zeppelin \\"I\\" has a debut album had as much impact on a generation then Pearl Jam's Ten.     The emotions rendered listening to this over and over again, can only be described as visceral.Led Zeppelin \\"I\\" was bombastic, Pearl Jam's Ten nearly has as much gonads!     One of the great albums of all time. A must have in any music library.
B00138KDO6|5.0|Amazing.. is all  that needs to be said about this band and their third album. The pure raw rage of Zack's lyrics and Tom's fantastic guitar skills makes this their best album yet. After hearing the crappy cover version of \\"Killing in the Name\\", from Guitar Hero, I decided to check these guys out for myself. And that one song was all it took for me to get hooked on these guys. But their third album definately raises the bar. To me, CALM LIKE A BOMB is quite definately the best song on here! I love the pulsating lyrics and the guitar on this song, especially during the choruses. Tim also did an impressive job on making that awesome affect on his bass. If you never heard of these guys, you are definately missing out on the best that music in general has to offer! BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B000002LN9|5.0|I am a huge Eric Clapton fan. In my opinion, this is truly some of his BEST work! The soul and feeling behind this live show is truly incredible. It's moving, it's clean, it's soulful, it's intoxicating! Moreover, it's worth a hell of a lot more than $25. Buy it... trust me.<br /><br />Oh... and when you get it... really listen to Bell Bottom Blues. It's not only the best version of the song that I have ever heard, it's my favorite song in the world.
031606792X|5.0|This book was exciting from start to finish.  It led from casual excitment to suspensful and surprising excitment.  I liked it because there is a new main character and that main character for this book is more important than Edward and Bella.  The story revolves around that main character. It is sad that it is the last in the series and I hope Stephanie Meyer keeps writing books because she is an amazing and talented writer.  I will miss this series and it's wonderful characters.
B000003489|5.0|So I've been intensely listening to Coltrane for all of, what, three months now? A novice to be sure. First, [[ASIN:B0000A118M A Love Supreme]], followed by some great albums from the Prestige collection (e.g., [[ASIN:B000000Y0Z Coltrane (Prestige 7105)]]) and some good later stuff too (e.g., [[ASIN:B000003N7T Sun Ship]]). But, as popular an album as Giant Steps is/was, I was afraid to throw down eleven bucks on it. I thought from the descriptions that it might be mostly just a musicianship-showoff album. After being shaken to my core by \\"A Love Supreme\\" and moved to tears by [[ASIN:B000W4KSVA Ballads]] and incessantly tapping my foot to \\"Prestige 7105\\" I did not want to hear Coltrane just zipping through insane technical pieces for the sake of insane technicality. I feared that maybe this was Coltrane's \\"[[ASIN:B000050I4E Facing the Animal]]\\" period album, so to speak. And ok, maybe Countdown is a little showoffy-for the sake of showing off, but it's short, and fun none the less. And the rest of the album is simply fantastic. Moving, impressive, fun at times, brooding at others. Incredibly accessible, too. Likeable/knowable from the first listen on. GREAT STUFF, Giant Steps, this.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|If you're like me, you heard that Springsteen's new album opens with an 8-minute \\"western\\" epic and thought, \\"okay, how's this going to work?\\" With anticipation and a good dose of skepticism, I put the cd in and found ... it works brilliantly. \\"Outlaw Pete\\" isn't just a long song, it's a varied, theatrical, wonderfully constructed piece - which is just how I'd describe many of The Boss's classics from the 70s.<br /><br />I think recording the Seeger Sessions influenced this album. It sounds to me like Springsteen and Co. applied a fun, folk approach to their rock and roll, capturing a lot of the joy of music-making. And the joy of production, too, as this is a very produced (some might say overproduced) record. A lot of attention was put into the details, something Springsteen is well-known for, but it's not stuffy or fussy sounding. Instead, there's just a ton of stuff to listen to, making this a superb headphone album. (Note, for example, the supermarket check-out sounds worked into the mix of \\"Queen of the Supermarket.)<br /><br />The songs are top notch, as they have been for the past decade or so for Springsteen (especially when he teams up with the E-Street Band). It amazes me that people like him, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Paul McCartney are still coming out with music of this quality. I guess it goes to show that the Greats really do have something special. It doesn't hurt to have one of the greatest bands of all time with you, too!<br /><br />If you liked The Rising, Devils & Dust, and Magic, I'm sure you'll like this.
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|John Frusciante's web site describes this album as \\"...the ways in which a person strives for what is beyond his reach. In his effort to go higher with every step, he sometimes dives down, only to find that when he reemerges he is always higher than he was before. The musical dynamics work in tandem with these inner rises and falls he experiences. He necessarily remains in a state of confusion and longing but is grateful for that, as without that he would not be becoming anything.\\"    The record's concept of hitting rock bottom before ascending to heavenly heights accurately reflects the tone of the music, which ranges from solemn piano-guided nocturnes to epic rockers which peak with seemingly unending crescendoes. In between lies lush electronica, VAST-like soaring choirs, eerie orchestrals, and ambient noise. If there is an album with which to compare this to, it remains unknown here; The Empyrean sounds like every other John Frusciante album in that it doesn't sound like any of the other John Frusciante albums. This is the trademark which makes the man's music so sincerely unique; the pinnacle which every great musician must strive for.    Longtime Frusciante collaborator Josh Klinghoffer returns to this recording on keys and drums, while Flea delivers his own unmistakable style to many of the tracks, the lack of The Mars Volta's Omar Rodriguez-Lopez being the all-star lineup's only letdown. Though the album is still new on the market, it has already sunk in it's bittersweet claws in that there are enough odd intricacies, fine details, and moments of repeated track listenings to guarantee this to be a record which will only sink in deeper with time. Forgive the cliche, but The Empyrean reflects Frusciante's entire musical career up to this point as a fine wine which only improves with age.

B001EOQWF8|3.0|Wall-E is essentially 2 films.  What both of these films share is that they're one of the most beautiful Blu Ray experiences you're likely to see right now.  This is a reference quality film for anyone with a Blu Ray player and a high def. television. It's visually stunning, at times 3D.  Pixar has really gone to town in this film using layers of texture not possible due to the earlier limitations of digital presentation. For fans of composer Thomas Newman, this is one of his tightest scores to date.<br /><br />Typical to Pixar, it's a heart-warmingly cute film.  But- it IS 2 films.  Film number one is a short date movie about Wall-E, who's job is cleaning up all the trash humanity has buried the planet in, ostensibly awaiting humanity's return on a somewhat cleaner world.  While Wall-E doesn't seem to be getting anywhere in his job, you can't help but empathize with him..<br /><br />Wall-E's wait is interrupted by the arrival of a rocket, which drops off EVE, a sleek search and survey robot.. EVE and Wall-E meet and have a series of first date moments, and it is this section of the film that this reviewer found most touching, artistic and excellent. Nearly no dialogue (which given the visual density was a nice touch), just the shorthand of comic romance, and it's very well done.<br /><br />It could end right there and be a nice little half hour art film...<br /><br />*spoliers*<br />But at this point, EVE finds a plant, one of the specimens that Wall-E has kept in his robo-trailer home, because he 'likes' collecting things.  EVE sequesters the plant in her insides and sends a distress call for the rocket that dropped her off, and goes into a robot coma. Wall-E continues trying to play 'date' with her while she's asleep, making for a second, less-funny montage of 'moments'.<br /><br />Finally the rocket returns to scoop her up, Wall-E gives chase, and we get the political part of the film.<br /><br />The humans who've abandoned Earth 700 years earlier to let the robots clean it up have gone off in luxury starliners where they have no cares but to eat, sleep, and drift around on floating couches, texting eachother. They all suffer from obesity, low bone density, short attention spans, and apparently no clue they've trashed the planet...  the 'Ugly Americans', essentially (well, ok, it's a Pixar movie, so they're not THAT ugly). The plot tension hinges on whether not these de-evolving consumers will overcome the robots keeping them hostage and decide to do their moral 'job' and go home and help clean up the planet... which kindof voids the idea of the main character by telling us that a group of people with major life-issue work to do on themselves will abandon endless luxury and rise to the challenge of fixing a planet theyve become completely out of touch with... replacing the main character, who was perfectly suited to the task.  The message is trite and confused, and seems brutally tacked on.  It doesn't completely ruin the romantic set-up of the film, but it doesn't do much for it, either.  I'm not knocking the idea of saving the planet.. I'm knocking pushing that message with all the subtlety of a 20 minute McDonalds commercial.  It's been done better.<br /><br />Anyway, great visuals... no-one with a BD player should miss seeing this.rliners where they have no cares but to eat, sleep, and drift around on floating couches, texting eachother.

B000006TRV|4.0|I do recall that when this album was released (1979) it sold like hotcakes.  I also recall getting pretty sick of hearing the line \\"we don't need no education\\" (from Another Brick in the Wall Pt. II) on the radio, not to mention seeing the anthem scribbled on walls and schoolbook covers.  At any rate, this was a huge album for the group and showed them adopting aspects of the (then) popular stadium rock styles.  This was also the last album that featured the classic lineup.  Indeed, this was very much Roger's album and while conceptually dense, I like the concepts presented on Dark Side of the Moon (1973) better.<br /><br />The lineup includes Roger Waters (vocals, bass guitar), David Gilmour (electric and acoustic guitars, vocals, fretted and fretless bass guitar), Nick Mason (drums and percussion) and the late Rick Wright (organ piano, synthesizers).  While the musicianship is still pretty good, this was not much of a group effort, and the atmospherics that characterized some of their best pieces were pretty much out the door.<br /><br />The music was very much influenced by Roger and the melodies suffered because of it.  Indeed, the music could be harsh at times and lyrically ugly - this was a very depressing album that principally served as a vehicle for Roger to explore issues of a personal nature e.g., the death of his father during the war and an overbearing mother (see Nicholas Schaffner's book \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" for more details).  Even more depressing is the fact that the concept is cyclical.  Some of my favorite tunes on the album (including Comfortably Numb) were written by Dave, who also played a few of the most interesting bass lines on the album - including parts on a fretless (introduction to Hey You).  Unfortunately, Rick Wright was barely present on the album and the lack of his contributions on keyboards is noticeable.  As a side note, the relationship between Roger and Rick was extremely strained at this point and Roger went so far to take stabs at Rick in the lyrics - e.g., \\"I have a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains\\".  In the box set compilation of live performances of The Wall from 1980, you can hear Rick pound out the piano parts when Roger sings this line.  The departure of Rick from the group was announced later in 1982.<br /><br />Although not as cool as my old LP, this remastered version is pretty good and features the lyrics and good sound quality.<br /><br />All in all, while not my favorite Pink Floyd album, The Wall certainly has its moments and served to bail the band out financially - at the time, they suffered massive financial loss following some bad investments.  Come to think of it, I even went so far as to see the film version of The Wall in the theater, although I found it to be just as depressing as the album.  For those folks that enjoyed The Wall, yet may be new to group, you might want to check out Meddle (1971), Dark Side of the Moon (1973), the excellent Wish You Were Here (1975), and Animals (1977).  The Final Cut (1983) was the last gasp for Roger and continues in the vein of The Wall.k in the lyrics - e.g., \\"I have a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains\\".

B001L5SXQG|5.0|This is an excellent new album by Bruce.  I liked watching the recording sessions on the DVD.  The video for \\"A Night With The Jersey Devil\\" is a song about a creature who lives in New Jersey\\".  This is not his best song, but the video is pretty neat to watch.  I like the part where Bruce rises out of the water in the video.  My favorite track on the CD is the upbeat \\"My Lucky Day\\".  The saxophone playing by Clarence Clemons is very good here.  My other favorite track is \\"Outlaw Pete\\".  It is an eight minute story song.  The string and horn arrangements by Edward Horst is beautiful here.  Another highlight is \\"The Wrestler\\".  This is an excellent song about life and loss.  \\"Surprise Surprise\\" is a song about celebrating life.  \\"Queen Of The Supermarket\\" is a sweet romantic song.  I love Bruce's gritty vocals on the track \\"Good Eye\\".  Bruce's harmonica playing is good here.  \\"Life Itself\\" is a subtle love song.  Steve Van Zandt's guitar playing is good here.  \\"Kingdom Of Days\\" is a lovely song.  The musical arrangements are beautiful on this track.  I love the violins on this song.  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is a simple song that features Bruce playing acoustic guitar.  I love this sweet song.  \\"Working On A Dream\\" is Bruce's tribute to the working man.  This song is so hopeful.  I like Bruce's whistling on this track.  This album is Bruce's best work this decade.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater is a very exciting ensemble and has churned out some thrilling progressive heavy metal.  Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002) is certainly no exception and comprises the band's magnum opus; a 2 disc set split between relatively shorter tracks and the progressive heavy metal suite on disc 2.  Although I prefer the artier sound of disc 2, I found both discs to be electrifying.  Indeed, I can not just listen to one disc.<br /><br />The lineup on this album includes three former Berklee College of Music (Boston, Massachusetts) students: John Petrucci (electric and acoustic guitars); John Myung (electric bass guitars), and the Neil Peart-influenced Mike Portnoy (drums, percussion, and vocals), along with James LaBrie (vocals) and Jordan Rudess (keyboards, Hammond organ, mellotron, synthesizers). My general impression of these guys is that they may very well be the most technically proficient progressive rock outfit currently active. Dense ensemble playing and Olympian scale feats of pyrotechnics on their individual instruments dominate, although there is more emphasis on ensemble playing than that on the previous album Scenes from a Memory (1999), which emphasized riffing usually played in unison on the guitar and keyboard and/or bass guitar.<br /><br />The six tracks on disc 1 range in length from 9 - 14 minutes, with the massive 42 minute long title track occupying disc 2.  The material on the first disc presents a fine blend of progressive heavy metal and classic English progressive rock.  Lyrically, the group is not afraid to tackle complex and more importantly, relevant issues, e.g., stem cell research, which is just wonderful.  I for one am glad that the group has not only updated the approach to the progressive rock sound for the 21st century, but has also updated the approach to philosophical/world view issues.  Although all of the tracks are enjoyable, I really enjoy the melancholy and quiet closing track Disappear.  With respect to the excellent progressive heavy metal multi-movement suite on Disc 2, which consists of eight movements (complete with an overture), it is clear that these guys have a real knack for putting large scale compositions together, which is very difficult I might add.  There is not a dull moment in the entire composition and everything works fairly well from an arrangement perspective.  Such is the hallmark of good musicians.<br /><br />In terms of the CD package it is pretty good and features the lineup and the lyrics. Unfortunately, the production quality is not so hot (Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci produced the album), which seems to be the case on all of the Dream Theater albums I have picked up lately. Specifically, the keyboards are buried in the mix (save for the solo sections) and poor John Myung has all been mixed out of the album. As can be imagined, the drums sound pretty good and John Petrucci is, well, everywhere.<br /><br />All in all, as a prog fan for the past 30 years, I found a great deal to like here and really appreciate the fact that these guys \\"mix it up\\" - they are not afraid to confound the expectations of fans. Recommended along with Octavarium (2005) to heavy metal fans that do not mind prog rock, and prog rock fans that do not mind heavy metal.vy metal multi-movement suite on Disc 2, which consists of eight movements (complete with an overture), it is clear that these guys have a real knack for putting large scale compositions together, which is very difficult I might add.

B000WMFZMY|4.0|El Cid was beautifully filmed and many scenes are visually stunning. The battle scenes and the siege of Valencia in the second half of the movie are truly extraordinary with vivid scenery and beautiful costuming. Each frame is carefully crafted as in a painting and it is the craft that makes El Cid well worth watching.<br /><br />The down side is the often wooden acting , more like posing in many scenes , of Sophia Loren and Charlton Heston. Loren looks stunning in every scene she is in and her beautiful face is framed in every conceivable form of headgear they could find. I almost found myself counting the number of different hats and hoods she wears from scene to scene and can't help but think that it was intentional to draw attention away from her inability to deliver a single convincing line. Heston huffs and puffs his way through the film and is introduced in many scenes with trumpet flares and pomp that serve the same purpose as Sophia's many hats.<br /><br />While that sounds like a recipe for failure, the film delivers a spectacle that is really memorable and so it is worth it to sit through some of the more painfully slow scenes of Heston and Loren exchanging meaningful glances to get to the good stuff.<br /><br />I give this 3.5 stars as a fine costume drama and a widescreen spectacle. You could do worse than to watch this with the sound muted.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|I am thankful for new Springsteen music but this album is pretty weak IMO.  With the SOLE exception of The Wrestler (one of his best songs in a LONG time!) this album does not hold a candle to Magic.  The E Street Band is barely evident on this record.  Songs are just not memorable at all....except The Wrestler.  I would have LOVED to see a Nebraska like album with all songs featured similar to The Wrestler.
0452289963|4.0|Ok, I liked the book.  Because it felt very familiar.  It is a collection of Buddhist thoughts and teachings with a new twist.  I also think Eckhart explained some of those thoughts in a way that resonates with me.  When I read some books on Buddhism I got the feeling that the purpose was to just be, in the now, that's it.  I got the feeling that sitting on a street corner with no job or food would be okay, because I was in a deep state of \\"being\\".  Luckily I never took it to that level.  But Eckhart explains it a little differently, be in the now, because that's all there really is, but have some plans for later just in case.<br /><br />His writing on consciousness was easy to comprehend and I also liked his explanation of ego.  I think its important to understand your ego and make sure you control your ego and don't let your ego control you.<br /><br />I think there is a lot of old information here that is presented in a new way.  If you follow the three modalities of awakened doing, which are acceptance, enjoyment, and enthusiasm in all you do, you really can't go wrong.  And if you do go wrong, it probably won't be by much.
B001F12J3Y|4.0|This is such a great movie and to see it in 3D is just awesome.
0545128285|5.0|My wife is a huge Harry Potter fan, so I had to pick this up for her.  We just had our first child, and this will definitely end up being a big part of the bedtime story routines.  The book isn't really for adults, but it is a great size and level for younger kids to get interested in reading.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|My wife and I started to watch this at 9:30 Friday night after a demanding work week, we made ourselves go to bed at 1:30 AM and watch the rest the next day.    Very well written story with acting to back it up.  Don't expect anything earth shattering, nothing worse that high expectation, just expect something different, authentic and enjoyable with plenty of twists and turns.    Out of the 160 DVDs or so I have bought from Amazon its in my top 20 for sure, how on earth could you narrow it down more ;-)
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|The best thing about this movie is seeing Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Barananski in a musical. That's a real treat. They did a great job with limited material.     However, I'm a little confused at the hype around this movie. Many of the songs just don't make any sense. The whole time that Pierce Brosnan, who really shouldn't be cast in a scene where he sings, is singing to Meryl Streep about how can he go on when she's gone, I'm wondering what he's talking about since he hasn't seen her in twenty years. The only way to enjoy this movie is to never ask what anyone is talking about or why they are doing what they are doing. If you can look at the movie as a series of unrelated music videos then you will be OK.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am the type of person who usually can't stand workout dvd's. I get very easily bored with them. Since I no longer have a gym membership, I decided to try The 30 Day Shred DVD (since I really enjoyed the book \\"Making the Cut\\"). I am shocked at how much I LOVE this DVD!!! Not ONLy does it go by super quick as Jillian mixes it up from cardio to weights to abs, but it challenges me as well. I am in decent shape and enjoy working out and I was surprised at how level 1 made me sweat! I am finally onto level 2 and mix up both the workouts to get better results working different muscles every other day. I have been doing this for a week and a half now with a 1 day break, and I have absolutely noticed a difference in the toning of my body. Usually I take a 2-3 day break during my workout regimens, but it's ONLY 20 minutes and I love it THAT much! It's totally worth it to get this DVD! :) (oh yeah, and I am also counting my calories, so that is helpful as well!)
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Got the movie in new condition in a timely manner.  Everything was as expected.  Excellent.
0765342294|5.0|I read Ender's Game when my 21 year old daughter finished it and told me \\"read it, you won't be sorry.\\" I did, I wasn't. In fact for the first time in my entire 40 plus years, when I finished it, I turned to the front and started it all over again! This time I even read the authors intro!! I am not a science fiction fan by any means, but this is just an amazing story that is almost impossible to put down. So as my daughter says: \\"read it, you WON'T be sorry!\\"
B001DHXT20|5.0|I loved the first movie until I seen this one. Holy Crow this is an awesome movie! Great special effects and great story line.
B001F12J3Y|5.0|The product arrived NEW as advertised and was worth the wait. Much better than paying retail at a discount store!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is and always will be my most favorite show. Others have come to my taste as well such as Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives, but this will always remain the best! It always help me laugh when I need it, smile when I need it, and even sometimes shed a few tears. I know this sounds really cheesy, but I'll say it anyway: The Gilmore girls are always there for me! Hahaha    Anyways, I highly recommend buying this and starting off the wonderful show with the spectacular first season. I myself own all the seasons on DVD and am still impressed to this day.    Hope this was helpful and you buy it! Haha :)
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|This purchase was done efficiently and accurately.  I will definitely use this source again.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I absolutely love Wicked. I got the wonderful chance to see the show twice in LA at the Pantages Theater and I (along with all my friends) immeadiately fell in love with the story of Elphaba and Ga-linda (Galinda with a Ga) Haha.     And the music is just as spectacular. There wasn't one song that I was hoping to end soon. From the witty \\"Popular\\" to the catchy \\"One Short Day\\" and the breathtaking \\"Defying Gravity\\". Honestly, every single song is amazing. I also got to meet Stephen Schwartz in Hollywood at a local Borders and got his autograph on my cd! It was awesome. I told him how thankful I am for his wonderful music.     So I highly recommend you buy this cast recording and if you get a chance, see the show! You will not be dissapointed.
B001HDO4YW|5.0|Love it! A must have! Guys know how to make beautiful music, thank you Jonny, Guy, Will, and Chris!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Love love love love love this show! I can't get enough! Enough said. The show is so juicy and enthralling. Season One alone is so good.     I highly recommend buying this and entering Wisteria Lane to learn about Susan, Bree, Lynette, and Gabby's lives as Desperate Housewives.    Hope this helped! :)
031606792X|5.0|oh my god. LOVED this book. all the books were sooo good but i think i liked this one the best. and it has so many surprises and twist to it. like Jacob inprinting on and half vamp half human who have thought that. Bella becoming a vamp was no surprise but making the royalty vamps run who would of thought hat of her.
0385340990|4.0|Yes many of the characters are stereotypes, perhaps the book is not 100% historically accurate and the author/main character is a bit too clever/cutesy pie but the book is charming and a terrifically entertaining read. Jeez, I even teared up at the end.
B000088NSY|4.0|another great example of why SACD sounds so good. I know almost all these  songs but never been able to hear the this clarity.    Stand out tracks..Walking in your footsteps, king of pain, Synchronicity II. The music departure that seems to happen with some songs when transferred to SACD is sometimes stark and you have listen to those songs you know all over again. The 3 mentioned above definitely give back that feel.     Great SACD, definitely recommend to anyone that has a SACD player.    I listened to this using my 60GB PS3 which is SACD capable (not all ps3 units are) and actually think it could sound better on a dedicated SACD player.
1400082773|5.0|Whether or not you are an Obama fan, I recommend you read this book.  He did not write this book to promote himself. It evolved as an exploration of culture and its impact upon each person. I loved this book because it gave me insights not only to Obama but to myself. I'm not black; I'm white.  But whatever color, race, or religion we are--most of us are in search of our identity.  It seems that many of us, including myself, wait too long to really search as to who we are and what kind of person we want to be and what our place is in this world. I was uncertain if he had enough experience to be President, but after reading this, I feel that he is very well qualified and truly understands where the \\"common\\" man is coming from and the role of politics.  I wish him well.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|I totally agree with H. Berry's title : \\"Hilarious French Comedy\\" and I have no choice but plagiarize. I purchased the DVD recently and I spent some funny 72 minutes watching it last night. Today, I feel happy that I read the Berry review after and not before: IMO, he is giving away too much of the story. But it didn't stop me from clicking the first YES vote.<br /><br />The sad news: With the film and its actors still in my mind, I did some research: Jacques Villeret, the funny \\"con\\" (idiot) of the movie, committed suicide since. Being a great comedian is no guarantee for happiness.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|David Cook's voice is just phenomenal and I was disappointed to find that it's hard to hear the vocals over the band instruments.  Listening to him on this CD was just so different than hearing him on AI.  I think he has incredible talent and I would love to hear more of his voice and less of everything else.  If he would come out with a recording of the songs that he sang on American Idol, I'd be willing to stand in a long line to buy that one.  Even when he sang the old songs they sounded so fresh and new with his interpretation and amazing voice.
B00005JLKB|5.0|It was great seeing smallville again it was like watching it for the first time and I can't wait to get the rest of the series!
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I mistakenly ordered this series without realizing that I would need an HD DVD player to run it.  We had to return it because we do not own one.
0385340567|3.0|While the beginning of this story grabbed me, much like many of Childs' stories do, it didn't keep my interest to the end.  The story's antagonist was a push-over and the anti-Bush sentiment (even for a liberal!) was a bit heavy-handed.  The story has its moments, but overall I was disappointed.
B001KVZ6C0|3.0|I went to see \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" a couple weeks ago because of the huge Oscar buzz.  And while I enjoyed this movie, I wouldn't recommend seeing it more than once to anyone.  So I find the hyperbole surrounding \\"Slumdog\\" a little alarming.<br /><br />I am in total agreement with Salman Rushdie, who has called this movie \\"visually brilliant.\\"  The cinematography is outstanding, kinetic, and the use of perspective and color to establish a scene is superb (in this regard, \\"Slumdog\\" reminds me of \\"City of God,\\" a better movie by far).  The soundtrack too is mesmerizing, loaded with pitch-perfect fusions of eastern and western music.  \\"Slumdog\\" is in this way every bit as good as \\"Trainspotting,\\" one of director Danny Boyle's best movies.<br /><br />Yet I also agree with Rushdie that \\"Slumdog\\"'s biggest flaw is its storyline.  Perhaps in the context of Bollywood, a game show which asks questions drawing entirely from the contestant's experience is fine.  But when a western director makes a movie in which this happens, I have a sneaking suspicion that \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is the result of lazy storytelling.  One coincidence in a movie is almost necessary; two is starting to strain plausibility; the dozen or so in this movie alternately provoke indifference and cynicism.  While watching \\"Slumdog,\\" I realized that this was precisely my reaction to \\"Forrest Gump,\\" another movie which leans heavily on a succession of improbabilities.  The flashbacks, which in many movies can heighten tension, are sometimes ineffective because we know Jamal (the protagonist) survives these tense moments.<br /><br />The characterizations in this movie don't always help either.  Jamal's love interest, Latika, never seems to suffer anything worse than living with a rich guy.  And she only seems to care about Jamal when he has won ten million rupees, despite abundant evidence of his virtues beforehand.  Yet I am supposed to identify with her?<br /><br />\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is probably worth seeing once, but its best attributes are also found in other movies.  It's better than \\"The Kite Runner\\" by a bit, but far worse than \\"City of God.\\"  The Academy has botched its nominations once again, as this is not really one of the five \\"Best Pictures\\" of 2008.attributes are also found in other movies.  It's better than \\"The Kite Runner\\" by a bit, but far worse than \\"City of God.\\"  The Academy has botched its nominations once again, as this is not really one of the five \\"Best Pictures\\" of 2008.

031606792X|4.0|I really enjoyed the twists and turns in this book, although some of them a little surprising and at first I was unsure as how to react to them, eventually it all worked out well. The only disappointment, which many will agree, is the fight with the Volturi. There should have been some loss on their end.. very big build up for a very quiet result... this book felt like the beginning rather than the ending to the series due to this part. However, overall, I liked it and it's nice to see Bella grow up some!
B001MW0J2O|5.0|It's often that even current \\"best albums ever\\" lists take old-age albums that our grandfathers/fathers passed down to us, letting our unquestioning faith in their wisdom give us what is considered the \\"best music\\". There were a lot of great albums in the 60's, such as Pet Sounds, Revolver, Odessey & Oracle... but does a great album truly need to be legend-ified to be considered among the best?    Now we're in the 00's, and surely no albums from this decade will approach those lists until we are able to grow with them and they can be an actual part of our and our childrens' lives. This is one of those albums. Animal Collective has always been a playful bunch, experimenting on countless genres and making their own, mostly incohesively. But what holds them together is their remarkable sense of harmony and rhythm. Both of these were evident in their lo-fi debut, Spirit They've Gone, Spirit They've Vanished, but they seemed to vanish themselves... until now.     Merriweather Post Pavilion combines the 60's pop melodic style of Panda Bear (Noah Lennox) with the psychedelic eccentricites of Dave Portner. Both weave their styles in and out of the album, sometimes actually both in making each others' song their own (as in Taste, the best moment in the album). The synth flows from track to track as Ben Allen lays down the beats and Brian baths them in atmosphere. Every song shines, and people are going to have a hard time choosing the worst song. My Girls, Summertime Clothes, Also Frightened, Brothersport, In The Flowers, Daily Routine...    This album is a masterpiece.
B00102F5WK|4.0|After the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, several security measures were taken to protect the United States and its citizens.  Among them, Congress passed the Patriot Act which gave the US Government unprecedented powers to gather intelligence and pursue terrorists.  Rendition is the horrific story of what happens when the process nets an innocent person.<br /><br />The USG, whose policies oppose any form of torture in this country, sought other means to extract information.  Working with other countries whose policies did not ban torture and who were willing to accept these suspected terrorists, the USG sent such suspected terrorists to them.  In the process, there was no requirement for due process of law and an individual's rights.  Thus, a person could just simply disappear for years and nobody would notify family, friends or legal authorities.  The process is called \\"extraordinary rendition\\".<br /><br />The film raises fascinating questions about an individual's rights under such circumstances, vis a vis the safety and future security of our country.  Clearly, when an innocent person is caught in this web, we feel horrified, debased and ashamed.  But, there are always costs, and if a few individuals are mistakenly tortured when society at large is saved from the greater threat of thousands dying, is rendition an imperfect policy or  a necessary strategy to protect this country?<br /><br />The disc also contains a documentary called \\"outlawed\\" which chronicles the real life stories of two men from different parts of the world who underwent such experiences.<br /><br />The film is beautifully made in the United States and Morocco.  Meryl Streep is terrific as the US Government official ordering rendition, as is Omar Metwally, who plays the tortured individual.  However, Reese Witherspoon, normally an excellent actress, as the missing man's wife seems to equate being a zombie with acting, giving a very disappointing performance.Jake Gyllenhaal is equally unimpressive as the US Government official assigned to represent the USG during the torture process.  The film succeeds despite these two lackluster performances, and is a thriller well worth watching.

0143035711|5.0|Great Courage<br />Since the beginning of the book you can tell the story is so good you cannot stop Reading it. It describes vividly what the life at the front line was for a helicopter pilot for dangerous missions.<br />The description of what life was back then is amazing, it shows the reality soldiers lived in Vietnam, how many people faced death everyday and the courage of pilots to do what had to do to accomplish missions.<br />I feel sorry for him at the end of the book, I believe he deserve better, a good life for somebody that was a hero.
0061139378|5.0|Have you ever wondered what the world would be like looking out of a mirror as opposed to into one?  Such is the topsy-turvy reality Neil Gaiman creates in the story of \\"Coraline\\".  The title characters name is a twist upon itself, which is your first sign that things are not always as they seem.  Coraline is an adventurer; braver than most, but slighter than many.  Size does not equal strength, kindness, or cunning though, when faced with evil.  Longing for an escape from the hum-drum of everyday life, she follows a doorway to nowhere.....on this particular day, however, nowhere leads to a somewhere one would only hope to dream and never experience.  In this \\"other\\" world, everyone and everything appears the same and yet different.  Her \\"other\\" mother is especially affectionate, wanting nothing more than to feed her and play games.  Coraline can't quite put her finger on it, but something there is just....wrong.  What evil lurks behind their shiny button black eyes?  Coraline feeling none to uneasy decides to return home after her visit only to discover her parents are missing!  She knows in her heart that her \\"other\\" mother has them, and she knows where she must go to bring them back.  Mustering all the strength a child can hold, she sets out on an adventure she will not soon forget with her only ally, a familiar, although sarcastic, black cat from her own world, guiding the way.  Will this be enough to stop the evil lurking in the shadows?  What other secrets are being held just out of her reach? You can be sure Coraline will uncover it all and more.

It's a funny, sad and a view on life of what is \\"normal\\". Elwood is happy in his world, others want to change him. But Jimmy Stewart as the main character with his imaginary friend seems to have a better take on life than most of those around him. A classic to be cherished.
B000E1MTZE|3.0|Please be aware that this box set is HD DVD. You need a special player that is no longer on the market.  I love the Matrix movies and would normally give this set a 5 star rating but Amazon should place a warning that these HD DVDs will not play on a regular DVD player. BUYER BEWARE.

0132350882|5.0|In Clean Code each chapter contains a different subject to enhance code quality.  From the simple practices that are often overlooked, for example; naming conventions and formatting styles, through the classic tried and tested; Kent Beck's 4 Simple Rules of Design (Run all tests, contain no duplication, code to express intent and minimize the number of classes and methods); to some gems that can take years to uncover; such as bad practices for returning null (with the correct idiom) and good practices for testing threaded code.  This reviewer certainly chuckled guiltily when reading some of the examples of code that could be written better (\\"Oh yeah, I remember doing that once!!\\").    I was surprised to see a few reviews on other blog sites and amazon about the fact this was not written solely by Bob but by different authors at Object Mentor. I actually thought this was a good thing as each chapter is a separate concern and the writing styles differ so the reader can be engaged differently from one chapter to the next. Plus, there is a lot of Java and the change in temperament clears ones head after reading all that code.  This book does not follow a specific 'project' throughout, like many other books today, but concentrates on real world examples to illustrate the different points made. This is not a book one can read quickly IF the reader wants to real get involved and practice what this book teaches.    One may presume that my opening paragraph was negative on the amount of code in this book. On the contrary, I found this to be an excellent model to get, mainly inexperienced [Java], programmers to look at more code written by experienced experts and take a look at the internals of classes in popular frameworks such as  JUnit and JCommon.    Chapter 17 is a concise description of each of the smells and heuristics used throughout the book and if you think you have your coding practices down to a fine art, read through this - you never know where you can learn a new thing or two. Also, if you are still one of the few out there that are not performing Unit Tests (shame on you) then just the first four pages of chapter 9 (p 121 - 124) should sell it to you, and your manager if required.     Now the bad! Maybe it's because we at Enerjy Software are so much into 'best' practices that a few things niggled me.  There are a few contradictions in the book. Not only where the advise to never leave commented out code in your application is ignored, but in some cases (e.g. p66) some Catch blocks with no code contain a comment as to why they are empty, while some are indeed completely empty (no comment) - we believe this is not a good practice and is one of the few cases where a comment is indeed useful in a block of code.    I also found a paragraph of slight Utopia-ism (is that a real word?). It is mentioned that programmers should not just get the code working but successfully refine working code before they move onto the next piece of functionality. Unfortunately I know of no customer who would be willing to pay for someone to sit and refactor code when it is functionally working correctly. This may sound contradictory on a Code Quality site but i think it is the real world. I think a better way of arguing this point is to define what is meant when a piece of functionality is 'done'. This would include the refinement (and documentation which is usually not evident) - maybe I'm just arguing semantics?      In summary this book is a great resource of areas of good coding practices that each chapter has had many whole books dedicated to. I would like to see this book in Computer Science undergraduate courses as I feel to get these practices in early is only a good thing. For any professional, the information contained here in one book gives huge value to the reader.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is one of my favorite versions of Jane Eyre. This is a compelling, emotional, wonderful love story! I thought the man who played Mr. Rochester was so handsome! Wow! So good looking!<br /><br /> I liked this version of Jane Eyre ,because of the chemisty between, Edward and Jane, and I loved the way Edward wanted to spend time with Jane, taking walks with her, talking with her, asking for her opinion, treating her like a equal. You could feel the love that Edward, and Jane had for each other, and you could feel the hidden intense emotions, and passion that they felt, for each other.<br /><br />My favorite scene was when Jane tolded Edward how she felt about leaving, and, when Edward asked her to marry him beside the tree, and I loved the scene where Jane saved Edward's life. And I loved the beautiful outdoor scenes, Thornfield in spring and summer. So breathtaking, and beautiful. I would love to know the history of the real place that was chosen to be Thornfield in the movie!

0446579939|5.0|I am a huge fan of Sparks' books and this book did not let me down. It is a great story and touching like always. Keep it up Sparks!
B000MV8ABS|4.0|This is an extremely hard movie to rate, given it's core audience is relatively exclusive.  Instead of rating it against all other movies, let's just say I'm giving it four stars in the horror genre, and even that comes with some caveats.      First of all, if you aren't a horror fan already, then this is probably not the place to start.  If you are a horror junkie, but haven't seen this movie, I wouldn't get my expectations up.  There's a very specific reason that this movie spawned so many sequels and so many fans - and that's because, like the first Friday the Thirteenth, at the time it was made, it was frightening and original.  It's still original, but maybe not so scary anymore.  There are some very specific scenes I remember seeing twenty years ago that really got to me, but watching it again recently, I just shrugged my shoulders.      Horror films that rely on a lot of special effects tend to date themselves very quickly (the only exception I can think of off the top of my head is [[ASIN:B00000ILDD Alien: 20th Anniversary Edition [Award Series]]]), and Phantasm is obviously set right at the tail end of the seventies.  Not that there is anything wrong with that in and of itself, but if someone was thinking about getting this movie, they should be aware that, despite all the glowing reviews here, Phantasm is definitly a product of its time.    That doesn't mean I didn't like it, though.  Maybe I have a soft spot for movies like this because they're from my era, or maybe I just like cheesy horror movies.  Either way, Phantasm fits both criteria, and I still enjoyed it, all these years later.  I also enjoyed the featurette in the DVD extras, \\"Phantasmagoria\\".  All the principle players were interviewed in 2005 about their memories of the original production, and learning how they went about making the movie on such a shoe-string budget tipped me over from giving this three stars to giving it four.  I don't always watch the extras, especially if they come on thesecond disc of a 'two disc directer's cut special grand high poobah edition'.  I'd like to kick these movie companies right in the shins when they rerelease a more expensive version of the same movie and all they've added is a second disc full of bogus extras.  But enough of my soapbox.  Phantasm comes on one disc, and Anchor Bay did a great job on the transfer.  I watched it on an up-convertor, and it probably looked better than when it was released and playing in drive-ins across the country.      If your thinking about buying because Phantasm scared you silly thirty years ago, don't expect the same today.  My fiance eventually just rolled her eyes and trundled off to bed about halfway through, and she even made it through [[ASIN:B001CIOCJY Sukiyaki Western Django]] till the bitter end.  But Phantasm is a better horror movie than all these home invasion/kidnapping/torture movies they've made lately, and a lot more fun.  As they say - if this one doesn't scare you, then you're already dead!

1592402038|4.0|This is a great book for those in your life who are grammatically challenged. It's also a great book for giving youngsters who are preparing for standardized tests, etc. to make them realize that grammar can be fun and funny. Bits of the book get a little heavy to trudge through, but very few such bits. Overall I found it an awesome addition to my library, the kind you can revisit over and over every few months

By showing Adams' truths and faults and mirroring the character's personal lives and professional triumphs, you can't help but sympathize with this amazing husband and wife team.

B0010VD7EO|4.0|The slick production of M83 meets the eccentricity of David Bowie. That's how I would describe this engaging album.
B000001ESN|5.0|Purely as musicians there is little doubt Rush have always had an impeccable reputation as musicians.But in many ways this is the album that put them over the edge in terms of popular and commercial success. That move would not be fully realized until the follow up [[ASIN:B000001ESP Moving Pictures]] but this one is about 99.98% there. The man reason why this album was such a sudden public success has to do with the fact the band have started to emphasize shorter pop/rock type songs as opposed to prog/rock symphonies of earlier recordings.Although most Rush fans already know this. For the most part,the bright production-already becoming (very lightly) puncuated by electronics is mildly rooted in the bands late 70's sound yet the blend of old and newer styles mark a certain level of perfection in Rush's general production.Nothing could epidomize this whole spirit better then \\"The Spirit Of Radio\\",showing adulation to the format that was now bring Rush the most success  while at the same time observing how so many musicians trade in their artistic integrity for applause and fame;an old story if there ever was one but luckily one that the band believed in enough to practice-the pursuit of vision over commercialism that is.That isn't to mention the terrific guitar solo Alex throws down;a classic rock riff right up there with Jimi Hendrix's on \\"Purple Haze\\" or Jimmy Page on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".\\"Freewill\\" doesn't take anything away from the spirit of the first cut,although the solos are traded in for the rhythmic ensamble style that was forward thinking to where Rush would take their sound on albums like [[ASIN:B000001EST Signals]] or even [[ASIN:B000001ESV Grace Under Pressure]] a few years later.\\"Jacobs Ladder\\",with it's anthemic bursts of fanfare is somewhat of a throwback to the \\"old\\" Rush but,with the same new production style it's clear even Rush's longer numbers from here on are going to be different.The longest tune here is \\"Natural Science\\"-not only are Neil's highly poetic,reflective lyrics indicative of the new approch he was taking on this album but the song,a composition that moves from a mildly folksy approch to an almost funky jazz/fusion-inflected groove would serve Rush excellenly in years to come.On the other side of the fense \\"Entre Nous\\" finds the same kind of lyrics,only oriented towards romance (at least I THINK so)married to yet another great pop song.I am not saying brainy lyrics and poppy tunes don't match but to some people that quality may have stopped it from being the hit is deserved to be.\\"Different Strings\\" isn't exactly a ballad but it's acoustic mellowness gives it the illusion of being so-it's also a song on this album that became very popular.So taken together this album has more then enough radio friendliness and variety to become a huge artistic AND commercial success,and it did. Not only that but it began what I'd describe as the third period of Rush's musical career,one that's thankfully been based on comrodery and longjevity long past what many bands in any genre can claim to have.Neil's highly poetic,reflective lyrics indicative of the new approch he was taking on this album but the song,a composition that moves from a mildly folksy approch to an almost funky jazz/fusion-inflected groove would serve Rush excellenly in years to come.On the other side of the fense \\"Entre Nous\\" finds the same kind of lyrics,only oriented towards romance (at least I THINK so)married to yet another great pop song.I am not saying brainy lyrics and poppy tunes don't match but to some people that quality may have stopped it from being the hit is deserved to be.\\"Different Strings\\" isn't exactly a ballad but it's acoustic mellowness gives it the illusion of being so-it's also a song on this album that became very popular.So taken together this album has more then enough radio friendliness and variety to become a huge artistic AND commercial success,and it did.

B001DHXT6G|3.0|OK, here is the deal (and it took a long time to figure it out.)    First, as far as the content: Fantastic, the remastering is superb and in some cases, thrilling. Brilliant work by extremely talented people who really understand what they're doing and gave great reverence and respect to the original material.    The problem is with the suits. No, not the costumes, the execs at Paramount.    It's a case of getting more than you paid for, a bonus of sorts, but renders the rest of the set unwatchable and, as Spock would put it, \\"quite irritating.\\"    My set came with Season One a COMBO disc in HD-DVD format on one side, standard DVD on the other. This was a surprise, because I'd bought only a DVD set on Amazon and thought only a complete DVD set was available.    Alas, no. It seems that Paramount had mastered an HD-DVD version of ONLY THE FIRST SEASON until the format died. So here I was, excited and thrilled that somehow I'd gotten an HD-DVD version of the entire set! Being the idiot that I am, I assumed the entire set was comprised of combo discs. I watched the first season in unbelievable high definition, and couldn't wait to get to Seasons Two and Three.    Only... Seasons Two and Three weren't combo discs, but standard lo-res DVD!! I had to go to Amazon to deduce what had happened.    Apparently Paramount had packaged these with the combo discs thrown in as an unlisted bonus. Or they wisely realized that people might be pissed off that Seasons Two and Three weren't in high-def and just not buy the set, preferring to wait until the inevitable Blu-ray release.    Either way, the result is definite disappointment. There is NO COMPARISON WHATSOEVER between the DVD versions and the high def HD-DVD and soon to be inevitably released Blu-ray versions.    I can't even watch Seasons Two and Three now without cringing. So much for surprise unlisted bonuses.    The conclusion is simple: Paramount should have released these in DVD only, and then in Blu-ray. Or never done acomplete set at all until the Blu-ray version came out.    Mixing up the versions is a poison pill, probably designed to make sure people will buy the set twice, once in DVD (and check out and get hooked on the high def video with HD-DVD) and then again in Blu-ray.    In fact, with the demand these things have got to be generating, there's no reason there isn't already a Blu-ray version out, or at least an announcement certain release date.    My advice: Buy season One in HD-DVD if you really must see it now, and skip seasons two and three and definitely this complete set until they release the Blu-ray versions. I wish I'd figured it all out before I blew a lot of money on DVD versions I'll never watch. Of course I'm lucky enough to have an LG player that does both Blu-ray and HD-DVD.
0689878451|1.0|I just finished reading this book to my 4 yr old.  This is the 2nd time I have run across a picture book with a homosexual theme.  I am appalled that adults feel that this subject is appropriate to bring up to such a young audience.  I have heard the argument made that it teaches them about tolerance, diversity, and how to show respect for those who are different.  What happened to the Golden Rule?  I guarantee you that children can be taught to show love and respect for all people no matter what their beliefs, race or sexual orientation.  With this said I do not agree with a homosexual lifestyle and have taught my older children this.  I have also taught my older children that we treat every human being with respect, just as we would want to be treated.  I am very disturbed  with adults trying to justify their inappropriate behavior by shoving homosexual propaganda to young children.  If you chose a homosexual lifestyle then it is your responsibility for explaining it to any children you may adopt. To teach the principle of love and respect, without the propaganda, I would recommend a book called \\"The Golden Rule\\" by Ilene Cooper.
B001LMRCP2|5.0|Excellent Album!!!   All of the songs are great.  However, the first four songs stand out from the rest.  The first four songs just seem to have an electric feel about them that just makes them come alive.  Even though Postcards From Far Away is a calmer and quieter song, it still brings a beautiful melody that only Coldplay can produce.  Overall, the album is worth every penny and then some.  Highly recommended!!!!!

At the edge of the fence that borders his house he inds a boy wearing &#34;striped pajamas&#34; Together they create a freindship that will last forever. With an army in their way, they won't back down. Join John Boyne for a fantastic story of freindship.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Dr. Horrible is fantastic.  A witty reversal of the standard superhero / supervillain roles, and very catchy songs that actually have musical merit.  The special features aren't amazing - the Wiccan subtitles are cryptic and lame, and Commentary!The Musical, while an amusing look at the fan obsession of knowing EVERYTHING, fails to live up to the actual show (still worth a listen though....)    A good product for the price.
B001H69D9K|5.0|Yup!     I saw bits of this on the internet as well, but I didn't want to watch more than 20 or 30 seconds of some of the songs featured, since I'd much rather savour the moments when I actually get the dvd. Along with some intense electronica \\"fusionesque\\", there's soulful bluesy ballads, plenty of Jeff's great innovative material, and the classy intro outside the club at night, followed by a cool little interview/introduction inside where Jeff describes how he finally gave in to having a show finally put out on dvd.     Don't worry, the quality is excellent, there's some great guests, amazing musicianship all around, and of course, the relaxed Jeff looking at least twenty years younger than he really is. And... his playing is great, as per usual! Makes one consider being a vegetarian (which Jeff has been for over thirty years!), once you consider the energy, inventive, and youthful factors emitting from a guy of that age!
B000HEWEDK|3.0|I did not care for this movie, but my Dad loved it. So for him a gave this movie a good review.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|Before I purchased the Twilight soundtrack I read the other reviews and they didn't sound positive towards the music, however I really enjoyed the soundtrack.  I love listening to music as I read and this was just perfect especially if you love reading the Twilight series.  You get the mood author, Stephanie Meyers was going for in her books.  I say if you love the movie and the books then you won't hesitate on getting the music.  Paramore does a fantastic job with the two songs they perform on the CD, and I love the Iron & Wine Song.  If you still aren't really convinced then think about this....Robert Pattinson(Edward Cullen) wrote and sings one of the songs on the soundtrack.  Like I said True Twilight Fans will love it!
B0002BO05S|3.0|The movie itself was good. The only thing that you should do is have the movie in fullscreen or wide. Let the people choose. Personaly I like full screen the best. That goes for all movies
1603580557|5.0|A must read for everybody (exception for some specialists in the field, perhaps). The type of future humanity will face, strongly depends on the extension that this area of knowledge eventually evolves and becomes largelly diffused. No amount of praise would do justice to this work of Donnella Meadows.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|I think has a special ressonance for me, as both a writer, and a traveler.  As a young college student, I wouldn't claim to have watched Woody Allen's entire ouevre, but from the twenty or so that I've seen, some I've liked, some I haven't liked, some I loved, and some I wish I didn't waste my money with, but this movie seems to be unlike anything he's done, while being so similiar to all of his films.  The dramatic display, the performance he gets from the actors, is so spot on, it is no wonder the film won best comedy at the Golden Globes.<br /><br />Vicky Cristina Barcelona is on first viewing, a travel film.  Two young American women who fall for the same spaniard painter Juan Antonio (played by Javier Bardem). Vicky (Played by Rebecca Hall in an amazing performance), is engaged to be married, likes responsibility, and doesn't like something that effects the norm, finds herself alone with the painter when Cristina--who was first drawn to the painter--gets sick, and they share a night together.  She says nothing however and the two women go back to Vicky's Aunt's house, where they are staying.  They don't hear from Juan Antonio for some days, and when they do, he calls for Cristina.  Cristina (wild, artistic bohemian, played by Scarlett Johansen in such an erotic and beautiful performance) is instantly taken and starts a relationship.  Unlike many American/Hollywood movies, Vicky neither shows bitterness nor anger, though some despondency.  What seems like a tamed love story that you begin to wonder where it will go, quickly becomes something completely different.  One night, Maria Elena (Juan Antonio's ex-wife, played by Penelope Cruz, with a fierceness that deserved the Golden Globe Nom) tries to commit suicide, and Juan Antonio picks her up from the hospital and brings her home.  Without revealing too much, the film begins to become male fantasy, and a meditation on art and connection and friendship and self-discovery.<br /><br />On the second viewing, you start to pick up the subtleness of the cogitation on love and romance, the possibilities and restraints of romantic love (unrequited love is the only form of romantic love) as the movie espouses, for neither Juan Antonio nor Maria Elena can stand each other, but then neither can they stay away from each other for long (odds are, and you might get this feeling also) they'll probably one day end up killing each other.<br /><br />On a third viewing the film becomes a meditation on art, on beauty, on how those two things coincide with love.  The tears from the Spanish Guitar, the emotion driven upward from the playing of such gentle music.  Vicky can be seen reading Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides (the book is on her bedside table), and Cristina can be seen reading Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer.<br /><br />The voice over, this has been a point of discontent for some on the message boards on IMDB.  This voice over, some say, shows what a hack Woody Allen has become.  But I must disagree.  The Voice over I believe aides in the story, it describes in a flat tone sometime the most erotic of scenes, but this aides in keeping us grounded in the story of the girls, and not in the lust, or sexuality that's portrayed in the film.  It helps develope and move away from American Travel movies, away from the actual events, and allows you to remember to watch the girls, watch their lives, watch the film, and not get drawn away into your own imaginations.  I believe the narrator was used much more effectively than it was in Little Children.  It also helps you understand where you are in the movie, through this foreign country, and gives the feel of a book.<br /><br />This movie may very well be my favorite Woody Allen film, with some excelent performances as only Woody Allen could pull from an actress (what director in the world has gotten fifteen nomination for writing--two wins--sixteen of their actors nomination for acting--five wins--and six for best direction--one win).  It was funny, romantic, intellectually stimulating, and each viewing there's something new.<br /><br />If you like Woody Allent, I do believe you will like this movie, and I do believe you will adore these characters.  For me, still in my twenties, an artist with large aspirations, in a moderately upper middle class family, this film seems to be made exactly for me.  Besides Adaptation and Wonder Boys, I haven't felt like that about a movie, and I go to see one to three movies a week--not to mention rentals and old buys.  So I feel I have a certain credibility to my opinion--but again, it is only my opinion.  I say buy it, if you don't like it, give it to someone who is the exact opposite of you, give it to your Cristina (we all have a friend that's exactly opposite of us and so much the same), and maybe you will be giving them a film that they can love as much I love it.ting, and each viewing there's something new.

0525951113|5.0|Bizarre murders claim the lives of two employees of tech gaming company, Cyberstorm. They seem to be the victims of freakish accidents of technology. Then, dead founder Matthew Sobol takes credit for the murders from beyond the grave. A Daemon is loose in cyberworld, plotting a hostile takeover of industries and society.<br /><br />Suarez makes a compelling read that grabs you from page one and doesn't let go. With an unlikely premise Suarez earns the respect of a veteran writer, detailing a world that puts the virtual in reality. Exciting action throughout. Graphic tech-violence and a scene of cyber porn earn an adult rating.
B001QD7SF0|5.0|I can't figure out the one star reviewer either. I subscribe to Rhapsody and I've heard the album in it's entirety and it's great- classic Bruce and E Street. But I won't be downloading this either- I want to have a hard copy and usually the week a CD comes out you can get it for under ten bucks. This is an album that I definitely want a hard copy of.
0740748475|4.0|While I was very happy with the collection, I was a little bit disappointed that I will be unable to throw out all of my other calvin and hobbes books, as the collection does not include any of the individual strip's commentary present in the 10th anniversary book or similar. Apart from that, it was great.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|For all you Eagles fans out there, this is a MUST HAVE! If I could give this DVD a 10, I would. I had forgotten how many wonderful number one hits the Eagles had written and recorded until I started watching this concert. The music; the vocals; the wonderful camerawork; the easy banter between Don, Glenn, Timothy, Joe and the audience, shows you can have immense talent and still be \\"one of us\\".  I have played that DVD at least 10 times, and recorded off a cd to play in my car. My husband feels the same way. We started looking for a nearby concert to go to. There's one at the Palace this year. The length of the concert definately gives you your money's worth. I would recommend this DVD highly to anyone!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchased these headphones for my husband for Christmas.  He says these are the best headphones he has ever owned!
B000W4KSWO|5.0|Indeed, the package is really cheap, with liner notes ridiculously small,<br />but since previously I had this album only on audio-tape, this CD is...<br />what can say? BEAUTIFUL...<br /><br />Although, if you're a hard-core, late-Coltrane fan, you might find it a bit too low-key, but if you like Coltrane's album with Johnny Hartman, this is something for you... Also, Ellington fans will like this Coltrenisation of their favorite composer/pianist/arranger/bandleader...<br /><br />I definitively come from more Ellington based pool (- Duke is the composer of most of the songs; one is by Strayhorn, one is by Coltrane -) and I LOVE THIS...<br />Lyrical, subtle, meditative, beautifully conceived and executed, logical collaboration of great artists.
031606792X|5.0|This series was my own personal brand of heroin!!! I read all four books in about 7 days. I have to say, when I first purchased \\"Twilight\\" I was very skeptical. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked! Now I have read many reviews of \\"Breaking Dawn\\",many I wished I hadn't, and I would like to say thank you for those optimist out there; that believe in a HAPPY ENDING! If this book had ended any other way I think I would have burned all four books in effigy!!! I enjoyed every word, every character, and YES every plot twist. With the world the way it is today; it was nice to escape for a while. Thank you Mrs. Meyer for writing a true happy ending. I look forward to seeing the movie adaptations for: New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.
140120306X|3.0|Major disappointment?  Well, minor.  For awhile I just got off on the pleasure of seeing Mina and Allan in incredibly sexy and sophisticated 1950s outfits and hairdos.  But after a few days or reading I became acutely aware that, no matter what Kevin O'Neill tried to do, it wasn't going to be enough to counteract Alan Moore's love of his own self.  Mina and Allan need the other League members with them to stay interesting.  Escaping from James Bond and British Intelligence makes for an exciting chase story, but asking us to believe that the Black Dossier exists in this, or any form, is too much of a McGuffin.  Mina goes through all this chazzerai just to find a book (and to read it to Allan as a prelude to more fabulous love-making) the details of which she already lived through in her earlier incarnations?  Come on!  The whole thing makes Mina Murray seem impossibly vain, and dumb besides, as though she's standing on line to get her own autograph.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|It amazes me to hear people moaning about being dissapointed with this new work from Springsteen.I bought this cd deluxe edition for 16.99 euros and apart from the great music and lyrics I got a fantastic 40 minute dvd of the recording in progress.Compare this with the forthcoming U2 release where it will appear in 4 or 5 different formats.You can rest assured you won't be getting any free dvds or extra unpublished videos here.Christ you'll be lucky if they print the lyrics.I'm not going to go thru a track by track list of all the songs on Working For A Dream but I will re-iterate what I said.Bruce has come up trumps again here.All tracks are pretty great.It's simply another classic.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Well, what more can I say that hasn't been said already?    This movie was brilliant! Excellent, even though there's little dialogue (at least for the first 1/2 of the movie)....To be honest, \\"Less was definitely More\\" in this movie. As a matter of fact, this movie could have done just fine without any human dialogue, and it still would have been a great film. Very emotional movie....The writers & producers of this movie did an outstanding job.    This movie has an incredible storyline, and certainly makes you think about our lives (as humans), and where we're headed, in the future, if we don't get our acts together. Hopefully, if we ever get to that point, we'll have E.V.E. & Wall-E there to help save us.    This was one of Pixar's best films.    Gonna watch it again right now!.....no, really......I am!
B000UFAURI|5.0|I admit it, at one time I was one who thought of Dave Grohl as someone who rocked hard, too, hard for me personally.    Until I gave this album a chance.     Nice, real nice. Less of a head banger than what I had heard in prior years. I like the mellower side of Dave.  I think having a family and kids has sweetened him up a tad bit and I'm digging the change.    This CD will give you a nice combo of softer tunes mixed with a few more serious rockin songs reminiscent of past material one might expect from the Foo's..    Favorite Tracks: Home, Come Alive, Stranger Things have Happened, But, Honestly & Ballad of Beaconsfield a gorgeous song.
0316168815|3.0|To be fair, it was a good book but I would not recommend it to a friend. It started off so good but it just continued to be depressing. I suppose the rape and murder of a 14 year old girl is never a comedic book theme but I was hoping for some sort of story about family coming together after tragedy, which sort of happened, but mainly it was just about grief, grief and more grief. Unless you're into having a good cry and never any laughs, this isn't the book for you.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Classic comedy and even though it was released in 1991 \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" is still a favorite to many.
0545128285|5.0|Great book, well written....nice to have another book after the finished series! Wish there would be more!
1588167461|5.0|As a young man, I was given a random style guide that detailed the ins and outs of how to dress and look like a stylish man by my grandfather. As that book has been lost or thrown out, I felt the need to have something to rely on in that case of uncertain style rules.     As an avid reader of Esquire, I decided to pick up the Handbook of Style after seeing the multiple articles in both the magazine and The Big Black Book. This book is both entertaining with various quips and facts from the political and social worlds as well as informational with all kinds of tricks ranging from how to tie a tie and what to shine your shoes with.     All in all, this is a must have for any man, young or old, with a sense of style and the vision to tweak it...
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This is one of the greats. This is a great family movie. It is extremely hilarious. I would recommend anyone to see it. Even adults. It's not to kiddish or anything. It's nothing but entertainment all around. It teaches a great lesson like many other movies. I would buy this movie a million times over if someone ever tried to steal this movie from me.
B000PY52EU|5.0|This movie is awesome, a little intense for the younger audience be aware! I liked it so much I got the sound track too. Samuel L Jackson, does a great job all around for this movie.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I am a huge fan of the Stargate, Bablyon 5, and Battlestar Galactica Franchises/Series.    Needless to say, many of my friends enjoy these shows too, and in our discussions a lot of them often threw in: \\"If you like those shows, you're bound to LOVE Firefly as well!\\" I took their advice and bought the first season on DVD. That was an awful mistake. (I re-gifted it! haha! shhh!)    This show is terrible, and that's putting it nicely! The characters are neither believable nor relate-able, the actors cannot act to save their lives, the plot is boring and predictable, and the whole western-in-space theme falls flat on its face.    I rarely, if ever, write reviews on here, but this one positively compelled me to write this. If I can, I'd like to prevent others from buying this series on the word of mouth tradition that so often helps spread Sci-Fi shows. I highly recommend you first watch the pilot online somewhere and get a taste for the show. If you like the pilot, then by all means go ahead and purchase the complete series.    However, if I may, I would first recommend you to other, far superior Sci-Fi:    1. Stargate: There is a reason the original ran for 10 seasons (SG-1), produced 4 movies (Stargate, The Ark of Truth, Continuum, 4th in the works!), spawned a 5 season spin off (Atlantis), AND is spawning yet ANOTHER spin off (Universe, debuting in Fall 2009): ITS AMAZING! This franchise is a tour de force that you simply cannot miss. It's set in the here-and-now of earth, the characters are fantastic, the plot never tires, and the comedy in it is splendidly refreshing. You simply cannot miss this series. There is simply no way I can stress how good this show is.    2. Bablyon 5: The whole first season may seem like garbage, but its absolutely necessary in order to set up the Sci-Fi brilliance of seasons 2, 3, and 4. Season 5 is a bit of a let down, but its still okay. Nevertheless, this franchise has two of the most memorable characters in Sci-Fi history without adoubt (Londo Mollari and G'Kar). The plot is wonderful and the development of many of the shows characters over the course of the show is simply astounding. Next to Stargate, this is hands down a Sci-Fi must have.    3. Battlestar Galactica: I'm sure you already know enough about this series to know that it's pretty darn good. It's gritty, sexual, and action-packed. Sometimes though, at least for me, it's too much. You can call shenanigans on me for saying that, but I like my Sci-Fi to remember that it's Sci-Fi, not a soap opera. Don't get me wrong, this is a good show, but it just doesn't have that special \\"magic\\" the likes of which make Stargate and Babylon 5 so good.    I hope this was at least somewhat helpful to any of you considering Firefly. If you are trying to amass the perfect Sci-Fi DVD collection (as I am), stick with the likes of Stargate, Babylon 5, Battlestar, ST:TNG, and ST:DS9 - you simply cannot go wrong with any of them!
B000957O7S|4.0|Hitch is the best romantic comedy yet!  I am a HUGE fan of Will Smith.  He is great in action movies and even better in a romantic role.  Will Smith and Eva Mendes were smokin' hot in this movie and had great chemistry.  The movie has so many real life examples that everyone can relate to in previous or current relationships, you can really understand the characters and how they're feeling.        Will Smith is the \\"Love Doctor\\" who helps every other man find the woman of their dreams or just the biggest babes ever, yet he doesn't believe there is anyone out there for him...kind of hypocritical...until he meets Eva Mendes.  Eva Mendes is a hard headed, successful, and independent woman who hasn't experienced love in a long time. Most of the movie they fall head over heels for eachother; while behind the scenes Eva Mendes is a columnist researching the \\"Love Doctor.\\"  There were many ups and downs to the movie but SO many laughs.     This movie is a must see with your significant other.  Even men will get a kick out of this romantic comedy.
B00005OWEG|3.0|The movie is great except that this version includes the scenes that didnt make it to the screen movie and there was a reason for that!

I was strongly tempted to toss the disk out of my room and try and hit one of the cement walls to see if it would blow up like the movie did, lol. Don't spend your hard earned cash on this one, get something better like Westworld, 2001, or the original Andromina Strain. later!
B0000E5NPZ|3.0|The films of Otto Preminger share for the most part a detached objectivity in their attitudes to character and moral issues...<br /><br />In \\"Bonjour Tristesse,\\" his gamine prot&eacute;g&eacute; Cecile (Jean Seberg) is a very peculiar girl, maybe spoiled and willful and arrogant and lazy...<br /><br />Anne (Deborah Kerr) had made her look at herself for the first time in her life...And that turned her against her...

How carefully and how seriously she went about that decision, is the tale of Françoise Sagan, published in 1954, by the time she was nineteen...<br /><br />Raymond (David Niven) is a bundle of surprises... For him, it's such a wonderful fun to have Cecile for a daughter... And loving Anne doesn't mean that he loves his daughter any less... The wealthy playboy becomes serious from the moment that Anne arrived... He could never think of her as just someone to have fun with... He does have fun with Elsa (Myl&egrave;ne Demongeot) but that's a long way from being all he wants...

For knowing that Elsa was there, she got stupidly angry and decided to leave...Then the prospect of packing and looking for a hotel was too much after that long drive so she decided to stay...<br /><br />Being too sophisticated (maybe for discovering occupied territory), Anne was as suspicious of summer as she was of Raymond in spite of the fact that she knew him 15 years ago, and was quite sure that with him, nobody is safe...<br /><br />For Cecile, Anne is prim and prissy and prude... For a woman who hates vulgarities--even when they're funny--she could never be seriously interested in a man like her father... So part of her was angry, part was happy, all of her was excited... Her father had brought a girl to the seashore, made her go out in the sun and then when she was a mess of peeling, dropped her like a hot lobster... It was unfair... Yet even while she was angry at him, she was proud that he had gotten the unattainable Anne... Anne looks now softer... She moves easier... In the morning, she seems as though she had the most wonderful secret in the world...<br /><br />Suddenly she becomes aware of a great responsibility towards Cecile, as it would be good if she stops seeing Philippe (Geoffrey Horne) and studies for her philosophy examination...<br /><br />Cecile becomes furious at her interference... Anne wants her to study and not to see Philippe... So what shall it be? For her, there'll be a man to take care of her...And she doesn't need a diploma for that...<br /><br />Now she hates Anne...

B001HY3BFE|5.0|If you liked Saxon's last release on SPV Records \\"The Inner Sanctum\\" you'll want to pick this one up too. With \\"Into The Labyrinth\\" (as well as with all Saxon releases) you have non-stop in your face metal. Think guitarists Paul Quinn and Doug Scarratt exchanging lightning fast licks, powerful drumming thanks to returning member Nigel Glockler, Nibbs Carter's bass and Peter \\"Biff\\" Byford's strong gutsy vocals. Beginning with the first two tracks \\"Batallions Of Steel\\" and \\"Live To Rock\\" you get a taste of what the remainder of the cd is like. My favorites are \\"Battallions Of Steel\\", \\"Live To Rock\\", \\"Valley Of The Kings\\", \\"Crime Of Passion\\", \\"Protect Yourselves\\" and \\"Come Rock Of Ages (The Circle Is Complete)\\". The only complaint I have with \\"Into The Labyrinth\\" is that the cd is highly compressed creating distortion on some tracks. Also, check out Motorhead's \\"Motorizer\\" and Uriah Heep's \\"Wake The Sleeper\\" all recently released on SPV Records.

1439102813|5.0|From the first page, this novel soars.  I couldn't put it down and finished it in two sittings.  I live in a retirement facility, part of which houses dementia patients.  This book reflects their situation clearly and honestly.  It deals with the emotional side, regardless of what the negative reviews want you to believe.  You must read this book, even if Alzheimer's/dementia has not touched you personally.  You will be captivated by the story and the strong writing.  Go buy it now!
0805047905|2.0|This is one classic I just don't get.<br /><br />Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? is often hailed as perfect book for the 2 and unders. It is praised for its simple illustrations, repetitive phrasing, and color education. It's a very simple, rhythmic book.<br /><br />In fact, it's so simple it begs the question: Who couldn't have written this book? It's very stereotypical for the age group. Throw in some animals, some colors, some repetitive phrasing, and voila! Instant children's book.<br /><br />Which, by itself, is fine - there's a reason for the formula. But if you're trying to find the very best books out there I just don't think this it. Let me explain why:<br /><br />First, the biggest obstacle to getting a parent to read to the child is in getting the parent motivated to make the time to read together. A dedicated parent may be willing to read through this book dozens of times, but I think unless the parent has fond memories of the book from his or her own childhood, the average adult is probably going to get mind-blowingly tired of this book after about the fifth time. It just does not have enough substance for the parent to enjoy reading it over and over again. Plus, frankly, the teacher at the end is a bit of a turn-off in a one-on-one parent/child setting.<br /><br />Also, I feel that the biggest goal of a parent is to foster a love for stories, and this book just doesn't seem to pull that off. A love of stories comes from fostering the imagination, exploring roles, and learning about the world around us. It most certainly doesn't come from memorizing colors, or the names of animals. A love of books will serve your child far, far more in the long run than a little bit of memorization.<br /><br />So, maybe everybody else sees something I don't see. Or, maybe parents are scared to criticize this book because it's a classic. If you ask me, though, you'd be much better off purchasing something that is fun to read (like anything by Sandra Boynton) or something that has a little bit of a plot and a little bit of imagination (like Eric Carle's other book, The Very Hungry Caterpillar) and leave the brown bear on the shelf.d a little bit of imagination (like Eric Carle's other book, The Very Hungry Caterpillar) and leave the brown bear on the shelf.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|It was good if for no other reason than that it showed some things that actually happened in real life.<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />1. The directing and casting both were VERY strong. Kudos to Clint Eastwood for his meticulous attention to detail.<br /><br />2. The acting was also first rate. The acting of Jolie's character, the corrupt police chief, and the killer were all excellent. Even the child actors were very good (and that is often a weak point of a movie).<br /><br />3. The plot was not at all hackneyed. At the outset, I thought this movie would be a rehash of a French film that I saw years earlier (\\"Olivier\\"). In that case, the son came back and the mother accepted him-- even though he had been murdered years earlier. These events were put together well enough to keep the audience on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />There were some historical inaccuracies in the film. It showed the killer as being captured in California-- but this was not the case. The killer was captured in Canada and extradited. This inaccuracy makes one wonder how much of the rest of the film was inaccurate-- and by how much.<br /><br />In summary: This film is definitely worth a movie ticket (non-matinee) or even a rental off the hot movies shelf.
0375805613|5.0|The Monster at the End of This Book is a fun, engaging book that will be read over and over. Although I am usually skeptical of any book with a brand-name character in it, this book really pulls off something great.<br /><br />The key element that makes this book fun to read is the interaction between the reader/listener and Grover. Grover is terrified of the monster at the end of the book and is prepared to do anything to keep you from getting there. Any child reading this book is going to be dying to turn the page.<br /><br />This book also teaches a great message for kids. Sometimes, we get really scared of the monster we think is waiting for us, but then it turns out that the monster isn't so bad after all. This would be a great book for any child dealing with a monster-under-the-bed phobia, or even any kind of unjustified fears.<br /><br />This book gets a solid 5 stars from me for it's fun and creative illustrations, great plot, great message, and engaging humor. I would highly recommend this as an addition to any home library.
B00122Z5RI|5.0|In a way, this was true roots rock, in that it hauled rock music up out of the sludge it was mired in, and put it back in the garage where it began, and where it thrived.    As rock degenerated into pop, it became clearer and clearer that it was dead and didn't know it.    These guys knew it and finished it off, thank god. Applying the well-known zombie-killing technique of \\"kill the brain, kill the ghoul,\\" they brought rock back to life by emphasizing how it felt to rock, what it had originally meant to rock.    The result? I'll offer just one little peek into what this album eventually brought us to. Ever heard of an album called \\"My Aim Is True?\\"    Death of pop, indeed.    This album killed the dead music and brought the real stuff back to life.    \\"Rock is dead; long live rock!\\"
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|Seriously, isn't too late for a Portishead 3rd. album? The whole idea sounds tired, trip-hop is way too dead, and has been dead for almost a decade now.    I wouldn't know how to label this effort from the band: a 90's nostalgia record; or one of those albums that washed out bands (like Guns 'N Roses) release so they can compensate for the shortage of royalties, due to the recent collapse of the music industry as we knew it.    They can call it the best Portishead album ever, but I'm not interested... Yeah, too late for the gods of trip-hop
B001GEL1NO|5.0|The \\"true\\" Soundgarden fans may scoff, the Audioslave mourner may ignore, but Chris Cornell stands in defiance as a solo entity.  While it may be to your chagrin, take another look, or listen rather, at this earnest offering.  Beneath the pop hooks is the same brilliant vocalization, the same raw lyrics.  Washing away all his efforts because you only Cornell should release rock, perhaps you should hearken back to his Euphoria Morning album.  Soulful R&B, folk, introspective and psychedelic jams that were no where near reminiscent of Soundgarden's hey-day.  Renew your 20-20 hindsight as you focus it forward, and enjoy an artist's journey.  Maybe someday, that reunion wish will come true.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|This is the first movie I have purchased from Amazon that included a free digital downloaded copy of the movie. I was very excited to watch the movie through the Xbox 360 acting as a Media Center Extender. The picture quality was great but the audio was lacking. I am not sure what the problem was exactly, but we definitely noticed it. We had to turn the volume up really loud to hear the characters talking and would then get blasted when there was a higher volume potion of the movie. So, we ended up putting the actual DVD in and watching it that way. The audio was MUCH better after that. It has completely turned me off to Amazon digital downloads though. I don't think I will ever buy one. If a movie I want comes with one for free, I might try again but I'm not holding my breath for it to be any better. Besides that, the movie was great and very entertaining. It's not a dark as people had led me to believe.

I thought it was a great book about a man in his 50s who has been running for many many years and the thoughts and feelings behind his running.  I like it best because I can really relate to him on a personnel level.  His running life seems similar to mine.  I like his prose, the book reads really well.  You will especially enjoy this book if your running is in a bit of a slump, and you need a motivational pick-me-up.  Enjoy!
B001KL3GY0|4.0|Has it really been that long since Franz Ferdinand burst onto the music scene since their first 2 albums, 2004's self-titled album and 2005's You Could Have It So Much Better? How times flies! The band's new album has been 3 1/2 years in the waiting, but finally we get the long-awaited results.<br /><br />\\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand\\" (12 tracks; 43 min.) has been buzzed about on the internet for a long time, and the early buzz was: a departure from the earlier sound, with a lot more synthesizers in the mix. Now that we have the proper album, it is true, to a certain extent. Check out the album opener (and 1st UK single) \\"Ulysses\\", which does feature some synths but overall as a song it leaves me a bit hungry, and a tentative way to open things. But \\"Turn It On\\" brings a much more up-tempo 'classic' FF sound. It is followed by \\"No You Girls\\" (slated to be the 2nd UK single), an irresistible sing-along song, just great. \\"Twilight Omens\\" is a 2 1/2 min. burst that is another highlight of the album (the overall sound of the track reminds me of a song heard before, although I can't place it yet). The second half of the album starts with a great \\"What She Came For\\", a typical FF tune. It all leads up to the 10th track of the album, the 8 min. \\"Lucid Dreams\\", which is the essential (and best) track on here: the first 3 1/2 min. is another great FF tune (and slated to be the 3rd UK single), but it is then followed by a 4 1/2 min. 'electronic freak-out' which must be heard to be believed, an absolutely show-stopper. The album closes with the acoustic \\"Katherine Kiss Me\\", a sweet way to end things.<br /><br />In all, this is terrific from top to bottom. Yes, it does feature more synths, but overall it is not a radical departure from the earlier work, and it's simply a band evolving while staying true to their sound. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and sure to make my 'best of 2009' list at the end of the year. I've seen Franz Ferdinand in concert a number of times, and can't wait to see how they'll bring these songs live, in particular \\"Lucid Dreams\\". (FF is rumored to be at Coachella (again) this year, and I can only hope that to be true.)g these songs live, in particular \\"Lucid Dreams\\".

B001M5UDGS|5.0|There is more to Joss Whedon than meets the eye. He likes to distract viewers from the genuine seriousness of his work by a glittering, humorous surface--and by deceptively facetious titles. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, despite the humor of the title and the very funny aspects, was a serious show that dealt with genuine moral issues. One could cite the episode The Body for an example. There have been few more emotionally draining episodes on television.    Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is the epitome of Whedon's tragedy-hidden-within-comedy method. This is, of course, like all Whedon's work, deeply funny, starting with the opening monologue. Finally we learn the vocal production secrets behind those villainous laughs!    But this is an authentic tragedy. Perhaps we should know by now that just when things seem their sunniest is when Whedon is going to really hit you with the reversal. I'm not going to give away any plot details, because it is a real thrill watching the story unfold. I had the oddest feeling as I watched that this drama really resembles the ancient Greek tragedies with their three main actors, plus a chorus. Greek tragedies were also sung, by the way, though we do not have the music to be able to re-create this element. The basic structure of Dr. Horrible is also consistent with classic Greek tragedy, though in reverse. Typically the hero attempts to achieve some goal but runs up against some limit or flaw. In Dr. Horrible, however, the 'hero' is trying to join the Evil League of Evil. So is Dr. Horrible closer to Attic New Comedy? Perhaps, as the love element is certainly predominant. I can't go into more detail without giving away too much of the plot, so I will take up this review at a later date, perhaps.    One final thought: the delights of discovering the serious sub-text to the comic surface of Dr. Horrible point out the defects in some other recent dramas. Take \\"Heroes\\" for example. This series creates a ponderous, 'serious' atmosphere to which it is constantly adding with the voice-overs of Mohindar Suresh. Surely there has been no more excruciatingly bad writing since The Architect single-handedly torpedoed The Matrix franchise in Matrix Reloaded. Empty pontificating is the precise opposite of what Whedon does.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I love this show!  Eureka has all the best that SciFi has to offer: action, comedy, science experiments gone horribly wrong and the continuing fear that something shown on a television show will come true!  I can't get enough of this show.  The situations are hilarious but somehow always solved, not by the genius population of the town, but through the ideas of the former-US Ranger and now-sheriff, Jack Carter.  He proves a lack of intelligence in comparison over and over but still manages to make things right and save lives.  This is one of the few shows out there that equally draw men and women viewers.  Watch a clip on the website and you'll want to see them all.

B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|The snorkel comes up across the midline of the face and is independent of the mask.  I is better positioned for exercise swimming than one that hangs on the right side of the mask.  I found it very difficult to get the right-sided mask to be comfortable. They always pulled at my mouth.  This snorkel does not have an outlet which is a plus/minus situation.  The valve on the outlets were always the first part to break and let in water requiring you to get a replacement snorkel.  However, without the outlet, water does get into the mouthpiece (especially when there are waves in the pool) and has to be emptied every few laps or you get water-boarded.  It helps to position your head higher in the water than you would with a regular snorkel, more like a regular crawl stroke than like snorkeling.  This takes some practice and muscle strength, but like anything that demands more effort, is probably good for you.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Everyone talks about the movie itself which is amusing not the funniest movie ever made that is for sure. Though you must watch the Voice Over Commentary with: Stiller, Black and Downey Jr. in his character's voice. To me it was way funnier than the movie itself.
B001O4XWJM|2.0|This movie has a good cast, at least on paper.  What it doesn't have is chemistry.<br /><br />The romance between Ed Harris and Renee Zelwegger seemed contrived and they are not well-matched for this film.  There is absolutely no spark at all between them.<br /><br />That's not to say that this is a bad movie, it's not.  It just could have been a lot better.<br /><br />If you want to see a good western, check out \\"Lonesome Dove\\" instead.

She sang Crazy for You and it was just her voice and guitar, that's all she needed. She has so much depth and soul. I wouldn't compare her to Amy Winehouse or even Duffy, one's too crazy and the latter is too nasal. Adele is the perfect medium. This girl can sing, I only hope she doesn't get sucked into or disappear from the music biz. Let the Big girl sing!!
1400063515|1.0|After hearing of \\"black swans\\" at a highly informative seminar about the current financial crisis I was eager to read about the highly improbable. What a disappointment.<br /><br />Little in BS is new. Almost all of it can be explained by the common notion that our brains grew up on the Plains of Natural Selection in East Africa and aren't ultra-rational computers smoothly dealing with the complex world around us. Onto the \\"deficiencies\\" of our frontal lobes the author bootstraps a cute image, that of the black swan. Turns out -- it's hard to make this stuff up -- the black swan isn't even a swan.<br /><br />What is shocking about BS is the sheer avalanche of unsupported preaching that spills out paragraph after paragraph, section after section, chapter after chapter. The reader who instantly and uncritically agrees with the author is encouraged to pat herself on the back for being as brilliant as the author clearly feels himself to be. The reader who says -- over and over again -- \\"And you back this up with--what?\\" is roundly condemned. Fortunately, such condemnation puts one in good company as, well, everyone who doesn't agree with the author is an idiot.<br /><br />The emotionality in the book is fertile ground for wonderment. When was the last time you started writing words like \\"scorn\\" on your bookmark and then, with hash marks, kept track of the number of times the word was used? First-year clinical psychology students would have a field day with BS. The answers to \\"What is the author revealing about himself?\\" would make fine reading.<br /><br />In sum, I am bewildered as to how this book captured anyone's imagination. It is, in a word, trite.<br /><br />Of course, I'm one of the idiots who can't park my skepticism and uncritically swallow BS.<br /><br />Dr. Kirtland Peterson

B000A2UBN4|3.0|Cape Fear is a good remake of the classic that starred Gregory Peck. This time Nick Nolte steps into the role and Robert De Niro is ultra-creepy as a revenge-seeking sociopath who terrorizes a young family. Juliette Lewis received a best supporting actress Oscar nomination, she is really good in this, she mixes innocence with raw teenage sensuality. The twists and turns are good but this film fades with time. Martin Scorsese directed this thriller just in case you film buffs wanted to know.
B001CZVVWS|5.0|I almost decided NOT to buy this dvd, based on the negative reviews on this page.  What a shame that would have been!  I have enjoyed this dazzling and fresh production immensely, and am thankful for what some may have thought is over-the-top production.  I found it splendid from beginning to end.  (It's not Shakespeare, it's grand opera, after all!)  The performances are intense and stirring.  The video production is fascinating and made it possible to enjoy the artistic details of the set and costumes.    Now, I don't know what system you may have been using to critique this dvd, but my Samsung Series 7, and Bose Lifestyle 5.1 audio were sensational.    If you are curious about this presentation-- my recommendation is, get it and enjoy it!

I stayed up until 3:00 A.M. reading it, and it's hasn't hardly been put down since. It's a real insiders look at the ART of tattooing, with real stories, photos and of course KAT Von D.     My favorite part was the diagram of each one of Kat's tattoo's and the story behind them. It also gives advice about getting a tattoo and how to take great care of one.

031606792X|1.0|As a teacher, I feel like a have to read these books because they're all my female students have been talking about. I got \\"Breaking Dawn\\" the same time they did and read it and oh my gosh, am I ever glad that this series is over and done with.<br /><br />First of all, Stephenie Meyer's taste in love is just weird. I thought it was just godawful and appalling that Bella (who was somehow more obtuse and irritating in this book than in any of the previous three)and Edward's consummation of their relationship ended with her covered in bruises. WTH? Could there be anything sicker than lovemaking on one's honeymoon that ends with one spouse battered? That is wrong and bad on so many levels, I'd be hard put to list them all. Let me just start by saying that a decent human being would NEVER DO SOMETHING that would put a person they loved in danger of being physically or emotionally harmed. Edward knows how physically fragile Bella is compared to him, but he goes ahead and gives in to her infantile pleadings for sex and PHYSICALLY HURTS HER. Sick, Stephenie. Really, really sick. Especially since Bella's extra-mature way of dealing with her black-and-bue body is to basically tell Edward, \\"It's okay if you bruised me because I know you love me.\\"<br /><br />Then little nudger happens and we get to see Bella being consumed by her baby while Edward turns from a stony cool boyfriend (we'll just disregard that the potential abuser actually became one on that honeymoon, shall we, girls?) into a sobbing mess that cannot do one single constructive thing. Unless you want to count his asking Jacob if he'd be willing to perform stud service on the weekends and give Bella half a dozen wolfbabies to cuddle. Honestly, just when you think Stephenie Meyers has already hated the idea of independent, strong, smart women enough, you find out that she has deeper levels of loathing to descend to.<br /><br />Luckily, the nudger loves Bella -- Edward tells us that in a very syrupy scene that made me feel that need to keep a small wastebasket handy -- although many of us reading these books haven't yet figured out exactly what is so lovable about her.<br /><br />The whole birth scene was drawn out to the point of feeling like blood was going to start pouring out of the pages like something from \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\"<br /><br />The second half of the book was somewhat better because Bella finally developed a brain. It's kind of sad that she had to DIE in order to become a non-person of substance. And it was kind of heart-warming to see Bella able to jump over rivers and crush boulders without drowning herself, breaking her leg or smashing the bones in her hands. I was proud for her that she'd grown to the point where she was enough of a woman to be able to buckle her own seat belt without Edward's help. Meyer didn't mention if Bella was wearing big girl panties yet, but here's hoping.<br /><br />I was relieved by all of this, until I got to the part about Jacob's imprinting on Nessie. The bewilderment and gagging started all over again. What kind of life does Stephenie Meyer live that she can think up all of these unbelievably disturbing male-female relationships and present them as if they're acceptable? Like, sure it's okay for a little girl to grow up with a young man that she would probably perceive as a brother or even a father figure, someone who's poured juice into her sippy cup and taken her to the potty and then....marry him? Really, Stephenie? There's nothing about that scenario that should bother anyone? E[...]<br /><br />And then there's Charlie, who is probably the suckiest, most brain-dead father in the western hemisphere. No wonder Bella had to go out and find a boyfriend who acted more like a protective, concerned father than a boyfriend -- her dad feels perfectly comfortable operating on a need-to-know basis and if you weren't uncomfortable with the relationship between Renesmee and Jacob, contemplate the triangle of Edward-Bella-Charlie, then go read a little Freud and just feel your skin start crawling.<br /><br />In the discussion groups we had about these books at the school where I teach (mothers were invited too), it was not surprising that the girls who ate these books up didn't give one thought to Bella's honeymoon bruises or Edward's offer to lend HIS WIFE to Jacob for sex or Jacob's \\"imprinting\\" on Nessie and all the future ramifications of that cozy relationship. When the adults started gently pointing some of things out, the girls (9th - 12th graders) said, \\"Ohhh. Well, gee....that IS really messed up, isn't it?\\"<br /><br />Yes, it is really messed up. These books, while they are good stories, lack so much. And they present things as normal that are so not normal. Bella is one of the worst characters ever conceived, in my opinion. She's immature, self-centered, whiny and weak -- the very kind of girl we DON'T need today's teenagers to be.l your skin start crawling.    In the discussion groups we had about these books at the school where I teach (mothers were invited too), it was not surprising that the girls who ate these books up didn't give one thought to Bella's honeymoon bruises or Edward's offer to lend HIS WIFE to Jacob for sex or Jacob's \\"imprinting\\" on Nessie and all the future ramifications of that cozy relationship. When the adults started gently pointing some of things out, the girls (9th - 12th graders) said, \\"Ohhh. Well, gee....that IS really messed up, isn't it?\\"    Yes, it is really messed up. These books, while they are good stories, lack so much. And they present things as normal that are so not normal. Bella is one of the worst characters ever conceived, in my opinion. She's immature, self-centered, whiny and weak -- the very kind of girl we DON'T need today's teenagers to be.
0316017922|5.0|If Malcolm Gladwell did not exist, we probably would have to invent him. In his third book, Gladwell continues to demonstrate his facility for taking often obscure sociological and psychological data and theories and spinning them into an engaging popular work. What distinguishes OUTLIERS from its bestselling predecessors, THE TIPPING POINT and BLINK, is that at its heart lies a passionate argument for radically redefining our understanding of what makes people successful in a way that suggests how to create opportunities for many who might not otherwise taste its rewards.    \\"Outliers,\\" by Gladwell's concise definition, are \\"men and women who do things that are out of the ordinary.\\" But he's quick to reject the myth of the self-made man (for some odd reason the examples of outliers in his book are almost exclusively male). Contrary to our cherished notion that \\"success is a simple function of individual merit and that the world in which we all grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all,\\" Gladwell argues that these extraordinary people \\"reached their lofty status through a combination of ability, opportunity and utterly arbitrary advantage.\\"    What makes Gladwell's work so entertaining and his central message so easy to grasp is his ability to muster arresting examples --- some well-known and others arcane --- to illustrate this thesis. People familiar with the story of the Beatles' early career will recall the tales of the years they spent toiling in obscurity in seedy German clubs, but according to Gladwell those endless gigs afforded them the crucial opportunity to accumulate the 10,000 hours of practice necessary to attain world class expertise. He tells a similar story of Bill Gates, fortunate enough, in eighth grade, to have access to a time sharing computer that allowed him to hone his programming skills.    Then there are the accidents of birth, highlighted in the story of Joe Flom, the New York attorney who almost singlehandedly created the field of corporate takeover law. Flom wasn't simply fortunate to be the son of immigrant Jewish parents who demonstrated an intense work ethic in the garment industry; he and several of the other titans of that field happened to have been born in the early 1930s, a \\"demographic trough\\" that ensured they would have attention lavished on them by the educational system and would face relatively less competition when they entered the job market.    The benefits of such accidents are demonstrated in other fields of endeavor. Reflecting his Canadian heritage, Gladwell explains why some 40 percent of standout hockey players are born between January and March. The fact is that the cutoff date for entry into hockey leagues is January 1st, and thus the older the player the more likely he is to manifest physical superiority that will ensure selection for all-star teams, thereby securing better coaching and all the advantages that help advance an athletic career.    The second half of OUTLIERS is devoted to a discussion of cultural phenomena that contribute to success or increase the likelihood of failure. In an intriguing discussion of what he calls the \\"ethnic theory of plane crashes,\\" Gladwell describes how something known as the \\"Power Distance Index\\" --- how much a particular culture values and respects authority --- helped account for the abysmal safety record of Korean Air in the 1980s and '90s, as the undue deference shown by junior members of flight crews to their superiors produced disastrous results.    Gladwell doesn't leave us without at least one practical prescription for overcoming such cultural handicaps to create a new and more inclusive model of success. He describes New York City's remarkable KIPP (\\"Knowledge Is Power Program\\") Academy, the prototype for some 50 such schools across the country. There, children from blighted neighborhoods are exposed to extended school hours, intensive academic and enrichment programs, and, perhaps most dramatically in our educational system, shortened summer vacations. The results are striking: 90 percent of the participants earn scholarships to private or parochial high schools and 80 percent attend college.    \\"To build a better world,\\" Gladwell concludes, \\"we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success --- the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history --- with a society that provides opportunities for all.\\" More than a collection of factoids fit only for cocktail party consumption, OUTLIERS is a provocative, consistently engaging, occasionally amusing work that has the potential to change the way we view the world, perhaps even help change the world itself.        --- Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg
B001POAVZE|5.0|Very good throughout.  If you liked the original sound of the Killers you will love this CD.
B000UJ48O0|4.0|Out of the 28 discs, there were at least 10 of them that were loose.    I don't like the fact that the discs are in cardboard sleeves, but they have yet to be scratched.    Also, you have to careful with the set, if were to hold it upside down, all the discs will fall out of place.    The perks... the first season is in widescreen and the book is really nice.
B001P81GO0|4.0|This is a wonderful book for teens and as a teenager myself i highly reccomend it. If you enjoyed the Twilight Saga, you will love this, however if you didn't, but you like vampyres, you will still like it due to its unique circumstances and whole different set of vampire rules. This series is a good read for both teens and adults.
B0019M06JS|5.0|I just finished listening to this album for the first time, and even on first listen this recording is easily the equal of Eliane's earlier Dreamer album--which I love.  Both show the talent of this lady to the fullest.  She is quite simply the Brazilian Diana Krall, but perhaps she is even more talented since she often does her own arrangements--and she does this very well indeed.  So, Eliane is physically beautiful, an excellent pianist, writes smooth engaging arrangements, is very literate (I once heard her do a radio interview), has an almost infallible sense of taste---where does it end?  Is there anything she can't do well?<br /><br />One thing is sure, Eliane knows how to sing the bossa nova.  She even knows how to take songs that were not written as bossa nova and convert them into real bossa nova gems.  The More I See You, They Can't Take That Away from Me, and Day in Day Out are transformed completely and wonderfully here into smooth sensual bossa nova pieces that sound as though they were always meant to be done this way.<br /><br />Like Diana Krall, her voice may be somewhat limited in range, but who cares when her performances are so tastefully and beautifully done.  I am not a fan of female singers who feel they must show their chops to the fullest on every song they sing, thus overshadowing and even destroying the song in the process.  Eliane obviously takes care to respect each song and, if anything, trys to increase its beauty and appeal without any though of showing off in the process.  If you liked Dreamer, you will definitely like this outing.  I expect to LOVE it after a couple more listenings.  Thank you Eliane!!!
0316143472|5.0|This is a hilarious masterpiece.  Buy it, read it, you won't regret it.  How David is able to remain so creative for so long is a mystery.  Awesome book.

The relationship between Frank and the Inspector make this film and all work (dynamics).. Add a European love interst and a few over the top car chase scenes.. We all can agree this is a charactor we care for.. Awaiting Transporter 4..
B001LPWGE6|4.0|The Bourne Set is a must have for BD. It's a must have for any type of media that you can get it on. It is a phenomenal series and Matt Damon does a tremendous job in each film. The video quality is right where it should be and the audio is there too. The set drops 1 star in my opinion simply because of the lack of a digital copy. In this day and age we are all on the go and most good people don't want to pirate films. Why should we be forced to buy it for a third time (DVD orignally, now BD & again on iTunes) in order to take it with us on our iPhones or iPods or portable media player of choice. The digi Copy should have been there.
031606792X|5.0|I absolutely LOVED Breaking Dawn.  How could anyone NOT love it!?  It was unique, entertaining, and kept you on the edge of your seat.  Anyone who did not enjoy it has no imagination whatsoever.  You have got to love Stephenie Meyer's writing  - unbelievable.  I am PRAYING that she finishes Midnight Sun.  I am going through Twilight withdrawals.  I know how frustrating it must have been to have someone deceive her in that manner and leak her draft.  But PUH LEEZE Stephenie, we all need our Bella & Edward fix.  There is still so much more you can do with these characters.  I see Bella as becoming a kind of super-vamp.  While Bella  was human, she seemed to be able to see the future in her dreams. What happened with that?  What about the Cullens overthrowing the Volturi?  What about Jacob and Nessie?  We NEED to know.  At the end of Twilight and New Moon you teased us with a chapter of the next book.  Could you please think of the draft as a little bigger teaser and complete the book?  Midnight Sun really gave a wonderful insight into Edward's thoughts and what he was going through.  It made me love his character even more. By the way, I really enjoyed \\"The Host\\".  You do have a wild imagination.  However, the whole time I was reading it, I was wishing it was about Bella and Edward.
0316096199|5.0|The worst of all crimes is taking away another person's free will; that is what rape does to a victim. Rape is intentionally taking another person's free will away from them, sexually. In the novel, Lucky by Alice Sebold, the author actually talks about herself being a rape victim when she was barely a freshman in college. The book begins already with a very graphic and descriptive view of what happens to Sebold, as she is being raped and beaten in the park only a few blocks from her dorm building. It gives off an exact point of how a victim is feeling and thinking while she is being rape. Readers could get an insight on how difficult it was for the victim during the rape process and to understand the mind of a rape victim as she goes undergoes her new life.  Because of the rape, her life changes drastically that could either be negative or positive. She not only has to tell her family and friends, who try to support her but not knowing what to say, she has to go through her college years being known as \\"the girl who was raped.\\" She later not only finds her rapist but she also trials against him in the hope that he is given what he deserves.<br /><br />V.L., Bolsa Grande High School
0375714839|4.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is an interesting read.  It gave an excellent picture of life for an Iranian girl both before and after the Islamic revolution.  In Western society, we often tend to think that Muslim women aren't aware that their lives are restricted--or perhaps that they are, by in large, complicit in their own societal prison.  \\"Persepolis\\" allows us, as Western readers, to understand that neither view is absolute; quiet rebellions took place every day.  Perhaps \\"Persepolis\\" is the key to unlocking the door between Western interpretation of Islamic societies, and the reality.
B00064X3BI|5.0|I was always disappointed with the sound of this recording - even the MFSL Gold version.  This SACD version captures my attention even in the 2-channels that I listen to.  I want to keep listening and that is the true test.  Recommended.
0307269752|5.0|I just finished reading this and I have to say it was a page turner!! I have not read a book as exciting as this in a long time. I love the way the author builds up the characters in the beginning and so you feel like you know them personnally. So when the books moves along you can't possibly put the book down until you know what happens. Someone said it starts off slow but I really don't think so. I love the way the characters are built up in the beginning and without that part of the book it would not have been as exciting. That is what makes this book brilliant in my opinion. The only thing that slowed me down a bit was the Swedish names for people, places, and things because I am not familiar with this language, But as soon as I got used to it the book went smoothly. Highly recommended. PS: There are some violent scenes in the book and it deals with violence against women in case some are sensitive to this type of issue. Happy reading.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|It's the kind of music that sticks in your head and in your heart.   Funny plot, great songs and great acting...   When will there be a sequel II?
B001L5SXQG|1.0|Incredible. It is incredible that the music buying public continues to support this DREK! Boring, pretentious, derivative. self absorbed! Not to mention, ol' Bruce is so caught up in ANY CAUSE.....what ever happened to rock n roll? Which he used to claim was his purpose on the planet.  Listen folks, go get yourself a Norton Records catalog. Spend an afternoon rediscovering what good music is all about. Shell out some coin on something worth listening to. Remember, this Rock n roll was once supposed to be fun. No fun here.Drek!One more thing.....who are these \\"arteests\\" who need to perfect it all in the studio and take forever to record product. Forget the polish Bruce. This RnR was all supposed to be somewhat spontaneous....which would make it GOOD. None of that here.  Bruce ran out of steam in 1972. People who know music, know that.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The TV series is just flawless.  If you were so inclined I'm sure you find something wrong, but what is so wrong with calling something flawless.  I love the acting and the cinematography is great.  Best thing HBO has ever done.

B001LF4IA6|4.0|I love Bruce Springsteen and the East Street Band...I've seen his concerts more than anyone else's and I have all his CD's. Before the CD Working On A Dream, came out I started with the very first album I bought<br />by Bruce and listened to everything. I LOVE his earliest works and Darkness on the Edge of Town remains my FAVORITE. Still, I respect him enough to realize he is wring and recording different music from then today and he is a lot older. As a fifty something guy myself, I can relate. If you listen hrd to this CD, you still can hear Bruce. I'd hate it, if I got a retread of Born to Run or USA...Too many artists today try to look back, and just can't go back...I'm glad he's nmot trying ecept in concert of course. Thsi CD does not disappoint unless you want to look backwards...It's precious.<br />  My only complaint....I don't like the media hype for it...I feel like<br />Bruce should speak for himself....

B000001FQQ|3.0|Ok, there are already DOZENS of reviews posted for HITS, so what are the chances anyone will read mine, let alone vote for it?  Slim at best.  But I don't care.  HITS is not one of Kiss's standout albums, but I do like it, so here's my review.<br /><br />At first listen, I was not impressed.  In fact, I was pretty disappointed.  Even after a couple of listens, I couldn't remember any of the songs except Hide Your Heart (which got alot of airplay as the first single) and Forever (because it was &#34;the ballad&#34; of the album).  This led to me feel the album was a throwaway.<br /><br />But I do love 90% of Kiss's music overall, so a few years later on a long car ride (about 36 hours round-trip), HITS was one of the tapes I decided to bring along.  I figured I'd try to get more familiar with it.  With 15 tracks, the album was huge for its time (released 20 years earlier), so maybe I just needed more time with the songs.  Well, surprisingly, alot of the songs did get my attention once I was able to sort them out in my head.<br /><br />The opener, Rise To It, sounds like Bad Seamstress Blues from Cinderella's &#34;Long Cold Winter&#34; album...very bluegrass/hillbilly sounding intro.  But after that, the song itself is actually pretty rockin'.  I think its downright awesome with the alternating Paul/Gene vocals midway in.  This is Paul's song, overall.<br /><br />Other Paul songs I took to were Hide Your Heart (no big surprise) and King of Hearts.  KoH just really rocks my socks off!  Nice guitar work & Paul sings his heart out (no pun intended).<br /><br />In general, though, I preferred Gene's songs on this album.  Betrayed & Prisoner of Love seemed really inspired to me, like he took his time with them, more so than his Animalize & Asylum efforts.  And I can't say why, but I could imagine him singing Love's A Slap In The Face in full Demon-costume during the Dynasty/Unmasked era.<br /><br />It was also nice to finally hear Eric Carr sing an original song on a studio album.  Little Caesar may not have been an instant classic on its own, but it was a good song overall.  Just sad that he finally sings lead, and it turns out to be his final album before his untimely death due to cancer.  (Ironically, Bruce Kulick would also finally sing lead vocal on his last Kiss album, Revenge.  Thankfully, this was not due to death.)<br /><br />So those are the standout songs from HITS in my opinion...Rise To It, Betrayed, Hide Your Heart, Prisoner Of Love, Love's A Slap In The Face, King Of Hearts, and Little Caesar.  I liked Forever, too, but it got so much airplay I've grown bored with it.  The rest of the songs...not horrible, not spectacular, just kind of there.<br /><br />Hopefully, despite all the other reviews, someone will read my review, give those few tracks a re-listen, and find more enjoyment out of HITS than they originally had.on its own, but it was a good song overall.

B000OQF6N6|2.0|I feel like there's something meaningful in the second verse of \\"Tarantula\\"--\\"We are the real/If real ever was/And just because/We are the real/They feel we have enough/We are the real/'Cause someone gave us up\\"--but I'm not sure what it is.  They aren't the real, you know; only Billy Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlain came back.  You can't make the Smashing Pumpkins with those two, but you CAN make a new album and label it a Smashing Pumpkins record, or so they figured.  The result is a jungle of mordacious guitar work and acrid growling (whining?) from Corgan, the swollen Fu Manchu behind this whole evil plot.  For Pumpkin diehards, it'll be enough.  But there used to be something to their music, something it conveyed that clung parasitically to the indie environment of the early- to mid-Nineties.  In this fallow wasteland of an album, there's only noise.

0679746323|5.0|This is certainly not the first book I read on Chinese contemporary history, but this one is mindblowing!  It ought to be mandatory reading for every Chinese person, which would help in understanding what has been going on in their own country, but unfortunately I understand it is banned in China.  Too bad, but maybe some day.  The amount of painstaking research that the authors must have gone through, in order find as much first hand information as possible, is almost beyond comprehension.  It is a story that grabs you, and of all the despotic leaders the world has seen in the last 100 years, this man takes the price.  How one person could manipulate a quarter of the worlds population, and almost single handedly develop such a cult, is unbelievable, but we know it happened...

B001LF4IA6|2.0|Let me just sat that I enjoy and have been a fan of Bruce Springsteen for many years.  Having said that, I must say that his latest release \\"Working On A Dream\\", has proved to be somewhat of a let dowm for me after a few listens.  This Cd has received tremendous publicity upon it's release, from all the media outlets, including TV, the newspapers, the presidential election, magazines, and even the upcoming Superbowl.  The cd has its moments, like the title track, and a few others, like \\"Mr Lucky\\" and the \\"Wrestler\\".  The problem, is that this cd has been pushed to 5 star status by the media, who also are insync with Springsteens political views.  The truth of the matter is this latest album by the Boss, does not even come close to the quality of \\"The Rising\\", or even \\"Magic\\".  I would be dishonest, if I wrote down and stated \\" this cd is the second coming of \\"the River\\", \\"Born To Run\\", or \\"The Rising\\".  I'm sure there are others who are fans like myself, who think everything Bruce does is top shelf, but I'm not one of them, and it is my opinion here, that \\"Working On A Dream\\", misses the mark and is less than average.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|I listened to the \\"Sneak Peak\\" of this album on NPR.   I couldn't wait to hear it on a proper setup as even on the PC speakers you could tell the sound so of this was \\"richer\\" than most of Springsteen's recent work.      Working on a Dream has a very different sound from the last two albums. The sound is lusher and the outlook is happier than the past two. It sounds like Bruce has been listening to a lot of the Byrds and the Beach Boys.  Yeah, there are a lot of strings (heresy?) on this album, but I think it works on the songs that they are on.  There is plenty of great guitar work.  The only quibble I have is that there is not much of Clarence on this one (he only steps out on \\"Lucky Day\\" and \\"This Life\\".    This album has knocked the latest Derek Trucks Band CD off the system for now.    I have listed to the whole thing several times and it sounds awesome on headphones on a proper system!    It's hard to single out one song above the other, but if you told me to pick a few I'd go with \\"Outlaw Pete\\", \\"Life Itself\\", \\"Lucky Day\\", and \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" for a start.  The two \\"extras\\" are a nice bonus.   \\"The Wrestler\\"... what can you say?   The Academy miseed the boat but at least they appreciated \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\".   I am 50-50 on \\"Night with the Jersey Devil\\" but it may grow on me.        A LOT of folks really are slamming \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\".   Folks, it's supposed to be a fun song.  I seriously doubt the man is really stalking Pathmark letching on checkout girls.   He has written goofy tunes before, and he did it here.    I'd like to say a word to the \\"experts\\" who like to trash the Boss. It's a free country so vent. Thing is you are in the minority. Most of you have probably never accomplished a damn thing and slagging someone who has is what gets you off. If you don't like it, don't listen.    It seems that the objection seems to be that the \\"Old\\" Springsteen is missing. A lot of folks want to hear the \\"Born to run\\" or \\"Darkness\\" over and overagain.   That is not a bad thing as they are classics.   However, the mark of a great artist is someone that doesn't keep re-cycling his \\"trademark\\" sound but branches out.    \\"Seeger Sessions\\" and some tunes on this WOAD may not be everyone's piece of cake, but I find it awesome that age of 60, the man was/is still trying different.      I remember reading somewhere years ago in an interview where Bruce said that someday he'd like to do a whole album of love songs.  No message songs, just love songs.   Well, it looks like he finally did it.    And while it may not be a \\"message\\" album like he has been making lately, it IS nice to hear him having \\"fun\\" on this one.    Bruce Springsteen has been a constant source of pleasure for me for over 30+ years. While other artists go on tour recycling he same old stuff, he is still out there trying new sounds at the age of 60. It doesn't always work but give credit for trying!    Hey, and if he sounds \\"happy\\" on this album, why not, he's earned it.  I, for one can't wait to see some of these tunes in concert.
031606792X|5.0|I was really surprised at so many negative reviews of this book (as well as sad to see so many spoilers...)    This 'baby-boomer' and young grandmother loved it! Yes, it was a bit different than the first 3 in format but once I finished it I couldn't wait to read it again.    Perhaps it's just that after seeing quite a bit of the realities of life for so many years, it's just nice to read a happy ending...    I highly recommend the entire Twilight series. I've read all 4 of them twice now and will probably start in on them again in a couple months. It's a great way to relax and leave the challenges of adulthood and the 'real world' behind for a while...

B0000DC14V|5.0|This is one of the best western's ever made.When OEJ was released it was bashed by critics everywhere.If the film seems a bit cut up,that's because Brando's director's cut as submitted to universal was 4hrs and 30 minutes long.Universal studio editors took Brand's film and cut it to peices.Even cut up and incomplete OEJ stands a Brando's expensive,slowly made,masterpiece,loved by avid western fans,hated by studio execs because of it's price tag,and because the visual perfection and awesome cast of the film,along with the the excellant script,cinematogrophy,and a underplayed but riveting performance by Brando.. resented  if not doomed by the boys in the front office,who considered it excessive and over the top for a first time director.Critics were viscious,attacking OEJ as a pretensious,flop.That was in 1960.    Forget that Kubrick was originally hired to direct the film,as well as Elvis to play the Rio Kid.Kubrick dropped OEJ because of script issues,Elvis dropped OEJ because The Rio Kid was a little too provocative for him.Enter Brando..he was willing to direct and star in OEJ.The OEJ project geared up again,Brando brought in some of his buddies,Karl Malden,Slim Pickens,Ben Johnson,Wally Cox and Katy Jurado,to play the various characters found in the rather long story of revenge..next Brando built an exact replica of Monterey city circa 1880.The Monterey set was expensive to build.It set the stage for over-budget spending that plagued the project from day one.Then shooting began,it continued at a turtle's pace.Brando the perfectionist came out,he re-shot scenes up to 20 times,which drew heavily on the already strained budget.The movie industry waited with attentive curiosity.Brando completed the film in August 1959.He edited most of the film himself.The final director's cut was 4hr 23minutes long.Studio Execs called it too long and demanded it be cut to about 2 hours,Brando refused any further editing changes to OEJ saying it was perfect and any changes would change the continuity of the film.The final cut put OEJ at 2hr and 20 minutes.The story line was altered into fragments of the original.It's modified slow pace made the film seem long and often boring.OEJ was the biggest bomb of 1960.The cast,thinking they were working on a classic,were bitter toward the Universal execs who had Brando's Western edited with such relish,the film was at times not recognizable even to some members of the cast.   Actually,OEJ is a great Western,one of the best ever made.How can this be,in 1960 it was a miserable failure?When the word got out that Brando was going to direct a western for universal studios,and it would have a great cast,large budget,and the best technical personnel in the business working behind the scenes,everyone.. execs,reporters,and the public in general awaited the release of OEJ to hopefully see the film and Brando fail.It was released and it failed many of the attacks on the film were based on jealousy for Brando.Brando was a revolutionary actor who redefined acting,in doing so,he had rocked lots of boats.OEJ was the visual proof of\\"what goes around comes around\\".The critics of the day hated the film not because OEJ was a bad film so much as it was a chance to bash Brando.His talent urked the best of them.   Roger Ebert called OEJ\\"certainly one of the best of the genre,with perghaps one of the best scripts ever in action cinema\\".    Even edited to death,Brando had made a great film.Today it stands as a film ahead of its time.\\"Every frame is created by a master director who learned much from the great directors of his day\\"    OEJ has one of the best casts ever assembled in cinema.The cinematography is the best,the script is better than the best and Brando gives one of his finest,most complex performances as the Rio Kid.
0743496736|5.0|Nineteen Minutes is a wonderfully written novel about a tragic school shooting and the events leading up to it.  Picoult was able to capture the emotion and hard truth that was behind the shooting, which can often be a difficult thing to do.  She had me captured every time I picked up the book.      Her ability to write in such a way that is so detailed and real is the reason why I think this book is so moving.  She has your heart aching for the families of the shooting victims, but at the same time enabling us to have compassion for and willingness to understand the shooter.  She does a beautiful job at creating such developed characters that come alive for the reader.  The complexities (Alex's inabilities to connect with her daughter Josie) and tiny details of their lives make the book such a fabulous read.         This is a book that makes people think about the hard things in life that nobody wants to think about, especially if you have kids.  Bad things, like school shootings, can happen and this book encourages you to think about these things and makes you realize there are things that can be done to prevent such a horrific event from happening at your community's school.

B001I82RVS|4.0|In coming up with a way to describe Tokyo Gore Police I'm tempted to go with my original idea and use the term \\"WET\\" as lets be honest any movie with gore in the title is either using that as a deflection or has as many gory bloodsoaked bits as can be crammed into a film. In the first opening minutes not only is someone shot in the head but the head in all its glory explodes outward from within sending shimmering piles of red goo hurling into space while several pieces of head are attached still at the neck. Really though the best way to describe Tokyo Gore Police other than to do a laundry list of mutilations is to say that it took me back years ago when I had discovered Japanese horror and would pull out something like Miike's Dead or Alive to show friends the final scene. This is something you want to show someone just to show that it even exists.  The plot as it is revolves around a privatized futuristic police force being set up to combat crime and more specifically engineers, mutants humans who when parts of their body are amputated grow some form of bio weapons in their place. Ruka, the police forces main combatant against engineers is searching for the cause of them which involves key like tumors that need to be severed in order to kill them. Describing anymore of the plot would ruin the film which is filled with a double crosses, conspiracies and in the end a full fledged coup. And trust me when I say that if You're someone who purchases this film because you have a love for this particular type of cinema the experience is something best had fresh.  As a film itself from the makers of The Machine Girl I will say that its more polished than that one and was better at maintaining my interest more. I'd chalk that one up to a better sense of humor this time with a strong bit of satire to the procedings- as well as at least some more profesional acting even though most of it is still pretty goofy. The better parts of the film for me were small asides that seem to be taken from Paul Verhoeven where We get small commercials for the police force or a new remote execution scheme where the family of a victim get to kill the doomed with something like a Wiimote. Everything looks slick and pretty even though there were probably budget constraints at times. The effects though are really good stuck mostly with physical effects. Most of the gore involves actions towards puppets with some CGI but its well done in the mood of the film. My personal favorite though was some kind of quad-amputee who comes into play at the end of the film with its leg and arms replaced with swords.  Its a pretty cool movie. I'm a bit disappointed in the dvd. The image and sound is perfect but all you get in the way of extra features is a couple of trailers. This is something I would have loved at least a twenty minute featurette but then again at a twelve dollar price I guess thats an easy miss on my part.  Anyway if you like movies like Dead or Alive or even Brain Dead check this one out. Its short sweet and something to put on and watch with like minded friends.
0312427999|4.0|There are plenty of well-written and thought provoking reviews already swirling regarding Shock Doctrine, so I will limit my review to how the book affected my worldview. Suffice to say, for me, I have just taken the \\"Red Pill\\".    To Ms. Klein's credit, her extensive research and analysis has created in me a desire to research further - to understand both sides of the argument and where (and why) ideologies derail. Where I had easily embraced free markets and capitalism as the hallmarks of a thriving democracy, I have now been introduced to a deeper discussion that invites a surrender of deeply held assumptions. (Who knew a thirst for understanding economics could ever be developed by reading one book. Economics teachers - take note.)    Like all authors, she does have her own worldview and her historical analysis is presented through this lens. However, it is specifically because of her documented research that I cannot simply dismiss her presentation as rhetoric or diatribe.    An excellent book should promote discussion and prompt action. Shock Doctrine has done that for me.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|I just bought this new music from the Boss & band, it is really great music. Bruce & E-Street continually evolve with their music. Most listeners keep expecting hard rockin songs, but as we get more mature{older for some of U} our way of thinkin does actually change as will our music. No but can continue with their old ways or then they will be considered as repetitious. Change with the band & except the music and let it guide U. I listened to the new metallica cd & couldn't tell the difference in their first & last cds. There was no evolving in their music just lots of noise, so evolve with Bruce & E-Street and enjoy.

B001LF4IA6|1.0|If you enjoy Bruce Springsteen's music, the insightful lyrics, the uncanny storytelling abilities coupled with one of the greatest rock voices ever and, icing on the cake, if you truly believe that the E Street Band is the best rock'n roll band in all the land, well...<br />Well, you should ignore Working On A Dream and pretend that horrendous release never happened. None of what makes Bruce Springsteen is to be found on this record and as far the E Streeters, well, we're told they're playing on the album so that must be true ( except for Clarence Clemons who is almost 100% MIA ) .<br /><br />Still, if you have no taste in music in general and enjoy over-produced, corny, lame songs that even Bon Jovi would be ashamed of, you should give WOAD a listen.<br />Enjoy such masterpieces as \\" Queen of the supermarket \\" ( sorry, no 3rd degree there I'm afraid...) , \\" Surprise, Surprise \\" ( this one should leave you speechless ) or the comically naive \\" Outlaw Pete \\".<br />Sadly, the list of casualties goes on and on and with the exception of the haunting \\" The Last Carnival \\", which must be had by all, WOAD is nothing short of a major stain on Springsteen's outstanding resume.<br /><br />Blame it on greed. Blame it on the fact that Springsteen knows most of his fans will buy anything with his name on it. Either way, stay away from this corporate stinker !!!
B000W4D94I|5.0|We Loved this movie when it came out and bought it on VHS. When I got the Blu-Ray Player Twister was one of our first disc's and it is Truely Amazing!!!! This Movie really POP'S out at you.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|There are no words to describe the amazingness that is this DVD.  The show itself is well worth the price of the product, but the special features are what make it a must-have.  They wrote an entire second musical for the commentary, you're basically getting two shows for the price of one.  Then they also have making-of featurettes, a \\"real\\" commentary, hilarious Evil League of Evil application videos (my favorites: The Reverend and Lord Stabbington), and more.    Buy it.  You'll thank us later.

B001GZ6QC4|3.0|The Dark Knight is a great movie, and if all you're looking for is the feature film, this is a great product.  However, there are ZERO special features on this version, which I was sad to see (I thought there would at least be a filmmaker's commentary).
B0000E6XH3|5.0|this is an AMAZING movie, i became a daft punk fan because of this movie.  is you like music you'll enjoy this very much, my five year old nephew watched it and now its one of his favorites, besides Cars and Happyfeet. basically this is a great movie for everyone to watch.
B001BGTWXI|1.0|I've been a fan since Iowa and my favorite personally is the first album...I cannot believe they went this direction. I know some people say if bands don't change they fail well...not true...look at Tool they haven't changed all that much and all their albums have hit no. 1. Also Joey Jordison himself says his favorite album is Iowa and he wants to go even heavier than that. This album doesnt touch self titled or Iowa and in no way shape or form represents what Slipknot CLAIMED to stand for from the beginning...these guys were there through the worst and best days of my life then it's like the fans they targeted at first no longer matter because Corey and Clown who were pretty much responsible for Slipknots changes have said many times they don't care what people think. Well that includes the fans..Im a maggots maggot and I take that as a slap in the face...fortunatley though I know the MAIN contributors from the 1st two albums still care what the fans think. So thank you Joey Paul Jim and Mick. . .this album should have never been made.

B001GQO50I|1.0|This is the first official live release of the Doors in their prime. All the other cd's are from 1970 and by that time Jim Morrison was going into half drunken poetic recitals during the songs and they had clearly passed their live prime (though there were some good songs from then). But in 1967 the Doors were in another realm live. Next to the Velvets, this is about the only group that had a darker element to the sound. And you get to hear the full version of \\"the End\\" with the oedipal sequence and some bizzare lyrical improvisations intact. Apart from a few blues covers the Doors weren't \\"just starting out\\". This is the Doors at their best live.<br />  Sadly, because of the sound quality, as the other reviews detailed I can only rate this one star. Its lousy. I've heard the \\"concert issues\\" of them and they are far better. The surviving members of the Doors could and should have released the original masters. Not only for the listener but to honor Jim Morrison. You can grasp what the Doors sounded like live during their prime era which influenced punk, proto-punk and goth. But the sound quality is abyssymal. They need to reissue the original master tapes to the public or at least as penance allow the next winner of \\"American Idol\\" to be the lead singer for the \\"Doors of the 21st Century\\". Take your pick. Just not this release until they get it right. Jim Morrison would agree.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|Anyone who grew up hearing Abba will be disappointed.  The singing voices are mediocre and the acting basically phoned in with the exception of Christine Baranski, a seasoned Broadway actress, who gives an amazing performance.  Abba needs to be heard sung by Abba.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Yes, the band was completely fracturing here and the album is more Waters with Floyd sidemen then a group effort.  But when I listen to this album, I hear the most genuine emotion the often chilly group committed to tape as Waters deals with the emotions surrounding the death of his father in WWII, his own personal relationship troubles, and the state of the world in the early 80s.  The album doesn't have the instant accessibility of their classic run in the 70s, but rewards the listener over time in ways that even Dark Side of the Moon does not.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00168HARG|5.0|I had my skepticism about the show from the previews and commercials. My biggest worry was they would overuse TV-budget CG-effects for the Terminators, and thankfully that has not happened. In fact, the show has far less action sequences than the movies. I think the whole first season has less gunfire than T2. But what it lacks in summer-movie action it more than makes up for with great story, interesting characters, and an amazing premise.    If you only buy one show on Blu-ray, get this show. Because of the writers strike, season 1 has been cut down to only 9 episodes, but they are all memorable. This show deserves to be in glorious 1080p, and it shows. The Terminators actually appear very well rendered in HD and not overly fake. The sound is absolutely stunning on the Blu-ray as well, and if you're a fan of the music in the show like me, you'll appreciate the audio track.    No spoilers here, but I've found the continuity-inconsistencies to be minor and the story in each episode to be deeper than a lot of the other shows out there now. Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles does not need to rely on outrageous plot twists or shockingly unexpected gimmicks to captivate the audience, but it is far from predictable. I love the music from this show too, it's not too varied but the main theme sticks in your head in a good way.    Summer Glau's performance as Cameron is at times humorous and haunting. Lena Headey portrays Sarah in more of a motherly guardian figure for her son than the Sarah from the movies. It's like she really believes he will save mankind whereas in the movie she seemed more concerned with just keeping him alive because she had to. And Thomas Dekker makes for a great John. It's clear he just wants to be a normal teen at times, but it also shows he understands how serious the situation is. I honestly will admit that I see more of the strategist/military leader in him in the second season, though they've done less to really make me buy into how much of a computer genius he is or that he's capable of reprogramming Terminators. I suppose it's been established from T2 that he's something of a hacker, but the kid barely goes to school and seems a bit more angst-ridden this season.    Here's hoping that this show goes on for many more seasons. It was a close tie between The Sarah Connor Chronicles and House MD for me, but this show really took the spot as my favorite show of 2008.
0525951113|4.0|For those who understand how technology works, and what it is REALLY capable of, the premise of this book is similar to others where the machines take over. However, this time it isn't the machines but, rather, software processes collectively known as the \\"Daemon\\" that are the protagonist here. There's plenty of good, evil, sex, who's the real bad guy(?), and the usual suspense wondering how bad things can get really get but, and it's a big one, Mr. Suarez does set the reader up at the end. He leveraged the ending to set up for a sequel, or sequalae (who knows), at the disappointed expense of this reader. Something of a cheap trick, or was it the publisher's, but it does not diminish in any way what Mr. Suarez accomplished in this great, first book. As he masters his craft I've no doubt that he will take his place at the top, although he will have to explain the technology more clearly to the Luddites in the crowd if he wants to go mainstream. Well worth your time and effort - be prepared to think about some things that seem far-fetched - perhaps they aren't?

B000VXLC3K|3.0|I used to sit around and listen to this with my hippy pals as if it were philosophy.  Now, nearly 40 years later, I must admit that I found a lot of extremely callow - it hadn't aged well, unlike many of my old favorites like Freewheelin Bob D or Rumors by Fleetwood M.  The ideas - get up every morning with a smile on your face, you make me feel like... -are about as deep as hippy speak.  Even her voice seems limited in range to me, without a certain depth that I expect from jazz or soul vocalists.  While some of the extra tracks on this are interesting and indeed raw, it is still the same old stuff.  On the positive side, I did like to tap into the emotions I was feeling then and remember intimately, but again this will not enter my pantheon of much replayed favorites.  I admit, this has more to say about my taste, so I don't pretend it is objective.<br /><br />I would recommend this to old fans so long as they don't expect to love it the way they did as teenagers.  Alas, it was disillusioning to me to listen to it critically.
B00008G9JO|5.0|Heavy Horses is an underrated piece of work. Although arguably missing some of the \\"fun\\" of Songs From the Wood..It is still filled with melodies that stay with you. I think many reviewers of Ian's work just dont get it(thick as two short planks). Much of Tull's work is an uncanny mixture of acoustic,celtic,folky, music in a Rock setting. This album shows this in spades. \\"Acres Wild: with its mixtures of acoustic guitar, mandolin, bagpipes and Martin's wonderful electric guitar blend perfectly.The musicianship is beyond reproach. Barrie Barlow, on drums and percussion, really shines on this album. The extra tracks are fun and \\"living in these Hard times\\" is indeed timeless. Many retractors should listen again with an open mind and maybe a pint(lol).
B000NA28I4|2.0|When making this review I did my best to keep from being biased by the book. But anyone who even knows the basic storyline of the book knows that this movie was a complete mockery of the book.    Even after watching the movie for the 4th or 5th time I couldn't detect even a hint of character development or even an illusion of a time line. Saphira, one of the main dragon characters, becomes some superpowered tank weeks to even days after her birth. Brom, Eragon's mentor early in the movie, is a big refreshment but through out the whole movie Eragon stays a hot headed, spoiled, brat who thinks he can do anything as long as he whacks it with a sword hard enough. Eragon meets an Elf named Arya who he never knew even once in his life and suddenly he has an almost obessive loyalty to her and risks his own life to save her.     I must admit that they did an impressive job on the dragons and the scenery and you can tell they spent a lot of their budget on the special effects team. But the battles were still very unimpressive and many of the scenes that should have been huge turning points in the movie weren't eye catching in any way other than the flashy spells. Frankly, the whole movie movies in a straight line and you are left at the end of the movie with the question, \\"What just happened? It's over?\\"     If the movie had tried to have a more independent story line from the book it could have been a very imaginative movie. But it was obvious through out the whole movie that it was trying to cling to the scenes from the book and that dragged it down. If you are thinking about buying this movie, I would say ultimately that you shouldn't even waste your money on it. Find a friend with the movie and watch a few scenes and that is all you really will need.
067144901X|5.0|This is a wonderfully fantastic book. My 18 month-old loves it. We read it at least 3 times while she's on the potty. :) As soon as she sits on her potty she asks for the \\"Moo book\\".  I read the lines and she says the sounds that the animals make! It's so interactive that it makes her relax and go-potty. :) To say we love this book is an understatement! :)
B001L5SXQG|4.0|Bruce Springsteen is one of those pure and simple musical entities. He is right there before you. Leaving himself bare to observe his deepest thoughts. His passions, his fears, his interpretations of his multitude of emotions. His greatest gift is in his ability to make all of these ideas and ideals feel universal to the listener.<br />On this record he finds himself nearing 60 years of age and still graciously surrounded by his long time band of friends and equally stellar musicians.<br />They walk through the fields of life with power, grace, subtlety, vivid conciousness and above all a joined sense melody.<br />He really is one of the last great sculptors. A bard for this age and the ages to come.<br /> When the tumbleweed of these generations have blown beyond the horizons of the present.<br />His music. Including most of these songs (I would have excluded \\"Queen Of The Supermarket\\" and \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" from the final release). The rest will take us to a place to which Bruce surely has his heart attuned.<br />A place with a lovely panoramic. Both the epic and the novella.

Shes helping to bring that European type music to America. Love Game is also very good. It's cheasey, but great beats. I think her image is crazy, but overshadows the music to much.

They would have done better to use unknowns that had actual singing talent. F. Awful.

Ray of Light is almost like a breath of fresh air. It's great, it really works for her voice. It really show cases it. It's also very relaxing to listen to. Frozen, is alittle slow, but great balled. Nothing Really Matters great techo, and Ray of Light is a great pop song.I can actually enjoy this whole album and like it. This is really  one of her best albums in my opinion.
B00005UEAR|5.0|How many rock bands that have been making music after twenty years are STILL making relevant music ? Most bands that have been around that long are still performing their couple of hits, but nothing that is very interesting in this century. This band just keeps making ambitious music well into this decade.     I can't believe the second side of this album is getting some bad reviews !!  I am only commenting on the second side as I was blown away by the performance on Score DVD. Absolutely fantastic !! Didn't hit me the first or second time I listened to it. But now it is my favorite part of the DVD concert. Brutal metal (The Test that Stumped Them All), beautiful orchestral parts (Overture and About to Crash)and great pop/synth songs (Solitary Shell).    Similiar to Scenes from a Memory and almost as good, which is saying something. Scenes from a Memory is one of the best progressive rock albums ever released, but this isn't that far behind.
B001NB6IN8|3.0|I saw Fall Out Boy in concert, last december. And i wasnt a big fan then, and im still not now. (even though the tickets were free). They just overplay their crap to much on the radio, and it's so boring. Compared to alot of bands like them.  Anyways, i did like most of what was on their new CD. It's very progressive. And ever since this Gaga, Chris Brown, Neyo techno explosion(everybodys copying). It seems right if they want an audience. They do seem to know that they might want to  roll with the times. Pete Wentz, kept saying he knows their a guilty pleasure, and he kept hinting at the band being in trouble. Propably because Emo, is a really just a fad, and it's been like 4 years. It's dying off realy quickly. I don't care, Winona' s Good, and a there's a few others i cant think of that are decent.
B000UKN9QC|5.0|Having borrowed it from the public library and loved it, I decided to add this book to my personal library so I could lend it out and read it again whenever I wish.  I've bought two copies, it's that good!      Great character development, suspenseful, good story.  Would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read a good mystery.    I wish Setterfield would write more like this!
B0018CAAN6|2.0|I originally wrote a review that trashed this album. Well, this album isn't as bad as what I orginially thought. About a year later this album has grown onto me. Which is something that albums rarely do. I do think that somebody of her caliber could have came up with something better than this album. Confessions on Dance Floor had such a cool edge to it, and this album.... Well it really sucked in comparison. I feel that she propably had a hard time keeping up with being creative. It's def. not as good as Donna Summer's latest release or Cyndi Lauper.(I got them as suggestions after buying this album). Those two were alot more aggressive, and their Beats were killer compared to this cd. I think her problem was working with Timbaland and the pressure to compete with Mariah and Janet. You could tell by listening to 4 Minutes. Which totally sucked, but the catchy hooks saved the song. I serously can't listen to this song, because i got tired of it. I do think that there are 3 tracks which are Miles Away, Beat Goes On, and Candy Shop. Candy Shop was the first track released from Hard Candy and I loved it. I was expecting big things from the album after hearing the song, and seeing Madonna on BET. The grooves are slick, and the vocals are classic seductive Madonna, Where can you go wrong? The next track, Miles Away has to truely be one of the best Madonna tracks she's ever written. I usually hate it when she plays the guitar, because she a pop star. But this song is beautiful in the way it's set up and the meaning behind it. Plus the dance beats are irrestible. I think she should have gone into more of a Miles Away direction, it truely could have been one of her best albums since Ray of Light. The last track, Beat Goes On, was pretty catchy. Although it was more a Kanye track. Kanye and Pharell did do it justice, and to me shows me that Madonna's new album could have worked alittle better in the U.S. if she would have released this as the new single. I thought the rest of the tracks were stupid, and Give it to me(the video at least) was a complete rip off of confessions! Give me something new. The ending track with Justin Timberlake was telling that she's getting desperate to try to compete with all the young ladies. Not to mention the tacky cover, People were always like, is She serious? She def. could have come up with a classy cover then that. Fortunely her next CD(even though it's greatest hits) is going to be alot better then this. Her leaked track sounds awesome, and I think Celebratio blows this crap out of the water. I would get this album if your an avid madonna fun, but i would only stick to purchasing miles away.
B001O4FXY4|4.0|He's already an integral part of the second coming of The Allman Brothers. Oh wait! Make that at least the third coming. His latest offering isn't one for jam band purists or those people looking for a guitar god offering. It's a fantastic sounding, scary good full band effort that should put Derek and the band up the permanently with the legends of southern rock. This band is tight, tight, tight. No, Derek doesn't rip off solo after solo but he plays delicious slide guitar that Duane would be proud of while helming one of the most amazing bands in rock and roll. Blues fans, rock fans, soul fans unite! Your savior has arrived.
B0013AUF2O|3.0|Michael Jackson has truely always been a joke, when I've been around. Truthfully he's never been popular since was a toddler and now im in college. So im not a huge mega fan like some people.(actually care more for Jermaine and janet they produce really good soul music).   As for Bad, it's got great pop beats, everybody heard the songs a million times, and he's got a great message. Dirty Diana definately an intersting song. As for, the way you make me feel. I think he was truely at his peak of normalness, while making this album. How could you not like this music, it's really good.
B001QD7SF0|4.0|Even Bruce Springsteen that doesn't grab you on the first listen is better than most things I can think of. It's a tad too produced for my taste. I'm willing to admit that I could be coming down from a \\"Magic\\" high which I thought was perfect from start to finish. I loved \\"Lucky Day, \\"Working On a Dream\\" and \\"The Wrestler\\" before the album even came out. The only thing I really couldn't wrap my head around was \\"Outlaw Pete\\". It seemed like a strange way to lead off an album. I'm sure the album will reward repeated listens. I'll give it four stars and keep right on listening.
B00192IOBA|4.0|With Jason Mraz, I was alitle skeptical. I didnt really know if he could still hang and be played on top 40 radio. I was wrong. Im Yours is a great album, and he is a really good artist. I like because he's not to overdone. Which seems rare for today. Overall, he's always came out with great stuff, he's always been popular, and he's a good songwriter.I cant to seem him in concert soon.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This movie reminds me of the romantic comedy musicals of the 1930's: nothing more than pure escapism during tough economic times. Those classic musicals were full of catchy songs, hot stars, and storylines that were fun if not highly improbable. But nobody cared because it was the Depression and anything was better than reality. \\"Mamma Mia!\\" fits this mold - it's the escapist movie for the Great Recession of 2008-2009. It's full of catchy ABBA music many people know and love. It has hot stars, including the best actress of our day, Meryl Streep (is there a role she can't do?). It takes place on an idyllic Grecian island far away from the problems of the modern world. And it has the rather improbable, but fun, storyline of a bride-to-be inviting three of her mother's past lovers to her wedding to see which one is her real dad. Though musicals are pretty much out of fashion these days, \\"Mamma Mia!\\" is a bit more accessible to the masses. It uses familiar pop tunes and the singers are pretty average, lending them a more human quality. No polished Broadway voices of the likes of Barbra Streisand or Julie Andrews to make you feel inadequate. You can actually sing along with the actors and not feel out of place (in fact, the DVD contains optional sing-along captions just for the purpose!). So turn off the news, pop in this DVD, and ESCAPE!
1415956111|1.0|I've read all the previous Reacher books.  I can't honestly call myself a fan as so many others here have done.  The books were fairly entertaining but I have always had a problem with the whole \\"off the grid\\" premise.  Reacher stumbles by, finds a way to get ticked off, many people end up in the hospital and many others end up dead with usually at least one law enforcement agent aware of his actions and he just walks away.  In this latest \\"effort\\" he commits dozens of felonies including assault, vehicular assault, grand theft, arson and murder.  He does it with the full knowledge of a law enforcement officer and we're expected to believe he just walks away - again!    Look, I like to see the villains catch a beating as much as the next guy, but with every installment in the Reacher saga, Child has gotten farther and farther from 'barely plausible' and now resides firmly in the realm of 'That's just stupid!'.  I've read comic books with more believable story lines. They at least have the virtue of consistency.    The thriller genre is not noted for complex character development, but calling the antagonists in this book 'cardboard' is an insult to recycled compressed corrugated paper products.  The fat corrupt sheriff, the bought and paid for towns people, the huge, slightly over the hill henchmen - constantly slapping his hand with a wrench no less! A trifecta of lazy writing.  As head-scratchingly bad as these three are, the crowning achievement of this excursion into mediocrity is clearly the industrialist-fundamentalist-terrorist who is in bed with the corrupt evil military.  Normally you'd have to stay up until 3:00am to get a four-in-one deal like that. I can just see Billy Mays saying: \\"But there's more! Call now and I'll include willfully polluted ground water and wildly unsafe working conditions at no extra charge! (just pay shipping and handling)\\"    OK, for a moment, let's forget about the implausibility of Reacher's actions and how painfully transparent the bad guys are. Let's focus on the plot. I saw the radiation sickness angle coming as soon as the guy puked in his back yard.  All I had to go on was the combination of metal recycling, extreme secrecy and a lethargic but otherwise healthy man who vomited with an attitude of 'Here we go again,' rather than 'Holy crap, I'm getting sick!\\"  I could easily have been wrong but the fact that I wasn't is a clear marker of how poorly constructed the story was.  The only surprising thing about this aspect of the book was how completely lame and unscientific the radioactive 'threat' was.      Clearly, Mr. Child did his research online. He typed: the military sucks, corporations suck, religion sucks, and humanity is poisoning the planet into one fat Google search and clicked on the first site that came back as a match. There was no need to go any further because the site had the word \\"TRUTH\\" in the title, so it had to be on the level, right Lee?  Why mess with all that icky science and inconvenient mountain of facts when some basement dwelling paranoid zealot has already done it for you?    The evil mastermind is willing to kill and sicken tens of thousands but he repeatedly lets the one person who is a danger to his plans just walk away. The guy's a drifter, nobody expecting him to show up anywhere, he has no weapons, no way to call for help, and for most of the book he went there alone. He owns a HUGE recycling plant, you couldn't ask of a better place to make somebody disappear.      Nobody in Despair has a gun? Nobody has a phone? Nobody thought, \\"You know, if we just call the State Police to come and arrest him for (take your pick) there will be a few days of cursory investigation and then we can get on with hastening the end of the world.\\"  Two assaulted cops, two wrecked police cruisers with Reacher's fingerprints on one steering wheel.  Come on!  Remember the line: \\"You don't mess with the Special Investigators.\\"  Well I can tell you that law enforcement has a similarattitude.  Even if they knew the sheriff was a complete idiot, they'd act to protect the integrity of the badge if not the incompetent fool who wore it.  They'd immediately invite Reacher into the back seat of a cruiser for the long ride back to the closest barracks, or station or whatever they call them in Colorado.  He'd have company on the ride too because they'd make a short stop in Hope to arrest his lady cop friend for aiding and abetting and obstruction of justice to start with.    The whole deserter angle was so forced and ham-fisted that it felt as though it was stapled on the outside of the box that the rest of the 'story' came in.  It's as though Child finished the book and thought: \\"It's good, but it really doesn't show my true contempt for the military. There must be some way of doing that and successfully alienating half of my readers at the same time.  I know!  I'll have Reacher go completely against character, get blatantly political and abandon all sense of honor! That'll get me invited to lots of cocktail parties in Manhattan and Hollywood.\\"    It probably took him all of 30 minutes to add it in.  It certainly reads that way.    By this point you may be saying: \\"Stop beating around the bush, did you like the book or not?\\"  Well, no....  No, I didn't like it.  But, I did give it a fair shake. Unlike some others who opine here, I read the whole thing through.  I don't begrudge their enlightened self interest in moving on to other, more pleasurable endeavors, like removing a wad of hair from a clogged bathroom drain. I however like to finish what I start, no matter how tedious. I'm also an insomniac who had nothing else to read.   However, the primary reason I continued to read is that I am at heart, an optimist.  I kept expecting it to get better.  I kept looking for Child to deepen and interweave the plot elements. I turned each page wanting to be surprised or intrigued by something... anything.  I quickly went from expecting a turn-around to justhoping for one. About thirty pages from the end I wondered how he could possibly make this mess work.  Needless to say, he couldn't. It ended as pointlessly as it had begun.    Obviously, Child wanted to end the story with a bang.(pun intended) He wanted to leave his readers saying, \\"Wow!\\" or \\"Cool!\\" or some other single word exclamation. I didn't disappoint, however the single word I chose was, \\"Stupid!\\"    The truly mind boggling idiocy of Reacher's final act did have one saving grace. It was consistent with the rest of the book in it's complete lack of reason and plausibility.    Having read the other Reacher novels I wasn't expecting great literature. I was, however, expecting to be at least mildly entertained and temporarily distracted from day to day life. Such books rarely stick with you, but this one has shown surprising staying power.  It has continued to annoy me for days after finishing.  It has also instilled a sense of wonder. Specifically, I wonder what the heck Lee Child was thinking when he wrote this paper waster.
B00133KFGW|5.0|----------------<br />August Rush: [opening voice-over] Listen. Can you hear it? The music. I can hear it everywhere. In the wind... in the air... in the light. It's all around us. All you have to do is open yourself up. All you have to do... is listen.<br />=============================<br /><br />August Rush is a fairy tale of a film, a really inspiring story of a boy in an orphanage who dreams of finding his parents--hearing music in the world and also inside himself that leads him ever onward in his quest. Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) likes music \\"more than food\\" and he has talent to burn. He is a musical prodigy with an incredible gift.<br /><br />He goes to New York where, drawn to the music, he finds the lair of Wizard (Robin Williams)--a Fagin-like entrepenuer, but instead of grooming pickpockets like Aftful Dodger, he grooms buskers like Arthur (Leon Thomas III). Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace is a complex character, creepy and malevolent--but not entirely evil as he does believe in the power and grace of music. It is just that, when faced with someone as talented as Evan, he can't resist the temptation to exploit his talent. He does, however, give the boy a guitar and a flashy stage name: August Rush.<br /><br />--------------<br />Wizard: You know what music is? God's little reminder that there's something else besides us in this universe, a harmonic connection between all living beings, every where, even the stars.<br />======================<br /><br />Robin Williams, master of comedy, is also adept at playing creepy sociopaths, such as Seymour Parrish in One Hour Photo or Rainbow Randolph in Death to Smoochy. His Wizard is perhaps his best creepy sociopath yet, and he wins the best of show award here.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Evan's mother Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), a cellist, is trying to find him, and his father, Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is trying to find Lyla. Louis is also a musician, naturally, and he sings and plays bass in a rock band. When the cops try to take down Wizard's squat, August rushes off and seeks sanctuary in a Gospel church. He hears some really good Gospel singing there, especially from a young girl named Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). She teaches him to read music, and about one second later he starts writing his Opus One, August's Rhapsody in C Major. Hope sees his music and goes to tell the Reverand about it. When they find him at the church organ, they hear his obvious talent and send him immediately to Julliard.<br /><br />If this all sounds a little hard to swallow, it isn't. The film spins its fairy tale with such finesse that you are perfectly willing to suspend your disbelief. The music is great, especially the parts where August Rush discovers the guitar. Some really great singing by Jamia Simone Nash and Leon Thomas III, who both, by the way, have sung on The Backyardigans (who are HUGE to the toddler crowd, just ask my great nephew, Casson Hunter Porter). I wondered if Leon Thomas III was related to Leon Thomas who is known for his work with Pharoah Sanders, particularly the 1969 song \\"The Creator Has a Master Plan\\" from Sanders' Karma album. Thomas's most distinctive device was that he often broke out into yodeling. This style influenced James Moody and Tim Buckley, among others. It would have made for a really good story, but apparently the two Leon Thomases are not related.<br /><br />Nevertheless, August Rush is quite inspiring, and fun for the whole family. Freddie Highmore did a fantastic job as August Rush, and I see that he was also Charlie Bucket in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Peter Llewelyn Davies in Finding Neverland--both with Johnny Depp. Add to that August Rush, and the young Mr. Highmore has made quite an impressive fairy tale triptych.<br /><br />^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br />[[ASIN:B000BB1MI2 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition)]] (2005) ....

0316096199|5.0|Alice Sebold tells the story of her rape at the age of 18, and the subsequent trial, and all that she endured and experienced in between. This story is so emotionally gripping, so powerful in its telling that it is almost impossible to put down, and it is so haunting that it stays with you long after the final page is turned.  I salute this very brave lady for telling her story so openly and honestly as I am quite sure it still causes her a great deal of pain. While the telling is probably a carthasis for the author, no one can possibly read this book without being emotionally caught up in the painful turmoil.  You cannot criticize this manuscript unless you yourself have been through what the author has endured. This is a book I highly recommend to everyone.  It is well worth the time and the read.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|Ever since Born to Run came out and flooded Springsteen with accolades, he seems determined to confound expectations with his next album. Working on a Dream is no exception. Magic was a stunner of an album and the tour that followed was an E Street Band showcase, and one would have expected him to follow both up with a straightforward rocking album in the vein of The River (to which Magic was often compared)...but no.<br /><br />With \\"Working on a Dream\\" Springsteen has given us something he has touched upon before, but never really shared...and something completely new. It's an overall happy collection of songs - his happiest since \\"Human Touch\\" and \\"Lucky Town\\" in 1992, but with richer, much more lush arrangements. It will interesting to hear this music live, to see what the E Street Band does with it in concert.<br /><br />Bruce took the 60's sounds of \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\" and \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" (respectively my favorite and least favorite songs on \\"Magic\\") and expanded those sounds for this new record. You'll hear echoes of Phil Spector, the Beach Boys, the British Invasion and the Byrds, all mixed together with Bruce's unique songwriting and sounds.<br /><br />But the songs are all strong. I've listened to it four times now and it gets better each time. The standout tracks are \\"Life Itself\\", \\"Kingdom of Days\\" and \\"Outlaw Pete\\". I don't really like telling you what each song is about - listen to them and find out for yourself. Also, \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" seemed a little silly to me at first, but it's really growing on me.<br /><br />Look, if you're one of the so-called Bruce \\"fans\\" that looks down your nose at anything after \\"Darkness\\" then this album is not for you. This is the NEXT Bruce Springsteen album, not one of the old ones. This is new and different and I for one like it. I don't think it's going to be my favorite Springsteen album of all time, but it's very good - and even an average Bruce album is way better than most of the dreck that's out there these days.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Product in perfect state.<br />This season is legendary! (I'm not Barney - but I heard that guy's awesome!)<br />I am so happy that I found a way to watch it before it comes out here in France (and I paid it a lot less money that the price I would have paid if I bought it here).
B00168HARG|5.0|I watched the whole season in one sitting! It is great to see a show this entertaining from network television. If you liked any of the Terminator movies, you have to watch this series.
B0013ND30W|5.0|The Blu-Ray remastering is simply breathtaking. I owned the remastered DVD and there's no comparison, especially on a big screen HDTV (with its full Cinemascope glory). The clarity and the details of the images look even better than I remember in the theater. The remastered soundtrack adds gorgeous 5.1 surround sounds and brings out the impressive score. The result would please Walt Disney himself -- it's as if the film was made in 2009! Truly a masterpiece for all ages. They don't make animation like this anymore.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I truely found this to be a strange and riveting mystery that I couldn't put down. I wasn't sure I liked it almost all of the way through, but I certainly couldn't stop reading it until I found out the mystery of it all. The author keeps you wondering all the way through. As soon as I figured out one thing I was wondering about another and at the end I confess that I did still have a few unanswered questions. I wasn't sure I liked the story while I was reading it, but upon reflection I see that what I really didn't like was the way the characters lived. It made me uncomfortable to think that several generations of a family could have such little regard for their off spring and their responsibility to them. I know this is fiction, but obviously books are loosely based on the world around us and our imaginations. This book made me reconsider my reading choices and ultimately I am glad. If you love a good puzzling mystery, you will surely love this book.
B001GCUNVW|4.0|I'm one of the kooks who expected Mickey Rourke to sneak in and nab an Oscar nomination for his role as Marv in Robert Rodriguez's SIN CITY, and I still maintain that he was robbed, so I'm pretty damned happy about all of the attention he's getting over his role as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson in Darren Aronofsky's stunningly dark film, THE WRESTLER.     Rourke's portrayal of \\"The Ram\\" is both beautifully understated and larger-than-life; The Ram's heyday was in 1989, when he faced off against his arch-nemesis \\"The Ayatollah\\" in front of a capacity crowd at Madison Square Garden. Today, he's a broken-down mess eking out a living working in a supermarket during the week, and wrestling in VFW halls and high-school gymnasiums on the weekend. A life-altering experience causes Robinson to attempt a reconciliation with his estranged Daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) and pursue a relationship with an aging stripper (Marisa Tomei), but the call of the ring proves irresistible, and Robinson finds himself booked for an anniversary rematch with his old nemesis, The Ayatollah......     The performances are uniformly excellent, and Rourke, in particular, is outstanding. He also does a great job with the wrestling scenes....If I didn't know better, I would think Rourke had been wrestling professionally for years prior to making this film. I would be so damned happy to see him win the Best Actor Oscar, and it would be extremely well-deserved.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I wasnt too sure about this album at first but now I cannot stop listening to it. My favourite stand out songs on this album are Full moon,supermassive black hole,decode,eyes on fire,never think,flightless bird/Amerian Mouth and leave out all the rest;-).    A great album.I would recommend it definately.
B001I82RVS|2.0|This movie is often laugh out loud absurd. The first half actually isn't too bad and by the end you're more than ready for it to be finished.    If you're a fan of Eihi Shiina you may enjoy it just to watch her strut around with a katana and be pretty flippin' cool. As I said in the title she manages to be both sexy and stylish even in this ridiculous affair.    I would love to see Quentin Tarantino take Eihi Shiina and the basic character from the beginning of this movie and do something with it.  Eihi Shiina could definitely be an action/gore queen with the right vehicle.    The movie does have a few cool scenes and some interesting composition at times.    Again, I didn't hate it and I wouldn't recommend it to non Eihi Shiina fans.
B00006C7G9|5.0|I was very pleased with this purchase.  I bought the VHS set of Band of Brothers for my grandfather for Christmas.  It arrived well packaged and the VHS tapes looked brand new.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is Audioslave's first and best effort, hands down. Just buy this album and you'll not regret it, especially if you like 90s-era rock with a grunge flavor to it.<br />Chris Cornell has one heck of a set of pipes and Tom Morello, even though I would not say he's the most proficient guitarist, has one of tastiest and spot-on guitar licks, trademarked on all of the tracks. Instead of spending your money on two lattes or beers, just buy this CD and get your own musical high!
0743297334|1.0|I've been looking forward to reading this novel for a long time, as Hemingway is considered one of the greatest American writers who ever lived. Sorry folks, but I can't believe this pile of garbage is considered an all time classic. If I wrote this and took it to a publisher he would have thrown it in the garbage after a few minutes. I can't believe so many people gave this meandering, meaningless piece of trash all the stellar reviews. I will never read another Hemingway...and I was looking forward to reading them all.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Great acting, great screenplay, great everything.  Super mini series.  I was astounded when I picked up the book and saw what Heidi Thomas had to work with.  It's excellent.  Elizabeth Gaskell would be thrilled.
B00160TH66|5.0|I'm no musical genius but I know what I like and I loved this.  Beautifully orchestrated, lovely melodies -- perfect!
B000FC1LOC|1.0|This book starts out superbly.  The characters are believable and real.  Unfortunately Ms. Picoult writes herself into a corner and resorts to a cheap too pat and too neat ending.  She does throw in heart wrenching emotion but I would have preferred a more honest attempt to deal with the unfolding drama.  Cheap trick.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|My advice about the one-, two-, and three-star reviews given to WORKING ON A DREAM, Bruce Springsteen's latest, is that you should take them like the humor in SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE and buy the CD anyway. People apparently are unhappy that he didn't have any more rotten eggs to drop, and are disappointed that this album has a positive tone, unlike MAGIC, which was totally pessimistic. This album is the perfect way to greet the arrival of a president we can believe in, and should be treated as such. In my view, kids whose parents can't take a positive-toned Springsteen album should get loads of homework to do on the weekends, or at least have to serve Saturday detention in school. This is because music is supposed to please the artist as well as the audience. In this case, Bruce Springsteen has admitted that he was in a more positive frame of mind when he recorded this CD than when he made MAGIC. Like it or not, this is a great album.
B000PAAJYW|5.0|Magnolia Should have won an Oscar like Crash...Crash got it ...But the real great movie was Magnolia and timing is everything...Reverse the order and Magnolia gets it...Provocative Performances from everybody in it...Rent,Buy it ...Its all about Change, Redemtion and your own personel Recovery...and yes it is the movie's 10th Anniversary of making it.

B001F290E4|1.0|Please listen to the originals then compare. Notice what's missing? There is no soul.     This album sounds like it was recorded in his bedroom over the course of a weekend. Please don't support this crass effort to satisfy a recording contract obligation. Seek out the originals.
0956010903|5.0|When I got this for Christmas I cried. It's very pretty: stamped leather, velveteen drawstring bag, parchment envelope for the sketches. The book itself is well made. My only complaint is the eyes in the skull were glued in at an odd angle and the glue is visable.    The stories are great. I really enjoyed them and the notes from Dumbldore and the glimpse into the extended Malfoy family is very funny.    I'll probably get a regular copy of Beedle to bang about, but this is version is very special.
0780628551|5.0|This is by far not the best science fiction movie that I have seen, it has a great love scene in it and the ending is a surprise. Johnny Depp is just pretty to look at in any movie that he is in.
6304493681|4.0|I liked the movie, if you like Princess Mononoke, then you may like this science fiction movie done with the same style of animation and computer graphics, new DVD came in excellent condition.
0312383320|4.0|I have to agree that PLUM SPOOKY is silly, in fact, it's very silly. But you know what, it is also very entertaining. And come on, folks after reading through the Number series can we really say that the off-the-wall characters and absurd situations that Stephanie et al find themselves in time after time are anything but enjoyably silly?<br />  Lets applaud Janet Evanovich for that rare talent of being able to make us laugh or at least grin at a time when laughter and humor are in short supply! Watch the evening news and you'll see that we live in a world fraught with pain and misery. Then take a look at your reading list because if reality isn't enough to sour us then why is it that we revel in fictional worlds of pain and misery, whether the novels are Detective, Thriller, Secret Agent, Super SEAL, RANGER, SPEC OPs semi-inspired, Love Gone bad, Love Gone Really, Really Bad, or Life is Crap themes?<br />  The long and short of it to me is that maybe after a lousy day at work or a less than inspiring ride on a crowded bus or train on the way to work, when worrying about our jobs, the economy, our kids, what's making the car rattle, if that tooth ache may need a crown, or wondering if the fish in the kid's tank is floating upside down and perhaps sunning himself or if maybe a Pet Store run may save the day...again, then Janet Evanovich's humor is much appreciated.<br />  Perhaps too, the problem is with us. With this 15th book perhaps we've become so familiar with the character and her pals that maybe we've become plotline complacent- the too much of a good thing principle.<br />  As an avid reader I prefer to place her books in between a handful of others so that by the time I return back to them I'm Plum happy to visit again, even when she's just monkeying around.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A wonderfully honest and moving rendition about  John Adams and his devotion to the creation of the United States of America.     I am glad to see a story about our founding fathers told in the most genuine manner.  These were a bunch of men who fought for an ideal, and how much their ideal has changed \\"the course of human events\\".      Since we have a new president now, by watching the scene of the slaves building the White House, I realize that our country has come a very long way indeed.  I wander if President Obama has a had a chance to watch the mini series.      This film puts everything we've learned in the history books into perspective and gives it life.  All those times we crammed for a history test, trying to remember dates, who crossed the Delaware, who was the first, Who was the second?   Who signed this?  Which document did what?  Somewhere over the years, we've managed to reduce a significant event to a bunch of dates and numbers.      As David McCollough said, \\"History is about life,\\" and grateful for him bringing back that resonance to John Adams and history itself.  The more we remember that \\"history is about life,\\" the more we remember what it's like to aspire to great things.  We are not a mundane people.  Our country was never founded on nonsense.  We ought never to forget that.  \\"O'er the Land of the Free, and the Home of the Brave\\" -- Can you blame Francis Scott Key for being moved?    An honorable piece of work, well deserved of it's Emmies and Golden Globes.  It would have been great if it had also been eligible for an Oscar.  It's been a long time since we've seen worthwhile historical dramas.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I've watched this with my wife and it's been a lot of fun.  The series is all about relationships between men and women.  You might think the women are treated badly, but I think it's more a reflection on the men.  In any case, none of the characters are wimpy and the photography, sets, costumes, etc., are perfectly done.  Really evokes that time period.  All smoking and drinking.  I love arguing with my wife why such-and-such a character is not as morally depraved as another.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|I wouldn't know how to start in heaping more and more praise on a movie like this. This was the sort of movie that cinema is made for. Even being a hard R-rated dramatic character study, it manages to be not just lightly humorous, but outright laugh-out-loud hilarious in almost every scene, without ever disrupting the tone of the movie or the mood.<br /><br />The film is indeed about Walt Kowalski, which Clint Eastwood plays in a way not far from the movie personas that made him famous, and yet easily encompassing how someone would imagine someone like Dirty Harry as an 80+ year old man. He seems as though he's not \\"Clint Eastwood playing a crusty old racist\\" but rather \\"A crusty old racist playing himself\\". No matter how many racist terms he tosses out, it's always in a way that doesn't seem in any way out of the ordinary or like too much of a step for Eastwood to draw out in his acting.<br /><br />And so many of the scenes from the snarling stares given to his family and friends during his wife's funeral, to chewing out priest Janovich, sparring with Sue back and forth, there's always hilarity to be had when he starts growling or mumbling something in a voice close to Batman in \\"The Dark Knight\\".<br /><br />Yet despite his cantankerousness, racism, and stubborn need to be self-sufficient, he never ventures into the realm of disgusting or (overly)violent; he seems just as ready to string out a racist rant against ghetto-looking street thugs as he is against sheet-wearing hillbillies.<br /><br />The burgeoning friendship that builds between Walt and Thao is sweet without stepping into being saccharine, and the climax of the film is intense, causing a great change in Walt that would seem fully unexpected in a movie character, yet in this context is not only done brilliantly, but Clint Eastwood develops his character so thoroughly, that he becomes the character as deeply and richly as Daniel Day-Lewis did Daniel Plainview in \\"There Will Be Blood\\": You fully believe Walt Kowalski could be a real person. He is in no way a hero or a villain, but just a normal person.<br /><br />To the end of the film, Walt remains an unrepentant racist and bitter, cantankerous old man hateful of almost anything, but where his own family is alienated from his life, he seems to gain a new one in the form of Thao and his family.person. He is in no way a hero or a villain, but just a normal person.    To the end of the film, Walt remains an unrepentant racist and bitter, cantankerous old man hateful of almost anything, but where his own family is alienated from his life, he seems to gain a new one in the form of Thao and his family.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|No sweat super plug n' play!  Product is as promised by seller!  Speedy delivery as well. Thanks much!
B00000JXZ7|5.0|This delightful reissue couples two Chung performances, the Bruch - with Kempe - dates from 1972 and the Mendelssohn - with Dutoit - from 1981. The Bruch is truly excellent, more profound, but also more wistfully melancholic, than in any other version I've heard - not to mention Chung's obvious technical proficiency. Now, there are certainly a lot of good rivals out there, but what just might bring this one to the very top is the glorious orchestral contribution. Kempe's ability to follow Chung's interpretation, the way he complements it and the beautiful and rhythmically incisive playing of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is simply a marvel. The Mendelssohn isn't far behind either, and the sound  has been remastered to magical effect. One is simply forced to applaud the whole thing.
B00004YZ36|5.0|I don't know enough about the history of different styles of performances of the Mozart concerti to comment on how these fit into that picture, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed most aspects of these performances.  Tempi are a little too quick in some places, and in that regard I suppose these show the modern tendency to play pieces faster than the composers probably intended.  Comparing movement timings to multiple other recordings I have on hand it seems some are slower and several in this set are quicker.  Despite that, the artistry and interpretation were definitely highly enjoyable to me.  It's easy to get caught up in the fun of these lively, highly skillful and playful performances.<br /><br />Regarding sound quality, in a sense these are excellent recordings.  Piano and instrument sound are extremely good, if one is not looking for hall sound or a realistic presentation in acoustic space.  I was aware that Deutsche Grammophon had the close-miking disease, but didn't know it extended back into the 1960s.  Not even on stage does one hear instruments seemingly from the inside out, so while the instrument sound is very clear as usually results from close-miking, the perspective can't honestly be called realistic.  Unfortunately too many recordings are close-miked.  The sound of this recording probably could have been much better if not close-miked, assuming the DG engineers could learn to do it well.<br /><br />There are occasional signs of some high-frequency or dynamic limitations.  Probably these are inherent in the microphones more than the original analog tape.  Tape noise is not intrusive.  DG's digital signal processing called \\"Original-image Bit-processing\\" seems to work very well.  Signal integrity seems good and possibly improved over the original tapes.  If the improvements are an illusion, it's a good one.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Saw it at the movie theater 3 times and bought it when it was released.  It is just as good at home as it was at the movie theater.  I could watch this movie once a week and never get tired of it.
0142000663|4.0|I read and completed this book, enjoying every single page from about p. 120 onwards, but it took that long for me to access it. To take oneself seriously, one must have completed reading this, I reckon.

0810979772|5.0|About the book: Instead of a novel, about half of the book is a workbook/journal -- including survey pages (like: \\"Five things NOBODY knows about you\\"), themed drawing pages (like under the heading: \\"The WORST NIGHTMARE you ever had\\"), unfinished comic pages (in the typical Wimpy Kid style, where you finish the comic or add text to the balloons). The other half of the book is lined blank journal pages.<br /><br />We bought this for my 9-year old son because it was a 'Wimpy Kid' title. Despite that, I wasn't expecting him to do more than page through it a couple times, because although he loves the Wimpy Kid series, he has never gone out of his way to write anything more than has been absolutely necessary for school.<br /><br />To my surprise, my son loves this book. He's had this book about 8 months now and continues to come back to it. He's drawn his own cartoons, filled in many of the surveys, and has written numerous pages of journal entries.  Before this Do-It-Yourself book he had no interest in writing; now he comes back to the book often to add to it.<br /><br />This book has opened my son to the world of journaling. What's more, when he's grown it'll give him a snapshot of what a funny, goofy kid he was.<br /><br />Update 4/15/2010<br /><br />At 10 1/2, he still loves coming back to this book and adding to it!
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I loved this cd and yes there are some generic songs. Most are focusing on her voice. We all know that she can \\"sang.\\" I was looking for the quality of the songs.  I am so in love with \\"Giving Myself\\" and \\"You Pulled me through\\". Those songs are wonderful and for life if you just listen to the words. They can be for a personal realtionship and a spiritual one.
B0001906O0|5.0|If you're a Cure fan this is a must have to obtain .  It's pricey brand new but worth it .  This is certainly their REAL work . Disc 1 is just about \\" Boys Don't Cry \\" and \\" Meathook\\"  but the other 3 are just awesome .  From song to song you can hear and feel the evolution of the band .  Great stuff .

B000002UZU|5.0|I remember finding this album t=years ago in a used record store.  Probably my favorite find of all time.This is pure. Pure truth, pure love and a voice and presence bigger than anything I have ever heard. The king of the boogie and one of the architects of electric blues .... what a monster. God bless John Lee. There is no doubt in my mind that when Gods having a down day, he calls John Lee in and everythings alright. Don't think about missing this one.

B000NOKERM|5.0|Wow. This album has more than twenty years. I have listened to this album for more than twenty years and it still sounds fresh to me and still moves me. Few bands did so much with a single album for an entire movement or musical genre in my opinion. It is a perfect, perfect album. Every song is a single with incredible melodic hooks, killer guitar solos and parts, a fantastic guitar player (John Sykes at the top of his game) and an incredible singer (Coverdale) who managed to sound perfectly in charge with this music. I don't know if they were aware of the fact that they were making history with this one. I can't say much more than this. 1987 would be one of my 10 desert island discs for sure. No doubt about this. One of the three or four rock ones. For me it's absolutly a MUST HAVE. Talking about this edition it is a splendid remastered cd. They did it big. The sound is very full, the guitar parts sound incredible and the overall mix is very good. The booklet and everything else is \\"special edition\\" and deserve the high price. All in all something you can't miss, if you like me, are in love with this album since we were kids. I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS ONE !!!!!
B00127RAJY|3.0|I am disapointed with this!  I really liked Jillian and thought I'd love her DVD but I have to be honest, she does more talking than she does working out!<br /><br />The workout is a good one but it takes forever to get past the previews and her talking about her step program before you even get to the workout!  Then once you get to the workout she talks some more before showing you the two ladies behind her who you need to watch.  And yes, since she is mostly talking and not working out you do need to watch THEM and not her!<br /><br />Needless to say an overall disapointment.  I purchased this in hopes of working out each morning with it before work.  I can't spend the what feels like 10 minutes each morning to get to the work out that it takes!  Thumbs down for me just for that reason.<br /><br />If you could skip the intro and her talking and get straight to the workout it would be 100% better!  The actual workout itself is a good one.

It is written in a way the people who aren't experts can understand.  I can't wait to try out some of the tips that are in the book.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve the way they take photos.
0307454894|5.0|In mid-century Berlin, a young boy falls ill on the street; he is assisted by a woman who helps him clean up and sets him on his feet again.  When he returns a few weeks later, to thank her, the two begin forming a pattern for their time together: making love and reading.<br /><br />First he reads to her and then they make love.  This relationship never leaves the spare rooms.  The boy holds his secret safe inside; it warms him and comforts him, bolstering his self-confidence.<br /><br />And then she is gone.  The rooms are vacant and there is nothing left behind - no clues to why she left or to her current whereabouts.<br /><br />The boy - Michael Berg - misses her, this woman, Hanna Schmidt.  He compares each subsequent relationship to the one they had and all others fall short.  Even though his relationship with the woman was very narrow and contained little in the way of sharing - just the reading and the sex.<br /><br />Years later, while a student, Michael is involved in legal coursework, which leads to his attendance at a trial.  Several defendants are being held accountable for deaths in the concentration camp - people who died in a burning church.  One of the defendants is Hanna.<br /><br />As the facts emerge throughout the trial, Michael begins to piece together several clues that reveal a deep secret held by Hanna - a secret that, if told, could actually improve her lot in the case.  But she says nothing.  And Michael, who struggles with whether or not to come forward, also remains silent.  And she is sentenced to life in prison.<br /><br />Through the years, he confronts the issues again and again, wondering if he did the right thing.  His struggle against the possibility of altering someone's fate - especially when that person has obviously chosen not to act on her own behalf - or remaining silent and allowing a miscarriage of justice.  Eventually, he stifles the conflicts in order to get on with everyday life.  But underneath, informing all of his choices is the emotional muffling that occurs when strong feelings are suppressed in such a way.<br /><br />A deep and moving exploration of moral ambiguities and conflicting choices, [[ASIN:0307454894 The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)]] is memorable and emotionally stirring.<br /><br />Laurel-Rain Snow<br />Author of: [[ASIN:1419656864 Web of Tyranny]], etc.ices is the emotional muffling that occurs when strong feelings are suppressed in such a way.<br /><br />A deep and moving exploration of moral ambiguities and conflicting choices, [[ASIN:0307454894 The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)]] is memorable and emotionally stirring.<br /><br />Laurel-Rain Snow<br />Author of: [[ASIN:1419656864 Web of Tyranny]], etc.

B000NA1OXY|2.0|I really liked Avril's first 2 albums. It's not something I brag about, but it's more of a guilty pleasure thing. The first album reveals Avril as (I think) a nice girl hiding behind her \\"rebellious\\" cover. While the 2nd album takes logical steps forward lyrically and musically. And now, a couple years later, after being married and apparently magically becoming younger and more immature. Avril released The Best Damn thing. Gone are the likeable nice, rebellious girl. Instead we get a girl that nobody really likes in high school. The same exact girl that I picture Hayley Williams singing about in Misery Business. The girl that thinks she's better than anybody else and isn't afraid to let everybody knows about it. There are moments where we got a glimpse of the old Avril, but those are too few and not enough to compensate for the complete terribleness of the rest of the album.    If you want to hear something like what you heard on Avril's first 2 album. Don't waste your money on this. Go buy [[ASIN:B000PTYPAC Riot!]] or [[ASIN:B00064ADRK Breakaway]]. I'll listen to the Paris Hilton CD before this, and I'm not kidding, that CD had some good production on it and isn't completely worthless.    One more bad album from Avril, and she'll never come close to my stereo again.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Only three weeks ago, I was a total newcomer to the show, The Biggest Loser, and although I'd seen Jillian Michaels' picture in any dozens of magazine ads for health and/or weight loss products, I was impressed enough by her personality on the show that I convinced my wife to buy the 30-Day Shred DVD.  Last weekend, the DVD arrived, and my wife and I have done the Level 1 workout twice now....and we are completely sold on Jillian's approach.    I run a few times a week and am a bit overweight - 5'10\\", 180 - and my weight has fluctuated by 25 pounds over the years several times.  My problem is that I have never been able to get going with a total-body workout regimen, and instead have done a lot of cardio that pushes only one or two primary sets of muscles.  With the 30-Day Shred, it is like I have a new hope for actually getting rid of the stubborn flab while having fun doing it.  My wife has never been a regular exerciser, and she hates running, so I've been wonderfully surprised that she LOVES this workout DVD and wants to do it with me a few times a week at a minimum.  We have challenged each other to lose 15-20 pounds in the next 2 months, and Jillian is going to help us do it.     I recommend this DVD to anyone serious about making a positive lifestyle change, no matter what your current fitness level.  As Jillian says, she has 400-pound people doing full jumping jacks - if they can do it, so can we!

B000RJO578|4.0|This may be my first time coming out of a movie and not knowing whether I loved or hated a film. On one hand HOT FUZZ gave me a headache with it's loud action and constant inclusion of loud noises, caused by close-ups of several artifacts, constantly shown to irritate the very uptight lead. On the other, not too often do I laugh out loud at a movie several times, including at scenes where the joke is telegraphed well in advance (fascist............. hag!). In the modern Hollywood movie machine, the hardest thing to find is a comedy with actual laughs and HOT FUZZ is certainly that, just make sure to bring along a couple of aspirin !
B0000C9ZBW|2.0|I last bought a Skagen watch two years ago. The quality was excellent, and I have been happy with the watch ever since. Unfortunately, the quality of Skagen watches appears to have gone down in the interim. I ordered this watch because it looks classy. While the face is classy, the band leaves something to be desired. Skagen has decreased the width and thickness of their watch bands. The band looks far too small for the size of the face. Furthermore, the clasp does not fit securely, and jingles whenever I move my writs. Furthermore, the area around the clasp was painted sloppily. The paint does not extend entirely underneath it, and parts of the clasp are unpainted.   While the face of the watch is still attractive, they removed the second hand. While the watch's face is still stylish, the quality of the band and the watch overall do not justify its price.  All of this speaks to cost cutting since the last time I purchased a Skagen watch,  and the overall effect is that of a stylish watch executed cheaply and poorly. I would not recommend this product.
B001GKJ2FC|3.0|Fast and flashy, ultra-violent action fest with curving bullets, colliding bullets, bullets ripping through foreheads, big guns, little guns, car chases, breathtaking train sequence, you get the picture. For the most part, the cast is enjoyable although lead James McAvoy is very irritating. The film as a whole makes little sense and is mind-numbing unbelievable but if rip roaring special effects and action are your thing, you will probably enjoy it. Looks great on Blue-Ray!
0930289234|5.0|Simply one've the greatest pieces of fiction I've ever read. This novel single-handedly rejuvenated my interest in reading and learning.
B000ZK4466|5.0|I am a huge fan of TMV and have given each of their albums a great deal more play than those of most other bands in my collection.  Each album of theirs so far has been very strong, albeit in quite different ways.  Deloused may be the most superficially listenable and infectious, Frances is possibly possessive of the most imaginative, pervasive sense of mood, and Amputechture's tracks are likely the most musically complex and elaborate of the lot --  there will forever be debates over which album is the greatest of theirs, but after much deliberation, The Bedlam in Goliath seems to be the obvious winner.  First of all, it is their longest, most varied, and full, in every sense of the word; in raw play time, in number of tracks, in the distinct lack of filler when compared to other albums -- most bands would only include two thirds of this much original material on a single album.  Each track exists as its own entity, each track has vocals and all members of the band playing simultaneously, frequently with the feel of composed \\"jam\\" (compared to more heavy-handed experimentation on earlier albums).  The songs, to put it frankly, are amazing, yet the album as a whole manages to be greater than any individual track (certainly more than the sum of its parts).  The overall flow and composition of the album could be described as eerie, relentless, terrorizing, trippy, supernatural, incessant, and disturbing.  For the most part, it's very fast and very loud; frenzied, raw, and unbridled.  Much of the album's propulsive, jaw-dropping energy is contributed by the new drummer, whose galloping rhythms might as well have been delivered by well-aimed machine guns shot to a metronome's pulse than a(n admittedly large) drum kit (he is very fluid and precise).  This is the thrashiest work the band has done; heavier music fans of the band are likely to see much made of the band's \\"metal\\" potential realized, while also finding their progressive, latin stylings from previous albums returning and fully functional.    Despite the album's pacing, it is nevertheless quite funky, and not without its slower moments.  Without going into detailed specifics of the album itself, I'll attempt to sum up the contents.    Agadez and Conjugal Burns are probably the two most well-written and representative tracks on the album; both are filled with a bit of everything from other songs; catchy choruses and hooks, superb musicianship, listenable pacing, and balanced heaviness/weight.  That being said, Soothsayer and Askepios are maybe the most haunting and creepy in the collection, whereas Metatron and Cavalettas certainly rock the hardest.  To put it simply, the album is best taken as a whole rather than in isolation.  It is a musical being, to be experienced from start to finish, and if one is willing to sit down and watch a film at ninety minutes, then swallowing this album in one sitting shouldn't be a problem.  The longer track lengths allow for a feeling of unmarginalized creativity and exploration, which, in my opinion, reflects the mental territory of most Mars Volta listeners.    Now, to emphasize the haunting, creepy, and cursed quality of the album, be forewarned that from the combination of infectious, poppy songwriting, unusual sound effects, stripped down production, and expansive, prolific track length, comes an album that is potentially very disturbing, alluring, and superstitious.  Likely that others have already mentioned the legends surrounding the recording, development, and production of The Bedlam in Goliath, and so a reiteration is not necessary, but I can certainly see how the angst, terror, and mystery surrounding the production has been assimilated into the listening experience.  It is difficult to put my finger on, but the sound quality is often fuzzy, yet difficult to discern, and personal events of my life surrounding enjoyment of the album have been rather suspect.  Rest assured, anyone who embraces this album as a fully realized work, worth listening to many times, in its entirety, will find that life becomes decidedly less \\"normal\\" and rationally explicable, often directly correlative with this album.  It's not a joke -- there is something uncanny and ghostly about the recording, for better or worse.  Removed from all superficial judgments of the album is an appreciation for its characteristic unique, otherworldly vibe, as a whole musical phenomenon (and one that is fiercely listenable).

143911000X|5.0|My buddy at work and I love the show. And this book is perfect. Keep it buy your desk so that you can reference it whenever needed. I only wish I also got the audiobook version so I could hear NPH read it!!
B0007TKNII|3.0|The DVD is of good quality and arrived in good condition.  I intended this for a 13 year old granddaughter who liked the music she had heard previously. I had seen a stage production of Phantom several years ago. I thought that this version was a little darker than the stage production. I watched it with my granddaughter and was able to explain some parts that were a little obscure. It also seemed to lack the intensity of the stage version. The Phantom character could have been developed more. We should have felt more compassion, but the character did not evoke our sympathy. Even so, the music still has a haunting quality. The sets and wardrobes were great.
0743290119|3.0|I have read the reviews of this book. And the majority of the reviews are terrible- and would defintely turn me off from the book if I had not already read this book myself.   To me, Lauren W is a author that you have to warm up to. The first few pages of The Devil Wears Prada, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. But I gave it a fair shake- and wound up really enjoying it.  This is not a terrible book- in fact if you go into reading this with the right attitude, I believe that you will find that this book can be enjoyable. It is something of a \\"beach read\\" but to me, you don't even have to be at the beach to enjoy it. It's light, fluffy, and not too serious. Really just a way to take your mind off the day to day stresses. Yes- these girls in this book are kind of silly, maybe even over the top; but they do have funny moments and are real in \\"a reality-show\\" type of way.  If you're looking for a book that will make you think, or one that will impress your friends- then by all means pass this book by. But if on the off chance, you are looking for a book that will make you laugh some, and take your mind of the daily stressors- then give this book a try.
0143038419|4.0|I read this book on the heals of Barn at the End of the World by Mary Rose O'Reilley which made it hard to digest Gilbert's whiny witticism. Gilbert herself admits her tendency to \\"verbal tap dance for pennies of affirmation\\"(p. 190). Her style is the complete opposite of O'Reilley's spare and insightful language, and her plight in the first 20-30 pages of the book seemed ridiculously ego-centered. But since many readers I trust enjoyed this book, I decided to stick it out for at least 100 pages and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />By the middle of the book, I was berating myself that a 35 year old woman (that is younger than my two of my own children) was having insights I'd yet to discover and in fact was underlining in her book. My favorite section is the India section as her time in the Ashram so resembles my own experience with meditation. I'm not much of a foodie, so I had trouble relating the Italian experience but it was without a doubt an essential part of Gilbert's journey and I \\"get it,\\" i.e the need for self-indulgence as part of the way out of sorrow. The Indonesian segment made me want to travel, to have Gilbert's adventurous spirit and her ease in new places. In this part, she truly demonstrated skill with capturing voices to portray character.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book, and though I wouldn't recommend reading O'Reilley and Gilbert side-by-side, in the end it turned out to enhance my experience of both books.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I got this DVD a month ago and am just beginning to get through level one without dying and that is following the modified girl in the workout.  Jillian is full throttle here and pushes you to your limits and beyond.  I am already starting to see toning take place and feel much stronger than before.  Here are the pros of this workout:  There is music.  There are three levels to go through and within each one there is a modified way to follow a standard way and an advanced so there is lots of room to grow and still find this challenging.    The three women are all in kick butt shape which motivates me to stick with it when it gets hard.    Jillian is still very instructive but without being annoying.  I really see few cons except that in the start of the DVD she gives a speech that you cannot skip past so it takes some time to load to the workout, but I just spend that time getting dressed.    This workout is HARD and beginners may find it above their level, but as Jillian points out \\"we are all capable of working out hard\\" and \\"you get out of life what you put in\\".    Each level takes only about 20 mins and that includes a warm up and cool down stretch.  I burn around 250 calories going through the modifed level one once.

0525951113|3.0|There have been quite a few books and movies that have imagined that computers will eventually take over the world. Few, however, can match this book for its level of technical detail that can make such a scenario really plausible.<br /><br />The set up is ingenious: Sobol, genius programmer, head of his own software company, and exceedingly rich, dies. Knowing his fate for some time previous to this, being diagnosed with an incurable ailment, he leaves a little surprise to carry on after his death, a daemon, basically a program set up to respond with various actions via carefully structured logic trees to events as they happen in the real world. As its first actions are to kill, in rather unusual ways, two of the other programmers who worked on pieces of the program, the police quickly become involved, and as the extent of the daemon's powers becomes more well known, the FBI and various other agencies are dragged into the maelstrom of identifying and nullifying it.<br /><br />But the daemon's actions extend to far more than just engineering these programmer's deaths, and there is a steady progression of events that shows quite clearly just how insidiously computers have not just invaded our everyday lives, but made us almost totally dependent on them. It is this aspect of the book that turns it into a real thriller, as the shear plausibility and easily seen relevance to the reader is enough to send shivers through your consciousness.<br /><br />Characterization is good, if not extremely complex, and the technical information is delivered in an easily understandable and unobtrusive manner. All very good up to about the three quarter point of this work. However, the last quarter seems to step over the line from very believable to totally incredible, as the daemon starts demonstrating powers that are well beyond any conceivable simple program and demanding that it really be a true artificial intelligence (which so far no one has actually come close to creating), destroying much of what had been so well done up to this point. On top of this, the last section of the book seems to degenerate into scenes clearly intended for a Hollywood \\"let's blow everything up\\" montage, with far too little explanation of the 'why' behind the actions.<br /><br />A fast, page-turning read, but with a quite disappointing end.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)been so well done up to this point.

B000RPTQ1C|3.0|Are you a fan of the U2 song \\"Where the Streets Have No Name?\\"   Because this Coldplay album contains a lot of songs that sound VERY much like that U2 song.  If you consider that a good thing, pick this album up very soon.  If not, well, probably best to avoid.  As for me, I like the album but it's not the best music I've ever heard.  I prefer other U2 songs.
B000O1799U|5.0|I have been waiting for a musical like this for a looooong time.  Since the musical days of the delectable Annie and Oliver Twist and Julie Andrews, there hasn't been a film musical that hit the note both musically and artistically.  There have been many feeble attempts (with the exceptions of Chicago and Moulin Rouge) but musical lovers such as myself were left to only reminisce the good ol' days - until the arrival of this film.<br /><br />Almost all film versions of musicals cast actors who can sing.  But this musical has cleverly casted singers who can act.  There is not one weak link in this ensemble cast.  Beyonce has come a long way as an actress and she takes on this role pleasantly.  She is sweet, innocent and a darling - and she pulls off her weight beautifully with her magnificent voice.  Eddie Murphy - what a pleasant surprise - the wise-ass donkey can sing his behind off!!  Jamie Fox didn't have a lot of singing (which was a bit disappointing as he has an incredible voice) but his presence in his acting definitely kept the film grounded.  And then there was Hudson - what a performance!!! She is a show-stopper!!!! - the greatest discovery in the film.  I've only mentioned the main players but even the extras who have a 10-second act are fantastic performers.<br /><br />This film not only will satisfy you musically, it has heart and soul just like the music.  Huge kudos to the director and the producers - and a sincere thanks from a true musical fan.
B00026WUAU|2.0|I can't help but feel slightly let down with this album.  Bob Dylan's first average album.  It was bound to happen sooner or later.  Street Legal is exactly that- every song sounds much poppier compared to previous efforts, not to mention somewhat fake-sounding as well, with the brass instruments.  It's a MUCH different sound than what Desire was going for.  It's much worse too.    Furthermore, most of these songs, while most of them are pretty melodic, it doesn't take long before I start getting tired of them.  Something about the way the record was recorded bothers me as well- everything sounds annoyingly loud and obnoxious, and if anything, it shows exactly what was around the corner for Mr. Dylan- a slow decline into mediocrity (but to be fair, the same fate was in store for many musicians from the 60's and 70's- those darn big 80's production values raining down on our timeless party!).    I admit I like the opening song along with a couple other ones, but classic this is most certainly NOT.
B000PC0S5K|1.0|I really needed some uplifting message from this book.  Deluded again.   I felt like I had no connection with what Tolle was saying.  It is like being in junior high and left out of the &#34;in&#34; group.
B000002OX5|5.0|What's amazing about this album is that there's a lot of diversity combined among the VERY melodic and entertaining songwriting.  This is probably one of the Who's best albums, though it's always been a tough choice between this or Tommy.  I say own BOTH albums.  You have the concept theme of Tommy, but the diverse songwriting talents of Who Sell Out.  Seriously, each song on the album sounds much different from the other ones, so that makes Who Sell Out a classic in my book.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I love the Godfather. These are incredible, epic sagas that todays Hollywood doesnt have the guts to create anymore. This great new collection restores the original films to their original luster and sheen; its like they were made last year instead of 30-plus years ago, the new picture transfers look that clear and crisp. If you already have the original 2001 DVD set, its worth getting this new reissue for the brand new look of the films as well as the all new documentaries created for this set.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I have used the Belkin Nostromo n-52, and wornout a saitek cyborg command unit which was a huge improvement over the stiff keyed nostromo. I use these units for extended hours of World of Warcraft play, and they aren't even comparable to the g13.  The G13 comes all ready to go, and has profiles prepared for many popular games that are ready to go automatically.  Seriously, buy it.    The keys are not overly stiff, but rather light with a noticable click like feel upon depresion.  the joystick is a bit stiffer that the saitek was, but this is compensated for by a longer shaft (more leverage) so all is good.  i guess this could be a problem for extremely small hands, but mine are smaller than normal for a man and it's all good in the hood for me.  The only problem i have is deciding what i want all the keys to do, which is a great problem to have.  I do wish the backlighting were capable of a truer red, but for all this thing can do, who cares!    it knows who is chatting with me, it tells me my stats including how full my bags are and how soon i need to repair, it has premade sets of displayed stats that are acctually useful to the main character types (dps, tank, healer).  I love it    i thought it was overpriced when i ordered, i no longer feel that way.  First product of this kind that not only hits the mark, but raises the bar.

0385340990|5.0|This novel is about Juliet, a one time author struggling to write her next book. Years before this story begins she had sold some of her books to make room on her shelves and make a little extra cash. On the inside of her books, she wrote her name and address. One day she gets a letter from a stranger in another country telling her how much her book had helped him through some hard times in his life. She begins to correspond with this stranger and ultimately learns about a literary society formed by the stranger and some of his neighbors during World War II. Each person within the literary group begins to write to Juliet to tell her of each side of the story. Through this correspondence Juliet discovers a topic for her next book and engages in relationships with each member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.<br /><br />I was not interested in this book when it first came out. The name alone is a mouthful and can put anyone off. However, some ladies in a book group in which I am a member raved about this book and piqued my curiosity. I ended up buying it and devouring it within a day or two. This book is different than a \\"normal\\" novel. This story is told in the form of letters. There are many different characters and the reader is given a glimpse into each character by each person's individual and unique writing style, personality, disposition, and attitude.<br /><br />When I first read the book I closed it and thought it was \\"okay.\\" It's an easy read and was an interesting concept. However, since I turned the last page and enclosed the letters and the individuals within them between the hardbound covers of the book I have not been able to let those characters go. Each one of them leapt out of the book and I have carried them in my heart with me everywhere I have gone since then. They will most likely join me on my future journeys as well.<br /><br />This book is full of love and loss, hope and despair. Friendships are created and enemies are found. You will laugh, cry, struggle, soar, ache with pain, and fall in love. It is amazing to me how fictional characters can make such an impact on a person's life. If you want a book that will make you think twice about your life and the people within it, read this book. Be thankful for the people you have today, the friends you lost yesterday, and the loves you will meet tomorrow. No matter how far away they may seem...they are right by your side.struggle, soar, ache with pain, and fall in love.

B001LF4IA6|5.0|This is what the CD means to me:  Each day, we face the realities of life which can tear us away from what matters.  This whole theme of not giving up hope and love in the face of life is shown in the title song \\"Working on a Dream.\\"       First, life throws a lot of crap at you (Outlaw Pete, Good Eye, The Wrestler).      Some songs reveal that confrontation between life's hard lessons vs. the power of love:  (My Lucky Day, What Love Can Do, Life Itself).  On these songs, and on the theme of the album, we hear that love is the victor.     Love's victory really comes through on songs like Tommorow Never Knows , Kingdom of Days, and Surprise, Surprise.  Queen of the Supermarket also expresses that wonder of romantic love.  But Bruce doesn't just talk about romantic love here.  He covers the love found in friendship (The Last Carnival), and love that is connected to the universe and its wonders (This Life).       Springsteen the realist doesn't sing about life from a one dimensional, simplistic, and naive point of view.  He's singing here about the struggles of life in which we can become victorious through love.    The music?  Picture Brian Wilson, Phil Spector, Roy Orbison, some \\"Something in the Night\\" sounds (from 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' album), rock, blues, and bluegrass.  Yes, the music is muddy sounding.  But picture Spector's \\"wall of sound\\" where everyone plays at once.  The sound is dramatic, and that is fitting, given the dramatic theme of the album. The drama sounding \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" the ending of \\"Queen of the Supermarket,\\" the beautiful Brian Wilson Pet Sounds type of intro in another song, as well as the touching organs in \\"The Last Carnival\\"... The dramatic lyrical theme of this CD is matched by dramatic sounds....      All this drama hints at the bigger drama of real love vs. the realities of life which is the thread...oh, and love is the easy victor here.       The 80's brought us some of Bruce's political stuff.  And he followed that with the introspective \\"Tunnel of Love.\\"  That's what this music thematically reminds me of.  We had the political \\"Magic\\" follwed by this introspective work.  But in \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" the idea seemed to be lost love (when taken in the context of his divorce)....but here, in this album, Bruce and love are the winners.  It ain't all easy, this love stuff.  But Bruce acknowledges that he's \\"working\\" on the dream...In this album, Bruce points that love is sure worth it.  He's victorious in the love he's found now...     A beautiful piece of work....the pure powerful force of love transforms human diffilculties and human reality...Very moving songs.....Superb......     (I edited my earlier reviews)

0312383320|4.0|Sigh.  What to say?  I definitely laughed out loud during the reading of this book...however, I was definitely looking forward to finishing it, and it was not one of those novels that I absolutely could not wait to pick up and begin reading again.  Those standard characters we've grown to know and love are there...plus a few new ones.  Lula is her usual large, spandex-laden self. Carl the monkey reappears--yet again--after Susan Stitch drops him off with Stephanie while she heads for her honeymoon.  Ranger and Morelli are both simply bit players in this silly tale...which is mostly featuring Diesel,  the gorgeous supernatural bounty hunter on the hunt for his equally gorgeous but evil cousin....who seeks to control the world by harnessing none other than the weather.  But there are also helmet-wearing monkeys, people who resemble Sasquatch, and men who fart fire....; it all may be a bit much for some of the more normal, run-of-the-mill readers to take.  Steph and her friends remain fun, but they are certainly becoming a bit repetitious.  What is needed here is a quick injection of novelty and creativity...in order to save this series.  HELP!!!      DYB
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I'm not even going to pretend to be objective about this show - I think it's the best TV series, ever. I was hooked within the first ten minutes of the pilot episode and have been thoroughly addicted ever since. I've bought all of the DVD sets and go back and watch them again prior to each new season and enjoy them just as much as I did the first time I saw them. It seems that people preferred the fourth season over season's two and three. I think that's mostly because the fourth season was much faster paced and mostly plot-driven. But I actually enjoyed watching the second and third seasons on DVD. They seemed much faster paced than I remembered them to be. It certainly helped watching two or three episodes at a time. Yes, the first three seasons were more leisurely paced and character-driven but, in my opinion, that just means they should be savored.  I was shocked that LOST didn't get a SAG nomination for ensemble acting. I guess my only point of comparison was the cast of Closer, the only nominee I'm familiar with. I like The Closer a lot. I record every episode on my DVR and I think it's a well produced show with an excellent cast. But I honestly don't think it can hold a candle to the ensemble acting of LOST. Since the beginning of its run, LOST has been blessed with extraordinary acting from its leading roles to its smallest supporting roles. There simply hasn't been a weak performance yet. The closest they've come to a bad performance was Maggie Grace's \\"Shannon\\" and as soon as the writers gave her character more to do than whine and bitch Ms. Grace immediately turned in a stunning performance.  I'm hoping the Emmys will do for LOST what the movie Academy did with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, namely wait until the final, concluding installment to really shower it with accolades. And when they do I hope they also acknowledge things like Art Direction, Cinematography, Musical Scoring, and Editing because all of LOST's production values are extraordinarily high.  I'm very happy with where the show seems to be headed. It's already been an immensely satisfying ride.   Well, I think I'll go watch the first episode again right now to remind myself of how this remarkable show got started.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|This is a 5 Star live album that demonstrates once and for all that JEFF BECK is the Greatest Electric Guitar Player EVER!  I have witnessed in concert just about every great guitarist out there ( even the obscure ones like Roy Buchanan who Jeff Beck dedicated \\" Cause We've Ended As Loves \\" to ), in every style (heck, I have seen Roy Clark), and many of those guitarists in different stages of their careers.                  This live album catches the best of them all in his finest form ( I have seen Jeff perform live nine times - 1981, 1986, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2006 twice )!!!  Listen to these songs and take note of his delicate touch, his change of tones ( without a row of pedals - it's all in his fingers ), his unbelievable use of the \\" wammy bar \\", his technical proficiency, and his musical fusion of styles.  There are a few songs that I wish were on this record.  On his \\" Jeff Beck Official Bootleg live \\" are the musical gems \\" Star Cycle \\" and \\" Somewhere Over the Rainbow \\", while \\" Seasons \\", \\" Goodbye Pork Pie Hat ( in it's entirety ) \\" and \\" Freeway Jam ( which Beck says he hates to play because it sounds like an Irish Jig) are found on \\" Jeff Beck Live at B.B. King Blues Club \\".                                                 I am so \\" sick \\" of hearing about Jimi Hendrix ( and listening to him )!  His legend has out grown the actual person he was and his ability to play the guitar.  To be blunt ( but truthful ), Hendrix was just another junkie who happen to be an awesome guitar player - ONE of the BEST to EVER LIVE!  He was, however, weak and as a result died by ingesting the drug of his choice, overdosing, and choking to death on his own vomit!  Jimi's death was not tragic - it was pathetic.  Randy Roads, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Michael Hedges, Duane Allman, and Rory Gallagher's deaths were tragic because they were victims of circumstance.  The \\" guitar community \\" still looks upon Hendrix as the greatest guitarist ever; however, there is another guitarist who can play guitar at a level that transcends the notes that are offered by the fretboard and his NAME is JEFF BECK!!!  Could of been ... should of been - people always talk about where Jimi would have taking the electric guitar if he had lived.  The point is moot...he's DEAD.  Besides, his guitar playing could have just as easily artistically and technically stagnated just like so many other 60's guitar heros.       If you want to hear the ultimate Guitar God, - the Guitarist's Guitarist- then purchase this CD and bask in it's brilliance as you listen to the best there is!!!

B000E6ESL2|5.0|STAY is one of those odd little movies that seem to make no sense until the very end. Like CARNIVAL OF SOULS, JACOB'S LADDER, DARK CORNERS, MULLHOLLAND DRIVE, INLAND EMPIRE, etc., STAY creates a mysterious, alternate universe where dream and reality intersect. Psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor), his girlfriend, Lila Culpepper (Naomi Watts), and his new patient Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling) are caught up in a shifting nightmare-scape of unraveling sanity. Sam is especially intrigued by Henry's story and his seemingly psychic, almost supernatural abilities. Sam is drawn into Henry's world, which eventually bleeds through and overtakes his own. There are many \\"WTF?\\" moments! We are left to be just as confused and confounded as Sam. However, if we can hold on until the final act, we will be rewarded w/ an inovative conclusion. I was impressed...

B001F7MSG6|5.0|I got swindled into seeing the original Hellboy...not knowing pretty much anything about the background of Hellboy or even what to expect, I came out of the theater with mixed feelings. I typically enjoy this type of superhero/fantasy action-type film, but I felt as though the original really didn't offer me much in the way of true excitement.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years when I and a bunch of friends I hadn't seen in a LONG time finally got together and we sat down to decide what movie we could all agree on...it was 4 votes to 1 (guess who voted 'nay'?) to see Hellboy II. I tried--honestly I tried to get them to agree on Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 but they would NOT budge. Consequently, I went into this film with rather low expectations--and man was I wrong!<br /><br />Hellboy II turned out to be unbelievably better than the original--and I realize I may be in the minority regarding how poorly I feel about the 1st film, but I gotta tell you, the sequel ROCKED. From the stunnnig special effects to a clever story, and let's not forget great casting as well as finely tuned directing, what isn't to enjoy about H2? Personally the biggest factor in the movies success has GOT to be the fact that at NO point did the movie ever take itself too seriously. Tongue-in-cheek humor abounds throughout the film, mostly coming from the superb acting of Ron Pearlman as Hellboy. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of stand-out roles sprinkled all over the movie, but for me, it was the main character which honestly gives this particular story the real bite needed in order to make it totally worth seeing--not just once, either.<br /><br />What else can I say? If you liked the original, you will positively LOVE H2 and if you are like me and only thought the 1st was marginally entertaining, then be prepared for an exciting shocker. About the only thing negative I have to say about the film was the build-up to the films climax featuring the Golden Army was so big, that the final conflict literally fizzled...at least for me anyway. I have to say that Hellboy's final fight was about what I expected, but--well, I don't want to spoil the end for you too much.<br /><br />All in all a rare sequel that not only improved upon the original, but for MY $$ actually made up for the fact that I didn't really like the 1st one all that much to begin with.y fizzled...at least for me anyway.

1563898586|5.0|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is sort of a Serial Adventure story, unlike Moore's more complex works like Watchmen and V for Vendetta.  This is not a criticism, however.  League is one fine piece of entertainment, and it's a shame the movie turned out to be so poor.  Moore takes classic characters from 19th century English Literature and puts them in a superhero comic.  Moore makes good use of Victorian England and 19th century technology to create an environment that is different from most superhero comics yet familiar at the same time.  Blimps are used in place of airplanes for example.<br /><br />Alan Quatermain, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, and the Invisible Man make up the league that the British government has assembled to stop crime.  Each character is entertaining in his or her own way, but I must say Mr. Hyde really steals the show.  He's become an Incredible Hulk character, only smarter. Hyde has a knack for cutting through bull and telling it like it really is.  The Invisible Man is the character the league can't really trust entirely, which makes him all the more interesting.  Nemo is introduced as one of the more sane characters but turns out to be even crazier than Mr. Hyde.  Mina and Quatermain are the straight men in this story, and we certainly need them, considering the colorful characters that surround them.  Mina is quite the feminist and Quatermain is the character that doesn't know what he's gotten himself into.<br /><br />The story is exciting, but I was taken aback by how funny the comic really is.  There are moments of hilarity that could have been great on the big screen.  My favorite joke is when Hyde grabs Mina's hand and starts to hurt her.  Quatermain picks up his gun and threatens to shoot him, but Mina calmly says something like \\"Mr. Hyde you are hurting me, and I have to ask you to let go of my hand.\\"  Mr Hyde pauses for a second and lets go.  I'm sure it doesn't sound funny in this review, but it really works in the comic.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this comic to any fan of comic books, superhero movies, or serial adventure movies along the line of Indiana Jones.omic.

031606792X|4.0|This is the fourth book in Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series.  It picks up where Bella, Edward, and Jacob left off after their battle with Jame's mate Victoria.   I don't want to spoil the book for anyone so I will let the suspense of the continuing saga go forth.      The book itself was not where I thought the series would lead to but I feel it was well written with many twists and turns.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of it to see what is next.  There are a few slower instances but you need those later to understand the action and the drama.  It creates a nice setup for the next book to follow.    I would recommend this book and have to many friends and family.  It is a must have if you want to have the full idea of the whole series.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The Dark Knight is really an overwhelming experience. For a two and a half hour movie, it really goes by fast. The film's plot is simple: While Harvey Dent, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman try to bring down the Mob, the Joker outsmarts them at every turn. The fight to stop the Joker becomes more than a fight to stop crime, however. The Joker attempts to bring out the worst in everybody, to prove that we are all as mad as him. He targets the people that everybody holds most dear: hospital patients, civilians, politicians, cops, and the woman Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent love, Rachel Dawes. Batman and Harvey Dent have to struggle to prove they are better men than the Joker.  Bruce Wayne has hope the Dent will be able to clean up the city, and plans on settling down with Rachel Dawes.  I felt this part of the plot was a little rushed and somewhat predictable.  Does every superhero have to try to give up being a superhero?  This is only a minor quibble though.<br /><br />Heath Ledger gives an outstanding performance. He slips into the role like a glove, something Jack Nicholson really could not do because his personality was too strong. They utilized Ledger perfectly. He steals the show whenever he is on screen but it never feels like this is a Joker movie.  His \\"humor\\" is so sick I think audiences laugh only because they are uncomfortable. As many critics have noted, The Dark Knight works as a legitimate crime drama as well as a superhero movie. All of the Joker's schemes would fit right into a movie like Silence of the Lambs or Seven. They are so intense I was at the edge of my seat whenever he was on screen. I particularly liked his announcement to Gotham City that if a certain individual (can't recall his name) was not dead within 60 minutes, he would blow up a hospital. It was the perfect type of scheme for the Joker. With every scheme, explosion, and every person killed, the Joker pushes Batman to his limits.<br /><br />The entire cast gives an all around good job. Aaron Eckhart gives a good performance as Harvey Dent. The combination of make-up and CGI for his face was perfect. Christian Bale was even more intense this time around, although his voice is sometimes grating. The scene where he interrogates the Joker is the most suspenseful scene in the movie. I should also note that the action scene editing was a major improvement over Batman Begins. Sometimes Nolan cuts a little too quickly but it is not as distracting this time.<br /><br />I only have a few minor criticisms (Big time SPOILERS). I still do not like Christopher Nolan's Gotham City. I understand he went for the modern look to give it a more realistic, serious feel, but Gotham has never looked modern in the comics. I just think Gotham should have a distinctive look. Maggie Gyllenhall, while better than Katie Holmes, sometimes acted a little out of character for an assistant D.A. Finally, I think they should have saved Two-Face for the third movie. Killing him off in this movie made his story feel rushed. I can't really think of another Batman bad guy whose story can really compare to Harvey Dent's. They are going to have a tough time coming up with a bad guy for the third film. Nevertheless Harvey Dent's story arc is tragic and effective. Harvey Dent represented the hope and strength Gotham needed to overcome evil. He was written and portrayed a million times better than he was in Batman Forever. His fall from grace gives Joker the last laugh, and Batman has to cover up everything Two-Face did so as not to hurt Gotham's morale or release the prisoners Dent put in jail.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing where they will take the Batman character in the next movie. The Dark Knight stands towards the top of the list of best Superhero movies for its perfect portrayal of the characters and all around intensity.ives a good performance as Harvey Dent.

B0017R5UAA|3.0|Takes a dedicated focus on the songs to get into.  Pretty good once you really listen but not easy to catch onto after a few listens.  Listen to it many times before deciding what you you think.
B001LF4IA6|1.0|I read that this was album was recorded during the Magic tour and that they just had so much material from Magic that they kept going.  Well those songs that didn't make Magic landed in the dust bin for a reason, and if you insist on recording them please take the time in the studio to to it right.  So much of this sounds like left over melodies and lazy lyrics simply rushed to market, and much of it simply feels unfinished.    Ultimately this feels like a slap in the face to fans who simply expect more effort.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|After reaching legend status in the early 1980's with The River, Nebraska, and Born In The U.S.A., The Boss struggled to put out any memorable collection of songs in the 1990's.<br /><br />After a 7 year break, Springsteen roared back in 2002 (the E Street Band in tow) with a rock masterpiece, The Rising, that received near universal acclaim from music critics and became his highest selling album of new material in 15 years.  After a couple solo experiments that were also successful (see Devils & Dust, The Seeger Sessions), Bruce brought the whole band back together for what was perhaps the most memorable and passionate album of 2007, Magic.  It featured a fiery Bruce railing against the direction America has taken under George Bush and also was widely praised by critics and was commercially successful.<br /><br />Bruce campaigned hard for Barack Obama in 2008 and his dream of change in America has come true...and it shows!  Working On A Dream is the latest addition to a fabulous run of albums that Bruce and the E Street Band have been on since The Rising.  The songwriting is powerful, the lyrics are eloquent (mostly, which I'll get to in a minute), the music flat out rocks, and there's even some experimentation going on here with new and old sounds alike.<br /><br />There are a lot of standout tracks on this album.  One that stands out in not so good way is \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\".  The song has moments of musical innovation but has several lyrical verses that could frankly...well...use some work.  Setting that song aside, this album is a deep collection or great, upbeat tunes for the new Obama era let by the joyous and infectios \\"My Lucky Day.\\"<br /><br />Most of the reviews from critics so far have been positive, but after reading some of the negativity I feared that \\"Dream\\" wouldn't be able to match the genuine inspiration of The Rising and Magic.  What a relief!  While Bruce focuses less on politics here and more on relationships, the joy that the feels about the direction of our American culture is unmistakable.<br /><br />Don't miss this album, it's going to be one of 2009's essentials!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I heard so much nit-picking apart of this album that I didn't buy it for a long time. Why? Sure the sound has changed a bit, but if you're not growing as an artist, you're dieing. Josh is at his very brightest when he is being experimental. The tracks with African sounds are two of my favorites. Granted, Machine is a little far off. It's not a bad song, but so different from the rest that I can't get into it. But this is the first of his albums that I've been able to listen to all the way through without skipping tracks -- quite an experience. Looking foward to what he comes out with next.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|Were all (actual) widescreen prints destroyed or something? I'm not a big fan of this movie, in fact I much prefer the 1999 version that actually adapts the musical. But when I saw this for the first time it was in Pan and Scan and yet during A Hard Knock Life you could see the kids knocking themselves out clearly. Here they zoomed in on the picture so that they knock themselves out offscreen. And this has the worst pan and scan job ever too- half the time we only see the characters' noses.
B00155GDXC|3.0|This book was not what I expected at all. That doesn't mean anything good or bad, it was just really different from what I had imagined upon picking it up. Changez is a young Pakistani man telling his story to an American he encounters in his hometown. Changez tries to calm the man's fears, telling him that he has lived in America and is pleased to offer hospitality to the stranger. Changez tells his story: a highly intelligent Princeton graduate who goes to work for an elite New York firm and falls in love with a beautiful American woman. Changez is torn in his new life: he loves his work, spending time with Erica, and truly feels as if he is a New Yorker (although not necessarily an American); but his heart and mind keep returning to Pakistan, especially after the 9/11 attacks and the escalation of tension between his homeland and India.<br /><br />This short book packs a pretty large punch. It demonstrates how a man a normal, everyday human being, accepted and even admired one day; can turn into a fundamentalist, almost without noticing. The line is quite fine in Changez's life. Interesting premise and book, although it did feel a bit too rushed towards the end.
1433210428|5.0|This is a very powerful piece of work that is truly life changing for the person that is ready for it.  An amazing book.
B001G9F9IW|2.0|Of course this is a great movie, but there are absolutely no extras that you would expect on a nearly $30 blu-ray disc.  All you get is the movie and Spanish and English subtitles.  Seriously disappointing.  Recommend saving ten bucks and just getting it on regular DVD.
B001CU1RRM|5.0|I am not a fan of Michael Jackson. I am a Prince fan. I am a fan of musicians, not just singers. So I should be a fan of Justin Timberlake and Usher right? Wrong. Getting back to Jacko. Usually BEST OF, GREATEST HITS or ESSENTIAL albums/box sets are filled with their complete hit catalogue. But there is always a song or two that should be on there and one song that is one there that shouldn't be. Who (or whom)ever arranged this hit fulfilled 3.0 package is just a few songs of perfect. Agree or disagree.<br /><br />First of all, The 3rd disc starts with \\"Can't Get Outta The Rain\\". Now before I continue, here's Amazon's start of their product description of the Essential Limited series. 'Each Essential Limited Edition 3.0 expanded 3-CD set features the biggest hits and best-loved songs from superstar artists'. \\"Can't Get Outta The Rain\\" Best-loved? This song is awful. It's mocking disco with silly chants and noises. Quincy Jones should hide under a tree if ever asked about producing this one. They should have omitted that one. Secondly, where's songs like \\"You Can Win\\" from his Scarecrow role in the motion picture THE WIZ? Where's \\"Scream\\"? The only song that he's ever done a duet on record with his sister, Janet Jackson. Of even The Jacksons \\"State Of Shock\\" with Mick Jagger? Surely you don't mean to say that there was not enough room on the 3rd disc for those two tracks while disc 1 has 21 and disc 2 has 17 tracks on them, pushing disc 3 to 10 selections from 7, my goodness, would be-pushing it?<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an awesome set. Remember, I AM NOT A MICHAEL JACKSON FAN. But aside from my complaint, it gets no better than this. Starting with a few Jackson 5/Motown tracks to Michael's Motown solo hits, to shifting to The Jacksons and Epic to Michael doing it alone and never turning back. Questionable 2nd verse lyrics in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" (lyrics slightly different from the THRILLER album). There's nothin' BAD you can say about this box set, really.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Suprisingly just about everyone, Stallone decided to make a real movie with Rocky Balboa instead of the cartoons that had preceeded it; the only sequel that is true in spirit to the original, it can be a bit slow in the first half but it's a worthy film and a fine capper to the series.
0743290119|1.0|I have read both of Lauren Weiseberger's books.  I loved the Devil Wears Prada and I enjoyed Everyone Worth Knowing.  But Chasing Harry Winston was a huge let down.<br /><br />It feels like Weisberger is trying to become Candace Bushnell - three female friends in the city, talking about love and relationships.  Unlike Bushnell, Weisberger characters are not developed.  Unlike her first two books (about ordinary women being thrown into a world tha they are unfamiliar with) Chasing Harry Winston is full of three self assured characters that are whiny, superficial, and annoying.<br /><br />The dialogue was dull.  I kept hoping that it would get better and forced myself to keep reading on - it did not.  Instead, I found that I was skipping entire paragraphs of copy because I was losing interest so fast.<br /><br />The three character format is also very jumpy.  One minute a character is on the phone, the next they are in bed with a stranger.  While I believe in books for entertainment sake, these situations are so highly unlikely that it's hilarious.<br /><br />Unless you are in the mind for some mindless entertainment, I would skip this book and opt for Weisberger's earlier works.  Hopefully she'll return to her roots for future books.
0792162803|2.0|The Bottom Line:    I have no idea who the audience for Superstar is supposed to be, for even people who like the Mary Katherine Gallagher character in short sketches are sure to tire of her after a full movie; another unfunny comedy for people who find stupidity inherently amusing, Superstar is not a movie to spend money or time on.
630463949X|4.0|Great concert performance buy all.  My only negative is the cost of the disc then getting a cheap cardboard box to store it.  Couldn't they splurge and give us a nice plastic box that snaps closed?
B000LXH0AE|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Sadly ignored while in theatres, Stranger than Fiction is a clever movie which runs with its premise while culling a good deal of pathos from its high-concept scenario; also featuring fine dramatic turns by Will Farrell and Dustin Hoffman, Stranger than Fiction earns its ending and (hopefully) your time and/or money.
B001G9F9IW|4.0|Woody Allen likes to let the movie speak for itself.  He's never been one for extras, and the fact that this edition has none should be no surprise.    The picture quality is excellent, and makes it worth buying this over the SD version.  You won't be disappointed on that front.    The audio is not 5.1 as the specs suggest.  Dialogue and most sound comes through your main front speaker, and the front surround speakers are used for the musical portions of the film.  Again, though, this is typical for Allen films.  The dialogue is clear and easy to understand, and that's all that really matters with a movie like this, right?    If you're a Woody Allen fan, then I highly recommend you pick this up.  You won't be disappointed.
B000MZHW40|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Jennifer Connelly never seems quite necessary and the movie rambles at times, but the two male leads are very good and the anarchic setting is milked for everything it's worth; Blood Diamond is not a perfect film but it'll stay with you.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|The bonus feature of putting all of the events that happened in the order that they happened was really helpful.  I am a loyal Lost fan.  This season was the best so far.  My favorite character is Locke, and I am hoping that he will come back to life once they get back to the island!
B000KX0IOA|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Gandhi is a reasonably well-made and certainly expensively-mounted version of the Mahatma's life that decides to deify its subject rather than examining him but nonetheless emerges as a solid biopic.
B00005M1CO|5.0|This is one of my favorite power metal/ folk metal, and just metal in general albums of all time. seriously i dont know what else to say other than that you should get this. its seriously awesome. White Willow.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The Bottom Line:    Casino Royale features well-directed (no shaky cam here) and visceral action sequences used to service a clever plot, an effective villain, a beautiful and intelligent Bond girl played with panache by Eva Green, and a tremendous debut by Craig; I've seen every Bond film so believe me when I tell you that it easily cracks the top 5.
B001HN6972|4.0|Warning:  this review contains a significant spoiler.  If you really have no idea what the movie is about, and don't want to know...read no further.  I don't discuss anything beyond what you find in virtually any review about the film...but be warned nonetheless.    THE READER is fabulously well-acted, and thus it is a gripping drama.  When it's all said-and-done, though...I was left perplexed as to how to react.  I didn't have mixed feelings about it...I literally wasn't sure how I felt.    That may be both a huge accomplishment and a failing.  THE READER essentially conspires to make us sympathize (to one extent or another) with a Nazi war-criminal.  In a way, the film may be doing this to help illustrate how easy it is to turn away or ignore horrible things going on.  To give some sense of how so many Germans could have turned a blind eye at the atrocities of the SS during World War II.  Yet by the same token, the film cheats in evoking these feelings because we are introduced to the main character years after the war, and are led to see her in a sympathetic manner...feelings that stick with us throughout the film.    Kate Winslet plays Hanna, a 30 something woman working as a conductor on a streetcar in post-war Germany.  She lives a quiet life in a tiny apartment, making a very small ripple in the world.  One day, she shows a little kindness to 15 year-old Michael, and when he returns to Hanna's apartment to thank her some weeks later, the two fall into a deep, passionate and highly inappropriate affair.  Hanna clings to Michael for some kind of comfort, yet she is also quite demanding on him.  She will give him virtually anything he can imagine sexually, yet she holds up a very solid wall against his efforts to build a truly intimate relationship.  He is, understandably, madly in love with this amazing older woman who is teaching him things his friends can only imagine.  And he also reads to Hanna (at her insistence):  short stories, novels like HUCKLEBERRY FINN, etc.      One day, Hanna just disappears and Michael is left bereft.  Years later (I won't explain the circumstances), Michael finds that Hanna is on trial for war crimes...apparently she was a guard who led a fair share of women to the death chambers and also left a large group of women and children to die in a church fire.  There is no question she was involved...but to what extent?  Did she have a valid reason?  And does Michael know something about Hanna that could help her?  And if he DOES...should he use it, or should he let Hanna \\"suffer\\" a large punishment?    This dilemma is at the crux of what the film is about.  It explores guilt and it also explores the idea of a \\"shared\\" guilt.  I know the book upon which THE READER is based was written by a German, so I believe both works also are working at understanding the national guilt Germany feels, or the world thinks it should feel.  And it was this exploration that left me perplexed.  Am I supposed to sympathize with Hanna?  If I were in Michael's shoes, would I want to help her or hurt her or ignore her?      And in this story, Michael is also deeply affected by the sense of loss and betrayal Hanna's sudden disappearance left him with.  He has become a person who is closed-off from his feelings and reluctant to open himself to others.  Frankly, he's become an unlikeable, uptight jerk.    How the relationship between Hanna and Michael grows and changes and concludes is the through-line of this movie.  It is certainly and interesting and compelling drama.    And the three stars of the film make it very, very watchable.  Kate Winslet, who can do virtually no wrong, gives one of her best performances.  Her character is frequently unlikeable (even before we know about her past)...yet we can certainly see why a 15 year old would be hopelessly smitten by this damaged person.  And although her old-age makeup isn't always the best, Winslet develops her character convincingly over several decades.  The young Michael is played by David Kross, a very talented young man who very convincingly portrays the reserve of a child of a wealthy family, as well as the enthusiasm for sex that only teens can have, along with a very touching effort to try to understand Hanna and make her happy.  Older Michael is played by Ralph Fiennes, who once again shows how many different ways a closed-off, repressed person can be played.  It's another type-casting for Fiennes, but as always, he pulls it off as no other modern actor can.    So while I found THE READER a perplexing puzzle at times, I still greatly enjoyed the film.  It is crisply directed, and the cinematography makes the German countryside sparkle.  It is not flashy, but it is still softly powerful and disquieting in how much it can make us care for these far from perfect people.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Sinking to levels of despair and grimness that mainstream holiday releases rarely do, The Pursuit of Happyness is both a welcome antidote to the streams of formulaic treacle that we're used to seeing and just about the most depressing \\"uplifting\\" story ever.
0525478183|4.0|Paper Towns is the story of a boy named Q who has been in love with his next door neighbor, Margo, for as long as he can remember. After a long night of adventures, which to me was a bit dragged out, Margo disappears. This takes Q to work with his friends as well as Margo's friend to try and figure out what has happened to her and where she has gone.<br /><br />The adventure and mystery that surrounds Margo leads the main character to eventually figure out things about himself.<br /><br />This is a pretty good book with highly imaginative plots and a ton of on your seat parts. I was eager to finish the book to find out where the clues that Margo left led Q. What's great about this book is that it sends out a powerful message. Never judge a book by its cover plays a big part in it. It shows how the next jock or popular girl is completely different once you get to know them and also, we're all really much alike as people. The book to me was a lot more about a self discovery while the reader is engrossed in the adventure and mystery.<br /><br />The only thing that made me take off one star is because of how slow the book got at points. The wordiness of a passage will drag on or there are just parts that I wish were taken out. I will not speak of specific ones which would spoil the book but there were just parts where I did not care to read about what they were doing every single hour.<br /><br />Overall, it's a fun read and recommended for adventure/mystery readers. I found deeper meaning into it but that meaning is really well woven into a story that will excite the reader.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|The Bottom Line:    I still don't think that the Japanese plotline fits in with the rest of the film, but Babel is a consistently-engaging and thought-provoking drama which manages to be different without being pretentious and multicultural without being obvious.
B000066C1N|5.0|Excellent.  Great for \\"any\\" age.  My grand children request this DVD every time they visit.  I enjoy watching it with them.  All of us do!  A great DVD to add to your DVD library!
B000E33W1W|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Ghostbusters, though beloved, is not a terribly good movie--the special effects are no longer impressive so we're left only with the uneven comedy (weak beyond Bill Murray) and a goofy Rick Moranis--watch it if you must but don't expect a classic.
0618918248|5.0|This book is properly titled, well organized, concise, informative, and effectively convincing. I highly recommend it and my consciousness has been raised.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Agonizingly long and additionally slow because Matt Damon's lead character is blandness personified, The Good Shepherd sounds good on paper but should be avoided at all costs: it fails as a history lesson and it sure as heck fails as a movie.
B000AY74OG|2.0|The Movie Madagascar is terrible for children.  It teaches them to spit, use words such as freak, etc.  I would not recommend this for children.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvana's third and sadly final album is taken to a completely different direction. In Utero is darker, heavier, and much more intense than Nevermind. You can tell with the first two tracks, \\"Serve the Servants\\" and \\"Scentless Apprentice\\", these are in no way similar to \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" or \\"Polly\\". \\"Rape Me\\" is probably the only song that's similar to those in Nevermind.<br /><br />But does this album fail because the musicians have done something different? Hell, no! This is an equally stunning album with heavy guitar riffs and disturbing lyrics. \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" is my most favorite song from Nirvana, and to tell you the truth, this is the song that drew me into their music. This is ultimate rock music right here. I would also recommend Stone Temple Pilots and Alice in Chains.<br /><br />R.I.P. Kurt Cobain
1607960001|5.0|De Rigour in Ivy League 100-level creative writing courses for decades,  The Elements of Style is a classic easy to read \\"How To\\" guide. It remains an essential concise desktop library component for anyone who crafts corporate communiques, and will benefit fledgling creative literary geniuses, as well.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This show is complex, well thought out and has a lot of developed characters.  A lot of bad things happen to and by cops in this show and you think it is way beyond reality - but if you live in Chicago and read some of the stuff that some rogue cops did to folks, and it is not a stretch at all.  The plot weaves throughout the entire series over 7 seasons.
B000RJO578|4.0|We thoroughly enjoy all of the nuttiness in Hot Fuzz, but don't like vulgarity. So we watch it with our Clearplay machine and it's a really funny movie. We also edit out gore, and have never seen the \\"R\\" rated version, so I can't voice an opinion for the full edition. I can heartily recommend it with Clearplay.
B00005JPFH|5.0|I bought this for my teen-aged son for his birthday.  He loves the spiderman series and really wanted to own them.  It was a great addition to his collection and a nice birthday gift.  the item arrived in good time and was in the condition promised.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|I read the bad reviews on the disc and there was a few complaints about the disc's failing. There may have been a bad batch out there but I didn't get one. Out of all the thousands sold Amazon only got about 8 or 9  complaints, it almost swayed me not to buy it but I took a chance and came out o.k.. Watching this movie in the widescreen format is the only way to watch it.
B00003CXB4|4.0|Directors, Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff deliver a powerfully moving and entertaining movie about a lion cub, who is fooled by his uncle, who is next in line to the throne, that he has killed the Lion King, and flees their land in shame. Then, later, all grown up, he returns to claim the throne.    The story is captivating and engaging throughout.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This is a tale that goes way back to the months after I graduated high school in 1974 -- a young Frenchman named Phillipe Petit managed to string a rightwire between the nearly-completed towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Then, for an hour, he walked about danced across the rope -- a quarter of a mile in the sky -- above the heads of amazed New Yorkers and their less-amused constabulary.<br /><br />\\"Man on Wire\\" splices current interviews with film, video and still footage from the 1970s to tell the story. Petit is a dynamo -- a frenetic blend of pluck, skill and insanity who gathers around him a hodge-podge of volunteers who help him execute his art. This is a story of romance, careful planning, athletic excellence, technical skill, sleuthing and near escapes. It is utterly delightful to watch. Except, perhaps, for the fact that the sluthing was being done on the WTC, a building that was also surveilled by those with less artistic intents. This unavoidable sense of sadness and loss is not addressed directly in the film, but colors every frame. Some of Petit's still undimmed wildness seems misplaced given the context.<br /><br />\\"Man on Wire\\" is a beautiful film, with stunning photography taken by the gang that conquered the Twin Towers -- in a good way. A neat DVD extra (that *does* address the loss of the towers) is a Scholastic animated after-school special that tells the tale in about 10 minutes. My wife and I loved the whole thing.
B00006CXSS|5.0|A great series of films about WWII. Most griping was the scene where Easy Company enters a Death Camp. Well done and recommended.
B000002JR8|5.0|Rarely do you hear an album this punishing that is still coherent and well put together.  From the pure brutality of \\"Slaughtered\\" to the mellow Black Sabbath cover, this CD never takes a breather.  At times Far Beyond Driven reaches into thrash metal, but stays rooted soundly in the groove metal that Pantera excelled at.
B0000048CP|5.0|So, although I give this 5 stars, the audio quality of the Kraze version is pretty bad, but I look right past it. This is album is just amazing from start to finish. Quorthon made a landmark album with this one. The standout songs for me are \\"A Fine Day To Die\\", \\"Holocaust\\", \\"For All Those Who Died\\" and \\"Blood Fire Death\\"...don't get me wrong, every song is amazing, but these few are the ones that stood out the most in my opinion. Now considering the fact that the audio quality and production was never the greatest on any version of this album, the one released by Kraze is pretty horrible. There is no book, it's just an insert which looks to have been bootlegged although it isn't. But I still recommend ANY version of this just because the songs \\"For All Those...\\" and \\"Blood Fire Death\\" is worth the horrible production. Recommended for anyone who appreciates old school black metal, or just any metal in general.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|Philippe Petit is the focus of this film, and of course there are the Trade Towers. Seeing stock footage of them being constructed was remarkable, visually similar to the way they looked after 9/11. A hauntingly, surreal reminder of the positive energy it takes to build.    My Amazon comment title says that the film is too long. I think it is. While supportive footage of other crossings and Petit's friends is essential, there is too much of it. The extended length of the film does not add to the suspense of finally being on The Wire.    The Scholastic animated bonus feature on the dvd is a delight and in some ways better than the Man on Wire film. It was a caring, insightful film intended for children and adults - to tell Petit's story and to also help viewers as they are reminded of the devastation of 9/11. Details of Petit's crossing were beautifully rendered and made more clear in this very nice little film.

B001CLG6RC|4.0|well ofcourse its another beautiful album from Enigma. I'm giving it 4 starts only because I've missed the 'dark mist' that covers their songs in their previous albums. But still, this album got its own...taste! I love most of the songs. Thanks Engima for this wonderful music.
B00000JQFM|2.0|2 1/2     Surely an important or influential electric solo guitar disc, but one whose tracks have only partially withstood the test of time. A select group of compositions extend  melodics usually not found in the restrictive genre, helping to steer away from the collective 80's metal assault that still crept into much production and robbed at least half of SWTA from staying fresh.
B00016POFE|4.0|This review pertains specifically to the DVD-A.  Another outstanding Porcupine Tree recording. But I have to ding the DVD-A one star (from 5 to 4).  I own the audio CD and purchased the DVD-A specifically for the High Resolution Stereo tracks.  However the Stereo program is 16-bit (same as the audio CD) not 24-bit.   This is the first DVD-A I have found on which the Stereo tracks are not 24-bit.   Very odd. Caveat Emptor.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Daniel Day-Lewis turned in a spectacular performance yet again.  However, this film started out at a snail's pace with no dialog for what seemed like forever. Plot development was poor, even non-existent.  I waited at the edge of my seat for a deep story line to develop, but was sorely disappointed when NOTHING happened.    This film didn't at all live up to the hype surrounding it.  I wasted 158 minutes of my life watching it.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|I too went to see this film because of the free tickets received with our classic Bond blu-rays. Thank the lord the tickets were free otherwise we would have demanded our money back.     Nothing against Daniel Craig, he is a talented actor in some areas, but not as Bond. As one of the other reviews stated he is the most un-Fleming like Bond. Which makes him good, how? Bond should be Bond and in this movie he is a low level Jason Bourne action movie ripoff.     But that is not the problem with the movie. The problem with Quantum of Solace surprisingly isn't the title and isn't the non Bond worthy star, it is the director and the guys from the Bourne movies that were hired to film it.    The action scenes are a confusing mess. A really bad mess, there are times it is hard to tell who is doing what to whom, and even better yet WHY.  To that point the plot makes little to no sense at all. Beyond the brooding, charmless Bond going after revenge for his suicided girlfriend.  (a foot note: she killed herself,it is nothing like when Blofeld murdered Bond's wife.)  Holding a bankrupt 3rd world nation ransom is a good move. That is what Blofeld and SPECTRE would do right? Oh. That's right he wouldn't.. Why would anyone try to pass this plot off to the movie going public is the biggest mystery surrounding Quantum of Soalce.    As it turns out the biggest insult was yet to come, the extras included in this Blu-ray are almost non existent. Where is the alternate ending the director talked about? Where are the cut scenes? Could there possibly be a directors cut of this film that has makes sense of the movie.  No. Not on this edition which is ashame.     If you (are among the few who) saw Quantum of Solace and liked it you should pick it up on Blu-ray, it will never look or sound better. If you thought it was Okay then wait for the inevitable second release which will contain the extras which will make it worth while.    As for me I'm skipping this one and ordering the next wave of Classic Bond Blu-rays and if I want to see Daniel Craig in halfway decent movie I'll watch Casino Royale, on Blu-ray of course.
0525951113|5.0|Few readers were more saddened by the premature death of Michael Crichton than I was.  Ever since his death (and truthfully even before it) I'd read any novel that promised to introduce \\"the next Crichton.\\"  Invariably, I'd come away disappointed.  Until Daemon.  Daniel Suarez's debut novel gave me hope for the future of smart, complex techno-thrillers.  What a read!  What a find!  Thank you, Amazon Vine!<br /><br />Daemon is the story of... Well, it's a little hard to summarize.  The catalyst of this novel is the death (from brain cancer) of Matthew Sobol.  Sobol is the young, multi-millionaire genius behind a computer gaming empire.  Specifically, he made his fortune designing MMORPGs, and if you're like me, you're a reader who doesn't know squat about Massively Multi-player Online Role Playing Games.  That's okay, you'll get educated along the way.<br /><br />So, Matthew Sobol spent a lot of time thinking about society and the world we live in as his death approached, and apparently he found it lacking.  Or, perhaps, the tumors in his brain drove him mad.  Take your pick.  In either case, Sobol set in motion an elaborate plan that would be kicked off, only after a computer read of his obituary in the news.  That was the catalyst that released the eponymous computer daemon into the world.<br /><br />For those that don't know (i.e. me), a daemon is a process that runs in the background and performs a specified operation at predefined times or in response to certain events.  And that's precisely what Sobol's Daemon does.  The obituary triggers the murders of some of the programmers that took part in the daemon's creation--in quite creative ways, I might add.  And that is literally the start of the novel, and how we get introduced to homicide detective Peter Sebeck.  Pete is our everyman, the one who asks the questions about technology so that the reader doesn't have to.  And initially, it seemed that Sebeck would be the protagonist of a fairly typical police procedural.  I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />First, rather than have a single (or a few) protagonists and antagonists, Suarez tells his tale with an ever-expanding cast.  It's very hard to tell who will be a major character and who will make a brief appearance, never to be seen again.  And even among the more major characters, don't get too attached, because no one is safe in this novel.  This daemon is playing for keeps.  Through the computer attacks, it is almost as if Sobol still lives (all the while begging the question: How do you punish a dead man?).  He makes phone calls.  He sends videos.  And he punishes anyone who gets in the way of his destructive plans.  He also rewards those who help him, because even the most powerful computers in the world need occasional human henchmen.<br /><br />The way Sobol recruits from among society's disgruntled and disenfranchised reminded me so much of Randall Flagg in Stephen King's The Stand that I'm inclined to believe it's Suarez's homage to the man.  I found it a little hard to believe how many people were willing to sell their soul to the daemon, but what do I know.  Interestingly, none of the heroes in this novel is all good, and none of the villains is all bad.  It certainly made for more interesting reading.  Sometimes I couldn't even figure out who the good guys were.<br /><br />Crichton has long been criticized for writing underdeveloped characters.  Suarez, quite frankly, isn't even trying to develop many of the characters, sometimes populating entire chapters with characters notated only by the agencies they represent:  CIA, FBI, NSA, DARPA, and so on.  The stakes in this novel certainly do expand beyond the Thousand Oaks Police Department.  The daemon is an enormous, world-wide danger.<br /><br />The pace of this novel is relentless, and more than a few plot twists took me completely by surprise, including an enormous shocker in the final pages.  The novel comes to a satisfying enough conclusion, but quite a few threads are left unresolved.  I was sort of okay with the things left up in the air--food for thought, you know--but Publisher's Weekly promises a sequel.  I am so there!okay with the things left up in the air--food for thought, you know--but Publisher's Weekly promises a sequel.  I am so there!

B001KL3GY0|4.0|The spark to a revolutionary slew in British and American guitar-based rockers and the blueprint to that retro sound that tore up charts in 2004, Scottish foursome Franz Ferdinand always towered above many of their peers with their concise blasts of tuneful guitar hooks, dance rhythms, and singer Alex Kapranos' wry, irrepressibly clever lyrics. Franz Ferdinand's third album, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, has been three years in the making, and longtime fans expecting a return to the angular post-punk guitar ricochets of You Could Have It So Much Better and their self-titled debut will be more than a little disappointed with this latest outing. Kapranos himself has stated that Tonight was to be \\"quite new . . . quite different sounding from everything we've ever done before.\\" This is undoubtedly true, but for all the benefits of evolving, not everything on Tonight is up to the standard of the band's seminal earlier work.<br /><br />Still there but far less important in the mix is Nick McCarthy's guitar, replaced by bombastic `80s keyboards and slinky bass lines. First single \\"Ulysses\\" is the perfect example of Franz's new direction, a love-it-or-hate-it opener that starts off with a simple beat and Kapranos' whisper of a voice before expanding with a twirling synth and distorted guitar as he belts out \\"I've found a new way.\\" Indeed, this is a new Franz, but the song's lackluster bridge and fairly standard chorus cause \\"Ulysses\\" to pale in comparison with previous Franz singles.<br /><br />Everything is forgiven, however, with the excellent one-two punch of the following \\"Turn It On\\" and \\"No You Girls,\\" songs that recall the dance-punk of their debut but with a noticeably funkier sound. \\"No You Girls,\\" in particular, jives along a twisted guitar riff and Kapranos' deliciously naughty lyrics (\\"kiss me where your eye won't meet me\\" goes an early verse) before exploding into one of the best choruses on the record.<br /><br />Throughout, Franz do a fair job of switching between the familiar guitar-based rock of their earlier work, such as the thumping, unrelenting rhythm of \\"Bite Hard,\\" and their newfound fascination with synthtastic, Hot Fuss-era Killers new-wave punk, like the keyboard-heavy \\"Live Alone.\\" On some songs it sounds forced and over the top, as on the aforementioned \\"Live Alone,\\" but tunes like the dub-influenced \\"Send Him Away\\" and the buzzing techno and impressive bass playing on \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\" show some serious promise for Franz's future if they continue in this direction.<br /><br />There's one thing, however, that will definitely need some work on future records: Kapranos' often-unforgivable lyrics. The album follows a loose theme of a night out on the town, so maybe lines like \\"I typed your number into my calculator / where it spelled a dirty word when I turned it upside down\\" can be attributed to one too many pints at the bar. Too many times, however, does Kapranos resort to bad puns or nonsensical rhymes to get through a song. Luckily, his distinctive pipes are so pleasant to listen to it's easy to overlook many of his verbal gaffes.<br /><br />Tonight: Franz Ferdinand is easily a step down from their debut and the oft-underrated You Could Have It So Much Better, but, at its best, the band's merging of electronica and `80s synth rock with their own inimitable post-punk guitar tricks show that Franz are not content to re-make their debut over and over again. Sure, I never thought I'd hear Kapranos and co. bloat a song like the otherwise enjoyable \\"Lucid Dreams\\" out to nearly eight minutes with pointless electronica wankery, but, hey, musicians sometimes have weird desires. Tonight is a grower, and for a band branching out of their comfort zone, it's an uneven, entertaining experiment.ased rock of their earlier work, such as the thumping, unrelenting rhythm of \\"Bite Hard,\\" and their newfound fascination with synthtastic, Hot Fuss-era Killers new-wave punk, like the keyboard-heavy \\"Live Alone.\\" On some songs it sounds forced and over the top, as on the aforementioned \\"Live Alone,\\" but tunes like the dub-influenced \\"Send Him Away\\" and the buzzing techno and impressive bass playing on \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\" show some serious promise for Franz's future if they continue in this direction.

0099443244|5.0|After having read \\"Did you spot the Gorilla\\" which was also written by Wisemen I was expecting an easy read that was still well researched and insightful.  This book definately filled that criteria.    I have always felt that I've been lucky in life but never really known why.  Following a ten year study of many volunteers, wisemen has somewhat solved this mystery for me by scientifically braking down luck into four quantifiable \\"luck factors\\".  Not only has he done this in a way you can easily understand, but there are also exercises throughout the book that help you determine your own luck factor score.  Once you have read through the chapters on each factor, he then proceeds to give you 'real life' ways that you can work and develop these factors to turn you into one of the lucky ones.    The language in this book is very easy to read, so if you're a strong reader you'll easily fly through this book.  There are numerous anecdotes from some of the volunteers in his studies that added extra entertainment for me.    I will have to admit that after reading about the factors and the self-improvement section (which were both great), the conclusion seemed to be long-winded, a little repetitive and maybe a bit uneccesary.  He seems to really want to nail into you just how super important these factors should be to you and how much you really should try to improve yourself but after a couple of pages of this I found myself slightly skimming the pages just to try and get to the end of it.    Overall a very interesting read and definately worth reading to improve your luck or just for entertainment.

B0019T9FL6|4.0|I had waited so long to listen to her above ordinary voice. When I finally got it, I was a bit disappointed about the content of the CD. I thought it would blow my mind. It did not. Of course, it is not Jennifer's fault, but producers' not a happy choice of songs. I was also convinced it would grow on me, but for the time being I found some of the songs absolutely fabulous (Giving myself, Invisible, If this isn't love, I'm his only woman, Spotlight, You pulled me through, My heart) but the rest just not so much exceptional (the worst Pocketbook). I do not also understand why the producers have included \\"And I'm not telling you ...\\" which does not suit well here. If they really wanted to show her artistic potential, which Jennifer undoubtedly has, they should have chosen either \\"I am changing\\" or \\"One night only\\" where she is both expressive and powerful. To sum up, she is a great artist and I hope next time songs will be better selected.

031606792X|4.0|**No Spoilers Here--but recommend reading spoilers so that you can enjoy the 4th book**    I was apprehensive about reading the Twilight series, everyone seemed so passionate about it that I didn't know if I wanted to get sucked into it.  I finally succumbed out of boredom and the need for a new book to read.  The first book does pull you into the story within the first 2 pages, and you get sucked into a love story like no other. I read the 1st book in a day. (My poor kids had to fend for themselves.)  I wanted to continue, but nervous because I had heard different views on how the series ended.      Normally, I avoid all spoilers wanting to enjoy the story and twists for myself. But I was desperate to find out how the story ended--to know if I wanted to continue with the series or just pretend that \\"Twilight\\" was all there was.  I read all the spoilers in the reviews posted here, and I'm SO glad that I did. It prepared me for where the story went. I think if I hadn't read the spoilers, I would have hated \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and it would have spoiled everything for me. But because I knew the direction, I could see all the \\"markers\\" and \\"foreshadowing\\" that Meyer wrote into the series.      That all said, I did enjoy the continuation of the relationship between Bella and Edward. I wouldn't have chosen the route that Meyer took, but I could understand why and I was prepared for it.  I didn't like that she chose the write the middle part of the book from Jacob's perspective.  I think I would have LOVED the book if she chose to do it from Edward's perspective.  After all, it's the love between Edward and Bella that holds our attention. I didn't like how Bella's relationship with her dad is resolved once she becomes a vampire.  I do love all the details of Bella's transformation, her first reaction when she opens her eyes to her new life, her first glimpse of Edward, her first hunt, her discovery of her developed talent that Aro was so interested it, her passion for Edward,her new maturity that makes her so less whiny.  I could go on,but I won't. You'll just get bored by me.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I cannot say enough to recommend this video. Really. It is the most effective, most challenging, and yet completely motivating workout I have ever done. (And I've done a few.) It is completely brilliant- a 20 minutes workout that actually kicks your butt; the length of the workout really makes you feel like you have got to push yourself and get through it, because you tell yourself, who can't do 20 minutes? Psychologically, it really makes you want to finish, and finish strong.     And it pays dividends. If you're anything like me, I couldn't even do the video for 2 days after the first time I did it because I was just too sore. But in the best way, that I-really-got-a-serious-workout kind of way. Very satisfying. In under 30 minutes!    I love Jillian on The Biggest Loser, and she has the very same no-nonsense approach on the video that she uses on the ranch, and I think it really does push you. She tells it like it is- \\"If you are looking for a modification on jumping jacks... look elsewhere. I'm not going to give that to you, I have 400 pound people doing them on the ranch, and I know you can do this,\\" \\"I'm not gonna let you cheat. I know this is hard work. If we are promising you big things, we have to deliver.\\" And she's right. If we're really trying to get a workout in 23 minutes or whatever it is, she's really got to make it hard to get results. But it works, and it's worth it.     I have read several of the other reviews on here, and I would like to respond to some of the negative points that people have brought up:    -The intro to the video cannot be fast forwarded, so you actually have 2 or 3 minutes of Jillian talking at the beginning of the DVD that adds time to your workout without adding any action. OK, it is a bit annoying. But USE THIS TIME WISELY, by running in place or any other light cardio activity to extend the warm-up time. The video only gives a minute or two for your warm up, and trust me, you will need a little more than that to prepare your muscles for what's coming.     -The workout is too challenging/not challenging enough... That's crazy. It is what you make of it. If you think it's too hard, modify - I didn't use weights the first few times I did it, because you don't want to shock your body by doing too much too soon. Give yourself time to get used to the motions and the workout before you add weights if you are a beginner. If you think it's not hard enough or you are not getting enough burn in the strength training segments, you need to add more weight, or, considering this is just a 20 minute workout, alternate days doing this DVD as good cardio and doing a more in-depth 30 minute strength training segment the next day. There is no reason this DVD cannot be a staple in your routine, no matter your fitness level. It is an undeniably effective 20 minute workout. Make it work for you.     -It's too high-impact. OK, there is a lot of jumping. That's because jumping is wildly effective at burning calories. Again, 20 minute workout, it has to be as challenging as possible. You could cheat, and take it a little easier on your knees, but you will be sacrificing intensity. If you KNOW you have bad knees or arthritis and you still want a great workout, buy a mini trampoline for the jumping segments. You won't be able to fully extend your legs to the side in the jumping jack sections, but you will still be able to jump and reduce a lot of the impact. My arthritic mother, who I bought a copy of this DVD for, did that and it worked perfectly for her.     -Not enough warm-up/cool-down. Come on, people. Did you really think that you can get a warm up, decent workout, and cool-down in 20 minutes flat? Let's manage our expectations a little bit. It is 20 minutes. You will need to add a couple of minutes to the warm up, I addressed that earlier, just begin your warm up during the intro part of the DVD that you can't fast-forward through. The cool down/stretching segment is also not long enough to really stretcheverything you just hammered during the video. Turn the DVD off, and do some additional stretches for another 5 or 10 minutes. Even if you add to the warm up and the cool down, you're at about 35 minutes for a great, complete, body-rocking workout. That is not unreasonable, especially considering most people would spend almost that much time in the car driving to and from the gym. (Where you would have to work out much longer than 20 minutes to get the kind of full-body workout that Jillian delivers here.)    The bottom line: It costs less than half of a monthly gym membership at even the most affordable gym, you can completely modify it to work for you, it is 20 minutes long and you do it in the comfort of your own home so you really have no excuses not to get it done, and it delivers like Domino's. You will see and feel a difference faster than you thought possible, and the soreness in your muscles will let you know real quick that you are doing something effective.     Jillian knows what she is doing, and she will get you results. It is well worth the price and it absolutely makes the most out of every single second you spend doing it. What more could you ask for?!
1582701709|4.0|i was surprised at the number of negative reviews of this book. i received it for christmas, and admit that at first glance it felt very cheesy-new-agey. BUT, as it was a gift, i read it, cover to cover. and i think it made a lot of sense, and i think that it should make sense- and no, i don't think a million dollars is going to fall into my lap now - AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THE SECRET IS. the secret is, summed up without embelishment, BE HAPPY NOW. that's it. throughout the entire book, that is the message that is reinforced. be in the now, and be happy about it. and i'm not going to say that that won't make all my dreams come true, cause who knows? everything IS made up of energy, so why can't you use your energy to draw the energy you want? the most important thing i think is, even if it \\"doesn't work\\", if you can stay positive, if you are happy, doing good things for others, loving others, then, well, didn't it work? shouldn't \\"the secret of life\\" be... enjoy your life? and don't most major religion's have some spin on \\"ask and ye shall receive\\"? all you have to \\"lose\\" is the time spent reading it. and in my opinion, you will gain more back.
B001KVZ6BG|1.0|I just read at least half a dozen news articles from India to England, about how much, or little, the child actors in this movie were paid.    My being able to watch and enjoy this movie as an entertainment (they didn't claim this was a documentary) was based on the assumption that this was a fiction. I was going to go watch it again a couple more times and was going to urge all my friends, colleagues, and family to go watch it. But now that I have found out that the movie was never a fiction for these children, I cannot.    Note to Mr. Danny Boyle: You are a pretty good director, but it wasn't merely your talent that made this movie great, and the teenage and adult actors were not that impressive. You would not have gotten this kind of outcome without this particular group of children. I guess that is precisely why you chose them in the first place.    Let's say somebody made a wonderful horror movie where several people meet horrible endings, and it is really a good movie. How many people do you think can sit through the movie, knowing what they are seeing is those unfortunate people dying in reality? I feel kind of the same way about this movie.    The movie is really good, but for it to be entertainment, the people who control the money from this movie should seriously give more consideration to how to better take care of these wonderful children, who were the best part of the movie.    As it is right now, the makers and distributors of this movie are peddling these children's real-life misery for their own fame and fortune, and that is pretty low. I read one of these people saying the children were paid three times what other people in their neighborhood make or something like that, as if that is something to brag about. Folks, three times nothing is still NOTHING!!!    I sure hope the bean counters have a change of heart and fix this situation quickly. Otherwise, I am going to do my best to inform AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE of these children's exploitation bythe makers of this movie.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|My expectations were low for this movie but I really enjoyed it. It was action packed and lots of fun!!!

B0010YPTGU|5.0|Outstanding DVD & CD combo.   I wish I was in Tuscany to see this live.  The DVD/CD was worth the purchase.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|Watched this movie with my grandsons, ages 10, 9, 6, & 5.  After 10 minutes they were bored and left the theater room.  I continued to watch for awhile and concluded this was some group of liberal nuts trying to give us a message about garbage and obesity.  Goes over the heads of children.  Don't waste your time and money
B000001DYA|5.0|When people talk about the evolution of metal sometimes Blue Cheer is left out. Blue Cheer was a big influence on a lot of bands today. Remember it's all about the blues riff and the power chord, the \\"stoner\\" rock of today would not sound the same today without them

B0006IF92U|5.0|Mistaken Identity is a nice change from her first album Innocent Eyes, but is every bit as good. There are great slow songs like \\"Be Strong\\" and \\"Out of The Blue,\\" but the album gets really good with darker, more musically driven songs like \\"Electric Storm\\" and \\"Last Night On Earth.\\" The hidden bonus track \\"Nobody Listened\\" makes the album even better, and is unlike any song she has ever done. Delta can do no wrong, and this is by far her best work!
B001LF4IA6|2.0|Again, the greatest band in the world does not exist. Where is the E Street Band? I will admit, which is a surprise, Bruce sounds better than he has on the last 2 cds. But, the vocals have a volume of 10, while the band is turned down to a volume of 2. If the E Street Band could be heard, this might be a fantasitc cd. I just don't understand having the band covered up in a trash can. C'mon Bruce, you are better than this. I sit and listen and just get mad that what should have been a wonderful cd is not. I think Bruce needs to put out another version of this with the music turned up.
0399134204|5.0|Senior waited too long to get a book, but found it on Amazon and the price was a steal.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|I've bought every Nick Cave album since \\"The Good son\\" I've loved most of them. Warren Ellis is all over this one. This album is all about rock.  I love the mustache too:) I can't help but laugh to see this in so many top 10's for 2008 along side bands like coldplay and other crap. This is the most \\"American\\" album that they have every made. I wonder if that has something to do with it. I hope Nick continues to be as prolific as the last couple years.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|The price was wonderful and the shipping was free even better.  Husband loved it, since he is a Taylor Swift fan.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|I'll just start by saying that I have been a huge Springsteen fan for many years, and I own every album he has put out. After giving WOAD several listens now, I believe that this is his most ENJOYABLE work since \\"Lucky Town\\" (\\"Seeger Sessions\\" notwithstanding). \\"Magic\\" didn't really grab me like most of his stuff, but \\"Dream\\" jumps out at you from the very first listen. It also features some of his best vocal work as well. All in all a very, very solid effort. The only thing missing? Those great organ fills.....
068987474X|5.0|I bought this for someone and they loved it.  It's a lighthearted, knowledgable insight on dating and relationships.  It really makes you think about everything in a new light.  This book got so passed around, and it was a hit with the 18-35 crowd.
B000641Z90|5.0|I was in shock for 3 days after I first saw this DVD. Phil Collins was running all of the stage playing some drums and singing like it was the time of his life. Great songs collection with a few twists on them that make them better. Crowd is great! Paris! Stage was a solid design, lights were good (no Genesis) but it was the show and how he put it together that really makes this one a classic. Not to mention all the Interesting EXTRAS!!!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Controllers are expensive. Amazon has sales every now and then that makes the controllers only cost $40. If you can, hold off for the sale and buy all your controllers then.<br />Once you get them on sale, you will never buy them full price again.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Here's a guy who just keeps getting better and better.  This is apparently Jeff's first post-Epic records release.  There goes, probably, Epic's finest and most respected artist.  It features Vinnie Colaiuta, one of the finest drummers out there, along with two high tech non-household name players on keys and bass, who are in the same league.    Surprisingly there is no info on the dates of recording (sometime in 2007)  and no pictures of the other players, which is about the only fault I can find with this.
B001PJ3S3G|5.0|John Frusciante's web site describes this album as \\"...the ways in which a person strives for what is beyond his reach. In his effort to go higher with every step, he sometimes dives down, only to find that when he reemerges he is always higher than he was before. The musical dynamics work in tandem with these inner rises and falls he experiences. He necessarily remains in a state of confusion and longing but is grateful for that, as without that he would not be becoming anything.\\"    The record's concept of hitting rock bottom before ascending to heavenly heights accurately reflects the tone of the music, which ranges from solemn piano-guided nocturnes to epic rockers which peak with seemingly unending crescendos. In between lies lush electronica, VAST-like soaring choirs, eerie orchestrals, and ambient noise. If there is an album with which to compare this to, it remains unknown here; The Empyrean sounds like every other John Frusciante album in that it doesn't sound like any of the other John Frusciante albums. This is the trademark which makes the man's music so sincerely unique; the pinnacle which every great musician must strive for.    Longtime Frusciante collaborator Josh Klinghoffer returns to this recording on keys and drums, while Flea delivers his own unmistakable style to many of the tracks, the lack of The Mars Volta's Omar Rodriguez-Lopez being the all-star lineup's only letdown. Though the album is still new on the market, it has already sunk in it's bittersweet claws in that there are enough odd intricacies, fine details, and moments of repeated track listenings to guarantee this to be a record which will only sink in deeper with time. Forgive the cliche, but The Empyrean reflects Frusciante's entire musical career up to this point as a fine wine which only improves with age.
B001BKG9RQ|4.0|Any fan of Gilmour or Pink Floyd will like this; it has one of the last performances of the late Richard Wright.  His harmonies and keyboard work were a big part of the overall sound.  Of course, Gilmour's solos do not disappoint.

B001LF4IA6|4.0|I don't know exactly what it is about Bruce Springsteen, but he is adept at gauging where the country is, and exactly what it needs to hear. Be it melancholy reminders of social problems in society, such as Born in the U.S.A. and Nebraska during the optimistic Reagan years, The Ghost of Tom Joad, reminding us of the downtrodden during the relatively peaceful Clinton administration, or The Rising, which rallied Americans together with their president, and Magic which subsequently lashed out at the problems with the 21st Century. Here in the beginning of the Obama administration, though the country is in the worst shape it's seen in several decades, Bruce isn't singing about bitter problems. He's optimistic. Rather than spitting in the face of the man that pushes him down, he's still \\"Working on a Dream\\" in the title track. Granted, not all the album is happy-go-lucky, such as the Western fantasy epic, \\"Outlaw Pete\\" or the touching Danny Federici tribute, \\"The Last Carnival,\\" but even in his melancholy, he is sentimental. It's true that this album isn't his best work, comprised mainly of catchy, optimistic pop tunes ala \\"Girls in their Summer Clothes\\" from Magic. However, he has some true greats, such as \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" \\"What Love Can Do,\\" the Micky Rourke film inspired \\"The Wrestler,\\" \\"Kindom of Days,\\" the title track, and the best song of the album, \\"My Lucky Day.\\" These optimistic tunes are just what America needs now. America has finally moved on from an unpopular administration, and though the nation is in trouble financially, Bruce isn't complaining. He realizes that what America needs is hope (Obama's naive messianic reputation aside) that times will get better, and that the American dream \\"will be mine some day.\\"
B000GCFO0S|4.0|Not really sure WHY someone decided to leave the making-of featurettes off this release.. why leave ANYTHING OFF a BD release? Like there's a danger of running out of room?  Doesn't make sense, unless they're planning an inevitable special edition.  Meh.<br /><br />I'm taking off a star for that.<br /><br />Otherwise, I love this movie, and it shines in BD format.<br /><br />Director Christophe Gans has done an expert job distilling the visual tone of the original game...  and those familiar with the games will recognize all of Akira Yamaoka's evocative music, used here perfectly. The entire production, unlike other videogame to screen versions, was done with the insight and blessings of Konami, and if fans of the games take issue with the details of the story, they hopefully might realize this film is more for those who are new to the series.<br /><br />This is more of a classic ghost story than a horror movie. Or like an especially dark episode of the Twilight Zone.  Silent Hill is a town with a secret so terrible, it literally fell into purgatory.. and it and it's inhabitants are hovering there, waiting...  twisting in their own personal hells.<br /><br />I really don't want to spoil the story, this film I don't think is really ABOUT story.. it's a mood piece about a mother going to the edge of sanity to rescue her daughter. And there is plenty of iconic imagery here to enjoy along the way.. even at it's most graphic, it has a surreal Hieronymus Bosch beauty to it.

Most of the music on this cd is standard enya but white is in the winter night really stands out from the usual holiday fare put out by other artists. the lyrics to white is in the winter night are both charming and memorable. the are easy to memorize because they are filled with so many wonderful images and Ifind myself humming them all the time. So much of Enya's music matches the human heartbeat which is why it is so calming. The instruments that accompany white is in the winter night, violins and cello blend in beautifuuly with enya's crystal clear and enchanting vocals. all in all a realy beautiful CD. ll in
B0000A118M|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already? This guy is a genius and way ahead of his time. People didn't understand him then and most don't get him now. For the few of those who do get John Coltrane, what a sheer joy. The one word I use to describe \\"A Love Supreme\\" is passion. There aren't too many people that have had that much passion for anything. John Coltrane bears his soul to put this work of art together.<br /><br />I read some of the 1-2 star reviews and guys trust me I understand what you are going through. A lot of Coltrane's stuff was difficult for me to listen to when I was starting out. Now my ear is mature enough and what I first considered to be noise is now some of the most beautiful sounds ever created. Be patient.
0743455967|5.0|Mr. King is a master story teller.  This book is about writing, but in my  opinion, it should be required reading in every high school literature class whether the students are interested in pursuing a career in writing or not.  After \\"The Shining,\\" this is my favorite Stephen King.
074322454X|4.0|Long ago I read World War Two history almost exclusively. Recently, I have largely moved to other interests, but I took the time to read \\"Band of Brothers\\" after seeing the superb miniseries and reading Dick Winters' autobiography \\"Beyond Band of Brothers.\\" While I liked the Ambrose book, I found \\"Beyond Band of Brothers\\" by Winters himself far more compelling, interesting, and in several instances, better written.<br /><br />\\"Band of Brothers\\" chronicles E Company, 506 PIR from training in Georgia through the post-war period. The book is quite easy to read, even for those with no military training, and in that regard I think it's an enormous positive that this important story of American heroism under horrifying circumstances has been read by so many people who might not otherwise read military history. Military historians would, no doubt, appreciate a more rigorous (and necessarily longer) treatment of the engagements (which Winters provides in his book), but I still found it a worthwhile book on balance.<br /><br />The book does not take long to read, and the basic themes are easily grasped. I appreciate that Ambrose sought to single out a single Company to reveal longitudinally their progress through the war: too many books focus solely on a single engagement, leaving the reader to figure out how to fit the subject into the bigger picture. I never felt that way here, and it is one of the books best features. The actual prose in the book varies dramatically from sublime to \\"high school essay,\\" with most of the book adequate. There are quite a few punctuation, grammatical, and spelling errors in the book, which I found surprising given the profile of the author. Ambrose also can't seem to figure out where he as the author fits in: sometimes he writes in first person, sometimes in third person, etc. Overall I got the feeling that the book was hastily written and edited, which Mr. Ambrose seems to refute in a concluding editorial passage contrasting this book to his earlier book \\"Pegasus Bridge.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book, especially to those who have seen the miniseries (which I explicitly endorse), although if I could only choose one book on the subject, I would unhesitatingly select \\"Beyond Band of Brothers\\" by Major Dick Winters.\\"Pegasus Bridge.\\"    I recommend this book, especially to those who have seen the miniseries (which I explicitly endorse), although if I could only choose one book on the subject, I would unhesitatingly select \\"Beyond Band of Brothers\\" by Major Dick Winters.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|You look at that DVD cover and you assume you're just gonna get something like all the other teen junk out there with stupid sophmoric humor that is poorly executed and shamelessly tries to get as crude as possible in order to draw attention to itself.<br /><br />Yet, the ROCKER gives me hope that good cinema still exists. It isn't outstanding and it isn't slam bam laugh out loud every two seconds but what the ROCKER does, is something that USED to be done all the time in movies. It has CHARACTER and HEART and PERSONALITY and a MESSAGE to say about living your dreams and not letting anything knock you off course.<br /><br />Most importantly though, the ROCKER locks you into the characters and you care about them, you are involved and invested in their stories. You have a connection with them, and sadly, that is something that most films these days... forget.<br /><br />The ROCKER does ROCK because it had the balls to be REAL, HONEST and FUNNY at the same time, in a hollywood environment that caters to the sophmoric crude and trashy humor that we get most of the time. It banked on the personalities in the script and banked that the audience would relate and they did and will.
0743454537|1.0|I started this book with high hopes. The situation was interesting and posed a fascinating moral dilemma. But the more I read, the more I found myself becoming irritated with the characters and, finally, with the author. At first I thought it was because of the insipid string of reasons the lawyer gave for having an assistance dog, but as I got deeper into the book (and I haven't got to the end yet, which many here have dissed), the more I realized it was the gaping hole in the book which led to my frustration.    Here we have a family of five: mom and dad, brother, sister donor and sister dying of leukemia. We also have a lawyer and an advocate. And, with one glaring exception, we have narratives from all the main characters. We know what Anna is thinking, Brian, Sarah, Jesse, (well, we don't get the dog's point of view (have to read Martha Grimes for that)). BUT WHAT ABOUT KATE? Why is this author witholding the viewpoint of the center of the circle? And why haven't any of the main characters even asked Kate how she feels about this????    This makes no sense unless the author is witholding this until the end when suddenly we will find...what??? That Kate wants to die but is afraid to tell her mother...and Anna knows this and is REALLY acting for Kate and not herself...so she can take the heat for the refusing to donate, when this is what Kate wants??? And we'll find this out in the last chapter when finally, we can know what Kate wants/thinks????If so, then this is pretty dishonest.    If not, then why haven't we heard from Kate? Is she too sick to have thoughts? Does the family not care? Should the reader not care? Does the author beleive her point of view is irrelevant...or is she witholding it from us until some big final event?    I read a lot. I can tolerate a lot from an author in terms of sloppy writing, marginal characters, far fetched events. But I don't like it when the author appears to be fooling with my mind simply for her dramatic effect. Maybe my speculations are totally off the wall but they're the best I can do. Why else does this author exclude one of the most central voices in what could have been a fascinating morality tale>
0385340990|5.0|Such a lovely book.  I hated reaching the end.  The unusual style adopted by the authors worked extremely well for me and I look to future output from these gifted writers.
B001F12J3Y|1.0|I just want to comment on the 3D version of this movie.  The regular version of this movie is outstanding.  However, the 3D version is absolutely visually awful.  It is really poor quality 3D and not worth paying the extra money.  Just purchase the regular DVD if it is cheaper.  Until better 3D technology for in-home viewing comes along, I would not waste the money.
B000GR7N9I|4.0|What's there to say ....... ought to be required reading in every school (if it isn't already).
B001L5SXQG|5.0|When I first heard the 30 second clips from the songs on this cd I was not immediatley hooked.  However, after a few listens today I can tell you that there are some absolutely fantastic songs on this cd.  Kingdom of Days stands out the most and I must have listened to that track 10 times today.  The line about \\"laughing under the covers counting the wrinkles and the grays\\" is perfect.    I was not into \\"This Life\\" at first, but now I can't get enough of it.  I'm not crazy about the title track, and \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" is the oddest thing he has ever done, but \\"The Last Carnival\\" and \\"The Wrestler\\" more than make up for that.  The video of \\"The Last Carnival\\" is amazing and the song is an instant classic.  Danny was the man and he will be missed.  Another amazing cd from Bruce and the band.  \\"Magic\\" had more of a classic E-street sound to it, but this cd really explores some new sounds for them, and in most cases, it words wonderfully.  Can't wait for the tour!!!!
B000071XA7|5.0|Essentially, this CD is a sampling of High-Renaissance music (both instrumental and vocal) during the reign of Charles V (AD 1500-1558), a Hapsburg who ruled the Holy Roman Empire and Spain.  His reiqn was characterized by the dramatic expansion of the Spanish into the New World -- as well as by continuous warring in Europe.      The \\"Mille Regretz\\" title cut is a composition by perhaps the best-known composer of the day, Josquin Deprez:       \\"It is with great regret that I leave you      And lose sight of your loving face;      I suffer such grief and pain      That you will see my days are numbered.\\"    Accordingly, this album offers, overall, a warm--yet almost elegiac--voluptuousness (a couple Renaissance dances, notwithstanding).  Although Amazon provides no sound samples for \\"Mille Regretz,\\" you can catch its flavor by checking out other albums on the Alia Vox label, like \\"Ostinato.\\"  (They're all . . . wonderful!)

B0015OKWL2|2.0|I like interesting cop shows. I-n-t-e-r-e-s-t-i-n-g!  This movie should have been called the DeNiro and Pacino Show.  Couldn't figure out for the life of me why the killings could have been \\"righteous\\", even in serial killer terms.  You were searching for a commradere between the two partners but there was always that \\"guy thing\\" that kept them at odds and made their partnership rather vacant for anything meaningful, especially after all those years.  All the action throughout the film just seemed like a filler only until the end when it finally decided to pick up the pace.  Pacino and his righteous kills didn't sound like a mystery finally unearthed but just a flat \\"well here it is\\".  This movie could have been written better for these fabulous actors.  What a shame.
B000MRAAJW|3.0|Beautiful scenery, beautiful photography, and lots of it. National Geographic type. Very well worth the purchase.    Con: The first four discs were wonderful,except, it would have been much more soothing without preditors killing prey- grade as B+.  The fifth disc is propaganda from enviornmentalists with claims that are unsubstantiated projections of their politics and not worth viewing.

031606792X|3.0|I read this book 2 times and I think this was by far better then the 3rd book, Eclpise.  I know there are some out there who would disagree with me and say that the story line is so out there and ridiculous, it may be but this is fiction.  Yes, Bella can be whiny and she is always THE center of everyone's universe... but at least when she becomes a vampire she has hidden powers and strength that rival's even Edward and some of the Volturi clan, so at least it did not end with someone else having to save poor Bella.... The only part that I did not like at all is Bella being torn between Edward and Jacob... but all that worked itself out in the end.
B001GJ1QQG|5.0|It is a crime that Anastascia is not more popular in the States. Thanks to American radio for that! This album is outstanding! From rhythm and blues, dance, etc.. every song is a gem! This one won't be out of my CD player for some time to come! Get it now!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book's writing style captured me right away; the bizarre connections to the small things in life gave this book a unique life of its own.  The narrator, Death, is for once portrayed not as a dark shadow that steals your life, but as a gentle soul.  He is not cruel, nor sinister.  He simply is.<br />  I could not put this book down.  Sometimes I found myself holding my breath, or crying from the horror of it all.  Sure, we read about the Holocaust in school.  We read text books and listen to lectures.  But it was this book that made me finally understand just how terrible and how real the Holocaust really was.
B000NJXG6S|5.0|Recived item promptly and in great shape will use seller again in future if needeed.
0385504209|5.0|I decided to read this book because of the hype around it. I was pleasantly surprised, the writing style is very good and narrative. I even almost believed some of the theories were true. Don't be fooled, it's fiction. Jesus did not go to France and the holy grail is not what the book describes it to be..<br />Excellent reading though!!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is by far my favorite holiday movie. It is pleasing to children as well as adults.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|I enjoyed this unusual detective story. Most good detective stories have narration, but this wasn't at all like those others. The movie pokes some fun throughout and it doesn't distract from the story so it enhances the experience. Robert Downey Jr. plays a small time thief that lucks into an audition for a detective movie. When he becomes involved with consulting a real gay detective played by Val Kilmer and a high school crush, things get weird but interesting. The mystery will keep you guessing till the end. I recommend it. Good quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Don't listen to the reviews below 5 stars because this album deserves 6 stars. Every song on this album is good because of the Springsteen's lyrics.  The best song is The Wrestler,Outlaw Pete,....all of them... Get this album, you won't regret this!
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I've been waiting for this CD for 2 years now. I actually met Renee at a dance club back in Nov. 2006, and she said the CD would be released in Jan. 07, but that they wanted to get it right before release. Well, she definitely got it right.<br /><br />Her voice sounds more mature now, and as always, so wonderful to listen to. She has a style all her own, and so beautiful. And as a swing dancer, there's plenty to dance to on this CD as well. I've always loved Anita O'Day's \\"Thanks For the Boogie Ride,\\" but Renee does her own take on the classic, and really shines.<br /><br />My only wish is that \\"Through the Fire\\" would have been on the CD. But then it would have probably been delayed even more. If you love Renee, you've gotta have this CD.

0060574216|1.0|Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus  By John Gray, PhD.    Introduction:    Prejudice. One of the greatest gifts that has been discovered because of our wonderful system of democracy is the problem caused by having prejudicial beliefs. Prejudice breeds ignorance and contempt, results in anger, produces an overwhelming urge for power, blinds individuals from seeing the path to happiness, and in reality is the cause for the troubles within our relationships. Unfortunately, this concept has not yet breached the walls of the ivory tower of the psychology industry.    The very theme of the granddaddy of modern relationship books, Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus by John Gray, Ph.D., is the prejudice that men and women are different. In essence, what Dr. Gray is claiming is the key to the successful relationship is that men and women are different, if you want to be happy then you must realize this and simply get over it. Sadly, he couldn't be further from the truth.     Ah yes, say the critics of this prejudicial perspective.  The formative Dr. Gray is merely propagating a perspective that men and women should simply accept these differences, that tolerance will lead to loving and caring for each other through the understanding of these differences.  The only problem with this perspective is that it promotes prejudices between men and women.  Unfortunately Dr. Gray isn't a fan of history, or he would have known this. We have a perfect example that completely debunks his platform, the famous \\"separate but equal\\" decision in 1896 that kept African Americans and White Americans \\"separate but equal\\" until it was overturned in 1954 with the Brown v The Board of Education decision.     The only difference is instead of different drinking fountains and restaurants we have different households, with our current culture of divorce. In fact, this book has probably done more than any other to help propagate our culture of divorce.      Yes the idealism of tolerance and acceptance makes sense intellectually but unfortunately is impossible to implement. Promoting the difference between people only promotes the underlying fear of those differences.    Overview:    Ironically, he begins the book by claiming, \\"I do not directly address the question of why men and women are different,\\" which would add profound insight as to how to overcome those differences. Throughout the book it becomes extremely clear what those differences are. In his world, men only think and women only feel, which may be true of relationships in the nineteenth century but does nothing to help relationships in the twenty-first century.    In fact, to really help troubled relationships requires an understanding of the reverse that men can also feel and that women can also think. He does, though, contradict this logic, as he does with much of his \\"circular\\" logic, by stating that sometimes men do learn to feel \\"in order to become more loving and nurturing,\\" and that women do learn to think, \\"in order to earn a living in a work force.\\" His logic goes something like this; \\"Men mistakenly expect women to think...women mistakenly expect men to feel.\\" But can't men feel and women think?    In fact, if this book is read with a critical eye the reader would actually feel incredulous over his logic. For women his comment that \\"Their egos are dependent not on looking `competent,'\\" says it all. He is asking women not to think as part of the relationship. So his advice for women is to forget their ability to think. After all, that is man's work.    And he does the same for men with feelings. \\"When having a conversation with him at home, it seems as if only 5 percent of his mind is available for the relationship while the other 95 percent is still at work,\\" the place where men are supposed to think. In other words, Dr. Gray is trying to convince the reader men have only 5 percent of their brains available for feelings. He goes even further by stating, in essence, if men are not thinking then \\"he is drawn to solving little problems, like reading the news, watching T.V., driving his car, doing physical exercise, watching a football game, playing basketball, and so forth,\\" all behaviors that replace his feelings within the relationship. He even goes so far as to say that when a woman wants to engage in a discussion of feelings with a man, asking him \\"What's the matter, honey?...he may feel insulted or repulsed.\\"    His advice for the reader then follows the logic that \\"Men need to remember that when women seem upset and talk about problems is not the time to offer solutions,\\" while \\"women need to remember that unsolicited advice or criticism...make him feel unloved and controlled.\\" In other words, the key to the happy relationship is for men to do their thinking but not associate with the women's feelings and women can feel but helping a man think makes him somehow weak.    He uses this same logic when he explains that a man needs to periodically sink into his cave when he is upset while a woman retreats to her corner. What is true about his logic is when a couple argues a man does revert into the mode of thinking while a woman reverts back into the mode of feeling. Explaining this does not help couples overcome arguing. And again, he defends this point when he claims women want respect, respect for their feelings, while men want trust, trust that they can think. But don't men want respect, and women want trust as well. Not according to Dr. Gray. This circular logic is repeated throughout the entire book.    The rest of the book is spent giving behavior advice, just like all of the others. Dr. Gray even goes as far as explaining a point system, both positive and negative, that men and women should use to keep score of their different behaviors. Does he explain the causes of behavior? No, like he states initially he doesn't even discuss the \\"why\\". He doesn't even attempt to! So without the why, how can he provide an inkling of a solution? Again,he doesn't.    Well, he did sell over 20 million copies. Why did his book sell so well? People in troubled relationships identify with his description of the problem. How many copies do you think he would have sold if he wrote a book entitled, Men Are From Earth Women Are From Earth?    by Tim Kellis

074322454X|5.0|`Band of Brothers' is basically a series of first-hand accounts of WWII battles from D-day to VE-day, and the mop-up thereafter, through the eyes of some very young, genuine, citizen-soldier heroes.     It is a good book for WWII buffs (some of us) and for those who like to study human nature (all of us).  It is an actual, unromanticized account of one of the WWII paratrooper units that often reminded me of the mesmerizing first 20 minutes of the `Saving Private Ryan' D-Day movie; it made you feel that you would want to be somewhere else - ANYwhere else. And I'm sure the paratroopers felt the same way, but they did their duty anyway. It's hard to imagine citizen soldiers going from training in the States and Britain to being dropped off and shot at. On the flip side, it's hard to imagine some of the seemingly unnecessary killing and looting that some of them did as the WWII end-game played out. You wished at some points that they could have been a little nobler; but I can't judge for certain how I would have reacted under the same circumstances. (Hopefully, I would have done half as well as they did.) One thing is for sure: these guys were definitely heroes.     How did they do it? Was it because of patriotism? No, surprisingly, to me at least, it was because of the bond they had with each other; and this is what the book is about. They would gladly sacrifice their own lives for their brothers-in-combat.  That closeness remained for the rest of their lives, and still continues for the living.    I appreciate the work Steven Ambrose did to get first-hand accounts by actually interviewing many of them face-to-face. They obviously appreciated his work as they made him an honorary member of the 506th. His enthusiasm for the subject was infectious. I think he gave them their due!

C'mon Bruce, time to move to Sarasota and take up shuffleboard.  And as usual, O'Brien's production is crap....still infatuated with vocals in a coffee can sound.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|A hilarious or even crazy movie I must say. A lot of good laughs. Well expected! What fascinates me most is the superb performance, in particular of Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. If you had doubt on their acting before, your suspicion would be removed after the viewing. On the other hand, the opening five minutes is unique. I had been \\"cheated\\". The \\"explosion\\" scenes were big, which showed Bill Stiller had been serious in producing this comedy. In short, a good rental after dinner to reward yourself for a day of heavy work. Recommended!

0440236738|5.0|Think artichoke, a tightly closed artichoke. That is page one of \\"Gone for Good.\\" Read on. Will Klein is the voice of the story, one that begins chronologically with the murder of his first love during college. The alleged murderer is his adored, older brother. Eleven years later his second love is also murdered.<br /><br />Twists and turns. The artichoke is opening. Will works for Covenant House, a place that is a safe haven for runaways, teen addicts, young prostitutes, street kids. His live-in love volunteers there before she is found tortured and murdered. But why? What was she involved in?<br /><br />Bad people populate this novel--all from Will's old neighborhood and friends of his brother. Each life is a leaf in the plot's unfolding, finally to reveal the heart and, in this artichoke, all its nasty, twisty secrets. However, all is not as it seems. But like an artichoke heart, the center, the final revelations are the prize. Even as a shrewd reader of thrillers, I could not anticipate at any time where Coben was taking his readers. He is a master writer of psychological suspense.<br /><br />After I finished the book, I thought about a quote I read the other day: \\"Give me a person's reading list and I will tell you his character.\\" Although my list is eclectic, I wonder about the value of books such as \\"Gone for Good.\\" Was it worth the several hours I spent? It is definitely great escapist fare--a mental movie is playing while I'm reading.<br /><br />But did I learn anything? Is there redeeming value? Perhaps the pleas for compassion for the lost and difficult-to-love children of this world, especially runaways are worth the hours. Will asks at one point how anyone could walk by a person asking for a hand-out and not by moved by compassion. These passages are deftly written and definitely reveal another artichoke leaf. If we are what we read, does Coben create seeds of ideas that perhaps will grow into something bigger? Will we have compassion?<br /><br />Another seed is the consideration of those who torture and kill. Why do they do it? Is it the early home life? Or no reason at all? Does a killer have compassion? Coben skilfully works these provocative thoughts into his plot to give the reader a little frisson about real people like them. Wife beaters. Child abusers. Bullies. Animal torturers. And their victims. And their victims.ho torture and kill. Why do they do it? Is it the early home life? Or no reason at all? Does a killer have compassion? Coben skilfully works these provocative thoughts into his plot to give the reader a little frisson about real people like them. Wife beaters. Child abusers. Bullies. Animal torturers.

4893580914|5.0|This book is great for learning to read and write Kanji.  I tried Kanji flash cards, but I prefer this book for learning Kanji.  The flash cards are better for review.  This book includes common Kanji that I recognize living in Japan and are immediately useful.  It also does a great job showing how to write the characters.  Each chapter contains a manageable number of Kanji to learn so that studying from this book doesn't become too overwhelming.  In addition to learning Kanji, you'll also pick up new vocabulary words without much extra effort.  If you're studying Japanese, this book is definitely worthwhile.

0061139378|3.0|Young Coraline isn't all that happy with her life. Her parents work too much and, as young children are wont to be, she's bored. But when she discovers her alternate life behind a hidden door, she begins to think that her real life isn't so bad. Evil lurks behind every corner as Coraline tries desperately to regain her \\"old\\" life.<br /><br />Advertised for ages eight and up, Coraline is, for all intents and purposes, a horror book for kids. Scary, but without the gore.<br /><br />And although I haven't interviewed any eight year olds on the matter, I suspect Gaiman largely succeeds in scaring the pee out of them. The alternate world Coraline stumbles into strangely mirrors her own, containing another set of parents who, despite their outward declarations of love and devotion, don't seem quite right. (Black buttons instead of eyes are a pretty big clue here.)<br /><br />The alternate world Gaiman creates is quite well thought-out. And while the themes of the novella may not be original, the conveyance of it certainly is.<br /><br />As rich as the plot is, however, there is something lacking in Coraline. We know she is a kind girl and even quite a smart girl. But that's about all we ever get to know. Ultimately, she's rather one-dimensional in a cardboard cutout sort of way. Perhaps this was by design, but I missed getting to know Coraline.<br /><br />Hmmmmm. Here's the brutal truth: the thrill just wasn't happening for me. By no means is this an awful book. It won a Hugo Award, a Nebula Award, and the Bram Stroker Award.<br /><br />I read it. I didn't hate it.  But neither am I running out and buying copies for every kid I know.  Maybe I missed something. It's been known to happen.<br /><br />I do, however, have high hopes for the forthcoming film version.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This is a pretty good fantasy. However, the animatronic lead character was not very lifelike and far from convincing. Nice bit of propaganda, not much else.

0061537934|5.0|This is one of the first times I can remember writing a book review within minutes of finishing the book.  I feel the need to do this because I fear if I wait until tomorrow, I won't be able to express to you just how wonderful this book truly is.  With tears streaming down my face, I'm urging you to read it.....something I've never done before.<br /><br />You don't have to be a dog lover.....you don't have to be a race car lover.  All you have to be is a reader looking for something worthwhile to read;  something you'll never forget;  something you will be missing out on if you don't take the opportunity to do something for yourself and begin a journey with a dog and a man.....a journey you won't soon forget.  One warning though....do not read the end right before you're ready to go to sleep because sleep will not come.  You will be too full of your thoughts and your feelings and a sadness overshadowed by happiness.<br /><br />As soon as I finished the book, I instant messaged a reading friend of mine to encourage her to read the book right away.

B001LF4IA6|3.0|Bruce Springsteen & The E. Street Band-Working On A Dream ***<br /><br />Working On A Dream, Bruce Springsteen's third album with the E. Street Band since 2000 is one of those albums that is both fantastic in places and horribly disappointing in others. Though after hearing the title track on the radio some weeks back I told myself not to expect much from this release as it sounded as if Roy Orbison had inhabited the soul of Springsteen which on paper is great but not when witnessed in real time.<br /><br />As witnessed on 2007 fantastic album Magic Springsteen was starting to trade some of his Bob Dylan/Van Morrison/Woody Guthrie rip off mysticism for melody, something he use to dominate with but had long since lost with the Born In The U.S.A. album of the mid 1980's. Where this is good it causes that many issues elsewhere. The title track for example is brilliant songwriting but as previously stated sounds as if Orbison was in the studio vocalizing, this is very annoying when realized. This seems to be the case through out the album where the lyrics are among Springsteen's best in years and where the E. Street Band is playing something fierce but Bruce presents a down right boring portrayal of the song.<br /><br />But where the album is horrible it is that much better on tracks like the eight minute epic 'Outlaw Pete' full of crescendo after amazing crescendo, string arrangements for days, and some of the funnest lyrics good 'ol Bruce has written in years. Things keep rolling with 'My Lucky Day,' possibly the albums highlight. The title track which is loved but revered in the same listen. 'Queen Of The Supermarket' which recalls and would have been welcome on any of his early 1970's work. It's the soft love story of a small town boy in love with the checkout girl at the local Piggly Wiggly. The last great song that is officially apart of the album is 'The Last Carnival' a tear jerking eulogy for the late Dan Federici who past last year. In the final lines of the song Springsteen gets chocked up and can hardly finish the take. It is a good thing they kept this take because that is either the most honest thing Springsteen has ever recorded or more of a case as to why he is increasing become more transparent.<br /><br />'The Wrestler' is tagged as a bonus track. It takes it's name from the movie of the same title which Springsteen lent it to this year staring Mickey Rourke. Why it wasn't included on the album over some of the other tracks like 'Kingdom Of Days' is beyond me. The track is honestly the greatest thing Springsteen has ever recorded.<br /><br />The rest of the album isn't bad in retrospect but rather forgettable. This suffers much like his album The River did where nothing was actually bad but most of it failed to stand out or contain anything memorable. Over all very worth while for what is good as it is some of his best material in years though don't expect anything breathtaking from the album as a whole.ocked up and can hardly finish the take.

It's a multi-layered, Spector-esque \\"Wall of Sound\\" that runs the gamut from dark and stark (\\"Kingdom of Days\\") to the things-aren't-quite-what-they-seem (\\"Queen of the Supermarket,\\" make sure you listen carefully) to the rave up (\\"Good Eye,\\" but again, that good eye is to the dark). I am reminded of \\"Livin' in the Future,\\" from \\"Magic,\\" which many felt to be a \\"Glory Days\\" style party song. Maybe so, but only if you ignored the lyric, about fascism and denial. Don't pay any attention to those who write this album off as Bruce's \\"pop\\" album. Simply because the Boss embraces the 60's era layered production that would make Brian Wilson proud does not mean this is \\"Surfin' USA.\\" It is most simply a rich tapestry in which all instruments - including the voice of the protagonist - weave to form something far greater than their parts. Spectacular...
B001LRJH0U|3.0|What a shame the story line couldn't have been better for a cast of such talented actors.  The entire movie felt like a struggle.  It jumps around a  bit too.  At one point Ed and Viggo get shot.  What were their injuries, will they live?  Not exactly sure, but the next seen they are sitting having dinner.  Ol' Ed got a broken knee from a gunfight...hmmm.  Viggo, uh...I guess had a bullet proof vest on.  Rene's character was boring and unfitting for her level of acting.  This felt like a play, instead of a movie.    Definitely not worth buying.
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|I was not made aware that I was purchasing the director's version of the movie which is very different from the movie I saw years ago.  I was not very happy!
B001FB55YE|4.0|There is so much going on in Guy Ritchie's RocknRolla that it isn't hard to lose track of who's stealing from who or who got doublecrossed and why, but that doesn't stop it from being the most fun, wild, and thoroughly entertaining film from Guy Ritchie since Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels. As the film unfolds, we learn of a real-estate scam headed by London underworld boss Lenny (Tom Wilkinson) and Russian magnate Uri (Karel Roden), but soon enough much more comes into play when Uri's prized painting is stolen. Entering the scene are a group of low-rent hoods (Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy), a shady accountant (Thandie Newton), a rockstar presumed dead (Toby Kebbell) and his managers (Jeremy Piven and Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges), and Lenny's trusted right hand man (Mark Strong); all of whom have something to gain and/or lose as Ritchie manages to pack enough quips and comedic action moments into the 114 minute running as he possibly can. Saying more about the film's convoluted storyline would ruin most of the fun of RocknRolla, of which you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The performances are great all around, with a special mention for Butler, Elba, and Hardy; who are all great together, but sadly don't get as much screen time as one would like. Despite that though, RocknRolla is a blast, and re-affirms that Guy Ritchie has definitely not lost his touch. Now let's just hope that this isn't the last we've seen of the Wild Bunch.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|Hmm, I was surprised to hear everyone say that this was a super-original piece of cinematic originality that had never been done before. Although this film is really quite good, if you popped Three Amigos into Apocalypse Now, this is what you would get, Amigolypse Now if you like.     Its all rather over the top and fun, Tom Cruise is ok, Downy is ok, although I felt the joke wore a little thin after a while. The people who would probably enjoy this the most are probably actors, it would be great to actually have the insight into if actors really as big a bunch of self-absorbed butt wads as the film portrays, ok, we know they are but the film sometimes plays a little like an in-joke. You know, Like \\"Pret-a-Porter\\" but actually funny. Ish.     As parody movies go, this is one of the better recent ones, it's not as good as the classics like Airplane or Top Secret (Val Kilmer doing humour!!!???), and I didn't like this as much as Zoolander which I rate as one of the funniest films of recent times, I never fail to kill myself laughing at Project Catwalk on the TV where one of the judges not only acts like \\"Mugatu\\" but looks like him as well! Anyway, back to Tropic Thunder. It's a good movie to rent on a sat night but I wouldn't buy it, I cant imagine watching it multiple times like I would Zoolander for example. But, it's OK!     Oh, and Galaxy Quest, that is the same plot as well. So that's at least 2 films that have enjoyed the same premise.

B00003CXDV|5.0|Some actors think they are acting in a scenario where they fight some baddies but actually its real! Robert Downey Junior pretends he is a black character and Martin Shortt is a former childstar with a famed \\"quick draw.\\" Ok, well, its Tropic Thunder and 3 Amigos which features the same plot, but this spoof out does them both. The humour is dry and the character observation spot on. I wonder if Bill Shatner has seen it and if he recognised himself in it. Rickman is wonderful as cynical \\"Dr Lazarus\\". The whole film is a little lads' fantasy and one that I'm sure appeals to us chaps in our adult world, who wouldn't want to be suddenly in command of a real star ship tasked with saving the Galaxy?    What I particularly like is the reluctance of most of the actors to be associated with their work. I remember attending a conference and hosting Blackadder star Tony Robinson some years ago. The PR people had one word of instruction, we were under no circumstances to refer to him as \\"Balders\\" or \\"Baldrick\\" as he is particularly un-humorous when it comes to being associated with one of the best comic creations of recent times. Well, what else are you going to say to him?  Its true, je doesn't like being called Balders! He should have got a job on a checkout if that is his attitude! Humph.      This is one of those brilliantly watchable films you can safely add to your dvd collection as it can be watched many times and still be funny. Would highly recommend a double bill of Galaxy Quest and \\"Mystery Men\\" for an enjoyable \\"beers in/wife out\\" evening of entertainment.

006135323X|5.0|Don Ariely is a guy who had a lot of time to think.<br /><br />Severly burned in an accident, Ariely spent months pondering the various oddities of human economic behavior.<br /><br />And thankfully his pondering has left us with a very thought provoking book which shows that rather being \\"reasonable\\" market participants humans are for the most part \\"emotional\\" market participants.<br /><br />They'll spend time debating between a several cent difference on products then fritter thousands of times more than that difference on frivolous purchases.  They'll follow supposed leaders when a little bit of independent intiative could've put them much further ahead.<br /><br />And they'll readily impute their irrationality to others.<br /><br />In general this is one of a spate of recent highly readable neuroeconomics books which seriously discusses the emotional side of human economic behavior.  For those who have their interest picqued by this book I would suggest also the most recent economics book by Michael Shermer as well as Sway...both of which I've reviewed and also found to be excellent books.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is one of the best vampire shows I have seen up to date and as a series it is cool. I look forward to seeing it every Sunday night and sometimes in the middle of the wk. I really looking forward to seeing the second season. I am so hooked on it that I have convince some friends to have a look at it and they even think it is a wonderful, action, funny and unusual show. I will definitely own a copy when it comes available. Thank you
0061139378|4.0|\\"Coraline\\" is the most satisfying horror novel for kids since Roald Dahl's \\"The Witches.\\"  It has great elements of terror and a strong heroine who uses her wits to get out of a bad situation.  And it's quite a situation.  In a variation of \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" Coraline finds herself in an alternate world that albeit somewhat benign and slightly creepy at first, becomes far more menacing the longer Coraline stays.    What I liked about this book is that - and this is owing to Gaiman - it's not sugarcoated.   Coraline is in real danger at times and the situations grow more and more macabre.  It heightens the suspense of the tale when you don't know what's going to happen.  There are a few scenes that could even keep a person up at night; I won't say what but you may want to make sure your windows are closed tight before you go to bed.      I wish there had been just a slight bit more explanation as to Coraline's adventures, but that could be due to too many years of reading comics and demanding origin stories.  But otherwise, this is a nice, dark tale that's completely entertaining no matter what age you are.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|With the release of Springsteen's new album Working on a Dream, Springsteen shifts gears towards more pop-rock. Much of this album sounds like the song, \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes.\\" I don't feel as much of the rock part of magic on this album, although songs like \\"My Lucky Day,\\" \\"Working on a Dream\\" and \\"Life Itself\\" do stick out almost instantly. This album has me baffled because at first I was not very impressed, I was expecting a more rock album much in the vein of Magic, but as I listen deeper and explore that wall of sound that Springsteen produces, I think the album clicked for me. This isn't worse or better than Magic. Its an extension of it, that plays off it, and the sound change works perfectly. Listen to them back to back.    This album starts off strong with an 8 minute long song, about a rough ridin' cowboy of the, \\"Appalachian Trail.\\" The song is a decent opening to the album, but doesn't really place the mood of the album. You then get a dosage of strait rock, with \\"My Lucky Day.\\" The drums power through the wall of sound, and it is by far one of the best songs to use the whole E. Street Band. \\"Working on a Dream\\" is a perfect pop song. Followed next by \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" and another winner, although even I questioned it at the beginning, the use of the studio and sounds make this blend together great. We then get a song that sounds like it comes from The River, \\"What Love Can Do\\" and then a definite Magic song, \\"This Life.\\" At this point Bruce has an almost flawless album going. \\"Good Eye\\" just doesn't do it for me, but the next three songs are amazing and include my favorite song from the album, \\"Life Itself.\\" \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" just doesn't do anything for me, and is lyrically very bland. The last two \\"The Last Carnival\\" and \\"The Wrestler\\" are both somber ballads that end the album in a quiet way. Saddened by the loss of a group member (Danny Federici), and the sadness of a once great, now torn and worn Wrestler are the subjects of these songs. The whole theme of the album seems to be Time, Love, and Hope for the future.    Buy this album, you won't be disappointed with it at all. It has an epic flow that allows it to just somehow click after a few times through, and if you have the Deluxe Edition you get a great 35 minute video, that shows you the evolution of some songs. From acoustic creation, to whats on the album. I'm loving it, and it will be playing in my car for the next week, if not months, and will hold a spot well with all my other Springsteen albums.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|i gave it 4stars because the case is made from cardboard paper.  the movie was fine. movie teaches us we need to take better care of the earth.
B000MV90IU|2.0|The movie, of course, is still the same great Steve McQueen car chase movie I remember, which is why I gave it 2 stars.  As a movie, it is worth more, but as a BluRay product, I wouldn't even give it that.      Often, the \\"great\\" movies of my youth turn out to be \\"I really thot this was GOOD??!!?\\", like \\"The Omega Man\\", for instance.    I purchase BluRay for myself if it is 1) a spectacular movie (scenics like \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Hidalgo\\"), 2) actions like \\"Fifth Element\\" or the \\"Mummy\\" series, 3) to replace a DVD which plays in Letterbox on my BluRay player (like \\"Enemy of the State\\"  -- and I'm still waiting for \\"Armageddon\\" on BluRay), or 4) if the price is under $15 for a movie I care about.    \\"Good story\\" movies like \\"There's Something about Mary\\", \\"Executive Decision\\" or \\"A Few Good Men\\" still tell their story on DVD just fine.  If I have them on DVD, I won't replace them, but if I don't have them and they show up for under $15 on BluRay, I'll buy them.    \\"Bullit\\" fell in to the \\"Letterbox on BluRay player\\" and \\"Under $15\\" categories, but I might as well have kept the Letterbox version.  The sound was 2.0, and it didn't appear to me that the picture was any better than an up-converted DVD.      Certainly, having it in full widescreen instead of Letterbox is an improvement, but not worth the price when I already had it on DVD.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I recently purchased the Blu-Ray version of Band of Brothers [[ASIN:B00129H7VS Band of Brothers [Blu-ray]]]and it was terrific. Watched all episodes over a 4 day period and was impressed by the clarity and sound. If you have a Blu Ray machine this is a great movie to have. Not one to watched over and over, but one to be enjoyed from time to time. History is always great entertainment.
B001LF4IA6|3.0|Like Magic, Working On A Dream is a good collection of songs, some stronger than others, but great to hear Springsteen's creative juices are still flowing. Also like Magic, it's too bad the recording is so compressed that it hurts to listen to it. Strangled cymbals, organ that sound like it's being played through a toilet paper roll, background singers that are singing... something- can't make out a melody...<br /><br />Unlike Magic, I am hoping a 5.1 surround mix is released so I can actually hear and distinguish the drums, organ, guitar, strings, bass, instead of hearing \\"drumsorganguitarstringsbass\\".
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Maybe the best release from them yet. If you like Kings of Leon, you will love this album. Partially because it was recorded by kings of leon. Also because it is AWESOME. If you like the Black Keys. You will probably like this cd as well.<br />Have a great life and BUY THIS CD. K BYE
B0011NVC98|1.0|Not only is it a horrible adaptation of what is a wonderful poem, but it is ugly too. The characters look like they should be in a video game. If I could give this no stars. I would.
0312360266|1.0|For an exceptionally open-minded parent with an MA in English & fondness for vampire lore, this book was a bitter disappointment.  I pre-read it in hopes of passing it along to my pre-teen who's busily devouring the Twilight series.  No deal!  I don't know what turned me off the most: the wretched grammar & usage (what self-respecting editor would let incorrect use of \\"effect\\" for \\"affect\\" slip by more than once???), thin & meaningless plot, gratuitous use of harsh language or sexually explicit content that contributes absolutely NOTHING to the storyline.  What I do know is that anyone--teen, adult or otherwise--who bothers to read this material will sorely regret it.  Even if you're not squeamish about the cursing & sex at every turn, you won't find much redeeming value in this work.
B000NA28I4|2.0|Okay, I pretty much will go along with most movies for one reason or another, whether it be effects, plot line, or great casting. The true jewels of movie making are those that contain all the above.     The only reason I even own this movie is because I like the effects. It at least has a discernable plot line even though it's inaccurate in comparison to the book. Much of the acting was poor (especially Galbatorix. Yikes!) and the scenery was not what one would expect from a Middle Earth film. LOTR puts it to shame.     This film was clearly low budget, though not as bad as it could have been I suppose. It's worth having around for giggles, but don't pay more than 6 bucks for it.
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal's voice is unique and relaxing to me. You can't go wrong with his CD's.

0307386171|2.0|If the ebb and flow of emotions and elegant prose are your thing, you may like this book. Unfortunately the characters, and the novel, are shallow. Neither are entirely believable (ok, it is fiction, but the characters need to be gotten hold of). In Edward, we have a self centered boor, who spends his premarital days masturbating, \\"bending daily to the task at hand\\", preoccupied with the next warm vagina to wrap around himself. We know why Edward is present at the honeymoon; Florence qualifies as his lifetime semen cup. Edward is not the stuff of great literature. Florence deserves better. The author gives some integrity and substance to Florence by way of musical proficiency and civil activism, however Florence is molested into a lifeless shell by her father. While the author is able to manufacture sympathy for this sad woman, he does not maker her believable. She is presented as a substantial independent woman who professes to love this man sooo much, so elegantly and so deeply, and yet she is incapable of basic human communication on her wedding night?? The premise of the book is flawed from the start. The pleasant courtship is an incongruity with the wedding night. The courtship is evidently full of fun and romance (not sex, romance), yet on the wedding night, they cannot even speak to each other? If you are honest with yourself, you have to admit you know of noone who truly loves while behaving this way. This is the stuff of arranged marriages.    The comdey of errors and misunderstandings that take place on the wedding night are not believable. One inevitable error after the other, and the reader feels like a teenager trying to escape from an axe murderer, stumbling and bumbling, oh I forgot to lock the front door, I shot him but hit him in the wrong place, my car wont start, I try to run away but fall down, on and on. Spare me please, I have some Stephen King on the bookshelf if I want it.      The author also directly contradicts his own character development when describing their marriage as a vault away from a disdained youth into mature adulthood, then later (in the same scene!!!, although some pages later) Flo and Eddie express contempt for the maturity of adults in the hotel lobby. Where are the editors?    Crediblity is secondary to emotion evidently.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Ah I like em both but I prefer TRUEBLOOD for the more adult approach.  And for those of us drooling to get our DVD Season one set I found on the main TRUEBLOOD HBO Store website that it will be release 5/12/09... May 12,2009!  Once February hits it's only a few months away!  I would say pre-order now considering the price HBO's site is asking is $59.99.
0316017922|2.0|I have read a multitude of books on the subject of success but this one is unique. The premise as I see it is that regardless of your drive and desire to succeed, you are going to need to be very fortunate, lucky and blessed to have any realistic chance of becoming a true outlier. The examples that Gladwell selects to support his position are indeed interesting and most certainly have impacted the outcome for many, but I feel that these are examples of luck and privilege as opposed to success.    No doubt luck, privilege and circumstance greatly improve the odds of \\"success\\" or more accurately \\"skill\\" and he gives individual cases where it was absolutely critical but what of those who prevail in spite of the hand they were dealt? Even within his examples there are individuals that succeed despite his thesis. In one chapter he responds with the unanswered question \\" Wow! What's he doing out there?\\" Hey-that's the guy I want to learn about! He does come close to this in his chapters \\"The Trouble With Geniuses\\"    In the end I was left with the impression that, if I didn't know better I might be convinced that there is no use in reaching for my dream since my fate was sealed by the disadvantages I was born into.  Then in the final chapter I suspected that perhaps this book was nothing more than a cathartic attempt by Malcolm Gladwell to come to terms with his success through his own luck, privilege and circumstance.
B001FB55YE|5.0|It's debatable as to which movie is Guy Ritchie's best. Most would say \\"Snatch\\" or \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.\\" Regardless, Rocknrolla is one hundred percent Guy Ritchie. He's truly a master at directing the juxtaposition of fast-action sequences with sight and sound. The plot is a little involved but not too hard to follow. Everyone is well-cast, including Gerard Butler who continues to impress me. (Check him out in \\"Dear Frankie\\" to see him in a completely different role.) Tom Wilkinson did a heck of a job as well. And Thandie Newton adds just the right amount of eye candy. The dance scene with her and Gerard is classic!    Anyways, it you've enjoyed any of Guy's previous work then I'm certain you'll like Rocknrolla. I, for one, am buying it on Blu-Ray.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|I first heard Adele perform on SNL and was really impressed with her vocals (especially since we had seen Kanye West perform on the same show a few weeks earlier and it was absolutely the worst!) My husband surprised me with the cd and since then, I seem to always have it playing in the background. It gives me the same type of feeling I got from John Mayer's Continuum- with it's throwback vibe and moody undertones and fortunately, it doesn't push towards depressing. I haven't been this excited about someone in a while. It's easy to like Adele.     Where I do understand the comparisons to Amy Winehouse, I'd have to point out that she's more like Amy Winehouse without all of the rehab. It makes me happy that I can play this cd without having to cover my children's ears!
B0018M6J90|3.0|This slight but entertaining trifle is a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half. Its demands on the viewer are minimal -- just sit back and enjoy, you won't be required to think or reflect. I suspect it will go down like a good dessert leaving hardly a memory.<br />Set in London on the eve of World War II, it follows a day in the life of Miss Pettigrew, a repressed spinster who we first meet being fired from her job as a governess. Desperate for work, she's reduced to cadging a meal from a soup kitchen at Victoria Station. Pettigrew purloins an address from an employment agency and shows up at the lavish apartment of Delysia Lafosse, a young, flighty nightclub singer juggling three different men, hoping for fame and fortune in the theater.<br />Various adventures ensue, none of great significance, until the movie winds its way to a more or less satisfactory ending.<br />The acting is pretty good, Amy Adams is winsome, the music is pleasant and Frances McDourmand allows herself to smile in the final frames.
B000063UR2|5.0|Despite the fact that the villain is \\"devilishly\\" sexy and charismatic, the movie is really great! The product came in shrink wrap and so on and so forth. Great item, great seller.
0743496736|4.0|I was really into this book since it was about a school shooting and I am a teacher. It makes me want to be more accountable and aware of \\"bullying\\" because the effects indeed can be horrible. However, I was disappointed with the ending... a bit anti-climatic. The rising action was building so much that I anticipated what was going to happen, and then there really wasn't a whole lot of closure on the situation. I appreciated Picoult's detailed and figurative writing, but I feel as though she could have been a bit more detailed on what happened in the end and why... I could have used about 50 more pages of analysis and breakdown after the trial.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|I'm only a couple listens into WOAD, so my opinion may very well shift.  I didn't care much for Magic at first listen and grew fairly fond of it.  FWIW, I've been a near pathological bruce fan for 25 years since I was 12 y.o.   IMHO, this is far from his best outing...not even his best outing in recent years, but that said it's a rather interesting album, and I do commend him for putting something as unusual as this out there.    first, many are commenting that there is a lot of american 60's sounds borrowing from beach boys and the byrds.  sure there's some of that, but I'm hearing a lot more british pop musical influence.  i'll ID it where I hear it below.    before i break it down (mostly for my own amusement, I'm sure), a prediction.  within 5 years bruce stops coloring his hair, goes all white (a la peter gabriel), grows a beard (or at least goatee) and transforms into an acoustic bard.  no more e-street except to get democrats elected...but puts out some damn good folk genre albums.  he'll get more involved in a cause of some sort and remain public, though I don't see him running for public office.  oh well, that's my BS musing...so the music:    outlaw pete- a weird song, but i can't quite get it out of my head, so that's saying something.  def props to bruce to doing a wacky long ballad like this, especially as the lead track.  first brit musical connection: this sounds to me like a Townshend rock opera track from Tommy or something...and it's also a rocky racoon-esque storyline...if i'm not mistaken the foil here is named Dan as well.  some dylan sounds too in the vocals.      lucky day- best bruce straightforward rocker....bet he opens shows with it.  great tune...nothing wrong with it.    woad- in the last few years bruce has invented a sort of cheesy middle of the road soft rock bruce ballad i'm just not crazy about.  middle of the road meaning it's not a rocker, but nor is it a somber, reflective ballad (think Long Walk Home f/ Magic)  I like my bruce hard and pounding (adam raised a cain) or extremely supple (my beautiful reward, valentines day).  This track is from that in between variety that just doesn't grip me...there are a number of this genre on the album...the whistle bit near the end is nice though.      queen- kind of nonsensical, but gotta compliment him for putting it out there.  sort of like a promised land story...immigrant coming to this country and beiing overwhelmed by the choices and grows into the american dream.  i think it's starring that  same horny dude from girls in summer clothes.  justifiably panned by many.  in general, though, i tend to regard bruce as beyond reproach so I can't be annoyed too much by songs like this.  the unexpected and unnecessary f-bomb at the end of the tune is enough to put a smile on my face though.    what love can do- great song.  to me it has a strong british pop rock sound,- think XTC, Squeeze...a nice post-punk rhythm.  it's a new rhythm for him but I like it a lot.    this life...more middle of the road balladeering...recycled from magic...and not the best of magic.  This has the beach boys sound to it with a REM harmony at the end lifted from shiny happy people or something...    Good eye- pretty enjoyable for what it is, but I don't seek refuge in bruce for delta blues....i seek refuge in his R&R.  I kinda wish he'd make a straight delta blues album, then I could buy it or not but at least be clear about what I'm getting.  And for that matter please go make a straight country album while he's at it too where he could hide the next tune.    tomorrow never knows:  could live without it.  again, go make a country album to get songs like this out of your system.  he could do a trio with dylan and neil young and they'd have a blast playing old hank williams tunes.    life itself...perhaps best song on the album.  quite beautiful in substance and texture.  same qawalli wail at the end from worlds apart on the rising.      kingdom of days:  alright song...nothin' special.  more of that middle of the road soft rock ballad stuff.  my fear is that he runs the risk of going too far down the spectrum of soft-rockdom that he'll be sitting next to phil collins and rod stewart.      surprise, surprise...interesting tune for bruce.  not profound, but helluva lot better than many of the other songs on the album.  it's almost a relief, frankly after kingdom.  more british pop sound...can't place it exactly, but that's what it makes me think of.    Last carnival...phenomenal beautiful ballad.  this is what a bruce ballad should be.  one of his best.  content-wise the most interesting song on the album, too.  clearly a paean to Danny Federici...not to mention Wild Billy from Wild and Innocent.      Aside from the dedication to Danny, I wonder if he is saying anything else with this song?  Is Danny his 'handsome Billy' or is he something more? Is he saying goodbye to Billy forever?  Not gonna be on that high wire anymore?  Billy may have been his doppelganger all these years, it turns out.      it's kind of cryptic, but nevertheless f'ing beautiful.    the wrestler...excellent.  nothing to complain about here.
0767802470|4.0|This 1985 effort was re-issued with a longer VHS version in 1997 with surround sound and 60 minutes added to the original video, then put on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. All these improvements made a good movie even better.    Considering most of this 209 minute film is done inside a U-boat, a submarine, it's very nicely filmed. Jurgen Prochnow, who plays the lead character - the captain of the boat - is a manly, rough-looking-but- compassionate human being who's riveting to watch. Just as interesting as him are the sounds as the noises from the boat echo through all the surround speakers.    I would recommend going with the German language track with English subtitles. The dubbed version has English spoken with a German accent and isn't easy to understand, anyway.....so stick with the way it was made and go with the subtitles if you don't understand German.    In summary: yes, it's a little long but generally the film moves at a decent pace and features a good ending.

B000063JDE|5.0|This has always been a unique crime movie, like no story I have seen before or since. In numerous ways, yes, it's a sick film...but utterly fascinating, even after a handful of viewings. It's a certainly a trademark of director David Lynch with its bizarre story and twists and strange characters. You can bet I'll re-purchase this again when it comes out on Blu-Ray (hopefully).    This movie has one of the most evil characters ever put on screen: \\"Frank Booth,\\" played by Dennis Hopper. The latter is known for playing psychotic killers and this role tops them all. Hopper was never sicker. Almost as bizarre as him is the female victim in here, \\"Dorothy Vallens,\\" played a mysterious Isabella Rossellini.    Kyle MacLaclan is good as the nosy late-teen who just has to find out what is going on in Dorothy's apartment while girlfriend Laura Dern gets caught up in his curiosity.    In a movie that features strange characters, the strangest scene of them - and there are a number - is in Booth's apartment with Dean Stockwell and his friends. Stockwell's lip-synching to an old Roy Orbison song is really freaky. Make no mistake, though: as bizarre as this film can get, it's mostly a very suspenseful crime story that can get uncomfortable (but mesmerizing) to watch at times. The language in this film was surprisingly tame.....until Hopper enters the scene. He's about the only character who uses profanity but he makes up for the others by using the f-word in about every sentence. He is so over-the-top, though, that after the initial shock seeing this movie once or twice, I now almost laugh out loud at him and way he acts.    Visually and audibly, this is another interesting Lynch movie with superb colors, creepy camera angles and a diverse soundtrack. You hear everything from lush classical music to old rock 'n roll songs, and a bunch of bizarre noises (sound effects).    Now, just bring on the Blu-Ray edition, please.
1400082773|4.0|It's an entirely too soon to tell what kind of President Barack Obama will be but we do know that he's a remarkably talented politician.  This book suggests that he may be an equally talented writer.  Its hard to think of another politician capable of telling a story as hefty and nuanced as this one-in their own voice and with surprising candor.     The narrative of Obama's life is pretty well known now but this story will provide an American reader with insight into just what makes the man tick.   And it also reveals a man who is willing to admit his weaknesses and confess when ego has gotten in the way for him.      I was slightly disappointed by the African chapters as they seem to be written fro a greater distance than the Hawaii or Indonesia phases of his youth.  He tells some hard truths about his father but also seems uncomfortable with letting go on his generation.  Maybe that trip to Africa is when he realized he had a future in politics.  I'm grateful for that if it is so.  But it may have cost him a few MPH on his literary fastball.

0740748475|5.0|Maybe the single most complete and wholly realized artistic work of modern American fiction, Calvin and Hobbes stands alone as one of those rare instances of untainted creative expression. Bill Watterson's unwavering dedication to keeping his two titular characters from being over merchandised did not prevent the work from becoming a relevant part of pop culture; it kept it from becoming a cliche. Where most pop art strives to produce material for as long as it's regarded as consumable (ala the Simpsons now in its 20th season) Calvin and Hobbes managed to adhere to the ideology that a concise work of quality CAN and DOES say more than one of unfocused quantity. And isn't that the essence of the comic strip to begin with? It's proof that something funny as well as insightful can be conveyed in only a few drawings and lines of dialogue. It's evidence that brevity truly is the soul of wit. On the surface, it tells the story of a spirited boy and the relationship with his stuffed animal tiger, capturing all the poignancy and creative optimism that applies to those formative years of ones life. But even though Calvin is a two-dimensional drawing his character is anything but. He has a maturity that's ahead of his time, one that's based in a command of the English language that most adults don't posses, even if he does utilize it for immature ambitions. And that to me is where it found it's greatest element of design. It has a dualism that always asks the reader to understand variations in perspective. From showing in one frame that Hobbes is a toy from the parent's point of view, to showing in the next that he's real to Calvin doesn't attempt to convince the reader that Calvin's love for Hobbes is any less relevant. What's relevant is that Calvin's love was real. And even though each strip offers an enjoyable experience, surely this is a case where the whole became greater than the sum of its parts. It became a work of insight, a piece of philosophy that said more abouthumanity through the adventures of stuffed toy and his human best friend than most artists will ever hope to capture in more extensive and outwardly cynical works. Comics are slowly becoming more respected with the popularity of their film adaptations. And with the loss of the stigma that's attached to them an appreciation for their depth is gained. And like Calvin being a little boy ahead of his time, this work is too. One that many years from now will become better understood, more respected, and proves that something can be sincere without being naïve.

0893815233|1.0|Sally Mann exploited her children for notoriety's sake. She knows it. Every time she is interviewed and questioned about these pictures, you can see the tension. Her body language confirms her regret. So-called liberal minds endorse the nude photographs, reassuring each other that it's OK to look. It's not. What child would say, \\"Let me take my clothes off, mommy, so you can take a picture of me. I'll be the most popular kid in school.\\" Her success came at a heavy price, one that she won't have to pay...but her kids will.
B00122Z7NK|2.0|Was it good? Sure, it was fine, almost fun to listen to (the first time, at least).    Was it worth the price? No.  If this was 4 or 5 dollars, I would recommend it, but it is dangerously close to that 9.99$ threshold, which it simply isn't worth.    Many of the songs seem to blend together, but I doubt that this was intentional on their part.  Yes, it has that trade mark \\"Daft Punk type sound\\", but it is *not* as creative or energetic as Daft Punk.    I would be hard pressed to say that any song on this album did not consist of the following: Start with a catchy beat, repeat for 1/2 verses, alter slightly for one verse, alternate to original for next verse, alter slightly for next verse, etc.    The two songs that did have actual singing in them (\\"Tthhee Ppaarrttyy\\" and \\"Dvno\\") were completely shallow and crude, both intellectually and rhythmically.    It really hurts me to rate such a promising band so poorly; I really *did* want to enjoy this more, but the creative energy just is NOT there.    All in all, this album is worth hearing if a friend owns a copy and lets you borrow it, but it is not worth the trouble of paying for.
B001JRB16U|1.0|It seems every time you turn around another \\"Special must have edition\\" comes out on any movie.  With the ecnomy the way it is I would hope that the studio executive's would take that into consideration and not get us to buy another copy of a DVD we already own.<br /><br />I for one am not going to buy the 45th Anniversary Edition since I already own the 40th Anniversary Edition.

B001MW0J2O|4.0|i'm going to try and remain unbiased in my review as animal collective is  one of my favorite bands. i have heard 6 of their albums including this one (Feels, Sung Tongs, Here Comes the Indian, Campfire Songs, Strawberry Jam, MPP) which gives me a nice backdrop to review their latest.<br /><br />after hearing the album in it's entirety once, without reservation that it's a fine effort from start to finish. For the most part the songs keep you engaged, with standout tracks that include:<br /><br />==========<br />\\"In the flowers\\"<br />-starts off a bit slow but around halfway bursts into a nice jam<br />4/5<br />\\"My girls\\"<br />-with it's thumping bassline, beautiful chorus, and mesmerizing close,  (whooooooh!, i don't mean/to seem like i care about, material things/like a social stance/i just want, 4 walls and adobe slats/for my girls)<br />5/5<br />\\"Daily Routine\\"<br />-retains the eccentric nature of the band in an organized manner. Consider it organized confusion.<br />4.5/5<br />\\"Guys Eyes\\"<br />-wow, just when you think they've meandered out into old territory, (which they do, but only for a minute), they come back to earth around 2:33, what a contrast in sound. Reminds me of some beatles and brian wilson.4.5/5<br />\\"Taste\\"<br />-My personal favorite. the droning bassline and hypnotic drumbeat really suck you into their world (\\"Am i really all the things that are outside of me?\\")<br />5/5<br />\\"No More Runnin\\" - beautiful atmospheric vibe, containing some grizzly bear like pianos 5/5<br />\\"Brothersport\\" - a bright, childlike innocent sounding ditty, with \\"ooh's\\" reminiscent of the \\"no's\\" on pink floyds \\"dogs\\" 4.5/5<br />==========<br /><br />after a second listen while writing this, it's already starting to grow on me .. a lot. though i would have to say i think it's missing something. the eccentricity is there, its just not out in full force, which is one of the qualities about the band that i really liked in the past. i guess what i'm trying to say is that i miss songs like \\"Panic\\" and \\"Native Belle\\" that evoked a certain type of feeling and isolation.<br /><br />Decent Tracks:<br />\\"Frightened\\", \\"Summertime Clothes\\", \\"Bluish\\", \\"Lion in a Coma\\"tion.

1433502402|5.0|This is a Bible worth a first, second and third look. Thoroughly enjoyable. I find myself, if I have some serious study time spending 30 minutes to an hour on one or two chapters just reading through the text, and then reading through the notes on the text. I get to meditate on narrative in ways I hadn't thought of before. So enriching. Such a good buy I can not tell you. If you are serious about learning the Word with fresh perspectives and God honoring doctrine.
141690977X|3.0|I actually appreciated this book - when it came out 4+ years ago. It's a tough message to accept; that if a an is interested in you, there will be no ambiguity about it. But what Behrendt and Tuccillo espouse is for the most part the bare bones truth of the matter. The book highlights, examines and pretty much disposes the individual excuses women tend to make for a man's disinterest...or lukewarm interest. ('Don't Call That Man' is a great book that has a chapter entitled 'The Ambivalent Man'. That is a much less tongue in cheek handling of the issue and pretty darn enlightening.) What bugs me about this \\"new\\" edition is that it is solely capitalizing on the movie release - a movie that was merely inspired by the clever book title. There's nothing new here, but moreover what is of value is shadowed by the over-commercialization. For someone wanting to truly get over an ex or a broken heart, you'll get more out of a real support group or workshop like 'The Art of Letting Go - Releasing Heartbreak' or something similar. This book will frustrate anyone going through a fresh and real heart break.

The fables are great and Dumbledore's commentry is great,it really adds to the stories.it can be read without reading the books but that would be worthless in my opinion,not exactly like reading the last chapter in the last book but it doesn't have it's full magic unless you've read the all 7 of the series.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this dvd the other day because I am a huge fan of Jillian Michaels and Biggest Loser.  I've always wanted her to come train me...even though I know we would have words :)  But I knew if she put out a DVD, it would be worth buying.    I am by no means in shape because I had a baby three months ago, but I've always been a natural athlete and constantly working out.  I bought this DVD to help me shed the baby weight so i was so excited to see it in the mail last night and immediately popped it in.  I was surprised that the workout was only 20 minutes and although I thought Level 1 might be too easy for me, I did it anyways.  Level 1 kicked my butt.  I cannot imagine what the other levels will be, but I can't wait until I reach them.    I am so sore today from last night's workout that is actually hard for me to get around.  That to me, is very exciting!  This is definitely worth the buy!!!

B000X5SPBI|5.0|Two major plotlines shape season three of Supernatural.  First, Dean has sold his soul to the Crossroads Demon to save Sam's life and has one year to live before the demon collects on the bargain.  Second, the Winchesters open up a Devil's Gate and release hundreds of demons into the world.  Season three runs at a breakneck pace, largely to Dean's impending doom.  His deal is referenced in nearly every episode and you get the sense of being on a trail speeding headlong into the unknown.<br /><br />Two new recurring characters are introduced in season three, both of them female.  First there is the demon Ruby (Cassidy) who becomes Sam's guardian angel (so to speak) looking after him for her own reasons.  Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan), sometimes ally but usually foe, appears in six episodes.  Bela deals in stolen magical talismans and the like but is hiding her own dark secret.<br /><br />Season three is the darkest and grimmest season so far.  As time ticks away, the Winchesters become more desperate and careless to find a way to free Dean from his deal.  With hundreds of demons on the loose you might think that the season would become one-dimensional but that is not the case.  The writers did a good job of sprinkling in side stories into the writer's strike-shortened, 16-episode season.<br /><br />Among those shows that separated themselves from the main plotline were \\"Bedtime Stories\\" where a comatose girl brings the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales to life and the wonderfully amusing (and gory) \\"A Very Supernatural Christmas\\" in which the boys encounter a pair of Pagan Gods disguised as average suburbanites, who are feasting (literally) on their neighbors.<br /><br />Among the best episodes of the season (in addition to A Very Supernatural Christmas) are \\"Jus in Bello\\" as the Winchesters are captured by the FBI and are jailed in a small town Colorado jail until they can be moved.  The show is inspired by Fort Apache: The Bronx as dozens of demons converge upon the jail intent on killing everyone inside.  For the first time we hear about the demon's new leader, Lilith.<br /><br />In \\"Fresh Blood\\", the Winchester-hating Gordon, also a hunter, escapes from prison and begins hunting the boys down again but has a fatal encounter with a vampire, turning him into a creature of the night.<br /><br />People are receiving calls from the dead loved ones in \\"Long Distance Call\\".  While the people are overjoyed to hear from their deceased family members, the Winchesters do not believe whatever is calling them are benevolent spirits.<br /><br />The season and Dean's fate concludes with \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" as the clock strikes midnight on the last night of Dean's deal.  While it was a solid season finale, it felt very rushed.  The last episode would have been better served as a two-hour finale but that probably was not possible due to the strike.<br /><br />One of the major developments of season three was Sam's development as a stronger character.  When Dean tells Sam that they have to kill Gordon before he kills them, he surprises Dean by agreeing.  Sam becomes more forceful and takes the lead on several occasions as Dean tries to prepare him for life as a solo hunter.  The only disappointment about season three is that Cassidy will not be back for season four as Ruby, as her contract was just for one season.  She is replaced in season four by Genevieve Cortese.<br /><br />While the five-disc set does not feature any audio commentaries like the first two seasons did, it does come with episode introductions by the various directors or writers.  Other extras include three featurettes on special effects, Dean's Impala, and the \\"Ghostfacers episode\\" along with a gag reel.side.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|It's a shame they don't make more movies like \\"Collateral.\\"<br /><br />Then again, there aren't many filmmakers as talented as Michael Mann, a perpetually slick stylist, a connoisseur of cool in all its forms. It's generally accepted that his masterpiece was 1995's \\"Heat,\\" the epitome of filmic cool. But in \\"Collateral,\\" he makes a movie nearly as good by stretching himself and showing us something new. While \\"Heat\\" had a lot of warmth in the peripheral human drama, at its cold cold heart was the cool vs. cool of DeNiro and Pacino. But here we have something different--cool vs. nerd.<br /><br />The nerd in question is Max, a big-dreaming, small-living cab driver and perpetual momma's boy, played with remarkable precision and ability by Jaime Foxx. In a few brief scenes, Mann sketches out his life as an endless banal mush peppered only lightly with missed-and-moped-over opportunities. That is, until Vincent steps into his cab. Tom Cruise's character seems little more than a sharp-dressed man offering a very simple deal to Max: work all night, make five stops, get to the airport by 6:00 am, and earn 700 dollars.<br /><br />Of course, easy money never is; it soon becomes clear that Vincent is a hitman, a slick samurai of sorts who remains unruffled by anything the world can throw his way. On the surface he seems like no more than another of Mann's uber-cool leading men dressed, like so many of the director's cool killers, in a suit and no tie. And at first, there's a good deal of fun to be had watching him try to coach Max into coolness through sheer force of ego and personality. Confrontations with the boss, friction with mother--Max seems overtaxed by such simple everyday trials, until Vincent steps up to show him how to sail through such situations with ease. But there's a decided uncoolness that emerges in Cruise's character as the night unfolds--unlike DeNiro's character in \\"Heat,\\" who shows a certain nobility and a reluctance to do the immoral even in the midst of the illegal, Vincent is pure evil clad in Armani, a smooth-talking sophist with no visible conscience. When Max complains that the hitman just killed a total stranger, he asks, with an awesome mix of incredulity and condescenscion, \\"What, I should only kill people after I get to know them?\\"<br /><br />The script and the action are great, and the DVD extras aren't bad, if you're into that sort of thing--they offer a good look at the perfectionism and artistic process of an incredible director, although for me that can be bittersweet, like watching a magician reveal his tricks. But most importantly, the characters are fleshed out and interesting and real. As the movie and the night progress, they ricochet off one another in increasingly uncontrolled fashion, penned up, for the most part, in their claustrophobic cab, while the tension steadily escalates--it's almost like \\"Rear Window\\" on wheels. And yet despite that physical proximity, there's a moral chasm than neither man can cross. While \\"Heat\\" showed us a cop and robber who were astonishingly similar, who were inexorably drawn to one another in the course of a drama that sprawled like L.A. itself, this gives us a tight little movie with two men destined to repel one another despite their proximity. It's the opposite dynamic, but nearly as unforgettable--and that's pretty cool.s pure evil clad in Armani, a smooth-talking sophist with no visible conscience.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Here's a lovely, gentle movie about love lost and found, a Cinderella story with a happy ending. Amanda Root is perfect as the wistful, sensible, quietly romantic Anne Elliot. Ciaran Hinds captures attention as the dashing Captain Wentworth, her disappointed suitor from long ago. And the supporting cast of nuts and flakes doesn't disappoint: they're hilarious and frustrating. It's enormously satisfying to watch Anne and Wentworth create their own separate peace away from the madness and petty grievances of their associates. I rooted for both characters from start to finish.

B000244FDW|1.0|I find it remarkable that anyone could take a story that is beloved for its spark and bubble, for its quick wit and sly humor, and turn it into a boring, didactic lecture, but that is exactly what the BBC did. I'm very sorry to say that this is the worst version of P&P I have ever seen.     The best that I can say for this version is that it was--technically--accurate. The plot, characters, sets, and costumes were all in order. The fun, however, ends there. Whoever directed this apparently told the actors to assume their positions, strike a pose, and only then say their lines. Elizabeth Bennet failed to charm, her family failed to capture attention either for praise or censure, and Mr. Darcy had a brick-like countenance that seemed impervious to change. During the many interminable hours that this movie encompassed, he managed precisely two variations of expression: first from impassivity to boredom, then back to impassivity. I've never seen an actor act less.     In all, it was boring. I finished it out of loyalty to the genre, not out of any real enjoyment. Honestly, I've had as much fun watching statues grow moss.

0545128285|1.0|I've been holding off writing this review.  I was pretty excited when I bought this book (the day it came out).  I knew it was going to be different from the Harry Potter Series (which I love).  The book has a very good premise.  Being mentioned in the final HP book makes it a curiosity.  The bad part of this book is that is terrible.  Very short stories with some commentary by Albus Dumpledoor.  This book is extremely short and with the commentary not adding anything to this book, makes it even shorter.      Like I said, I've been holding off writing this review.  I originally felt I got ripped off for my $8.  I thought this feeling would go away.  It didn't.

The only part that's a let down is the size of the outside book compared to the inside book. It is well made and different from any other books.  We enjoyed adding this book to our Harry Potter collection.

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Kowalski (Eastwood) embodies the problem with America today: decadence, the rust belt and hard-felt bigotry...lack of religiousity with a twist.    As a war hero and retired UAW, widower, and an upstanding citizen he has been heft upon by the scourge of today's America: gangs, immigration, punks, and the old neighborhood: Kowalski remembers when America was great and he is not about to let it go; when all folks took pride in ownership, owned respect towards others; had their honest meager jobs and their neighborhood:  When people mowed their grass and didn't eat dogs; and spits in the eyes of thugs and immigrant gangs: There is a pithy core to his hard existence.  There are guns and Chinks, Niggers, Dagos, Polocks, and a nice car, all the ingredients for a classic movie.    As a abrassive and meaningful mentor to his Hmong/Korean neighbors, the same folks he was trained to destroy, he softens. He personifies all heroes who love America and the theme \\"thou shalt help thy neighbor\\", at least in Detroit, BECAUSE HE LIVES THERE and this is HIS \\"HOOD\\".  (Would Kawolski (Eastwood) give up his digs?) Unlikely, but he may install a steering column up your kazoobie... Unless...    Themes and symbolism abound, from the Calvery-to-Confession: an Eastwood Classic.  Good supporting cast.  See it.    WGV, Eureka
B000WCN8SC|5.0|If you were there you REALLY understand and I probably can't offer up much to you. You know. And to those that weren't and want to explore four american, rocker, hippie, musician guys, this package will do it for you.<br />Take a dark room, a couple of candles, some good incense, and smoke 'em if you got 'em. Have yourself a breathtaking experience of high end wordology/poetry, and high end virtuoso musicianship that just really gets to the point. A little reading of how Amerika was so uptight for this cat Jim Morrison, and you'll dig it even more. There was peace AND danger in the air kids. That's what rock&roll is suppose to be anyway.<br />This was a Christmas gift from wifey. A treasure for sure. Peace.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|I wanted to love this album, I really did. But I expect better from a legend. Here is a lyric from this album: \\"I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket, There's nothing I can say. Each night I take my groceries and I drift away.\\" Come on Bruce.    Highlights:  *The Wrestler (the only reason this album get's 3 stars), best new Bruce song I have heard in a long time.    I also like Outlaw Pete and This Life, both would fit in well on Magic and will sound great in concert.    Minus Queen of the Supermarket which is dreadful (lyrics not melody), the rest of the album is just ok. It is listenable, but somehow passionless and forgetful at the same time, this sounds much like a Magic out take album, filler material taken off of the cutting room floor, more time should have been put into it. If you had to choose one of the two, skip this and get Magic instead.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a loner whose ex-girlfriend (Emilie De Ravin) calls him in a panic. She doesn't tell him why she's so frightened, but she suddenly wants nothing to do with him. His love for her causes him to search high and low for her, only to find that she has been murdered. It becomes his obsession to find out who killed her and why; he will stop at nothing to find out the truth.<br /><br />An admirable attempt at updating the famous film noir genre, Brick is both entertaining and innovative (as much as a film can be that mimicks an older genre). In the beginning it seems a bit gimmicky but as the story moves along, the actors fall into their roles and the story flows nicely. It features trademarks of noir (the femme fatal, corrupt characters, violence, deception, flashback, fast talk and slang) but updates the genre to modern issues. We actually see some of the violence and the drugs; nothing is sugarcoated.<br /><br />The movie isn't entirely realistic, but that isn't the point. It is highly stylized and mapped out. You might not know anyone who actually uses this kind of vocabulary and you might not think that there are organized crime rings inside of high schools, but it is all depicted here as a heightened reality.
0307455874|5.0|I'm strictly non-partisan, voting for neither Democrats nor Republicans, and I was pleasantly surprised by this thoughtful, intelligent, introspective and well-written look at American politics by a supreme political player. While it does double duty as an effective marketing piece, what impressed me was our president's fairness, caution, and ability to see both sides of issues and frame arguments intelligently. He reveals a profound sense of the complexity of foreign relations and a sharp assessment of history. That he taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago for years deepens his understanding. His unique background puts him in a wonderful position to bring up sensitive, swept-under-the-rug topics like racism, and his fairness and sensitivity on these issues are impressive. So I am quietly and cautiously optimistic that America will be well-served under his stewardship.<br /><br />Still, I would like to remind the public that numerous thinkers have suggested that the office of the presidency has become dangerously powerful. It would be easy to use the excuse of a terrorist attack to proclaim martial law and use the machinery of government to silence critics. Presidents can start wars; Congress was supposed to have this power, according to the Constitution. Ordinary Americans have dropped out of the political process to the extent that they expect the president to do the hard work of democracy for them (see Dana D. Nelson's excellent \\"Bad for Democracy\\" in which she argues that excessive trust in the presidency is a grave problem). The meager extent of American political participation seems to be voting for president -- that's all we do -- and that's not enough. The office is a magnet for the shrewd, for persons with extreme political ambition, and there is real danger that any president, even one as apparently good and fair as President Obama seems to be, may become a tyrant.<br /><br />There should be no mistaking that America's problems are substantial: partisan gridlock, corruption, inability to confront serious looming problems like the specter of nuclear terrorism or social security underfunding, economic competition from rising nations, financial meltdown, excessive lobbying, the decline of real citizenship, and breakdown of the federal structure. Washington, not state governments, manages the economy, and it does this job badly. Most Americans are not real citizens but rather apathetic consumers who have little interest in local political participation.<br /><br />Thomas W.

B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This was a new product purchase so the transaction was very efficient and timely - a wait of a few days for the movie to be released presented no problem.    Thank you so much.
B001L5SXQG|2.0|Just got the album today, and here are a few impressions:    First, Bruce Springsteen desperately needs a new producer.  Brendan O'Brien got the band cooking on The Rising, and gave some muscle to Devils And Dust (one of the Boss' best albums, IMHO). But this \\"wall of sound\\" Phil Spector stuff is getting a little old, and it doesn't give the band room to breathe.  So many strings, girl group vocals, etc., and not enough of the sax/guitars/keys that make a good rock record sound like it should.    Second, the songs themselves: a couple of really good ones, a couple of mediocre ones, and a few that are pure 8th-grade tripe.  \\"Surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, c'mon open your eyes and let your love shine down...\\" WTF?  Is that really the BOSS?  These lyrics are as weak as they come.  Springsteen used to write these great wordy opuses that were full of smart details and feisty, devil-may-care quirks and self-contradictions - but those are few and far between on this album.  And, again, the arrangements and the mix just suck the fire out of the band.  There are a few songs that you can tell are really heartfelt, and at least a little more interesting lyrically; \\"The Last Carnival,\\" \\"What Love Can Do,\\" some of these are pretty good.  There are some interesting lyrical twists and some details that catch the ear.  But all in all, Springsteen needs a fire lit under him, and quick, before he becomes another washed-up nostalgia act.      Maybe a Republican in the White House would help... he was pretty good with Nixon and Ford and Reagan and Bushes around, and not-so-great with Clinton in there.  His two Carter-era albums were good, but Carter was a crappy president too.  But that's enough politics for me.    I'm glad they tacked on \\"The Wrestler\\" at the end of the record... with Springsteen producing himself, he sounds a lot more human, and a lot more interesting.    Here's hoping for better on the next album.
B001KVZ6BG|1.0|I wanted to like this film. I like Danny Boyle. I'm of Indian extraction. But wow. It's just a bad film. I agree with D. Bhansali's 2-star review in large part. Slumdog really isn't about India or even poor people. It's about the transformative of power cinematic illusions. But so what?<br /><br />**spoiler alert**<br /><br />To see how manipulative this film is consider the following question: how would the film have been different if Jamal's mother did not die? Answer: the only consequence is that he would not have known the answer to a game show question.<br /><br />I'm not joking. That is the only discernable difference. Jamal's mother is beaten to death in a pogrom and this influences Jamal's psyche in no apparent way. Later in the film, Jamal's girlfriend (Latika) is raped by Jamal's brother. Again, Latika seems to suffer no ill effects from this sexual assault.<br /><br />How are the children of the slums able to overcome such trauma? What is their source of inner strength? We never find out because Slumdog makes it very clear that the events it depicts are mere plot devices. They don't represent real events. The mother really didn't die; the girl really wasn't raped. It's all fake. It's just a movi about a game show. There will be Bollywood ending--complete with a little Bollywood dance--just in case you had any doubts about the complete unreality of what you just saw. Memories of children being orphaned, mutilated, sexually assaulted and sold into slavery are all erased in the blinding light of Latika's model-perfect (but entirely vacant) smile. Hey, that's cool. Why not? After all, it's just a movie.<br /><br />This sort of nonsense comes off rather badly when compared to the brilliant film Salaam Bombay! The street kids in Salaam Bombay! face the same tragidies the kids in Slumdog face. But Salaam Bombay! demonstrates that these stark circumstances are bearable because the children of the slums have individual worth. The urchins speak and have real motivations (compare this to Latika or the one-eyed urchin). The children of Salaam Bombay! survive their suffering because they create dignity within that suffering. At no time does Salaam Bombay suggest that the main character's suffering is illusory or can be easily forgotten if he can just find a beautiful Bollywood girlfriend.<br /><br />I don't deny that Slumdog is at times enjoyable. It's reasonably well acted and entertaining. But that is part of the problem. In view of films like City of God and Salaam Bombay!, I think we can and aim a bit higher and demand more than just entertainment.-eyed urchin).

B000V696US|4.0|...another Rufus Wainwright release like this one. The songs on Want One by Rufus Wainwright seem to all have a feeling of celebrating heartbreak and longing. Equal parts uplifting and sad. I haven't heard all of Mr. Wainwright's work (I only have his debut to date), but this is by far the best work from him I've listened to. I've come to identify him as a piano-man/singer/songwriter in the vain of Elton John, Ben Folds, and occasionally Elvis Costello. There are also faint hints of cabaret and classical lieder in his sound. The tracks that really grab you immediately are Movies Of Myself, 14th Street and Beautiful Child and all are well crafted pop productions. 14th Street in particular, hooked me from the get-go with it's rousing chorus and big background vocals. Vicious World is a piece of music I find really fascinating, how it somehow morphs from its sound loop like intro into a beautifully layered ballad is beyond me. The string arrangements are great throughout this release. In particular Vibrate, with it's floaty staccato.  There are a few moments where I lost interest (Pretty Things and Want),mostly because I didn't find them as harmonically exciting as the other tracks. In the end, I find myself enjoying this collection of songs that somehow celebrates heartache, and the lieder-like Dinner At Eight fittingly ends this outing on a somber but defiant note.
B000WGZGNS|2.0|video recording and quality is excellent but the music is not as classic as i anticipated.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|I bought this CD the day it came out and I am really into it as a whole.  I read many of the posted reviews here as well as in other publications.  This IS NOT a five star record but a sturdy four.  There does seem to be a happier undertone to this record that was not found in Magic or The Rising.  The lyrics are happier but the music sometimes veers off track... Outlaw Pete has great lyrics and tempo changes but some have compared the ending solo to Jungleland...Sorry folks...This is NOT correct...It is a great tune but not the epic that it has been compared to.  Along with Outlaw Pete and the title track my other favorite track is Life Itself.  This is a a very consistent album but lacks the energy of Magic or The Rising...and lacks sax too...But as in this case sometimes a lack of energy is a good thing...

0545128285|1.0|So, after really enjoying the complexity of the Harry Potter series, I was quite disappointed in this collection of stories.  First of all, it took less than an hour to read.  Second, the stories weren't the most interesting, some of them just creepy.  I checked it out from the library and am glad I didn't spend any money on it.    I almost feel like it was just an excuse to make more money without creating anything new.
B001LPWGE6|4.0|I couldn't figure out how to open this set. I was tugging on the sides. Then I tried to slip the case off vertically. I was on the verge of forcing open the box when I decided to google the set, hoping to see something about the packaging scheme since there is no clear indication as to how to open it. Before you force this thing open, take note: The cover image of Matt Damon is a magnet. It flips open to the left, allowing access to the discs. Enjoy.
B001L5SXQG|2.0|Michael Jordan will not be remembered for his time spent with the Washington Wizards and when Brett Farve enters the hall of fame he will only be thought of as a Packer. Ten years from now, when critics analyze the career of Bruce Springsteen, all that will stand out and survive the test of time will be his work from 1975 to 1984. This is an artist that should have retired in 1992 after the double album duds of Lucky Town and Human Touch. This current effort, Working on a Dream, is getting noticed not because of the music, but because of the high profile stature of the artist, Bruce Springsteen. The first track, Outlaw Pete, has lyrics that are amateurish. My Lucky Day relies on a monotonous melody and Queen of the Supermarket, even though it has an interesting melody, suffers from lyrics that are downright embarrassing, right down to the unnecessary use of the F word at the end. Surprise, Surprise has words that aren't even worthy of Hannah Montana. The rest of the album moves along at a brisk pace, but nothing stands out as memorable enough to mention. The only exception is The Wrestler, which has that unique Springsteen feel to it. It cries out for the E Street band to jump in with a raw, live sounding mix, but that never happens. Have you ever really seen a \\"one legged dog\\" walking down the street though?    On the positive side, the songs have a great deal of variety in the musical arrangements. With a few exceptions, the melodies are unique, the playing is varied and Springsteen's singing is well done. The lyrics though, which have been Bruce's strength over the years, are just to me, not inspiring and quite frankly, not very well crafted. If you haven't bought the record, go to Bruce's website and read the lyrics he so proudly displays, and see for yourself. I carefully listened to this record all the way through twice and I don't really have a desire to ever play it again. There is no song on this album that makes you put your fist in the air or sing along because the words and music are just not that inspiring. The production and mixing of the E Street Band, although better than Magic, still leaves one of the best live rocking bands in the world, with a muffled studio sound.    Springsteen is the golden artist. It seems that no critic has the guts or the honesty to call him out on the mediocrity of his post 1984 work. A 5 star review from Rolling Stone? Give me a break. A few years ago, he got rave reviews for Devils and Dust. I bet that almost no one who bought that album ever listened to it more than once. It was just plain awful. And the songs from Magic, now just over a year old, have pretty much slid into oblivion. The same fate awaits this batch of lackluster songs.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Finally an intelligent romantic comedy that's lovely and charming with a great cast. Be on the lookout from a funny cameo from Dustin Hoffman, who just happened to be at the Blockbuster while the film crew was filming their scenes!
B00004Y6NU|4.0|I like Telegraph Road BUT...it's too long. I'd rather have three good four minute songs than one good 14 minute song.  I like Private Investigations BUT...it's such an unusual and slow-paced song that I have to be in the right mood to listen to it.  I like Industrial Disease BUT... mainly for the lyrics; the melody is secondary.  I like Love Over Gold BUT...only consider it an average DS song; good, but don't see why it's so highly touted.  I like It Never Rains BUT...no buts here; this is solid Dire Straits.  I like the Love Over Gold album BUT...I like the other five DS albums more. Despite the qualifying remarks, it's a good album that I recommend to DS fans.
B001CTA1S4|5.0|An exceptionally strong ensemble drama with magnificent performances by the entire cast, but particularly mind-blowing performance by the ever-powerful thespian Meryl Streep. No one deserves more awards for every single performance than Streep, but this performance is truly in its own category. The intensity of Streep's performance is only aided by Amy Adams' incredibly powerful portrayal and Phillip Seymour's did-he-or-didn't-he convincing act. Viola Davis is on screen for a brief period of time, but she is truly phenomenal as a mother trying to reconcile what she knows to be wrong and what she realizes is the only path for her son. The film is incredibly anti-Church and anti-establishment, so it's no surprise that the Oscar nomination for Best Picture eluded it. Make no mistake though, this film would've easily deserved the statue.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Following their major label North American debut in 1967, the Bee Gees released three superb albums in rather quick succession, culminating in 'Odessa' in 1969. It was an ambitious era for rock and soul music, whether your tastes ran to the blues-based sounds of Johnny Winter or Fleetwood Mac; the psychedelic soul-rock excursions of Sly Stone, the Chambers Brothers or Santana; the jazz-rock experiments of BS&T, Lighthouse or Chicago; the proto-metal of Zeppelin, Deep Purple or the Jeff Beck Group; the back-to-basics 'Americana' of Dylan or The Band; or the 'sure sounds great on 8 track' swamp rock of CCR. 'Odessa' was another creature altogether. Grand in design and execution, it melded baroque pop, timeless melodies and a distinctly AOR-but-cool sensibility. Robin Gibb's voice was particularly stirring, but the harmonies throughout were flawless. If you're still not impressed after the first three tracks then remember: these guys were barely out of their teens when they recorded this. Respect due.
B001L5SXQG|1.0|I too admire Mr. Springsteen's commitment to squeeze out every penny out of his aging and, quite likely, tone-deaf fan base.'Perhaps it is the Brett Favre syndrome or just the oversized ego of yet another `bobo' millionaire but Mr.Springsteen, whose abysmal descent into irrelevancy was made official with the release of this hilarious \\" Working On A Dream \\" scheme , just keeps insisting on staining his own legacy.<br /><br />Still, congratulations are in order: whoever manages to fool the general public for decades with a stale blue collar act while living the life of the obscenely wealthy, deserves all kinds of accolades.<br /><br />So for elevating spuriousness to an art form, congrats to you, sir !
1595141979|5.0|This book was fantastic and devastating at the same time.  The story is wonderful.  Rose has matured immensely since the first book.  She is also going through many disturbing things between being Lissa's shadow-kissed guardian, seeing ghosts and experiencing feelings that are not typically hers.  This book is packed with intense action and romance.  The love story between Rose and Dimitri takes a new turn and you really get to know Dimitri in this book.  It was good to see him drop all his boundaries and finally start to really embrace the bond he and Rose have.  This book ends in a huge cliffhanger.  It was devastating to read but I think that Richelle Mead has some things up her sleeve. For the first time Rose puts herself first and I think it was a step she needed to take, for her and for her friendship with Lissa.  I'm hoping to see some changes in Lissa as well in the next book.  I like Lissa but found her to be a bit self-centered at times. I wonder what Richelle Mead has in store for us and how she will let this next book play out. I think this next book will send Rose on an adventure that will change many things.  Rose may be a dhampir and have no \\"magical\\" powers but she is special and unlike any dhampir.  Her connection to the world of the dead may prove to be stronger and more powerful then she thought.  I also think her connection to dimitri, the love and bond they share may prove to be more powerful then either one of them realized.  It is a magical world that Richelle Mead has created and I think anything could happen.

0375826726|1.0|The other reviewers have summed this up fairly well: This book could have been about 150 pages, not a whole lot happens, much time and effort goes into meaningless detail that does nothing to push the story forward. I loved the first book, I thought the second book was horrible, I read reviews of this one before starting it, and they seemed to indicate it was better than the 2nd... I don't think so'm not so sure. I was so annoyed that the author is milking this series into one more book (out of sheer greed - and I'm assuming it's just one more...he's now refering to it as a series...he doesn't indicate how many books are in the series) that I left it on the shelf for three months before very reluctantly picking it up. The author flits from tangent to tangent and doesn't drive the story forward...instead we get 100 pages of THE MOST BORING details of dwarvish politics. Details that have absolutely nothing to do with the story and will have absolutely no purpose in the subsequent book (the same can be said for the droning Varden political details in book 2 - who cares! It's not what the story is about). He needs a good editor to tighten up the story telling and get to the point. Buy it used if you must - or better yet, hit the library - you'll find yourself skimming a very large chunk in the middle. The author, on the other hand, should be looking over his shoulder - the Menoa tree canNOT be happy he is needlessly wasting paper on this dreck.

B000JVT1U0|5.0|Affronted by religious beliefs and culture quite different from his own, Sgt Howie is surrounded by what he considers obscene and immoral as he hunts to save a missing girl. But does that mean the unfamiliar is wrong? Haunting music and powerful images make this a memorable, provoking movie about different cultures colliding, as morals and decency are explored.

B000R8YC1I|5.0|Dark Crystal is completely puppets with no human actors making an appearance. Gorgeously inventive scenes and music that fully create a whole other worldly experience. Not just some children's tale- It has corruption, death, greed... It is similar to Lord of the Rings in it's epic journey/prophecy storytelling where the small must perform a big task with help of friends for the larger good; only he's healing a crystal in order to banish evil, not banishing a ring of evil.<br />I'm not familiar with each releases extras, for as long as I have the movie itself I'm happy. But you may want to compare the various releases before purchase to find the edition with the extras you prefer.
0312370849|5.0|Marvelous!!! - beautifully written!!!
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Supernatural, though not in the way a poltergeist is. There's still gore and reality here; not so much ephemeral ghosts. Youth, Death, Love and the afterlife all explored. Sort of a surrealist's horror tale, at once outrageous, campy, genuinely suspenseful and ominously terrifying.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I had seen Celtic Woman on PBS some time ago and liked it so much I just had to get the CD.
B00004WNRU|4.0|They sing like tree-huggers and when they play it sounds like an oak in the breeze--if that makes any sense--but they're here to do much more than hug trees.  Their sound is clean in a natural, unrefined sense, their words are everyman poetry without pretension, and their songs are twanging, pointed rock with messages and lots of life.  The \\"Air\\" side, tracks one to six, are the best; even though \\"The Wrong Child\\" isn't the catchiest or the strongest song on the record, its pure-sunny-Californian-wind self honestly moves me.  The \\"Metal\\" side fizzles just a little, but \\"I Remember California\\" makes it all worthwhile.  Those that stuck with the band during their more \\"indie\\" days mostly because they were a darn good indie group may be put off by this album, but those that dug R.E.M. for R.E.M. will be hard-pressed to resist its siren charms.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|I picked this up because how can you not watch a show about a team of people lead by John Barrowman?  I'm glad I did, too.  It delivered.  Captain Jack (Barrowman) is the head of Cardiff's Torchwood.  It's a secret agency that deals with keeping aliens and time rifts in check.  The show picks up when Gwen is recruited as a new Torchwood agent.<br /><br />Torchwood is darker than Doctor Who and for a slightly older audience.  It does deal with some more adult aliens and has many innuendoes of adult nature, but it's all done in good fun.  As was said by show runners and critics, it does seem to follow a format each week-- Alien comes, chaos ensues, Torchwood wins.  There is some character development, but we get much more in later seasons.  The cast is amazing.  They all seem so natural and you'll find yourself becoming attached to them quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I give this 4/5 stars.  I recommend continuing on with the series after this, as it just gets better and better!
B0000024W3|3.0|I give it three stars, but it's a brilliant album.  There are no less than three stories, all spun by Dylan himself, about why this collection exists.  I believe the second: Dylan was fed up with his \\"spokesman of a generation\\" label and tossed out this record as fast as he painted its cover--which he painted in about five minutes.  Despite its reputation, though, \\"Self Portrait\\" isn't awful, or even bad.  As Robert Christgau pointed out, it's brilliantly organized, particularly since Dylan includes traditional numbers which inspired him when he began in the early Sixties.  It's the most extraordinary rock artist of all time trying to throw everyone off by making a trashy album.  In that regard, it's genius.  But because it was meant to be a trashy album, no matter how un-trashy it is, it isn't going to be very lively--even the live versions of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and \\"She Belongs to Me\\" which Dylan was delightfully arrogant enough to toss on feel barren and devoid of any life.  Essentially, if \\"[[ASIN:B00028HODG Nashville Skyline]]\\" was a pointed nudge to get people off his back, \\"Self Portrait\\" is Dylan dropping tear gas, physically assaulting everyone in his audience, and then disappearing into the woods.  On the other hand, you get to hear him warble \\"Blue Moon.\\"
B000E41MS6|5.0|I admit, this was my first real introduction to a complete season of Doctor Who.  I'd seen some of the past Doctors, but never their 'complete run' as the Doctor.  I didn't know what to expect when I popped it in the DVD player, but, boy, am I sure glad I did!<br /><br />This 13 episode season had me hooked from beginning to end.  It had me thinking about it when I wasn't watching it and wishing that I had the time to sit and watch the entire series all the way through.  Christopher Eccleston is amazing as the Ninth Doctor.  His portrayal is different than I'd ever seen of the past doctors I watched.  He brings a darker edge to the stories and the Doctors mysterious past.  His chemistry with Billie Piper is great.  They work together so well.  I never heard of her before this and since seeing the rest of the companions in the full series, must say that she is my favorite of them (the companions).<br /><br />I recommend this series to anyone who has the slightest urge to pick it up.  It has time travel, space aliens, heart wrenching moments, laugh out loud moments, some romantic bits, and heart.  Give it a chance and, like me, I suspect it will have you hooked.
B000001DQI|4.0|Is \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" a masterpiece of rock or just the finest album of glamorama ever recorded?  The latter.  You can have your gold bricks and rock too, but only if there's dirt beneath the gold--and there are only sprinklings of soil beneath the bricks on this record.  \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\" sustains its illusion so well that one might almost buy into it, but, like the album itself, anyone not looking specifically to lose themselves in a glittering fantasy will look into that illusion and see nothing but empty space.  Which is alright, for the most part, since John's melodies are so pleasant and Taupin's lyrics so smooth-going.  What scares me is when people buy into the illusion and forget that rock was and is meant for something deeper and more urgent.  Only in the dazzling \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" did I sense enough truth to lose myself.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|Wanted to get this CD because I like some of the songs I've been hearing.  Glad I did.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|Considered by many to be one of the great American staples; `A Streetcar Named Desire' is in all honestly one of the greatest films of all time.  It truly lives up to the hype and delivers one of the most satisfying and gratifying cinematic experiences anyone can wish for.  With dynamic acting, solid writing and daring direction, `A Streetcar Named Desire' is truly desirous.<br /><br />The film tells of the conflict between disturbed Southern Belle Blanche DuBois and the simple yet brutish Stanley Kowalski.  When Blanche travels to see her sister Stella she never imagined the trouble she would not only cause but ultimately find herself in.  She immediately begins to butt heads with Stella's husband Stanley, their ideals and personalities at complete opposite ends, but she attempts to make things work, for as long as she can.  The film does a marvelous job of depiction a true loss of one's grasp of reality as we see Blanche and everyone around her sucked into a loss of hope.  Blanche arrives at her sister's New Orleans doorstep after losing her home (their childhood home) under circumstances that Blanche is not quick to relay.  Blanche seems to be placing up a façade to hide a past she is most ashamed of, but what sort of woman is she really?  Stanley, determined to deliver a reality check to everyone, searches out the truth despite the harm it may cause (it can be stated that Stanley receives the biggest `reality check' of all).<br /><br />The film dramatically and effectively approaches these characters with a stark realism that makes their every movement and action all the more poignant.<br /><br />I adore films of this nature, as many who read my reviews already know, for it delivers an emotional shock to the soul, and those connections make me feel invested in a film.  `A Streetcar Named Desire' is quite frankly one of the best examples of brutal honesty captured on film.  There is no sugarcoating here, none whatsoever.  Everything is stripped bare and delivered in a frank yet morally ambiguous nature; so much so that we become a major player in the films unraveling.<br /><br />And then there is the acting; tour de force across the board.<br /><br />Let's get the easy out of the way.  Kim Hunter and Karl Malden both deserved the Oscar's they won for their wonderful supporting turns here, adding layers with each scene to their characters but also to the leads as well.  Hunter is flawless as Stella, giving her a naivety that beautifully centers her character, grounds her into her surroundings and into our hearts.  That smoldering descent down the staircase is probably the single best scene in the film and makes for the one of the steamiest and most passionate scenes in cinema; ever.  Malden is also effortlessly captivating as Mitch, the clueless suitor who finds a light in Blanche that others cannot see.  His desire to have that someone is so passionate that when Stanley snuffs out that passion we are heartbroken; betrayed even.<br /><br />What is so wonderful about the casting of Vivian Leigh and Marlon Brando is that their styles are so distinct that they complement the very conflict erupting within their characters.  Leigh is a very mannered actress who mirrors the actresses best suited for the stage.  The fact that this is a stage play adaptation works in her favor.  She reminds me of Julianne Moore in her delivery.  One could say that she appears to be acting, and in this case it works brilliantly.  Marlon Brando is a much more natural actor, his delivery appearing fluid and relaxed.  He's far less controlled or restrictive in his performance.  You can liken him to Russell Crowe.  When these two actors share the screen it is such a blessing, watching them battle one another in more than one way.  It is the definition of inspired casting, and watching these two performance work to outdo one another is a treat to the viewer.<br /><br />The fact that Brando is the only actor in the bunch to lose the Oscar is a shame, since he was by far the best performer here.<br /><br />In the end I will wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece of a film.  It gets better and better every time I watch it, and truth be told it is truly one of the best films to ever be labeled the best of anything.  Sporting one of the greatest ensemble casts, one of the most powerfully riveting scripts and some of the most inspired direction of it's time and any other, `A Streetcar Named Desire' is a knockout on all levels and deserves to be rendered as such.I will wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece of a film.

1400079179|2.0|Got mine at a rummage sale without a dust cover, that's why I ask.  Thought I'd check it out because of all the recent hoopla.  Seems to me that the subject matter could have been the basis for a series of novels or at least one big thick one, but Mr. Brown (or his publishers) decided to present a tidy little boiled down version.  Unfortunately, the underdevelopment of the characters and the use of long french proper names makes the book actually hard to read, and definitely not a page turner for me.<br /><br />One can learn about much more shadowy individuals and intricate plots by just googling the words illuminati, golden dawn society, new world order, knights of malta, rosy cross, priory of sion, et cetera ad nauseum.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you are a Joss Whedon fan, this is a must own (but then you probably already have it) Its a fun and quirky tale of a super genius mad scientist in training and in love, and his attempts to become a full fledged villain.  The writing is tight and like most whedon work, becomes a more complex tale the more you look into it.  It plays on many super hero tropes, and at the same time makes the characters real people (Except Captain Hammer, who is played gleefully by Nathan Fillion with out any deeper thoughs).  Fun all around.      Short version:  Thoughtful funny song get stuck in you head inducing, tale of a mad scientist.
0312383320|5.0|Great book for anyone who already loves Stephanie Plum and people just meeting her for the first time!
0316067601|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the SEALs, Special Opertions Warfare, Afghan culture, or the Global War on Terror.  It's a special opportunity to see into the heart and mind of a typical, US Navy SEAL--where does he come from, what makes him tick, how is a Navy SEAL built from a mere mortal, how does a SEAL think, act, fight, and how does he feel about his brothers-in-arms.  Marcus Luttrell's book offers a unique peek into the deepest thoughts and feelings of a SEAL:  in BUDS training, in his unit assignments, in special operations combat, and as an overcomer of impossibly adverse circumstances.  One aspect of his story which I found of curious interest was the absolute fidelity of his Afghan hosts to their Moslem and tribal doctrine of accepting responsibility for the welfare and protection of an invited guest--even to the point of sacrificing their village.  It gives a better, more three-dimensional perspective on the people of Afghanstan and their culture.  Luttrell completely opens his heart and his mind to the reader.  I think almost everyone who reads this book will come away with an unusually informed perspective on just how amazing our special operators and, indeed, all of our young men and women in combat theaters really are.  Thank you, Mr. Luttrell.  God bless the US Navy SEALs and God bless Marcus Luttrell and his mates!
B001QB5ZRK|5.0|An overdue attempt to explore blatant excesses in science, Fringe brings together the viewers fascination and fears.  The plots skirt the paranormal, neither demonic nor religious, but instead a refreshing in your face look at science and it's magnificent dangers.  Combined with modern corporate and global issues, these story lines weave tales that wrought plausibility which force an onus on the viewer to sort their moralities while simultaneously being extremely entertained.

B000SO7OM0|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is a sublime work of a gifted woman and her surrounding musicians. The poetry of the language, the excellence of the melodies, the beauty of the voice all add to create a soul touching experience which deepens with each subsequent visit. My not-quite three year old grandson is mesmerized by Loreena's being and voice. It has opened up a world of imagination to him, filled with hurdy-gurdys and ouds which he talks about constantly. High praise that I trust from a pure little soul.

B000002KDG|5.0|We've always loved Neal Young's work, and this album in particular. This work hearkens back to the real world we grew up in, with a mix of styles and lyrical ideas that touch on all the various aspects of what we believed in, desired, hoped for, and feared when we were young people. As we grew older, so did our collections of cassette tapes, and of course, the radio grows younger. Being able to find discs to replace our old favorites is one of the gifts of the internet, and Amazon is one of the best places to find what we're looking for.
0446402389|5.0|Kudos to young Tom Rob Smith for a blockbuster debut - a first novel so well researched, authentic, and ambitious that it could be easily confused with that \\"other Smith\\" - Martin Cruz.  Though a Brit, Smith writes with Hammer and Sickle firmly in hand - \\"Child 44\\" captures the tyranny and oppression of the Stalinist Soviet Union with no embellishment, no apology.  Wrapped around the pursuit of a serial killer, this is truly a story of the Individual vs. the State - a stark and chilling admonishment to those who believe that all the answers lie with a central government.<br /><br />Set in 1953, Leo Demidov drinks the Stalin Kool Aid - a Soviet war hero who is now an officer of the feared MGB, the State Security Force.  Throughout his career, he has marched lockstep with the Party, from the bowels of the Lubyanka wrenching and ripping confessions from hundreds, sending them to a prolonged death sentence in distant frozen Gulags, or for a more merciful conclusion, to the executioner immediately.  When a young boy - the son of one of Leo's MGB underlings turns up dead and likely murdered, Leo is only too pleased to quickly write it off as an accident.  After all, how could there possibly be murderers in Stalin's workers' paradise?  But when more children start turning up brutally slain and similarly mutilated, Leo finds himself questioning his faith in the State, and before long, the hunter becomes the hunted, and Leo is sitting on the wrong side of the twisted justice he'd so often and so efficiently dispatched.<br /><br />The author effectively uses background and setting in creating the perfect atmospherics for this dark tail.  The weather - either frozen slush and icy rivers or insufferable summer hear and humidity and mosquitoes dovetail nicely with the brilliant absurdities of a system that erases all trust between people, building a culture where all is dependent on the State.  Unlike Colin Cotterill, who deftly dissects Southeast Asian Communism with wry humor in his excellent \\"Dr. Siri Paiboun\\" series, Smith navigates these troubled Soviet waters with little levity and less hope, relying on suspense, terror, and the necessary pace to keep his complex and multi-threaded plot coherent and moving.<br /><br />Its great to see another exciting new author on the shelves - make some room, Martin Cruz!  I look forward to TR's next: \\"The Secret Speech\\", due in May.\\"Dr. Siri Paiboun\\" series, Smith navigates these troubled Soviet waters with little levity and less hope, relying on suspense, terror, and the necessary pace to keep his complex and multi-threaded plot coherent and moving.

B00070DK14|5.0|The odd thing is I don't remember hearing about this album at all when it came out. I think it received little or no support from  N.Y. radio. When I finally heard the songs , I wondered why only the germans seem to have gotten it. The material here is,in my opinion,very good. The songs run from very powerful to soft and interspective. \\"Slow Marching Band\\" is one of Ian's finest and evokes alot of emotion. So many extra tracks too!I agree with another fan that too many compare the various Tull works. In the sense that Ian and company are a \\"forward thinking\\" group, I think they always strive for \\"newness\\". This may indeed frustrate fans that are looking for \\"AQUALUNG #2\\". I also believe that Ian revisits certain \\"themes\\" or \\"motifs\\" throughout the years that remind one of earlier works.

1591841666|5.0|Some reviewers didn't like \\"The Dip\\" because Seth took old blog posts, mixed them with new stories, and then packed it all into a small book. I didn't have a problem with that, in fact I liked it.<br /><br />Seth makes his point very early on by saying that we have to know when to quit an endeavor and when to stick with it. Most people stick with something that they should have quit a long time ago or they quit right before they reach a breakthrough. Simple, isn't it?<br /><br />Well not really. It seems that letting go of what's not working is harder than quiting something that's difficult to accomplish. Who wants to hurt their ego and admit that they've made a mistake? I say let go, admit that you've been wasting your time, and then move on to something else.<br /><br />Sticking with what YOU KNOW isn't working is like saying \\"We've been married for 10 years and I don't really like you anymore. However I'm too lazy to leave, I need someone to do my laundry, and you smell good. I'd rather be miserable by staying than admit I made mistake by choosing you!\\" OK, maybe that wasn't a great example, but you get my point.<br /><br />I thought the book was good short read. Yes Seth tells us stuff we already know, but most of us don't do anything with what we learn anyhow. I have to read business books at least twice before I'm able to really \\"get it\\".  Some books I have to read three or four times. Maybe I'm slow.<br /><br />I thought the book was great and I look forward to reviewing \\"Tribes\\".
0316113077|5.0|A well written and photographed cake book.Some beautiful designs and a great balance for beginners to more experienced cake creators.  I loved the use of colour and the designs, however no examples on how to ganache the cakes were shown.This seems to be an urban myth with cake books there are no pictures or instructions on how to ganache the sides and ensuring a smooth level top?Why ?    This book still, is a league of its own and  I highly recommend it.
0439023483|3.0|Well, it's YA.<br /><br />So does that mean I shouldn't expect it to be very good? Maybe. I'm in a bit of a muddle about that actually.<br /><br />It was (to me, at least) predictable, the violence seemed gratuitous, and the plot a mish-mash between Survivor, Running Man, The Lottery, and Reality TV 2083, with all the freshness implied thereby- but if I was a teen, and had no store of cultural expectations for what might happen in such a scenario, would I be excited by this book?<br /><br />I doubt it. But for what it was, it was well done.
1596061669|5.0|Since this is a book about books, it's very appropriate that it should be issued in a spectacular collectible edition: a real cloth binding, textured endpapers, two colors of ink. Limited and signed, it also includes atmospheric artwork, and a dust jacket that hides its own surprise.<br /><br />As to the novel itself, it's a big wonderful melodrama of the kind you're told no-one writes anymore. (See other reviewers, including Stephen King.) I can hardly wait for June, when the next book in the sequence is released in English.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|OK, so this isn't musical.  But be glad, I can't sing!  \\"Commentary: The Musical,\\" however, is dang near as funny as the actual movie, PLUS there's an actual commentary, which is also good, PLUS there are several video entries for the Evil League of Evil, created by fans and sent in for inclusion on the DVD.    The fan applications range from excellent to surreal, with the latter largely coming from Europe.  The absolute highlight of these, however, is the first, Mr. Terrible, who sings his entire 2½-minute application in a way entirely consistent with the movie... and the song itself is genuinely good, to boot.    The movie itself... well, honestly, 98% of the people reading this review have probably already seen it and made up their own mind, so I won't bother gushing over it.  For the other 2%... go watch it online, and then come back and buy the DVD, because I know you'll want to!    Even though the movie is available for free (and legally) on its own website, the DVD is *more* than worth the money.    Joss Whedon is the man!
B001LF4IA6|4.0|I wrote a review a few weeks ago which I've since deleted.  I edited it as I discovered more to like and love, but the Amazon system would not allow me to change my initial 3 stars; i.e., no matter what my narrative said, my review still had 3 stars.  I would actually give it 4.5 stars now if I could; I just can't give it 5, as that kind of rating, for me, has to be reserved for definite classics.  By the way, I am writing this on February 17th.  I mention this because when I previewed it I saw the date of my *original*, 3-star review (Jan. 28th).  Amazon:  can you improve the system to allow us more flexibility when we change our minds?  My experience is that very rarely does truly great music reveal itself right away.    This record has *definitely* grown on me, and I think it is superb.  For me, This Life and Kingdom of Days are right up there with some of Bruce's best (I've been a serious fan since '75).  The sound is also MUCH better than the sound of Magic, particularly in being less compressed, more \\"alive\\", easier on the the ears, etc.    I could say a lot more, but it's been said by others.  I refer you to Tom Ryan's review of January 31 for one of the best I've read.  This record really does have some gorgeous \\"stuff\\" (e.g., harmonic details, little \\"hooks\\", beautiful vocals and strings) which you will hear on a very good stereo system.    Thank you Bruce, for not producing another very compressed record like Magic (which, nevertheless, had some very good material and one great song: Devil's Arcade).  Is there any chance that Magic could be released in an uncompressed version?

B0000073I5|5.0|I've been listening to this album since it came out over 25 years ago, and it never gets dull. The singing alone is fantastic - would have loved to have seen more come out of this combination.    If you think Genesis is nothing more than a backing band for Phil Collin's saccharine-sweet pop tunes, think again. This is QUALITY music for sure.    If you like this, follow it up with \\"And Then There Were Three\\" and work backwards. Anything forward from there is rot, in my opinion...
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This CD is better than I'd imagined, Neon Bible being the first AF album I'd ever heard. And, like all their songs, it took me a few listens to really love the album. But that's how it is with a lot of good music, and AF is definitely good music.     My only complaint was with the packaging, which sometimes ripped as I pulled out the CD (it's a paper case). But that was probably my own fault, not the manufacturers. Overall, the CD is wonderful and it's almost a crime not to hear it. Enjoy!
B000063DHK|5.0|This CD (or the original vinyl album) is the perfect representation of their show from that era. I saw them either twice or three times in Spain, and they played, pretty much, every song on here.<br /><br />There are, of course, their most popular songs like Run To The Hills, Number Of The Beast, and Two Minutes To Midnight. However, there are plenty of other songs on here that keep you interested. In fact, there isn't a bad song on the CD.<br /><br />This is almost the definition of power metal, though they are also solidly in the NWOBHM category. Lots of melody, great guitar solos, and a solid rhythm section. The vocals fit right in with the style and Dickinson's range is quite impressive.<br /><br />I've always liked these guys, not only for their style of music, but because I love the songs, like the horror imagery, and they know how to deliver. Highly recommended.

B000NZD9RS|1.0|I hate to be a pariah here, but I absolutely despise this album. I didn't like it when it originally came out, and then every \\"classic\\" rock station in America played this stuff to death which made my opinion go down even further. I had no intention of writing a review of this thing, but my oldest daughter wanted a copy of this on CD, so I burned it from my vinyl copy and was kind of forced to listen to it. I can't like everything I listen to, so here is one of my very few bad reviews.<br /><br />This is essentially a Roger Waters solo project with supposedly (depending on who you ask) minimal participation from the rest of the band. Unfortunately, from Dark Side Of The Moon on, his influence dominated the Pink Floyd sound, and to my mind, not in a good way.<br /><br />If it weren't for classic rock radio, I might have felt good enough to give this two or three stars, but since I can recognize virtually any song on here with the two beginning notes, I know it too well.<br /><br />Besides the blandness of the music, I especially can't stand that twangy Fender guitar sound. The biggest example is that guitar solo on The Wall. I greatly admire Dave Gilmour as a guitarist. He absolutely blew me away with One Of These Days off the Meddle album. His work on Ummagumma is also top notch. However, this... to be polite, stuff, just makes me cringe.<br /><br />I wish Pink Floyd had stayed with their earlier style as it is much more to my liking. However, they had to change, expand, do something different, I guess.<br /><br />As for being a theme album, this doesn't hold a candle to Tommy. At least The Who still rocks!<br /><br />I'll probably have tons of hate mail over this, but to those few of you out there that know what I'm talking about, you are likely the same ones that love Umagumma, Meddle, and the Syd Barrett years. I don't even have to recommend or not recommend this as all you have to do is turn on your radio to a classic rock station, and you'll hear these songs over and over and over again. Save your money for something the radio doesn't play, because I'll guarantee that there is a whole world of wonderful music that will never make it to the air waves.something the radio doesn't play, because I'll guarantee that there is a whole world of wonderful music that will never make it to the air waves.
B000002UAF|5.0|You're probably thinking I'm saying pop as a bad thing, but it's a great thing.  Pop is basically short, accessible, catchy songs, under five minutes, but usually under three minutes.<br /><br />This is the one album that's a complete Lennon/McCartney album, and it's the closest that the two of them worked together.  Ringo doesn't do any singing, for all of you fans of the most popular Beatle, and the song that George sings was written by John and Paul.<br /><br />The complaint that I have, which in Roger McGuinn's book would be a huge plus, is that the guitar George uses is his Rickenbacker 360/12, instead of his Gretsch.  There is a major difference in sounds between those guitars.  The Rickenbacker would play two notes at once because it was a twelve string (on a twelve string each string is doubled, and one of the strings is either tuned in unison or an octave up).  The Gretsch guitar sounds more like a standard guitar.  It does, however, give this album a very distinctive sound because on all of the other albums, George uses a six string.<br /><br />The songs were great pop songs.  To be honest, if I had to pick a favorite, I would maybe say Abbey Road, which shaped the progressive rock music scene that bands like Yes, Pink Floyd, and Genesis really perfected.  However, A Hard Day's Night is a wonderful album, and the songs are just great songs.  Although it's not as influential as Sgt. Pepper, it has a bunch of great pop songs, and the closest collaborating the Beatles had ever done.

B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Some reviewers and fans of the Bond films have complained that this film is a lesser effort in the series and pales in comparison to \\"Casino Royale\\". They have missed something important in their assessment of the film. When Dominic Green says to Bond that he and Camille Montez have something in common, that they are both \\"Damaged goods\\" he has clearly put before the audience the crux of the film that is \\"Quantum of Solace\\".<br />The film picks up only minutes after the end of \\"Casino Royale\\" and we are presented with a very damaged and changed James Bond. As revealed in the first film by Vesper Lynd's assessment of him upon their first meeting on the train, James Bond is a man who came up from humble beginnings and was given a privileged education but never allowed to forget his low origins. This has made him a very guarded loner with a chip on his shoulder, a perfect candidate for recruitment by MI6. In his words to her later on in the film, Vesper has \\"stripped me of my armor.\\" But by the end of that film he is a man scarred by the death of his love, the armor is back on never to be penetrated again. He is now becoming the Bond of legend and a man bent on revenge.<br />So in \\"Quantum\\" there is no reason for the old fashioned quips or much humor in this man. Yet if you pay attention the character of James Bond as played by the incomparable Daniel Craig he lets us see that there are cracks in the armor. Something of a human heart still exists in him. This is played out in the scene after the plane crash where Camille asks him about his past. Craig shows it in his eyes in the most marvelous example of his layered and subtle acting style. Craig builds and molds a deeper, darker more complex Bond than we have ever seen before, a character more true to the books than in previous incarnations of Bond.<br />The action in the film is superlative and stylish. The opening car chase is indeed a nail biter only surpassed by the Sienna chase moments later. This too is then topped by the DC10 aerial battle towards the end of the film. The stunts are breathtaking and propel the film at top notch speed. But perhaps the most stunning and original sequence is the gun fight in the restaurant at the Opera house. This is played without sound effect as the score of \\"Tosca\\" commands the ear and heightens the emotion of the scene. This is inspired and brilliant film making taking in account all aspects of editing, cinematography, score, and acting. And since I mentioned music I cannot leave out the incredible delicious score by David Arnold who has infused his Bond scores with the much need taste of John Barry. He captures the glorious Barry sound and builds brilliantly upon it.<br />All the principle players give superlative performances. Judi Dench command attention as she always has as \\"M\\". Giancarlo Giannini redeems himself and is truly touching as Mathis. Mathieu Amalic is appropriately slithery and devious as the villain Green. As Agent Fields, Miss Gemma Arterton brings a light and fun light to the film. Finally in the role of Camille Olga Kurylenko holds her own opposite Daniel Craig. This is no mean feat and she is wonderful, athletic and touching in the film.<br />In the end Bond does find a quantum of solace and ends the film in a telling way. A small gesture that lets us know he is now moving on but not without a tinge of sadness.

B001KL3GWM|3.0|This cd is mainstream radio friendly rock.The focus is on the vocals and songs not the guitar.Most the tunes are midtempo and none really standout.After a while they start to sound alike.I hope Dereks recent tour with Clapton hasnt turned him into another Clapton - that being a former guitar smoker mellowing into a more mainstream \\"artist\\" doing crap like Wonderful Tonight.Derek doesnt take any chances or break any new ground on this cd instead he sticks to Allman Brothers light.Theres no blues or jazz .When I buy a Derek Trucks  cd I want to hear his guitar wail not pop radio songs.With his talent ,hes among the best ,Im a bit disappointed.

B001DSNG1S|5.0|The first time I heard Judas Priest in Abilene, Texas in 79, I thought they were okay but more or less a ripoff of Black Sabbath. I came around to an entirely different opinion a few years later. These guys rock! They are the definition of NWOBHM.<br /><br />British Steel is probably their most popular album and I have to agree. I've heard some of the songs ad-nauseum on the radio, but I can take them better than many other bands. JP has a magic to their sound that rises above the crowd.<br /><br />My version of the LP does not have that last live track on it, so I'm judging it on the original. I have it on cassette and CD also, but like the sound of the LP the best.<br /><br />Breaking The Law is a classic all by itself. It reminds me of several things. First off is Beavis and Butthead \\"Scraping The Jaws.\\" An obscure reference, but it fits. Second, it reminds me of God with a Guitar, this totally obnoxious guitar player I knew in Spain in the 80's. This was one of his signature songs along with The Trooper.<br /><br />Then there is what I call the \\"Insurance Song.\\" I'm talking about United. It always reminds me of an insurance commercial.<br /><br />Whatever impressions I get off this, it holds the test of time. I haven't played it as much as they do on the radio, but it has been a staple for years. I just pulled it out again after a 10 year hiatus and it still sounds as good as ever.<br /><br />Though I have other equally favorite albums by JP, this one is essential if you want to key in on their sound. Highly recommended.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|Look, this album is really too good for words.<br /><br />Forget who did it. If you're at all musical, you'll like it. If you're expecting pre-packaged pre-digested consumable junk, you won't get it.<br /><br />For those of you who will get this, it's like the best XTC album Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding never wrote--and fresher too.
B000002I77|5.0|This has gone on to be a jazz-rock standard since it's first release...and rightfully so, I mean you have the late Tommy Bolin on guitar, Jan Hammer on keys and THE MAN on the kit. This fusion icon of an album is an absolute must for any fusion fan...but always keep in mind...when you hear the opening drum beat of Quadrant 4 remember that this beat was done way before Van Halen's Hot for Teacher and that THIS album was done.....in 1973...man, I'm old!

B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family and encourages creative thinking in the way it is developed. Although it is set in a time period that usually is hard for me to relate with, this movie has a charm that over reaches the normal period induced restrictive life styles. I really enjoy this movie and have watched it several times.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Well, the every one knows of the great debate over Daniel Craig's ability to portray the beloved James Bond. In my opinion, he's a great edition to the star studded Bond family. I like the new direction of the film, depicting Bond as an actual human being rather than a savvy super soldier who inexplicable dispatches armies of soldiers with utter prowess and icy calm. Now he's a discerning man with a plan and a heart, and he gets kicked around quite a bit.       Now, as to the actual quality of the blu ray, the presentation is top notch. The film quality is superb, and the special features are thoroughly entertaining. The discs themselves are even entertaining to look at. Do yourself a favor and buy this blu ray if you enjoyed the film, or if you are interested in finding out what the hooplah is all about. This is definitely a display blu ray that you can showcase to your friends as a reason to invest in the high definition era
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|[[ASIN:B0000DZ3IG Love Actually]]    I started watching the movie with low hopes and was happily surprised. It's great, so is the music that weaves it all together.

B001LF4IA6|5.0|WORKING ON A DREAM begins with a bang: pounding strings and growling vocals blare out the eight-minute western epic \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" one of Springsteen's career highs.  When the E Street Band finally kick in behind him, you are aware that you are in the presence of masters: Men and women who have spent their entire lives crafting brilliant rock and roll, who know the ends and outs of their respective instruments, and who aren't about to compromise one bit of musical integrity.<br /><br />That philosophy continues through the rest of DREAM.  It is, on the surface, a rather optimistic record; in fact, it takes some reading between the lines to see the sorrow lurking in the background, to realize that all this optimism is nothing but hope.  On \\"Life Itself,\\" Springsteen ponders: \\"Why do the things that we treasure most slip away in time?\\"  In \\"Good Eye,\\" he bemoans that \\"I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun.\\"  In \\"The Last Carnival,\\" the circus leaves town without its star.  In \\"The Wrestler,\\" we are left with the image of a one-legged man \\"tryin' to dance his way free.\\"  Even the opener, \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" ends ambiguously, with a Navajo maiden wondering where her lover is.<br /><br />Stylistically, DREAM carries on a theme that the Boss and company picked up on their previous record, MAGIC: modernizing sixties rock.  It's most noticeable on \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" and \\"This Life,\\" though there are flourishes of it everywhere you look.  The bluesy \\"Good Eye\\" (complete with blues harp, heavy panting, and distorted vocal) mines musical stylings even farther back in time.  And \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is the kind of country/folk shuffle that is, essentially, timeless.  Lyrically, the album isn't necessarily one of Springsteen's best; but then again, even the lyrics are often written to reflect an older style of pop/rock.  \\"Queen of the Supermarket,\\" for example, isn't anywhere near Springsteen's best; but it ends with a bang: \\"I turn back for a moment and catch a smile/That blows this whole f***ing place apart.\\"  The two closing numbers are among the Boss's better lyrical offerings; \\"The Last Carnival,\\" a sequel of sorts to 1973's \\"Wild Billy's Circus Story,\\" is an ode to the late Danny Federici, whose influence and memory is all over this record.  \\"The Wrestler,\\" a Golden Globe-winning tune (from the film of the same name), tells the tale of a down-and-outer who is only looking for a little recognition in life.<br /><br />WORKING ON A DREAM is the third album that Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band have released this decade (come to think of it, what with his Sessions Band releases, this was a very busy decade for the Boss); it's also the best of the three.  THE RISING suffered from a few far-reaching songs that went nowhere; the tunes on MAGIC, though strong individually, didn't seem to meld together as well as they could have.  WORKING ON A DREAM fixes the faults of its two predecessors.  It isn't a masterpiece, or even a classic (yet), but it is certainly a strong effort from one of rock and roll's greatest bands.hat blows this whole f***ing place apart.\\"  The two closing numbers are among the Boss's better lyrical offerings; \\"The Last Carnival,\\" a sequel of sorts to 1973's \\"Wild Billy's Circus Story,\\" is an ode to the late Danny Federici, whose influence and memory is all over this record.  \\"The Wrestler,\\" a Golden Globe-winning tune (from the film of the same name), tells the tale of a down-and-outer who is only looking for a little recognition in life.

I looked forward to another new CD released so close to Magic, but this CD is awful!! He sounds as if he is making the corny lyrics up as he goes along (and no, Queen of the Supermarket isn't the only song I am talking about). I've listened numerous times and out of the 13 tunes, 4-5 are listenable.  C'mon Boss!! Today I see a Greatest Hits that will be sold only at Walmart?  12 rehashed tunes?

B000GFLE1S|4.0|It seems that British cinema has fallen into a rut, at least where comedy is concerned: like numerous other films of the past decade, KINKY BOOTS combines a touch of mischief, a touch of sex, a lot of \\"lets feel good,\\" and a \\"let's root for the underdog\\" plot.  But although the formula has become as pedestrian and predictable as last year's high heels, KINKY BOOTS still shines in terms of performances, with Chiwetel Ejiofor leading the cast as a professional drag queen in search of footwear that won't break down in the middle of a nightclub act.<br /><br />Very, very, very loosely suggested by an English shoe factory that faced similar marketing woes and took a similar route, KINKY BOOTS is the tale of Charlie Price (Joel Edgerton), who unwillingly inherits a shoe factory and then discovers that it is on the verge of bankruptcy.  A trip to London leads him to a chance encounter with drag queen Lola (Ejiofor), who has no end of problem with footwear--an encounter that inspires Price to go into the niche market of women's style footwear for men.  Charlie and Lola join forces to design the new line, but needless to say things don't go as smoothly as they wish.  Charlie's bride-to-be opposes the whole thing; the factory workers aren't wild about having a drag queen in their midst; and both Charlie and Lola have personal issues to work through in the process.<br /><br />Although the concept is clever, the script is not: you can easily see around each and every bend and forecast every plot turn long before it arrives on the screen.  But the performances make the thing work.  As previously mentioned, the big noise here is Chiwetel Ejiofor, best known for such films as PRETTY DIRTY THINGS and AMERICAN GANGSTER, who puts over Lola in a major way: from stage act to factory floor, he is entirely believeable, extremely sympathetic, and often downright hilarious.  Edgerton is equally well cast as the conflicted factory owner, and the cast is well-rounded out by such memorable supporting players as Sarah Jane Potts, Jemima Rooper, and Stephen Marcus, to name but a few.<br /><br />When all is said and done, KINKY BOOTS is a charming film that is a shade too formula for its own good--but even so it is worth a look.  The DVD package includes two brief features, one on the factory that inspired the story and a standard \\"making of;\\" there is also a director and cast commentary.

B001G9F9IW|3.0|I have been a frequent visitor to Barcelona. It is one of my favorite cities. In this Woody Allen movie there are beautiful clear but all-too-brief shots of Barcelona and the surrounding area. The photography in Blu-Ray is crystalline and sharp filmed with bright sunlight in beautiful settings. The bright colors of the movie collide with the dim opacity of the script.<br /> The premise of the movie I did not believe for an instant. The acting is fine, but the story is ridiculous. Javier Bardem's character invites two young American women, brand new to Barcelona, to fly to a nearby village for the weekend so he can bed them. The women go, and one gets seduced there, and the other gets seduced on the return to the city.<br />It's an adult fairy tale with absurd situations. It's not strictly a romance nor is it a comedy, but it is farcical, laughable in the sense that anyone who believes such nonsense deserves this new Woody Allen posturing.<br /> When I failed to suspend my disbelief, I lost all interest in the plot and merely stayed with it for beautiful shots of the Catalan area. Vacuous well-off people were merely indulging themselves, and the viewer gets conned into a meaningless ride to nowhere.<br /> Critics in general liked it partly because Woody Allen was behind the camera, not in front of it. I hope his next annual outing will be more credible and less pretentious.

I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in photography.

0141439661|5.0|Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" concentrates upon life in the Dashwood family and the relationship of two sisters, particularly in reference to the amorous events in their lives transpiring over the course of a year or so.  The younger sister, Marianne, represents \\"sense,\\" as she views and lives life in a romantic, sensual, and dramatic manner, while Elinor, representing \\"sensibility,\\" is more reserved in her expressions of feeling, and her pragmatic, moral way of making decisions.  While treating one other, at times, with brutal honesty, attacking the other for who they are not, each eventually learns that there is a deep love between them.  Additionally, the sisters learn that there is something of value in the dominant characteristics of the other's personality, and this works to positive effect for the love lives of both as time passes.<br /><br />Austen paints a picture of early nineteenth century England, especially with a focus on the position of women, who were largely dependent on marriage for their survival.  Yet, in spite of this, Austen's characters hunger for their dreams, for love that does not compromise their existence merely to pragmatic ends.  In narrative terms, Austen's genius never fails to come through with unseen twists in plot and beautiful, moving dialogue that has been kept at bay to be delivered to the anxiously-waiting reader at just the right moment.

After the two spend the week driving in the country, de Winter proposes marriage to her at the moment of her leaving.  She accepts and they and make their way to a new life at de Winter's Cornish estate, Manderly.  But, very soon after arriving, the young woman realizes that filling the shoes of Maxim's former wife, \\"Rebecca,\\" will be a daunting task, both in that she has not been groomed in the world of riches, and that her husband may still be in love with his former wife, in spite of the fact that she is dead.<br /><br />The heroine in this classic novel is barely ever mentioned by name, except once she becomes \\"the new Mrs. De Winter,\\" thus suggesting her insignificance without his association.  Du Maurier's prose paints the anxious, tormented inner thoughts of the new wife of de Winter, who constantly feels inferior to her predecessor, and  the earlier wife's \\"presence\\" is keenly felt through her overpowering artifacts remaining at Manderly, as well as though the memories of those who knew her.  It is in the contrasting of  the \\"modest\\" new wife and the terribly confident and ever-popular Rebecca upon which the novel draws its tension, as well as through the withholding of the story's outcome until its final chapters.

0061120081|5.0|Lee's smart, elegant prose weaves between the charm of childhood with the disturbing realities of racism in the South in the 1930's.  An African American man, Tom Robinson, is falsely accused of raping a white woman and goes to trial. The crime, at the time, could potentially result in the death penalty for Tom; certainly, racist \\"mob-rule\\" to take Tom's life coexists with his trial proceedings.  A white man, the lawyer Atticus Finch, takes up Tom's case in the face of racist resistance and taunting.  A keenly felt subtext in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is how Finch's children and their friend soak in what is happening.     As \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961, its tension, suspense and address of racial issues were timely as it fell in the midst of The Civil Rights Movement.  Yet, its themes of racism, injustice, and the passing on of values to our children for the generations to come will be timeless and universal.  Lee's prose transports the reader into the worlds of all its characters - the lawyer, his children, the man on trial and his family, as well as Macomb's many racists - and its soft moralizing, so poetically and rightly put, touches any open heart.
0143038419|4.0|I absolutely adored this book. I found myself rooting for Liz. I felt like I was traveling and discovering life along with her. When I finished it, I really took a look at my life and thought about what I wanted. Great book!
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I love A&E movies, but this one is just so darn boring.  I've actually tried to watch it four or five times in the month that I've had it, but I'm never able to get more than 45 minutes in because it simply puts me to sleep!
B000HG73L6|1.0|It's a nice product and it's the same dimensions as BOSS pedals but I get a horrible buzz whenever I hook up my amps into it, so it's completely unusable.  Go with something else.
0307265730|5.0|This is a book of short stories, some of which are inter related.  Lahiri is so good at depicting what it's like to be in families, in relationships. There's compromise, pig headedness, hidden or displayed anger, suffering both long and short, isolation but most of<br />all love. What really stood out to me was how even subtle but sometimes big occurences between people who have formed strong bonds can change the trajectory of their lives, in positive or negative ways. The connection never dies. The love never dies. And it<br />influences all their subsequent relationships. The last 3 stories read like diaries or love letters between a couple whose lives interlock into early middle age. It's amazing how they influence one another. though probably through most of the relationship, they would<br />both deny that connection. Even people who chose NOT to relate to others, to step out of relationship, are still relating by that absence. They leave a whole int the others life by not communicating.  After a strong bond is forged there's no way NOT to impact the 'other'. One or both can turn their back on the connection but it's as if the connections lives on independent of behavior or choices. Also, not to be missed is Lahiri's lyrical use of metaphor. I'll be reading more of her.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|Ok review is from a fan from their earlier work. But like every band who changes direction and kind of sticks to its roots. This is a classical example if you listen to Tonight. The album is brilliant, starts of with Ulysses which is well mixed but bite hard, what she came for, live alone, and twilight omens are the top songs. Lucid dreams and cant stop moving are mixed and done nicely.  Dream again and Katherine kiss me are the perfect closing songs for FF album, not bad for an album that has Doppler effect, human elements and lots of synthesizer to improve the sound. At the end its a great album, well worth the wait.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's `Working On A Dream' - An album that seems to have been a missing link in many ways from his catalog.      Optimistic, yet brazenly honest.  Fun, yet hauntingly beautiful.  It's nothing short of the most sentimental and endearing record Bruce has ever made.  His vocal range is the best I have ever heard, hearkening back to the 'Born To Run' tonality and quality with his thunderous and textured style trademark, yet tempered and complimented with the best control he has ever displayed, like a smooth and mellow 20 year old Scotch. He really opens up in a more rounded way, by far the best he has sounded vocally since the 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town' album.      The essence of this record is really the dichotomy in all of the song's characters who strive for divine intervention all the while realizing their own vulnerability and contradiction as human beings.  No brainers if you already know that these are constant hallmarks of his music over the years. Yet, this record delivers in a way that was a risk for him at a time of so much cynicism within pop music. With widespread anxiety, uncertainty and heartache in the world today heightened by the economic and emotional crisis of the last 8 years for so many people, this record serves as a blanket of solace, and a word of encouragement for the listener. The songs as simple as they may be at times, help us transcend above our own realities with a touch of grace rarely found in other Springsteen records. Especially noteworthy for me are 'Kingdom of Days' (my favorite), 'This Life', 'Life Itself' and the title track from 'The Wrestler' a Tom Joad like epilogue that really hits home, as does the ode to Danny Federici in `The Last Carnival' that is very moving as well.   He even goes Beatlesque on us, with an unabashedly child like sing along in`Surprise, Surprise'. Yet, you don't care, because after all the dark roads, dusty highways and crucibles over the last 40 years,  this almost feels like a reprieve, so you love it, especially if you are cruising down PCH on a Saturday morning with the top down...     `Working On a Dream' also features two of the best romantic rockers of all time that should join the Springsteen canon in 'Lucky Day' and 'What Love Can Do'.  This is the most diverse record he has ever made, with the oily blues growl of 'Good Eye' which feels like an extension of the Magic Tour's rendition of `Reason To Believe', to `Outlaw Pete' the album's 7 plus minute opener with the main character's howling cry moaning \\"Can You Hear Me\\", which is as powerful as the story itself...almost like a penitent confessional...     Well done and bravo Mr. Springsteen, BRAVO! You have done it again! At 59 years of age, you have not lost your step at ALL!  Reader, you will NOT be disappointed, run to get this record...or better yet...err...click on this fine web site and order! In my Springsteen top 5 records of all time!
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I listen to this cd alot and sing along to it. This is a good cd just to get you moving and in a dancing mood.
B000002VSN|5.0|The CD works fine and arrived shortly after Christmas.  I was thrilled to get it and listen to it.  It plays great!
B000PTYPAC|5.0|A great Cd. I listen to it often, it gets you pumped up and ready to go.  I would recommend to anyone.
B000VZYXPC|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out, and is still being played today. I can listen to this thing on repeat and it never seems to get old.
B001J4E1D8|1.0|I hated this updated version, it's lackluster and the acting is unappealing and uninspired. If you want to see a screen version of Hardy's tragic love story, go see the 1998 A&E version with Justine Waddell as Tess and Oliver Milburn as Angel, they epitomized those roles for me. Oh yeah, and Jason Flemying as Alec was perfectly wicked in just the right amounts.
B00009QG73|5.0|I'm a huge Ferry and Roxy fan from \\"back in the day\\" and was almost worried to watch this DVD incase they'd lost their edge.  But no worries on that score!  Fabulous concert -- it took me back to the 70's and 80's. Great talent and Ferry is as gorgeous as ever.  My 20 year old sons also got a kick out of watching it -- it's not just a trip down memory lane for the original fans.  Very cool and well worth the $$ !!
B0014I4KH6|5.0|The product came with no problems, but it arrivied one week later than the date that was on the order form
B000V86OKG|5.0|I love watching Dexter. It's a little gruesome at times, so not recommended for children. Dexter is definitely unique for a serial killer, you seem to find compassion for him! He's a the bad guy, but yet he only kills the bad people  that you yourself would want to destroy! Great Show!
B00012QM86|5.0|The story of how one man, not even a \\"good\\" man, helped 1,100 survive the holocaust. Schindler had no intention of helping anyone at first. He was an opportunist, a womanizer and a Nazi sypathizer. Through a series of events he comes to grips with the horrors of what is being done to the Jewish people. While his awakening to the evil is somewhat slow, once he determines to act, he does so swiftly and definatly.     Parents should be strongly cautioned should due to violence and sexually explicit scenes.
B001F0VHEM|1.0|I still don't understand why people keep flocking to this idiot and her music. But oh well...
0439023483|4.0|For all of you who say this book is a ripoff, I must disagree. I thought the whole theme of this novel was very fasinating, for I am currently working on a book that has to do with a furture ruled by evil. I found the characters interesting to learn about; Katniss and Gale, Peeta, Rue and all the other tributes.     The Games are hardc ore and merciless-the brutality of the Capitol shocked me. How could they find watching innocent children die entertain? They sicken me; except for a few people in the Capitol like Cinna; I liked him very much.     My friend Amber talked about it at lunch one day, saying how great it was and all. I'd commented that Stephanie Meyer had posted on her website that she couldn't put it down (yeah, I'm a Twilight saga fan. Got a problem with that?). So anyway, I started reading it after buying it as a birthday present for myself, and at first I have to admit, I wasn't so sure I'd like it very much. But I did, just like I enjoyed Gregor the Overlander (though that is the only book I read in that series, much to my friend's, Colleen's, annoyance).
B000002P5W|5.0|Just 'Little Wing' makes it up for the whole CD. But in general it has no waste. Actually it's not the best of Jimi's studio recordings, but as a cult follower I gotta have all of them, so I don't mind. The other contents are very nice too (photos, texts...)
B00019GG1M|5.0|Yo. It's Mossmask again. How ya'll doing? Okay, so anyway, I remember when I first saw the band Evanescence, not live, but in one of their music videos. I was young and my mom was watching TV in her room. On the TV was Evanescence's music video for Bring Me to Life. I watched as the woman fell from the building and listened to the lyrics. My mom said she liked the song, and so, years later, there I was in my room on my computer, when I listened to Evanescence again. Long story short: I liked them and so I added them to my iPod.     Now, Evanescence is definitely punk, but there is some pop mixed in as well-kind of like Linkin Park, who I like to even though I agree that they are very screamo. And I wish people would quit saying that they're a poor excuse for a punk band because they are NOT!
0783229364|5.0|This movie is so great! A true 80's classic comedy with Michael J. Fox. The soundtrack to the movie is also awesome!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I don't think there is one song on here that i don't like.   I think the only thing that is missing is the song from the trailer, i love that one!!!
B0015DWLD0|5.0|This wonderful debut novel by Adiga is a heartwarming tale of India told in avery unique way.  I honestly didn0t expect to like this novel as I purchased it on the advice of a friend.  Little did I know I would finish it in less than a week and be upset that it was done.  Easy to read with a lead character you will love.
B001LRJH0K|3.0|I started out really liking this movie. I won't spoil it but dang... the middle (when they picked Renee back up) was a killer for me. From there on out, it just seemed to die and turn do something weird. Not a good weird either. My husband is a western man and loves them but he didn't really care for this movie either.    I would suggest Unforgiven over this movie anyday. But then again, almost any of the Clint westerns are far better than this movie was.
031606792X|1.0|the 1st book was perfect, the 2nd was quite ok even if most of the main characters were absent, the 3rd was annoying and this one was clearly disappointing... the final combat at the end ends up in no combat at all, the baby thing is just too much, it looks as though meyer was just trying to finish the book as fast as possible as if she did not know what to write... And why the hell did she bring Jacob Black into the saga so much?? And where is Alice, Bella's best friend?? And why bring in so many vampires in the end if they end up being useless cause their is no fight??  Well, I'll keep reading the first book but I'm just so disappointed that she did not keep up with the perfect love story and that Bella is so annoying that you end up wondering why Edward is still with her..
031606792X|5.0|This book came to me in EXCELLENT condition! What an awesome way to end the saga! I CRAVE MORE! Stephenie Meyers is still an awesome writer and does not disappoint her readers! For any true Twilight Saga fan, this book is a must have!
1439102813|5.0|Brilliant novel about a 50 year old woman diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. This is the first novel I've read written from the standpoint of the patient as they sink into the abyss of this horrible disease. A fascinating and well researched read!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|It is one of the best and most fun movies in a long time. It's ABBA and Meryl Streep, need to say more??
0312360266|1.0|I started to read this book because Amazon suggested to me and like many other readers, the cover was intising.  From the get go, I couldn't stand the shallow characters.  The characters were stereotypical high school girls, but truly, not many high schoolers talk that way.  The writing was terrible and the structure of the book was obscure.  I gave it a shot, but after 75 pages, I stopped mid sentence because I just couldn't do it anymore.  The book was terrible.
1567184855|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. Sent it to my dad who also loved it. This book will change the way you look at life.
B001DHE9KG|5.0|The New York Met exceeded my expectation in this production of La Boheme.  I now have three versions, and this HD version tops the list.  The staging and acting were equal to the singing.  It all came together in something very pleasant to experience.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|Order the Blu-ray from Amazon UK.  You can use your same account information and the sight is identical to the US site.  It came UPS from Britain in three days.  The menus on the British Blu-ray are a bit different from the US format but aside from that:  The picture is spectacular and flawless with very well done sound.  The current US ordinary DVD is pure garbage compared to the Blu-ray.  This is one upgrade that is well worth the expense.         www.amazon.co.uk/
0375842209|5.0|It's always a bit surprising how different the stories of people in Nazi Germany are. Most of us usually read books from the point of view of Jews. But in this very creative novel we read from the point of view of death. It's very entertaining, and honest. Zusak writes through emotions masterfully, and gives us all a new appreciation for life. At times paralyzing, I was not able to put this book down. The integration of German words also lent the book an extra zest.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Tricky to rate a Bond movie for all the opinions out there for what a Bond movie should be. Ever since CASINO ROYALE (the DANIEL CRAIG version), I've been interested in the New James Bond as I like to call him. I fully understand the loyalty by fans to all of the previous 007 outings. However since the restructuring of the franchise in 2006, I find the character traits given to Craig's secret agent are way more compelling than the tired old 'who's the best Bond?'. This review is (as all of my reviews are) based solely on my outlook of a biased cinematical viewpoint. That viewpoint is this; all Bonds before Craig are somewhat the same.   Purists scoff.   Fans sneer.   S'okay.   Say what you will, but I've never, in any previous BOND flick, FELT Bond's motivation until the last 3/4 of CASINO ROYALE. QUANTUM is no different. Only when Craig's 007 says that there was nothing emotional betwixt Vespa and himself to M when this film kicks off, you realise how much there was for HIM with Vespa. He blames himself for her death. Giving Craig's Bond a dimension only merely mentioned in previous BOND outings. They have re-invented this character, people, Q ain't showing up.   The action in this movie is relentless. The stunts are excellent. In the first half hour there are four sequences worthy of climactic battle in most big screen pics. There is very little story, however the machine that QUANTUM is, it's not needed. I thought the action was well lensed and intense. JASON BORNE is not as cool, nor filmed with the ferocity, as Craig's Bond by a long shot. As far as I'm concerned, Craig IS Bond. All memory has been wiped of what were decent, if cheesy, movies.   This is different. This is new. And I love it.   It would be easy to watch CASINO and QUANTUM back to back. They flow right together. The continuation is another plus to Bond's new feel.   QUANATUM OF SOLACE is a necessary installment of the new Bond. Wrapping up a story line in the series and paving the way for many interesting new adventures, Bond truly finds, at the finale of the film, a quantum of solace.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|If you like the Terminator genre then you should love this series. It is very hard to watch one episode, always leaves you wondering what will happen next.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It was a great book. I really liked how Jacob and Bella were still able to be together and that jacob saw Bella as a friend. It was great that Bella became a vampire to be with edward. The only thing that i didnt like was the name! Renesmee? what kind of name is that?
1878424777|5.0|What a life changing pleasure it has been to incorporate THE FOUR AGREEMENTS into my own life. I have purchased this CD for many family members and close friends who all agree...its life changing and wonderful to be freed from other people's negative rules, unnecessary boundaries and limiting behaviors.  I read the book, but much prefer listening to Peter Coyote narrate on the CD...it's probably time to order more copies and pass this great information on to others.
B0011V7P0A|4.0|I had not owned any Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers albums but I recently saw a very well done biography on them on the Sundance channel.  I decided to buy this album because I recognized all of their songs that I knew and enjoyed over the last 20 years.  Tom was quoted as saying that he resisted the Greatest Hits concept but I really enjoyed the compilation of these songs.  Some bands are popular for 4 or 5 years and put out 5 or 6 albums that are played to death and then you have heard everything they have to offer.  Petty and his band seemed to have staying power and rather than release several albums in a row, they put out at a much more measured pace.  You can hear them mature and you can hear a generation's musical tastes evolve through the last 20+ years.  If you don't have a lot of Tom Petty buy this album.  You will be glad you did.
B001G1ACVY|5.0|Jason Mraz has really outdone himself on this latest CD/DVD collection.  After seeing him in concert, I can feel like I'm re-living the moments when watching this DVD.  He's so unbelievably talented, along with his band members, and his concert DVD shows his sense of humor and style so well.  I think he's fast becoming something really BIG!  This collection of songs is his BEST!
B001LRJH0U|1.0|Having lived on a ranch in Montana I will say that outside of the sets and props this movie depicts another urban fantasy on western/cowboy life. The movie consisted of a sequence of stitched together themes and characterizations taken from old school western movies: (a.) Sheriff & partner wander from town to town for hire. (b.) Towns are being victimized by bad guy rancher. (c.) Sheriff falls for local beauty. (d.) Sheriff/partner kill bad rancher. (e.) Sheriff settles down.   What rescues the movie is the silence between the cliched one-liners to allow one to appreciate the good photography.
B000002OVJ|3.0|My reasoning behind giving the almighty Live at Leeds an average rating has to mainly do with my dislike of the song choices.  If you like the songs that are featured here, most likely you will be satisfied with this live Who experience.      For me though, many of these songs are good in their studio versions, but not really the kind of songs I ever feel like hearing in a live setting.  I think that's my main problem with the album.      Oh sure, some of these songs are improved, and even stretched out quite a bit, but for the most part, I'm happy enough with the studio versions.  The remastered version DOES sound a lot better though, so that's a good thing.  It's still not THAT great of a sound though.  I've heard better (even from the Who themselves).
B000MV90IU|4.0|Just a quick double thought added to the plethora of comments so far, good or bad. The movie was NOT filmed in 2.40:1, as both Amazon and - absurdly -the blu-ray case itself states, but in 1.85:1, a considerable difference! Also, if during the \\"celebrated\\" car chase I see that green Volkswagon Beetle one more time in the hill scenes part of the chase, I'm gonna throwup!
B00006I53S|3.0|This lens came with my 40D and is probably one of the better kit lenses. It features \\"IS\\" which is very useful for low light situations. One of the things I don't like about this lens is the fact that it doesn't have a fixed aperture. The aperture increases as you zoom out, which is a real bummer. Another weakness is the image quality. Images are not very sharp in my opinion and saturation/contrast is so-so. If your looking for a starter lens, then this is a lens you might consider. It's light and pretty reasonably priced for a lens having \\"IS\\"!!
1600240003|4.0|This is a great book to get on CD. It does have one small problem.  At the end of every chapter they play music.  I found the music got in the way of enjoying the last few lines of each chapter.  I also kept thinking it was time to change CDs.     However, the voices were great and it is a book you can get into within mins.
1592332803|5.0|This cookbook is excellent. It has great dessert recipes as well as breads, breakfast items and more. I especially like it because most recipes are normal baked goods, just veganized! This is what I was looking for because I did not want to start out with vegan baking with especially unique or difficult recipes, I just wanted to know how to make my favorite baked goods in a vegan way!
0810970686|5.0|I love these books! I have two boys ages 11 and 9. They hated to read, let me stress HATED, until these books came along! Now they have both read all three and actually go to the book section instead of the toys! We found out the release date for The Last Straw and I thought they would have a breakdown waiting!! These books are hilarious and have great drawings. They're great for kids and adults alike! I hope Jeff Kinney keeps 'em coming!!
045122499X|5.0|==== Reading it again 2 years later:<br />The great team of character-types from Pillars of the Earth jump out of the pages again. A great story can always be told again and again. This time Ken Follett tells this classic story with even better plot twists and characterization. I thoroughly enjoyed reliving the great moments in this book as I reread it.<br />==== Original comments:<br />I LOVED Pillars of the Earth and World Without End is right up there as another classic book in the English Language. I just finished reading Chapter 42 (Witch trial of Caris) and that sums up how great a writer Ken Follett has become.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|It's been 2 and a half years since we last had an album from the Jacksonville' FL group known as Shinedown, and they return with a better album than their last one, and one that almost equals their classic debut \\"Us and Them\\".  Like the other two albums they have put out it's rather short, around 42 minutes and 11 songs, but it is also a very good album, with 9 of the 11 songs being good ones, a few being real good, and 2 of them I'd say are ok.  Like always, they do not disappoint and this would be an album I'd recommend picking up.    #1 - 7.5  #2 - 8  #3 - 9  #4 - 8  #5 - 8.5  #6 - 9  #7 - 8.5  #8 - 8  #9 - 8  #10 - 8  #11 - 7
B000XUUQQK|3.0|Okay, this was an impulse buy I must admit. I have a loyalty to filmmakers I like and Ghost House is headed up by two of my favs, Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi, so without saying I give them a tiny bit more slack. Which unfortunately lead me to theatrical viewing of the first Boogeyman and The Messengers, two totally underwhelming, unscary, unoriginal and just plain ineffective horror films, in The Messengers case it was all of the above until the conclusion where I got the added bonus of it being completely idiotic and predicatable. Anyway, I had seen the trailers for this flick and saw that it was in a different tone and that it was direct to DVD, which usually means it could be more risky and not really be close to what the original was.<br /><br />Low and behold I got a slasher movie. A real one. Old fashioned, not jokey, no self-references and filled with some brutal violence. Some of the violence is brutal just for the sake of gore but some of it works in getting under you skin(literally in one scene involving maggots).<br /><br />This is no great film, mind you. I can only slightly recommend it to folks who already like slasher films and will enjoy any slasher on some level(Yes, I'm talking to you, all you Happy Birthday To Me fans). This film is good enough for what it intended to do. I commend it for not having too many redicules jump scares involving cats, birds, or friends creeping in from the left or right of the frame. The director holds back on certain early scenes and makes the ultra violence towards the end more effective. Also, I must commend the acting. It's pretty good and the young and older actors give the characters some depth that probably wasn't on the page. I was shocked. These direct to video/sequel/teen-slice 'em ups rarely ever have competent acting, let alone a group of unknowns. No problems there, for once.<br /><br />My main gripes with the flick are of two schools: some of the gore was just showy and ineffective, and the reveal of the killer is totally predictable within the first fifteen minutes, though they do throw in some red herrings here and there, one of which was the great and now cult famous Tobin Bell. *SPOILERS* Slasher films are famous for having surprise guest killers under their chosen masks and this one is no different. The problem is the second you meet the main character's brother and he's being released from the fear clinic you know that most likely he is the new Boogeyman, as it were, and he is one because his childhood fear of the Boogeyman made him that way. On the plus side, the actor playing the brother is so good, and he has no corny grandiose 'the cat's outta the bag' killer speeches at the end when he's revealed. A little predictable, but done well.<br /><br />Finally, I'm no prude when it comes to gore, but I'm also aware of how gore can be used effectively and how it can't. This film has a couple real squirmers in the gore department, but then it overdoes it and it's less effective in the film, and more of a show case for some good and gross effects. The opening scene is a good example of this. When the two main characters witness their father's death we see him being stabbed through a dollhouse window, but then we see his actual intestines fall out. Not necessary and takes some of the impact out of the scene. More mood and sound effects and utter shock coming from the little girl would've been better. There's one more scene like this involving a heart. It all just feels like good effects and not-so-good story telling.<br /><br />Check it out, but if you actually liked the original Boogeyman(until I looked on this site I had no clue such people existed) you might not like this one. It's in a different genre. It's not supernatural and it's fairly brutal. The main difference between the films is that Boogeyman failed its supernatural genre, and Boogeyman 2 lives up to it's slasher genre's bretheren. Just wish it has a pinch more originality...able within the first fifteen minutes, though they do throw in some red herrings here and there, one of which was the great and now cult famous Tobin Bell. *SPOILERS* Slasher films are famous for having surprise guest killers under their chosen masks and this one is no different. The problem is the second you meet the main character's brother and he's being released from the fear clinic you know that most likely he is the new Boogeyman, as it were, and he is one because his childhood fear of the Boogeyman made him that way. On the plus side, the actor playing the brother is so good, and he has no corny grandiose 'the cat's outta the bag' killer speeches at the end when he's revealed. A little predictable, but done well.     Finally, I'm no prude when it comes to gore, but I'm also aware of how gore can be used effectively and how it can't. This film has a couple real squirmers in the gore department, but then it overdoes it and it's less effective in the film, and more of a show case for some good and gross effects. The opening scene is a good example of this. When the two main characters witness their father's death we see him being stabbed through a dollhouse window, but then we see his actual intestines fall out. Not necessary and takes some of the impact out of the scene. More mood and sound effects and utter shock coming from the little girl would've been better. There's one more scene like this involving a heart. It all just feels like good effects and not-so-good story telling.     Check it out, but if you actually liked the original Boogeyman(until I looked on this site I had no clue such people existed) you might not like this one. It's in a different genre. It's not supernatural and it's fairly brutal. The main difference between the films is that Boogeyman failed its supernatural genre, and Boogeyman 2 lives up to it's slasher genre's bretheren. Just wish it has a pinch more originality...
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Petrucci is respected for his variety of guitar styles and skills. One of the most notable of these is his high speed alternate picking which, as he himself claims, requires a \\"strong sense of synchronization between the two [playing] hands.\\"[4] He has performed alongside Joe Satriani and Steve Vai on their annual G3 tour 6 times. Guitar magazines and fans worldwide consistently vote Petrucci as one of the world's finest guitar players.[5] He has been labeled as a virtuoso on some fansites and webzines, including Sputnikmusic[6], and TheFunkyGibbons [1], among others.Mike's long list of Awards include 24 Modern Drummer Magazine Reader's Poll Awards including: 2004 Hall of Fame Inductee, Best Progressive Rock Drummer (12 years in a row!!), Best Clinician (twice), Best Educational Video/DVD for Liquid Drum Theater, and Best Recorded Performance of the Year (6 times) for Dream Theater's Awake, A Change of Seasons, Falling Into Infinity, Scenes From A Memory, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Score,making chaos the best drum work yet wow keep it up
B0000019P9|5.0|As a lover of independent music, or at least more obscure music with that certain, peculiar, je ne sais quoi, I fell in love with this incredible, surreal tale.  Closely paralleling the diary of Anne Frank, amazing dissonance and feedback with a gritty sound is coupled with head scratching lyrics that will leave you awe inspired.  The ballads on this album are also phenomenal.  Of course, if you are here, it is likely you have heard at least a bit of this album; on vinyl, for the purist, it is the ultimate iteration.  Best played with a slightly dirty needle.
B00007KLJJ|5.0|Great story and good actors.Well done.  Movie that you can watch more than once or twice...
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Having seen this movie at the theater 5 times I knew I just had to have the disk.    What makes it so much better is the second disk with all the info about how the movie was made and especially the interviews with the stars.   One of my favorite movies in the last several years.  One problem I did have was did not receive the DVD's when scheduled and had to call and have them send another 3 copies.   The first ones never did turn up so don't know if they were sent at all.   I even put my order in long before the movie was released.   This is the only time I have had trouble with Amazon and of course it had to happen with the movie I wanted the most.   I guess thats Murphy's Law.  Sheila Shoun
B0013D8LCW|5.0|The casting and the performance were well executed in Shelter.  Too bad we don't see movies like this in the mainstream but it's getting better -- but never enough. I enjoyed the locations.  The scenery conveyed a cold and lonely environment.    Trevor Wright is perfect for this role.  Brad Rowe is a sincere and sympathetic character.  You really get sense of how much he loved Zach and most importantly respected his choices. The script, the locations and the actors are incredible! I recommend it.    Brad Rowe's fans ought to check out this documentary titled My Big Break, if you haven't yet.  It's about his life and was quite surprising to watch.  He is an interesting guy who has definitely had to deal with a lot in his own life.  See it if you haven't yet and watch Shelter.
031606792X|2.0|Oh my god!! I was really excited to begin this book and find out whether or not Bella would become a vampire, end up with Edward etc. From the very first chapter of this book I had a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). The characters seemed much more shallow to begin with and Bella came across as angry and ungrateful. To begin with, there was so much emphasis placed on the expensive things that Bella was able to acquire by entering into her new life with Edward. I would have much rather read about her though processes (something that was very much a part of Tighlight and New Moon). Everybody fussed over Bella and wanted to make the transition into married life as easy as possible for her and she was always complaining. And what was up with Jacob? She seemed to want both of them and for a while I was wondering if Jacob would be her man on the side cause she just would not stop stringing him along. This was all in the first 300 pages or so. the remaining 400 or so could have been condensed into like...100. Seriously.       I thought it was interesting to see things from Jacob's perspective but in the end I dont know why that part was so essential to the text. Lets not even get into the fact that we are supposed to belive that Bella's half human half vampire child is the reason why he was in love with Bella in the first place. Everything after Jacob's section was horribly thought out and horribly written. After reading three other books about Bella and the Cullens I am dissapointed to see that not much thought went into the ending of the series. The Volturi are that easily able to back down? Bella serves as a shield? Interesting but that could have been better developed (take out all the wasted words about diamonds, clothing, cottages, Edward's beauty etc and there would have been 200 extra pages to actually develop the story). Stphenie Meyer must have had a deadline hanging over her head because this book did not seem to be well thought out and her characters were so one dimensional. I was expecting so much more from this final book. Hmmph!
B000GDH9JQ|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A strange and ultimately unsustainable marraige of Cold War thriller and dance movie, White Nights features some very impressive dance scenes and a spectacular plane crash, but never is able to sustain the high level of believability necessary to make its genre-fusion palatable.
1400097029|5.0|Don't read this review if you don't want to ruin the surprise ending because I'm going to give part of it away. If you're at all like me, you may find it preferable to know, to know more than what the jacket cover reveals, that there was a death in the narrator's childhood that he revisits in memory as an old man. At the end of the book the narrator relates the sudden double death of twin children.  And he reveals the true identity of Miss V, their former governess, now the narrator's landlady, which the narrator, otherwise forthcoming, keeps from his audience. Instead of being surprised at the ending, I would have preferred to have been given careful and haunting hints that would have allowed me to vaguely and unconsciously guess at what was coming.  I imagine the overall experience of reading this book will  be improved on a second reading now that the end is already in view.<br /><br />Banville's The Sea is a wonderfully written story that would be story enough without the shocking surprise.  I don't know what the function of the surprises is, aesthetically I mean. The deaths themselves reinforce the notion that even in (or especially in?) Arcadia, Death is usually found lurking. But the surprise of the deaths just jolted me and made me sad, unnecessarily, and the revelation of pointlessly hidden identity made me feel tricked.  I don't know why a good captivating story should be defined by an event that comes without warning. The opposite seems truer to me. In a story, events are presaged, somehow, in retrospect.<br /><br />I suppose Banville, who as his alter ego is a writer of thrillers and mysteries, has a fondness for that genre's plot line.  For me, The Sea is the very heart of the genre of literary fiction, which has very little use for such plots. The real power of the book, I feel lies elsewhere.<br /><br />The writing is lovely, on every page.  This is what literature should be. But I find most works these days calling themselves literary fiction don't even come close to what Banville seems to do effortlessly. Once I got over the confusion of the ending, I went back to mull over what I really love about this book and I am grateful to Banville for having written it.  There is so little out there worth the time.  First I loved existing in the mind of this narrator, an authentic and enlightening experience.  Novels ought to do this to us, for us, teach what it's like to be someone else, bestow on us greater powers of empathy. I didn't always like the narrator, Max (his hypersensitivity to odors, his cruelty to dogs and his insensitivity to his parents), but I understood what it was to be him and that's the point.<br /><br />Max is grieving his wife's death, and wondering what death means in general. He meditates on the way in which people live on in the memories of those left behind, a consoling thought, until he adds that once those people die there is a second death of the first. The next offered solution to the perennially undefined dilemma of being human is successful self-expression. There is a universal desire to be known to another, that, if one could achieve it, would satisfy and make a life seem as if it had done something, done the thing it set out to do at last. Max admits, \\"I do not entertain the possibility of an afterlife, or any deity capable of offering it. Given the world he created, it would be an impiety against God to believe in him. No, what I am looking forward to is a moment of earthly expression. That is it, that is it exactly: I shall be expressed, totally. I shall be delivered, like a noble closing speech. I shall be, in a word, said.\\" As a writer I am wholly sympathetic to Max's (Banville's?) ultimate desire.<br /><br />It's important to note that this raising of self-expression as the highest attainable good comes after a description of the fall, when Max falls in love with Chloe (one of the twins), his other.  \\"She was I believe the true origin in me of self-consciousness. Before, there had been one thing and I was part of it, now there was me and all that was not me. But here too there is a torsion, a kink of complexity. In severing me from the world and making me realize myself in being thus severed, she expelled me from that sense of the immanence of all things, the all things that had included me, in which up to then I had dwelt, in more of less blissful ignorance.\\"<br /><br />Sadly, we find that Max's relationship with his wife, as good as it gets as it was, lacked the kind of intimacy that would have reconnected him with another and the world.  They didn't know each other, not in that full way that would have been a good substitute for the \\"immortality\\" of being remembered.  They did not know each other in the way that a reader can when he or she shares the existence of a character in fiction. So I'm sad for Max in the end, but not too because he has been \\"said\\" in this book.<br /><br />Bravo Banville.  I did not need the shocking ending, but ultimately it did not distract from the beauty of this meditation on the meaning of completeness.<br />[...]of it, now there was me and all that was not me.

B0000AM6IY|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Dated, overlong, and poorly-acted, West Side Story features some nifty choreography but its plot is so irrelevent and ending so obvious that it's not exactly like there's a whole lot of suspense; if musicals are your thing you might want to watch it, but otherwise don't waste 150 minutes of your life.
B0011NVC98|1.0|I cannot believe they butchered the great poem Beowulf so horribly. It had nothing to do with the story at all except for the names of the characters. This movie was about a self-absorbed jerk who comes to save a loud kingdom from the pitiful Grendel, who has a seductress (seems to be 90% of Angelina Jolie's characters) mother. Beowulf, being the self-absorbed jerk he is, has a one-night stand with her, becomes king of the kingdom, kills the son he had with her in the lamest way possible, and then dies, leaving his buddy to screw Jolie's character and start the train over again. Boooooring! And so Hollywood typical! If you liked the actual story, you'll hate this. This movie butchered it. Oh, the animation was annoyingly awful too. If I could rate it 0 stars I would. Ew.
B00005JKG9|5.0|The Bottom Line:    An incisive look into the desperate lives of salesmen, Glengarry Glen Ross features standout performances from almost every member of the cast and is a sharp as a scalpel; marred only by the fact that the dialogue occasionally veers from colorful Mamet-speak into endless strings of profanities, Glengarry Glen Ross is a standout film.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|For the Rambo wanna be's in your life, it's a great gift. Stallone is a master in making these movies and staying in shape to make them. Mildly amusing for the under 20 set. Great addition to video library as they are classics, just like the Rambo series.
B000O1799U|3.0|The Bottom Line:    When it's at its best Dreamgirls is an aggessive and engaging musical, but too often it slides into slow scenes and uninteresting songs (We are a family/like a shining tree) while focusing on characters like Curtis (played by a thoroughly bored looking Jamie Foxx) that the audience doesn't care as much about; Dreamgirls is a mixed bag but I suggest you pass.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|Great gift for that burly guy in your life. Really funny set of movies for the rest of the world. Stallone is great in the movies. Rambo wanna be's will love it.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A movie about magic can NEVER cheat the audience, but this one does egregiously (please tell me how Edward Norton makes the King's sword stick into the stage, thank you very much); add in a terrible performance by the uneven Edward Norton and uninspired photography, and what you get is a movie that has no reason for existing.
B0010BFAOY|2.0|Thank you for allowing me to review my purchase. Because I viewed the movie before, I already know the movie is good. The one reason for purchasing it again. I had the DVD, it was stolen during a break in my home. At any rate, my opinion on the actual purchase process is very poor. I was not told this movie was a region 2 DVD and I would not be able to view the movie unless I owned a region free DVD player. Because I do not own a region free DVD player, I now have a $27.00 DVD I can't watch. I was fortunate to gain contact with the seller who advised that I should purchase a region free DVD player to view this movie.  I had already paid more than the movie was worth and now his only solution was that I buy an extra DVD player to view this one movie. I don't think so.  I then asked if I could return the movie in exchange for another movie. His response was he can not accept a movie that was opened. Amazing!!!! I guess the lesson learned is to pay more attention to who and where you buy product, you may not be able to use it!!!!!!<br />Thank you<br />A VIEW BLOCKED BY REGION 2
B000N6TX1I|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A suprising flop at the box office, Children of Men is a solid adventure story that gets a great deal of value out of its dystopic setting; it's not as profound a movie as some people have maintained, but it's very well-directed and consistently interesting.
B0019FUFM8|2.0|I like Morgan.  I like his movies.  But this one, frankly, stank.<br /><br />The plot was simple - father and son out to camp encounter an escapee hit man and take him prisoner as they try to return to civilization while avoiding the hitman's cronies, who (for the most part) are out to rescue their buddy.  It could've been a good movie. It SHOULD have been a good movie.  Unfortunately, it is poorly done.  There isn't enough plot to justify the length of the movie and something about it makes it seem very outdated - like you're watching a movie made ten or fifteen years ago.  It could've been improved with more exploration of the characters' situations, but that doesn't happen, either.  And the idea of the government agent giving instructions for Morgan's character to be killed, while surrounded by cops - yet nobody overhears her - would be laughable if it weren't so stupid.  I finished watching it, which is why it got two stars, but was sitting there most of the time wondering, \\"How much longer???\\" which is ALSO why it got two stars.  Very disappointing.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I saw this movie a few years ago, and I remember it very well. This is actually a very impressive thriller. It contains lots of high tension, severe gore, and clever plot twists. The actors have done splendid jobs, and the writing is crisp and not too complex. Music is also fantastic, and the cinematography is to die for. I give this an A.
B001FB55Y4|5.0|This another fantastic movie from a brilliant director.  He really got in touch with his roots on this one.  The plot and pace of the movie were very similar to Guy Ritchie's earlier work: Lock, Stock and Snatch.  If you didn't care for those two, don't bother with this one.    Character development is definitely Ritchie's strong suit.  Johnny Quid is the alternate universe equivalent to Sid Vicious if Nancy had never existed.    Something that never lacks in a Ska film is the Soundtrack.  My God! this is some great music!  Using the song Bank Robber by the Clash as Johnny Quid's theme music was dead on.  Hopefully this will be the movie to get Guy Ritchie out of movie jail.  Swept Away and Revolver were pretty damn bad.  Getting rid of the dead weight in his life has to have helped.

0786711647|5.0|I've always loved the film version of this novel, as I never read the novel.  Robert Wagner, Joanne Woodward, and Jeffrey Hunter were excellent in the film version, BUT WHEN I FINALLY READ THE NOVEL--the \\"book\\" really out did the film!  The only other novel written that was twice as good was Michael Critchon's 1993 thriller(?) I believe the film was titled, \\"RISING SUN\\", starring Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes, unfortunately, the film is not available anywhere(even Amazon)!  The endings of both books were almost identical and just as brutal.  Excellent versions of \\"noir\\" in the 1950's and the 1990's!!!
B001L5SXQG|5.0|this album is witty, creative, mature, and nostalgic. Bruce has not looked back, nor should he. Their should never be a reapeat ot classics like 'Born to Run.' Don't expect it here. The very first song Outlaw Pete is a modern day CLASSIC!! The rest of the album the E street band & Bruce hit their stride. This is a creative piece that stands alone, and also acknowledges the loss of E Street organist Danny Federici....RIP Danny!

B0009H1CKG|2.0|I have seen them live and they got busy, but this DVD doesn't compare to what I have seen. George Clinton is really high in this concert and it is affecting his performance. Plus, One Nation Under A Groove(One of my personal favs) wasn't on this. No offense to George, but I was not interested in seeing his granddaughter rap. She was good, but I wanted to see funk, not rap. P-Funk should have put a better DVD out.
0131479415|3.0|A methodology for estimating and planning in an agile environment is presented, but it is very limited.  In some cases the book raises issues with what is presented, and then ignores them.  Some examples:<br /><br />- Requirements are sized via \\"story points\\" based on complexity - the fact that a given number of points may take longer if it involves new technology is mentioned but not addressed.<br /><br />- In determining what stories can fit into an iteration, the book does not consider balance of functions (analyst, database developer, software developer, tester, etc.).  In fact the book goes as far as saying that stories/tasks should not be assigned in iteration planning, and that if a software developer has extra time, he could help with writing stored procedures or testing.  Also there is no mentioning of how to plan team composition, and/or whether the team should ever be augmented with contractors when certain functions have too much work.<br /><br />- In prioritizing, various models are suggested (financial and desirability), but does not present any way to combine the approaches.<br /><br />- In splitting stories, it is suggested to split into features versus tasks, but there is no mention of the added cost of having to redo more pieces of code (and more tests) more times.  Similarly, when editing code, the author recommends against addressing known bugs in the code!<br /><br />In summary, the book presents a methodology that evidently works well for some, yet has a fair number of holes.
B001GQACGO|4.0|This was a good CD I honestly thought that Bday Deluxe would not be outdone...but she did. I thought that songs like Diva, VideoPhone and Hello were great tracks.

159562015X|5.0|Obviously you must first know them.  Both SF1.0 and 2.0 do that very well.    Read the first [StrengthsFinder 1.0] and found out a lot about myself and my five core strengths.  Wanted to find out if I have changed/grown based on life experiences since the first one and to take advantage of new data incorporated in SF 2.0.    Guess what! My strengths have changed some.  I sure some is due to the additional research they did and the rest to the fact that I have changed.  I would highly recommend this if you are looking to find what your strengths are.  In today's job search world we all must figure out our key strengths and sell those strengths.  The analysis was spot on for me and makes it easier to craft a marketing statement that sells my strengths.
B000RZIGZ4|4.0|This movie about a young pilot who does not like authority and needs to clear his father's name as being reckless, works very well.    It is also exciting to watch with some breathtaking aerial scenes.    Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis head a cast of talented actors, including, Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards and Tom Skerritt.    Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. wrote a fast paced and intriguing screenplay based on a magazine article by Ehud Yonay    Tony Scott directs with verve and a clear vision.
B001ECQ75A|3.0|I heard a lot about this movie and I finally bought the widescreen version (again, I should have bought the regular version if there is one).    The movie needs some explanations on those animal martial arts warriors (for people without Chinese culture background). They actually represent branches of martial arts. However, it does not affect the content of the movie. Some of the Chinese name pronunciations need more practice (e.g., teacher (or shifu)).    The movie has one message, I believe, that one should believe oneself and the confidence can be used to pursue success.

0439806119|2.0|Biting the Sun (or Don't Bite the Sun)by Tanith Lee was published in 1999. It's a very similar premise, but the story is significantly more interesting and frankly, the writing is much better.
0425188809|3.0|My own bias, but I could not get past the hyper-intelligent dog premise that drives the book.  When the dog started reading books I simply could no longer suspend my disbelief and rolled my eyes in exasperation.  The idea of a golden retreiver sitting back on the couch with a good book was just too much.    Koontz achieves exactly what he wants to do in this book.  The characters are sympathetic and in need of change.  The villian is truly evil and relentless.  The climax is logical and emotional (sort of).      If you like Koontz other books, you'll probably enjoy this.  I know this is a very personal book for Koontz, who loves his dogs like children.  But a novel reading dog?  I just couldn't get past it.
1433502402|4.0|Let me begin with the negative bit: the translation. The ESV is nothing more than a doctored version of the RSV - the very version so scorned by our forebears. Second negative point: there Apocrypha has not been included. These books are essential for Anglicans and Lutherans. A Study Apocrypha is available from both Oxford and Cambridge in the NRSV version.  Now to the positive bit. This is a fantastic study bible as far as general content and layout are concerned.  No irritating red text in the NT! The notes are copious and are what you would expect from the religious right. Where scholars differ, the various views are given. But the outcome is patently obvious.  This Study Bible is far ahead of the (T)NIV Study Bible - too pushy and the NKJV Study Bible - too much speculation.  The editors have done a magnificent job of providing a mountain of information in a volume which is still very portable. The colour maps are great as are the various colour illustrations. It just goes to show what you can print on thin paper.  A good student of the bible will use various sources for study. The ESV Study Bible is an excellent addition to any personal library. The NRSV remains my translation of choice and I also make use of the New Oxford Annotated, the Harper Collins and the New Interpreter Study Bible.   I give the book 4 stars because of the translation - or better: the doctoring of an already excellent translation. By all means buy this Study Bible. And use it.

B001E95ZHY|1.0|Love me some Rainn Wilson, but this is excruciatingly bad. Literally one of the worst movies I have ever shut off after 45 minutes, up there with \\"The Wicker Man\\" in terms of filmic disasters. Like the icy winter wind, this blows. What the heck, Dwight, might as well strike while the iron is hot, huh? Wilson should thank his lucky stars that he is part of a superb sitcom, because this would've been a career killer otherwise.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my first Jillian Michaels DVD and after hearing so many great reviews on this, I had to buy and and boy was I not disappointed! There are three levels that get progressively harder. I'm only on level two at the moment, but I definitely feel better overall.     I'm a beginner when it comes to working out, and I love the fact that she explains all of the moves very clearly and that there's even a 'less impact' girl that you can watch if you're worried about joint pain or if you just can't do the big moves that the other girl is doing.     I love the fact that it goes through three essential work outs as well; Cardio; Strength Training; and Abs. You would have to buy three different DVD's to get the same workout that you get in 20 minutes with Jillian!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I think this movie was fantastic. And yes, there are a lot of differences between the Broadway musical and the movie. But the movie is not suppose to replace the Broadway show or prove that it is better. To me, it was made as an \\"addition\\" to the Broadway show. The show and the movie, both tell the story of \\"No Day But Today\\", just in different ways. And the movie is also a great way for the people who couldn't get to NY to bring Broadway into their homes. Also a side note: A lot of reviews that have rated this a 1 or 2 star(s) keep refering to the movie or the stage production as a \\"play\\". Although they may just be using the wrong terminology, it seems to me that the people who can't decipher between a \\"play\\" and a \\"musical\\" don't know what they are talking about in the first place.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Keeping it short, but I rarely have come across an album that so instantly becomes a favorite, like this one. Excellent harmonies and MUSIC, no self-serving garbage common to a lot of modern music. Surprised that this goodness can still find its way to mainstream publishing, but than heaven for it.    Like a lot of people, I'm guessing, was first exposed to them recently on SNL, and after three listens to the complete album, I am digging it-- looking forward to getting more familiar with each of the songs, and with this interesting band.

0743297334|4.0|It seems that most people read these books as a part of high school. I never read anything until a year ago when I picked up a copy of The Old Man and the Sea, which I liked. This year a friend of mine was sent ten copies of this by the publisher as a gift. Who am I to refuse?<br /><br />Hemingway, I think, is one of our national treasures for a number of reasons. Obviously, his sense of journalistic integrity helped him become the novelist that he is. But this book isn't just good because of the style. Hemingway also has a knack for choosing to write about things that are inherently wrenching and interesting.<br /><br />The story, essentially about a man castrated by the war and his doomed half-love for a slutty, spoiled ex-girlfriend, is backgrounded by a vacation in Spain, where Jake, the main character, and his friends go fishing before the fiesta of the running of the bulls. The drama behind this intimate almost-love-affair is what really puts this book over the top and where it becomes a masterpiece. The descriptions of Spain, of water, of simple pleasures, of bullfighting, of eating, of getting drunk, of fighting, of swimming, are almost grotesquely beautiful; they will turn your heart over.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, however, it's clear that Hemingway made an intelligent, clear stance. He's not just a writer, he's a master; and his writing style is one that he chose because he understood both that he was gifted with an incomparable grace and how to manage its effects to their most extreme. To quote him:<br /><br />\\"She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bullfighters used to make it look as theough they were working closely . . . Romero's bullfighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of the line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness . . . Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing.\\"maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing.\\"

I figured the Seiko works very well, it was inexpensive (177.00) and I have owned several Seikos.and they all worked very well. A new Seiko is a far better buy compared with the rip off Breitling. I get a much much cheaper watch, Breitlings go from around 3000 to 6 figures. I love this watch and am very happy I purchased it. To me it's a beauty..............................
B000244FDW|5.0|This relatively old version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" holds up excellently.  While I also like the newer versions of Jane Austen's most famous novel, I think the 1980 version is a superb adaptation.  First, this version is very faithful to the book, in details and in spirit.  Second, the acting is terrific without being overstated or flashy.  Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul are outstanding in their portrayals of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy respectively.<br /><br />I was also moved by one subplot in particular, the film's sensitive and insightful depiction of Elizabeth Bennet's parents.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are unsuited for each other in interests and temperament.  Their lack of marital harmony is the dark undercurrent to their family life.  Mr. Bennet's bitterness, indifference and cynicism have caused him to neglect his daughters' upbringing, care and protection, as well as the potential improvement of his wife.  Mrs. Bennet's frivolous vanity and lack of moral depth have rubbed off on some of her daughters.  Yet despite these grave disappointments and failures, the Bennets still maintain their family unit and their family loyalty.  The price was high for both of them, but the results were also impressive.<br /><br />On the negative side the cinematography cannot compare to later versions.  The film, originally produced for British and Australian television, has the washed out look characteristic of television shot on leaner budgets.  One sees the same look in many other British television productions of the 70s and 80s.<br /><br />But this detracts not at all from the excellent screenplay, the attention to detail, the film's reserve and repudiation of trendy innovation and revisionism, and its faithfulness to the original story.  Unfortunately too many screenwriters, directors and actors feel they can use classical literature and a historical setting to project their own views and ideologies.  This at times may be interesting artistically, but usually twists or ruins the meaning of the original story and distorts history.  Even filmmakers who have no ambitious personal statement to make in a film adaptation will often throw in touches of extra romance, sensuality, and suspense to make an old classic more attractive to a wider range of viewers.  Using film and television to faithfully adapt the classics is much richer and more satisfying, because the film medium benefits from the very qualities that made the written work a classic in the first place.<br /><br />I highly recommend the 1980 version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to anyone looking for a faithful and literary version of the classic and who will not be put off by the relative simplicity of the production.of the original story and distorts history.

B00139W3NE|1.0|This movie is not intended for children at least not mine, since it is about magic. There is nothing that is learned from it. As for the Narnia movie there is something that you learn from it. I do not recomend it for parents with children.

0684803356|2.0|I picked this book up a day after reading Catch-22, perhaps the most drawn out, most asinine ridiculous over rated book ever written, and For Whom the Bell Tolls is the second.      I found this novel silly, a glorified, and tamed sex novel one might find at the grocery store.  The love making scenes were ridiculous, what was this \\"thou, oh, oh thou oh oh oh\\" garbage?  It took me a week to get through this book, which from reading other bad reviews is pretty quick work of this novel.      This novel wasn't all bad, which is more than I can say for Catch Number 2 (that was not an error).  The three action packed scenes (The murder of the \\"fascists\\" at Pablo's town, Sordo's battle, and the blowing of the bridge) were actually pretty entertaining.  These were the fastest chapters of the book though they were the longest.  I did a little research on Hemingway and found that he had a minimalist style and liked verbs more than adjectives, and didn't like flowery language, I feel the man could have used an adjective or two to liven up this dull dead book.    Oh and watch out for that long drawn out paragraph that goes something like this \\"Now, all now, and now I say now all we have is now and then now this is now and now i what we have\\" that's pretty close to what he wrote and it continues with the \\"nows\\" Then there was the DIRECT translation of Spanish.  What was that all about?  \\"Less bad\\"?  That's \\"menos mal\\", which means literally less bad, but in English it sounds STUPID.  It's different when you read this book and are fluent in Spanish you see why the English is not less bad but all bad.  And what of the Thees and thous?  And Nays?  I get it, they were speaking archaic Spanish, one sentence at the beginning telling us that would have been sufficient, now I have to feel like I'm reading a 15th century novel.  The whole Robert Jordan thing was also annoying, just call him Bob or Robert or Jordan.  Lastly, what's with te glorification of communists?  The book is supposed to be about the death of idealism, but I saw none of that.
1584233494|5.0|This version (20th Anniversary Edition)of Supply and Demand is simply put...just amazing.  One sees the growth of Shepard's work from the previous edition (2006) until now.  There is plenty of the Obama stuff which made me first take notice of this \\"underground\\" street artist. And...in the same way that Picasso's work came to dominate the first half of the 20th century and Warhol's the second, Shepard's work will come to dominate the first half of the 21st century.

074322454X|5.0|I've read the book Band of Brothers by Stephen E. Ambrose (which I thought was awesome). This book was such a good book because it was action packed and was even better and more graphic than the movie. This book has a small sense of suspense and kept me on the edge of my seat when I read it. This story is about  an elite military group called E company (easy company) and their journey through the battle fields of Europe, from the horror of D-day and leading bayonet charges,  to the winter whip of Bastogne, Easy Company made it through it all. And my favorite character of them all was a man named Major Winters, the leader of the company because of his leading and braveness throughout the book. It made me very sad when somebody died, and even the gruesomeness of some of the Americans to the Germans. This was one of the best war books I've ever read.
1400079179|4.0|It is almost easier to count the number of people that have NOT read the Da Vinci code than it is to count those that have!  Cutting away all the hype, the objective reader can still find an effective and interesting thriller, and a real page-turner of a book.  Is it the best thriller ever written?  I can think of several I've enjoyed as much or better.  But that's not to take away from this book - it is fun, it is even thought-provoking at times.  There are many places where quibbles could arise (more on that below), and the Catholic Church is not presented in a very good light.  But everything in a book like this should be taken with a grain of salt because it is definitely 'speculative fiction'.<br /><br />The book starts with a typically Hitchcockian setup: a man is awakened by the police and dragged to a crime scene.  He was supposed to have met with the victim earlier in the day, but the appointment was cancelled.  Can he account for his whereabouts when the murder took place?  Into the crime scene marches the special detective - both she and the suspect realise that the murder victim has left a code for them to figure out.  Why was it in code?  Obviously because no one can be trusted - not the police, not their friends, and thus the chase is on.<br /><br />The conspiracy threory is no minor conflict between mobsters or politicians, though: it's the quest for the Holy Grail.  Here, Brown is very effective, much like Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton: he takes rumours (e.g., the Grail Legend) and facts (e.g., the termination of the Knights Templar) and speculates on possible connections between them.  The speculations are plausible, at least to conspiracy theorists, and the fun of the book is following along as Brown points out patterns and coincidences that could be taken as 'evidence' of a giant conspiracy by the (Roman) Catholic Church to hide certain information about Jesus Christ in order to maintain their priory over the Christian faith.<br /><br />That information is gathered as the 'Holy Grail', whose nature I won't reveal in this review, to allow the reader to discover it for him/herself.  Obviously one of the chief objections of the book is the idea that an entire belief system is based on a lie (or a coverup) perpetrated by the organized Christian faith.  I, too, am not convinced - it seems far more likely that the Catholics would try to cover up the fact that they actually know too little about Jesus rather than too much.  The second major fault is, I think, the fact that the Catholic Church is basically blamed for all the world's ills - apparently including in societies where there is no Catholic presence.  Sexism exists in China and Japan?  Clearly the subjugation of the pagan European religions by the Catholic church is to blame!<br /><br />There is also a (fortunately not fatal) problem with the setup of the book, i.e., the same impediments preventing Langdon and Neveu's original escape from the Louvre would also have prevented the real killer's escape, so Langdon should never have been a suspect in the first place!  No matter, though, because you're likely to be so caught up in the chase and in the effectiveness of the pacing and prose that these problems will only start to surface if you think too carefully about the book after you've come to its end.he 'Holy Grail', whose nature I won't reveal in this review, to allow the reader to discover it for him/herself.

031606792X|1.0|Why couldn't Eclipse just have ended with Edward's teeth pressing against Bella's neck? It would have saved me the time and effort of reading this three-inch book of nonsense, and would have been a much more satisfying ending to the series.    The problem with Breaking Dawn is that Eclipse ended so nicely (except for the great lack of Edward's teeth on Bella' neck, of course). Bella had finally made her decision, had finally let go of Jacob, and was finally ready to become a vampire. So everyone would have their happily ever after (except for Jacob, but he shouldn't matter any more because Bella told him goodbye).    So the only point I could see in writing a fourth book would be to see Bella become a vampire (which did happen, thankfully. It was the only good part, seeing Bella as a vampire, although I missed her old, clumsy, cute human self). Perhaps because everything was so pleasantly resolved in Eclipse, was the reason Breaking Dawn was such a bizarre stretch that groped in the dark for a plot that just wasn't there.    All of those poor Edward-aholics in the world, like myself, who were looking for another romantic book with sparkling, mysterious, charming Edward, were sadly disappointed. Bella's and Edward's relationship became only sex, which Meyer usually discretely skipped over (for which I must truly thank her on behalf of the hundreds of young, naive, innocent pre-teens I know who are also Edward-aholics). Because all of Bella's and Edward's sex/love scenes were so politely skipped, any sweet, mushy, romantic scenes were nonexistent. Meyer seems to have exhausted herself of all the great romantic scenes we all loved in the first books, from biology class, to the meadow, to the innocent nights in Bella's room (with no sex).    I, for one, was quite happy to see Jacob finally leave at the end of Eclipse. Bella chose Edward, so there was no reason for Jacob to hang around. But, most unfortunately for the rest of us, Meyer seemed to like Jacob enough to makeup some random excuse to keep him in the story. Unfortunately, that random excuse didn't come until AFTER three hundred pages of Jacob's point of view, which was long, boring, and overall extremely pointless.    Finally, three hundred pages later, we got back to the characters we have all stuck it through for: Bella and Edward. Unfortunately (wow, there seem to be a lot of unfortunately-s in this book), Bella and Edward brought with them a new character, \\"Nessie\\" Cullen, their daughter.    Like I said earlier, Meyer seemed to have been desperately searching for some sort of storyline, and most unfortunately the human/vampire baby just wasn't working. To make matters worse, Jacob imprinted on Nessie, which totally ruined the whole book (not that it needed any help in the first place) for two big reasons (although there are many smaller ones). 1- It makes absolutely no sense for Jacob, a werewolf, to imprint on a being that is half his mortal enemy, a vampire. It kind of defeats the purpose of the whole \\"mortal enemy\\" thing. 2- Now Jacob not only has to stay in the story, but he has to stay with the Cullens. What a slap in the face for all of us who were so happy to finally see Jacob leave.    These are just a few reasons I would highly recommend you steer clear of this book. Just imagine, dear Edward-aholics, that Bella became a vampire and they lived happily ever after without all the other garbage Meyer added.    P.S. If Jacob and Nessie had a baby (pretending, for a moment, that Nessie could even have children), what the heck would it be? A human-vampire-werewolf? A huvampolf?

B001HN697C|4.0|There have already been many reviews on this movie complaining about this, that and the other and if you wanted to dismember it piece by piece, I'm sure you could also find a lot to pick fault with. Instead though, let's look at what the movie achieves for its targeted audience. A presquel? Seems to be the popular way these days with a good franchise, if you can't move the story forward, move it back, and give us some history. Strange that I thought that had been covered in some detail in the 1st and 2nd movie, but I digress.<br />Those thinking they will be disappointed by the exclusion of the lovely leather clad Kate Beckinsale as Selene, will not be too unhappy with Rhona Mitra (Doomsday/Shooter). She smolders more than sizzles, but definitely adds some sexual tension, as Viktor's hard to control daughter Sonja (remember the one who Selene reminded him off in the first movie?). Also back is Michael Sheen (fresh from playing David Frost, and English PM Tony Blair) with washboard abs, tight pants and AC/DC's old stage wardrobe as head of the Lycans - Lucien. Best of all of course, is we get lots and lots of Bill Nighy as Viktor. Machiavellian, brutal, sadistic and full of charm. You get a real sense that he loves playing the villain, with an almost campy panache. Visually, it's a little tighter, Patrick Tatapoulos takes over as Director from Len Wiseman. Not that this matters much, as neither of them have much sensibility when it comes to monsters and Sfx.<br />So anyway, the story - well you don't need to know really, Vampires, Werewolves, Swords, Sex & Action. This was not intended to test the grey matter and usually a movie franchise gets weaker with each installment, but that's not the case here, as there is an almost fresh feel to the story, even though we're retreading old ground so to speak. It IS entertaining, and it will do just that if you can suspend your disbelief enough.<br />Great fun 4 stars, just ask yourself 3 questions as the credits roll:<br />1) Why don't the Lycans attack while the sun is shining<br />2) How come all these immortals seem to be easily dispatched with swords?<br />3) And how come there is a full moon EVERY night?ycans attack while the sun is shining  2) How come all these immortals seem to be easily dispatched with swords?  3) And how come there is a full moon EVERY night?

B001JV5BIA|5.0|Although I've seen this years ago, I thought I'd give my 2 cents worth since the remake will soon be released.<br /><br />\\"The Last House on the Left,\\" was probably the first rape film I ever saw and although it is low budget.  There are scenes in this movie that makes you sympathize for the characters, such as the self urination scene and the scene where the two girls are forced to have sex with one another.  I believe those scenes struck me harder then the actual rape and murder.<br /><br />When these rapist find themselves at Mary's home, I actually found myself rooting the parents on, hoping they would find out what had been done to their daughter, and of course they figure it out.<br /><br />The revenge in this movie is great, especially with the castration and the chainsaw wailing father.  Due to the explicit nature of this film it is a cult classic that will always be known as perhaps one of the most brutal rape/revenge movies ever.<br /><br />If you have yet to see \\"Last House\\" buy it, but guys I wouldn't suggest showing this on the first date to your girl, unless she likes to see multiple rape and disembowelment.  In all honesty this movie could be used as a party movie as well, there are quite a few scenes regarding dry wit humor, and plenty of blood soaked sequences that would make the strongest flinch.
1402756399|5.0|I will always be grateful that my parents gave me Darwin's books at the age of 9. I still treasure the works decades later. I can only imagine how much greater the impact on a young mind to have such a richly illustrated version.<br /><br />We owe it to the younger generations to awaken an appreciation of the wonders of the natural world. The genius of Darwin, and the importance of his work, are too often underestimated. This volume is ideal for the whole family, particularly the children. It can not fail to inspire the reader to a greater understanding of the inter-relatedness of life on this planet, and hopefully create a desire to care a little more for our fellow creatures.<br /><br />The concepts are easy to understand, and clearly explained in Darwin's own words. Indeed, his clear prose and careful reasoning make the book an excellent example for budding scientists of how science writing should be done. The illustrations and extra information really bring the man and his insights to life.
