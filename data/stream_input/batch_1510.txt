0061148512|5.0|I recommend this book. It is rightly considered mandatory reading in our schools. It is such a deep and emotional read, full of honesty and parallels to the author's life.<br />I it easy to use current knowledge and research of clinical depression to diagnose the character and see her story as loaded with symptoms. It is well written and often poetic, as you would expect from the intelligent talented author.
030758836X|3.0|This started out as such a great story with unexpected twists and turns.  But the last part of the book wasn't a satisfying ending - it felt contrived, implausible, and lacking the excitement of the rest of the book.  Disappointing!
0446573019|5.0|To say that Lee Child's \\"Affair\\" and David Baldacci's \\"Zero Day\\" are that alike or one is a copy of the other is total nonsense. They both came out in 2011. Baldacci's books come out in the spring, and Child's books come out in the fall. They could not possibly have any relationship to each other. Both are outstanding writers and write great books.
B000WEMH3C|2.0|Weber grill cover lasted less than two years and has completely fallen apart. You get what you pay for and for $8 you don't get much.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful. I was pleasantly surprised when I downloaded it. On days when I don't feel like reading, I can turn on the audio function and just listen.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is fun and different from other games. This game runs great on my kindle fire and is very fun and entertaining. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game great pass time good for free runs fast I would recommend to anybody anytime easy to use for anybody
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game its just like mario!<br />I'll be playing this game a lot. Please download this game. You wont regret it.  ;-)
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Love this little thing... Pairs up with my phone as soon as I walk in my car. everyone I talk to seems to hear me loud and clear. I hear everyone loud and clear. what more can I ask for?
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I think angry birds was a difficult but annoying but yet entertaining game and it I was ticked off when I got 14 games in a row and then fail. I was annoyed
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the choice of having a random deal or a winning deal.  My favorite app for my Kindle Fire.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't even want to give this book 1 star.  With all the hype about it I thought I'd give it a try but honestly....I don't like it at all.  If I could get my money back on it I'd be happier because I feel I wasted money big time.  I love reading and read all kinds of books but I just don't like how this one makes me feel and I don't feel like the characters are \\"real\\".<br /><br />I should add I didnt' even get to the end of the book because I just couldn't read any more!
B005LAIGW8|1.0|This is so unbearably bad that I had to turn it off. It is cornier than Oprah's stool on the 4th of July. Nicholas Cage has made some tankers before, but this tops the notch. Marvel should be embarrassed and needs to do a REAL Ghost Rider movie. Not these garbage films. The first Ghost Rider is pretty bad, but looks like Saving Private Ryan compared to this turd of a film. Save your money.
B0086700CM|2.0|I don't like it because it keeps freezing on me and its not my kindle because I can play any other game just fine.
1401233066|5.0|As usual fables manages to suprise. The plot climax always manages to looping the story back to some detail that was mentioned 3 or 4 books ago that you had completely forgotten about. And of course there are plenty of loose ends to keep you waiting for the next addition
B005HSG3TC|4.0|To all those who say the cover's stand does not work well -- you are very wrong and just not setting up the cover well as a stand.  Believe me, the stand works great once the manufactured creases on the cover have been broken-in a little by you, and even that does not take very long to happen. Once the the cover has been folded several times it will stand-up very well on a table or in a lap.<br /><br />This is a great cover for the Kindle Fire. It is very slim and ultra light-weight and fits on the Fire like a tight glove. It is very durable and will protect your Fire for a long time. If your Fire falls to the ground hard or it takes a solid hit, the cover will not save it from damage. If you want that kind of protection then get something else but know that cover will be heavy and big and bulky. This cover will protect your Fire's screen and case from scratches and light damage which is most likely the only kind of damage your Fire will have in its lifetime.  If you are usually clumsy and/careless with expensive gadgets, then do not get this cover.  To everyone else, you won't regret getting one.<br /><br />6/20/12<br />Just an up-date on the cover.  I do have to point out that the edges of the four corners of the cover, that hold the Kindle in place, are very sharp (at least mine is) and make holding the KF in those areas of the cover really uncomfortable.  I can see a person getting a cut on one of those corners if a finger snagged it just right.  For this reason I have lowered my rating from 5 stars to 4.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is game is my fav game in the world well my 2nd<br />by h.lima. if I could I would call the people who made this game and say 'thx for making this game's.
B0086700CM|4.0|Don't get what the deal is with the hater rush.<br />I've had very few problems with it (Acer Iconia Tab A500), no nags, and no &quot;pay to win&quot; catches.<br />Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it CAN get stale after a while, and I've had intermittent swipe response issues.<br />Overall, I still recommend.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Movie was nice, but not what I expected or what I have seen SEAL's do in real life, maybe they should have gone with real actors, and a fake move script. No disrespect to our SEAL's intended.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think it is cool because is so so so so so so so so so so so so very good
0439813786|4.0|This book had me captured for not just its words, but the use of its pictures. The use of pictures are creative and well done. The story of Hugo, the boy who fixes all sorts of toys and winds up the clocks in the station to keep them running, is different from other books, nothing like anything I have read before. How it captures the mystery of the old man in the toy shop and how he and the automotons drawing keeps your hands stuck to the book.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I think Tom's lip-synching to Bob Seger's \\"Old-Time Rock & Roll\\" while dancing in his underwear while his parents were off to some cruise in Mexico in \\"Risky Business\\", And karaoking to \\"You Lost That Lovin' Feeling\\" from \\"Top Gun\\" has REALLY did paid him off. Tom Cruise's character in \\"Rock of Ages\\" is mash-up of Kid Rock, Axel Rose, & Brett Michaels. Also, a little known fact; Catherine Zeta Jones started out as an 80's pop singer became an actress full-time. There are some hidden talents on this album. You know where to find them.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Works great with almost any mapping software including Google Earth.<br /><br />The best part is that it works well with Windows 7.
B00846REIS|5.0|without the BDSM element (at least in book one anyway) so if you loved that series you'll most likely love this one as well.  My only complaint is that it kind of leaves you hanging at the end and the next book doesn't come out until Oct.  I read the 50 trilogy back to back or I think I would have had the same complaint.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The boys did amazing. We saw stuff you wouldn't expect to see. I love this movie. I am proud to be a Directioner. I am proud of my boys and how far they've come since X Factor.
0307592731|5.0|Just finished this book and really enjoyed it. I loved the author's voice in this book, honest/insightful/funny/painful. So glad she shared her physical and emotional journey!
B000001DVD|5.0|New Wave of British Heavy Metal at its finest!  Not only is the best album Def Leppard ever put out, IMO, it's also one of the best hard rock albums of all time.  This one has it all - nasty, aggressive rhythm and lead guitar, hooks for days, raw  but melodic vocals (pre Auto-Tuning), outstanding production, etc.  This album sounds like the band is still very hungry and has something to prove.  They're cocky and aggressive (they were still teenagers), but have more than enough talent to back it up.  The band is tight and self-assured.  Do not confuse this band with the Def Leppard after Hysteria - they're two completely different projects.  Not knocking one or the other, but you won't hear founding member Pete Willis (who contributed significantly to the early songwriting), Steve Clark at his peak, and Rick Allen playing to his potential (ie, a full set of arms) anywhere after this album.  Once Phil Collen joined, everything became much more studied/cautious, less visceral, and the youthful piss and vinegar pretty much disappeared.  But here it is in all its glory, so enjoy it!
B002L4QP0M|5.0|This was my first time reading Jeffrey Archer but it definitely won't be my last. This novel was an intricately woven thriller; action packed, unpredictable and well written.
1466401885|5.0|This is a great book I could not put it down. I was able to read it in less then a day. The ending is amazing .....can't wait for the 2nd book :)
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I really don't understand why so many people didn't like this movie.  It was witty, interesting, and it kept you wondering what was going to happen next.  Robert Downey was phenomenal as usual.  Look, if you liked the first one, and you enjoy this genre, then this is definitely worth the watch.  People just like to hate things, whether it's warranted or not.  Can't wait for a third!
B0087240Z4|4.0|It's true, this album does not jump out and bite down on you like Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, and for those of you who have been waiting for a SP album to do so its safe to say that is not going to ever happen again.  Neither does this album croon and soar like Adore did, or take you on a mythical journey of sonic bliss in the way of Machina.  If there's anything that is consistent in the journey the Pumpkins have taken us on it is that there is no turning back, and there's always something new around the corner.<br /><br />Billy is a rock singer/ rock guitarist.  If you were to isolate just the guitar, you would say \\"Okay, this has some crunch\\", but in the context of the songs here, that crunch has become soggy from sitting in the milk a little too long.  But this is okay, because he's not singing like a rock singer ought to.  There is no wailing of despair or anthemic howling of some spectacular insight. Instead, he's just a guy singing about the things that matter to him.  Personally I'd be in favor of him trying to lower his voice a bit instead of using the nasally tone that is so distinguishing of his records. But whatev's this is his music not mine.<br /><br />My favorite track on first listen is \\"Pinwheels\\".  Many of the tracks stay on this middle path that do not really invoke much in the way of thought provocation or emotive response, but this one stands out.  I'm sure as I listen to the others more they will grow on me.<br /><br />One thing that I've learned is never to take Billy's music for face value.  If you want to be hit over the head this isn't the album for you.  If you're curious that maybe Billy is trying to forge new ground then give it a try.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Pretty much -- and it looks great, controls great, sounds great, and has great dialog. This game sets a high bar for what is possible on mobile devices. I've played it for a few hours now and have loved every minute.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game to play and its great I love it getting chased by monkeys is scary! but I stink at it!
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is very entertaining! once u start, u cant put it down. I love the sound graphics. one thing the creator's could work on is making the magnet so that u can use it at the beginning of the game. other than that, for now, I like the game and suggest you download it!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is AMAZING!!! Everyone should get it!! The adreninaline rush is just HUGE!! I never put my kindle down when I play this game!!
B007P6VLRS|2.0|most similar to the Zwan album than anything Corgan has put his name to before or since. and for the most part it sounds like what i'd imagine an album of outtakes from that album would sound like. the only surprise comes late in the album with The Chimera, a rock song that actually sounds worthy of the Smashing Pumpkins name. so along with That's The Way (My Love Is), Pomp And Circumstance and Stellar, The Chimera now brings the count of decent 2nd era SP songs to four.<br />the people who are the most desperate to find something to love about this album should be the first to throw up their hands in defeat and admit it's an insult to the legacy of the band we once loved so we as a whole can make some effort to keep it intact by refusing this as a Smashing Pumpkins album, but like a defiant patriot who will tell you to love everything about america or get out the voice of fanboy delusion wins out and all i'm left with is to say if this is a Smashing Pumpkins album i hereby hang up my Zero tshirt and resign as a fan.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great for business and remembering things. I use it Color Note for my nieghborhood business(Paws &amp; Claws). It's helps me ALOT.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm glad I finally found a weather app that works great on my Kindle Fire. This is the best one yet!
0307951529|5.0|Chris has created a wonderful book which inspires those who want to start their own businesses.  It's inspirational and educational at the same time.  I have even started to take small action steps towards my own business because of the inspiration which comes from Chris.  I can't recommend this book highly enough!
0062197258|5.0|GREAT debut novel by Elizabeth Haynes. I found myself sitting down to read for a little while at night and then realizing it was 2 a.m!...And yet, not wanting to stop reading.<br /><br />Haynes does a great job going back and forth between where Catherine/Cathy is now and flashing back to the past. Well done, well written.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|How can you not love this song? Adorable feel good song (with great parodies)!<br />Listen to this song every morning before you go to work... or when you leave work every evening.<br />Or.. all the damn time.
0679805273|3.0|The book was supposed to be \\"good\\", but it was average. The cover I'd completely bent and wore out. The inside cover is faded and has little color. Not worth the money .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put any of three books down. Read all three in under a weeks time. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me reflect on my own relationship. I was hooked till the very end. If you love romance you'll love this Trilogy
B003UESJH4|5.0|GREAT,UPLIFTING WITH GREAT PERFORMANCES!!!<br />COLIN FIRTH AND JEFFERY RUSH DELIVER AGAIN WITH ACADEMY AWARD WORTHY ACTING!<br />  A MUST FOR ALL FANS OF THE GREAT ACTORS!
1455518999|5.0|I loved this book.  The only thing I didn't like is putting a gay guy in, everyone is pushing this issue and I guess there was one other thing...the ending was sad, but it was a very good read and I love Baldacci's books!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I haven't read a Stephen King novel in many years.  My book club chose this one, and I am glad it did!  King is excellent at providing character development, excitement, anticipation, and sense of time and place.  Why I stopped reading him in the first place was all about the ending.  A problem here as well.  We invest in 100s of pages of building plot and then the end is quick and simple and feels rushed.  For me, the 100s of pages before the end were worth reading, so I recommend this book.  I also thought that the Kindle was a good format for such a long book.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|This is a great app with maps form all over the planet accessible without being online.  It comes in very handy.
0425263908|5.0|As a person who enjoyed the FSOG trilogy this was the number one book on the what to read after FSOG list. I must say I do agree with the other posters who are saying that It is alot like FSOG but thats just what I was looking for I needed something similar. I liked it and I will read the second novel :)
1612680011|5.0|I read this book around 2 years ago and it influenced me to make a business move that has paid off.  I took a break from reading, but have now decided to get things going again.  I lost my origional book and knew this is one that needed to be in my collection.  The book was in my mail box within 1 week and brand new.  No complaints at all.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book to see what all the hype was about- I was never much of a book person but I wanted to check this out and see why everyone liked it so much. The only thing I can say is right after I finished the first book I started the second then the third I loved it! If E.L James writes anymore in this series I will be right there to buy my copy. I didnt realize how much I enjoyed reading until this book so I started reading other erotic novels and i am seeing what else is out there. I know alot of people didnt like this but I Loved it!!
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I am a fan of the Dungeon Hunter series; However, I was greatly disappointed with this installment. I read the reviews and cautiously downloaded the game. I thought to myself.Hey, its a free download what do I have to lose. Well, first of all time deleting files so I could download this massive file. Second, the wasted money spend playing this repetitive lame game. Third, time out of my life I will never get back.<br />Do not waste your time, money, or memory downloading this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it but I don't like how you have 2 pay 2 unlock a game I think thts so stupid!!!
B005LAIGW8|1.0|This movie is crap from start to finish. I am now using this DVD as a drink coaster. I am giving it one star because this review feature will not let me give it any less.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever no lag on my kindle fire if u hate the game then ur dumb it is awesome and super addicting
0345803493|5.0|This is the second book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  The first book left you with a cliff hanger, and this book takes up where the last leaves off.  These books are addicting! I have a book crush on Christian (Fifty)! There is repetition in this book also, with certain phrases, however it doesn't take away from the story.  There is a growing intimacy in this book, and the sex scenes are plentiful.  This book is even better than the last book, if that is even possible.  The characters in the book really grow throughout the story.  As everyone now knows Christian is a Dom, so there are some BDSM elements, but nothing so severe that you need to shy away from this book.  Also, Ana isn't submissive, and is new at all of the sexual aspects of their relationship, so it makes it easier to read.  It's definitely not too extreme.  Christian and Ana still email each other throughout the story, which I really like, especially when they add to their signatures. Christian is more \\"hearts and flowers\\" in this story, which is so sweet!  Ana's two inner characters are still with us in this tale, which I love.  Her subconscious and inner goddess are too funny! There is a cliff hanger at the end of this book as well, so you will have to get book 3, Fifty Shades Freed!<br />This is more one long story than three separate stories, and should not be read alone.  It reminds me of The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty Series by Anne Rice, in that it is a BDSM trilogy that is really just one long story.<br /><br />VERDICT<br /><br /> Entire series is amazing. Go. Buy it.  NOW!<br />see more of my reviews, including Fifty Shades of Grey, at kaitlinmichelle.com
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I recieved the cd in good timing and in good shape! Loved the music when I saw it in theater and had to have it!
0345803507|5.0|Book 3 in the Fifty Shades series is just as good as the other two!  I shall miss you Fifty!  This is a series to be reread again and again.  The series is the best romance I have ever read.  Everyone who hasn't read this thinks it's just some BDSM sex book, but there is so much more than that.  The sex scenes are super steamy! Whew!  There was one part that I hated Christian, absolutely hated him! But he won me back over shortly after.  This book starts a few months after the last book ends.  Fifty and Ana are already married and on their honeymoon.  There are flashbacks to their wedding night, and some of the things we missed.  Ana continuously defies Christian, and he is quick to anger, but they learn a lot about each other in this book.  There is a lot of drama in this story.  The fire in Charlie Tango in the first book comes back into play, with more arson, and... well I can't give anything away, but SO MUCH HAPPENS!  Their unconditional love is truly beautiful.  The ending is a few years after the series.  The story ends with everything wrapped up tight.<br /><br />OMG! The end of the book has a bonus of Christian's POV starting when Ana comes to interview him through him leaving Claytons.  I loved reading his thoughts.  It was so hot!  I would be willing to read all three books again from his point of view.  I will be looking forward to anything else written by this author.<br />VERDICT<br /><br /> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! Buy the series! see the reviews of the other 2 books and more at kaitlinmichelle.com

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Item was delivered promptly and was well packaged. I could not believe the pricing was so low and it also came with a check toward Wal-Mart for $10.00 towards a Blu-ray Disney movie.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I had purchased the first release of Avatar on blu-ray. It was the theatrical release with no extras. I misplaced it so I wanted to buy it again. I was extremely happy that I got this extended version. Some added footage added some interesting plot lines. I also enjoyed the behind the scenes features. It showed just how this was not only a labor of love it was a \\"true labor\\"! Also I would recommend anyone getting an HD tv for the time or stepping up to blu- ray, this is the movie to start your library.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Read the poor reviews and I don't get it...this is top of my list of favorite books for 2012.  As a matter of fact, I liked it so much I will probably reread it, which I NEVER do.  I will not hesitate to buy anything from this author in the future.
B00004Y6NV|3.0|I'm a big Dire Straits fan, and there are some nice songs here, but overall it's too quiet for my tastes, and there is too much country twang on some of them for me. Their double live Alchemy is the gold standard for me.
0545123291|4.0|'This is a love story. I never knew there were so many kinds of love or that love could make people do so many different things.<br />I never knew there were so many different ways to say goodbye.'<br /><br />Grace has never been sick a day in her life since the wolves attacked her when she was a child. Lately, she's been plagued by a constant headache and a fever that burns deep and has her fearing that this is much more than just the flu. Sam, now human despite the brutal Minnesota cold, still feels as if it's too good to be true.<br /><br />Cole is one of the new wolves that Beck turned before he changed for the last time. Cole was an interesting and multi-faceted character. An ex-rock star in his pre-wolf life that was a junkie on the road to disaster. When he was approached by Beck he agreed to the change seeking a respite from the life he had created for himself. Sam and Grace shared the stage with the introduction of the growing attraction between Isabelle and Cole. I found the two couples to be vastly different yet managed to complement each other in the story wonderfully.<br /><br />Maggie's writing remains vibrant and beautiful. There's really no other way to explain it... simple yet not. She's an amazing writer. I especially loved the small snippets we were given of Sam's poetry/song writing abilities.<br /><br />'I'm an equation that only she solves/these X's and Y's by other names called/My way of dividing is desperately flawed/as I multiply days without her'<br /><br />The ending of Linger left me with little doubt that I needed to start Forever immediately. I needed to know the ending to the story even though I have a distinct feeling that it's going to break my heart. Here's hoping I'm wrong. :)
0143145150|2.0|Steinbeck wrote some good novels, some that are even almost great (East of Eden comes to mind); this, however, is not one of them.  The Grapes of Wrath is little more than bad communist propaganda.<br /><br />It isn't that the kinds of things he describes didn't happen, but the way he presents them---without looking for the deeper cause (rather than pulling out the tired old scarecrow of \\"greed\\", an abused and vague term anyway) or offering a real solution but rather simply pushing for a (dubious at best) political program---is not only unrealistic, it isn't artistic either.  About the only time it approaches the level of genuine literary expression is when Casy goes on about how his idea of holy is for every man to be harnessed, not even to every other man, but to Mankind as a whole.  That's a horrible thought, but at least it's a somewhat deeper one.<br /><br />Even Tom Joad's famous \\"Whenever you seen a cop beatin' a guy...\\" speech is all about the insignificance of the individual, and as if to prove his point, Steinbeck continues the story for quite a while after that but Tom (despite having been the main character up to that point) does not reappear.<br /><br />And stylistically, this is one of Steinbeck's worst...it could be described as faux-Hemingway---lots of awkward sentences, unnecessary repetitions of words rather than using pronouns, etc.  But it actually reads more like Socialist realism than anything else.  It has a lot in common with some stuff put out by the Union of Soviet Writers under Stalin around that time.  East of Eden is much better written, though Steinbeck is still using some techniques he seems to have learned from writers like Kataev.<br /><br />I did a bit of research after finishing this, and it looks like Steinbeck actually joined and had further involvement with the League of American Writers, which was set up by the Communist Party USA in 1935 in sympathy with the Union of Soviet Writers putting its policy of controlling and censoring the output of authors into effect the year before. Anyway, enough was known here about what was going on under the Soviet system by the time he wrote The Grapes of Wrath that he couldn't have had any honest excuse for glorifying it like that.<br /><br />I suspect that the only reason The Grapes of Wrath is considered such a great classic is that it was heavily pushed by the press which was highly sympathetic to communism in this country at the time of its release, and because of the movie version with Henry Fonda.  People like to pretend that Steinbeck wrote books like this for \\"the common man\\", but the truth is it's incredibly patronizing and condescending; he really wrote it for wealthy intellectuals like himself to feel better about themselves.  As someone who's in the working class himself (but doesn't intend to stay there his whole life), I think if I ever met Steinbeck I would have slapped his face, because The Grapes of Wrath is basically a slap in mine.ng the output of authors into effect the year before.

0545259096|3.0|'For among these winters there is one so endlessly winter<br />that only by wintering through it all will your heart survive.'<br /><br />Forever: the final installment in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series and the final story of Grace and Sam.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />Despite struggling profusely with this one there is no denying this was still a beautifully written story. Maggie's writing appears flawless and effortless... the words simply flow.<br /><br />The Bottom Line<br />As you can see by my rating, Forever didn't leave me with the warm fuzzies I had after Linger and especially after Shiver. It was too jumbled for me and a bit lacking in overall focus. I think that this is primarily due to the multi-POVs that didn't work for me this time around even though there were just about as many in Linger... it just made the story feel all over the place.<br /><br />Too much time was spent focusing on Isabel and Cole when I desperately needed/wanted more about Grace and Sam. It also seemed like there was too much extra information being doled out that was distracting from the main storyline. Bottom line: it felt very forced.<br /><br />The Romance<br />I didn't feel the strong connection that I was used to between Grace and Sam (view spoiler) And I found it strange how Grace/Sam would be thinking about how much they loved him/her or how much they missed him/her when separated yet they never really showed it. I realize that it was done so in a way to show that they both know and understand each other so much that actions aren't required but being a bite more vocal about it would have brought back the warm fuzzies for me. :)<br /><br />Despite my issues I'm still glad that I finally read these stories and experienced Maggie's writing firsthand. Even though Grace and Sam's story is officially over it will be hard to ever forget it.<br /><br />'And then I did laugh, even though the future was a dangerous place, because I loved her, and she loved me, and the world was beautiful.'beautiful.'
0307737381|4.0|The Century Trilogy is shaping up to be Follett's most ambitious project to date.  This first installment is about the transfer of power from the privileged elite to the masses (hence the novel's title, Fall of Giants) during the period leading up to the first Great War, the war itself, and its aftermath.<br /><br />Follett tells this story through an impressive cast of characters, some historical, but mostly through the romantic entanglements of his fictional creations.  These romances cross lines of class and nation---a servant girl has an affair with her noble lord, an English woman with a German aristocrat, a Russian worker with the daughter of a wealthy American...you get the idea.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these relationships are all incredibly shallow, based on nothing more than good looks, regardless of the beloved's actual character.  In some cases, they seem to be nothing more than lust, rather than love...but it's impossible to tell the difference, except that it's apparently supposed to be mere lust in the case of the bad guys, and love in case of the good ones.  This causes some plot problems and thematic issues, so that aspect of the book is pretty weak.<br /><br />Also, his theme about power moving from the hands of the few to the many leaves out some crucial distinctions, such as that between socialism (or even Soviet communism) and the individualism (imperfectly) implemented in the American system, lumping these widely disparate (even opposite) systems together under that ridiculously overused and much abused term, \\"democracy\\".  But there is some hint at the end that the next book will address this issue in the consequences of the shift in power in Russia and especially Germany, leading up to World War II.<br /><br />One of the better aspects is Follett's depiction of the beginning of the movement for women's suffrage.  Particularly interesting was the rift between friends who disagreed on certain aspects of implementation, such as those who accepted gradualism and those who refused to compromise on anything less than their full program (a problem common to many such movements, such as the abolition of slavery half a century earlier).<br /><br />So on the whole, the book is a bit mixed, but definitely worth a read in the hope that the rest of the series will improve.d gradualism and those who refused to compromise on anything less than their full program (a problem common to many such movements, such as the abolition of slavery half a century earlier).<br /><br />So on the whole, the book is a bit mixed, but definitely worth a read in the hope that the rest of the series will improve.
030758836X|3.0|On the day of Nick and Amy's five year wedding anniversary Nick comes home to find the door ajar, the iron still on, but no Amy. Amy's typical anniversary gift to Nick includes a treasure hunt with small personal messages to help lead him to the next location and to the big present. When he finds the first clue she had left for him he begins to follow the clues and realizes that Amy had been trying to fix their fractured marriage, but it may have been too late.<br /><br />The alternating POV (from present time to a past entry in Amy's diary) absolutely killed this story for me. I've ready stories that were written in this same format before but for some reason this one caused me to develop ADD and I was being distracted by the tiniest things. I think I started and stopped this one at minimum a half a dozen times. Now despite this, I must say that it was an extremely detailed and well-written story, I just obviously lack the patience and focus to truly appreciate it.<br /><br />As far as the characters go, Nick in particular was a very hard read. I didn't find myself liking him or even feeling sorry for him; however, I suppose that's to be expected as the way it was written made him a very obvious suspect for the reason Amy went missing in the first place. But of course, it's hardly that simple. Once the story picked up, and Nick finally started to follow Amy's clues I got into it a lot more. And once the story hit the midway point and did a complete 180? I was enthralled. Unfortunately that feeling didn't last very long and I felt that the last half of the book was very disheveled and seriously crazy, and not in a good way.<br /><br />This is a stand alone novel so I expect a wrapped up ending that answers all of my questions and gives some semblance of a resolution for the characters. I'm not asking for it to be all tied up in a pretty bow or anything but at least don't leave me with out big wtf. Well, that's exactly what I got. By the end, the story seemed so unraveled to the point of being undetectable from the story that I originally started reading. Having a story surprise me and go a completely different direction is one thing, but that's not what happened here. Not a lot can be said without giving serious spoilers to the story but suffice it to say I failed to be impressed by the end. I do give this story credit for the intricate build-up even if the resolution was less than satisfactory.veled to the point of being undetectable from the story that I originally started reading.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I finished book three and wanted to go back to reconnect with book one.  I really enjoyed these books.  The story line was wildly interesting.  I was afraid that it would just be trashy, but it was exciting to read and difficult to put down and I loved the ending.  I am now afraid of my beads.<br /><br />I would love to recommend these books to my friends, but some may not have the \\"stuff\\" to read beyond the Red Room.<br /><br />Look forward to reading this author again.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first you're bored, but then you want beat your own score. Fun for hours.<br /><br />Get ready, time will fly by.
B0082EOJYE|1.0|This movie is an atrocity. I have watched silent films and black and white classics my whole life. Silent films had a musical score that matched the things happening in each scene. They set mood and offered sound effects to things that happen in the movie. During the hey day of Silent films they even had people behind the screen to make all the sound effects such as gun shots or falls and door knocks. The only thing that was missing was the sound of voices. Even if they had left out sound effects out and only done a musical score to go with the film then they should have composed music that fit the scenes intended. There is even a use of a song with a singer. I was tempted to leave the theater at that point but decided to sit through it all to see how bad it truly got. It just kept getting worse for the sound. The music lacked a period feel and really didn't fit the following scenes. It felt more like the mod music that was often used to set the tone for the actors in a scene instead of the musical score meant to move the audience.<br /><br />The lighting techniques for one were all wrong. They director of photography should be ashamed of themselves for not knowing how to work in black and white. Mostly the scenes are all just gray. If you get a chance to watch true black and white movies you'll see the major difference. Proper lighting adds to the depth of a black and white scene. Having all lights up all the time like you do when shooting color really makes for a dull appearance in monochrome.<br /><br />As for plot, it's cute, but it has been done before. It's actually been done a lot. I think it is a good plot idea. Unfortunately the writers weren't that great and the acting matched it well. I don't understand why the Academy would award this piece of junk with so much attention and so many awards. The only screen presence that seemed to understand how to act without speech was the cute dog. I think they should have made the movie about him at this point. The socalled actors in this film lacked the ability to show emotion with body language. You need that when you have to act everything out in pantomime. Then you have the large lack of speech cards. I know that often conversations were had in original silent films that didn't use a lot of speech cards, but they acted it out in pantomime to make up for it so that you didn't need any cards.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend that you avoid this movie. There are a lot of original silent films out there that are so much better. This one should just be burned and forgotten.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|title says it all.  highly suggest this game for all ages.  very addictive pretty entertaining and has a cutrfa tor.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game I play almost everyday its very complicated but once u get the hang of it this game can keep preoccupied when you need it the most. so its defintley worth it for a free game!!!!!
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Shocked that so many reviews here fail to mention the quality of the DVD itself, whether blu ray or not.  I have the Standard Def Superbit DVD and just finished watching the Blu Ray version with lossless audio that uses the entire 5.1 sound stage where appropriate, especially so in the early parts of the film.  The Super Bit DVD states that the movie is 130 minutes while the Blu Ray disc states 127 minutes, which my display confirmed, even tho Amazon says it is 128 minutes.  Don't know where the 3 minute difference is as no scenes appear shortened.  The films video transfer is very good, not great, but very good.  It is a darkly shot film with muted colors in most areas and I saw nothing that would disconcert any one.<br /><br />There are a great number of deleted and extended scenes that are presented as if they had not gone through post production yet,  so their quality is not the best.  However, I do wish that the majority of these deleted scenes had been included in a director's cut.<br />I usually do not care for most of the extras on a disc but this Blu Ray version has several that are dated 2006 since this Blu Ray release is a 2007 release.  They are all excellent extras and it is rare that you see an extra where the director and actors are arguing over takes and the way a scene should be played out.  Really enjoyable to watch.  The SuperBit version had no extras but did have DTS audio which is great for standard def films.<br /><br />I have seen this movie many times but today, on the blu Ray, was the first in several years.  Still love it.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a great game but the only problem is that it doesn't function well. When I play I do it all right but it doesn't seem to follow my movements correctly.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is my  favorote game in the whole world. When I go on trips I play it the whole time.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Slavery.<br />Family.<br />Secrets.<br />Love.<br /><br />Lavinia was orphaned, small, fragile, and sick when Captain James Pyke brought her to Tall Oaks Plantation. She was to be an indentured servant. Initially, she has no memory of her family or even her name.  She is taken in and nursed back to health by the house slaves. The set up is new and very strange to everyone because Lavinia is white and Irish.<br /><br />Lavinia is given over to Belle's care. Belle lives in and manages the kitchen house and holds the biggest secret onto the plantation. Lavinia grows up playing with Mama Mae's twins, Beattie and Fanny. Lavinia adapts well to Tall Oaks Plantation. She helps to care for babies and assists with all the chores. She is not in the least bit concerned with the Master's children or their ways. The slaves that live on this plantation quickly become Lavinia's surrogate family and  later they become her property.<br /><br />Belle and Lavinia was the book's narrators. I was so engulfed in the story that I rarely distinguished between the two as I went from chapter to chapter. The characters in this novel are vivid and diverse but not well developed. I found it interesting that Uncle Jacob, the house butler, believed in Allah. The house Mistress, Miss Martha, and later Lavinia developed opium addictions. Miss Martha even spent a few years in a \\"mad house.\\" The only portion of the story that disgusted me was the love triangle between Belle, Ben, and Lucy.<br /><br />The prologue of this story made me tear into it and finish it in record time. It had my heart racing. I could hardly wait to get to the end. You feel like you are with family when you read The Kitchen House. Grissom really dealt with family ties, love, and loyalties. Lavinia was faced with some tough decisions due to her unconventional upbringing but she allowed love to cover a multitude of wrongs.<br /><br />Reflections:<br />As much as I loved The Kitchen House it did not leave a lasting impression on me like The Healing (Jonathan Odell). It read fast and when it was over it was over. I dare to compare the two because the overall subject matter is the same, slavery and life on a plantation. Lavinia being white and raised among slaves makes for quite a story but there isn't any \\"soul\\" in The Kitchen House.e like The Healing (Jonathan Odell). It read fast and when it was over it was over. I dare to compare the two because the overall subject matter is the same, slavery and life on a plantation.

B007ZD17XO|5.0|I just love this game. I play it every night before I go to bed or when I cant sleep. I don't have to count sheeps anymore. this game keeps me entertained.Since this game is under time pressure it is a game that requires speed in sight and touch to obtain the required score. The bonus portion is quite challenging.  graphics is great.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This case is just what I wanted.  The design is excellent.  The patent pending clips hold the kindle fire very securely.  The non slip pad is really nice.  I like the black interior and the soft feel to it.  There was a slight plastic smell, but it goes away quickly.  The red color is very loud.  If you like Le Creuset Cherry Red you will like the statement this cover will make.  Most of the time when in use you will not even notice the red so it is a nice change when you close your kindle cover to take it with you.  I like the contrast between the red and black on the interior.  The red stitching really pops against the black.  I put some Howard Feed-N-Wax on my cover to give it more of a shine since it is a matte finish vinyl. It has a nice orange smell. This case does all it says in the product description.  The stitching is very sturdy and the case is well made.

B000LC51TM|5.0|AWESOME!!  These guys rock! Saw clips of this concert on the internet, makes you feel like you're there, very powerful show. It is in German so you better brush up or do like I did and just jammed out and didn't care. The concert disk has the whole show from Nimes France plus footage from other places the music disk has 14 songs.<br />If you like high action concerts this is a must to add to your collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|so I could go on and on about this game,  but iwont,  this game is really fun.. I love playing it on a bigger screen and I love the fact that itbis free
B000URDE2Y|5.0|I was poking around on the internet and came across this album, listen to a few songs and was blown away.<br />I ordered it that night and been jammin ever since. This is a Jimi Hendrix type sound but not as twangy and a lot clearer. Look him up, listen to a few songs and decide.  This is a great album.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game about time they got it on kindle. its fun but the sometimes glitchy nature of the kindle makes it a little difficult at times

B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! The perfect time passer. And yes there are ads. But that keeps keeps the game free. The company is paid to advertise. So if there were no ads and it was free- they would not make any money. That is why there is ads. Anyway awesome game!
B0059XTUVI|3.0|The Iron Lady is an admirable film which does not, unfortunately, rise above the tour de force performance of the Meryl Streep, the greatest actress of her generation. Unlike the last iconic character Streep portrayed, chef Julia Child, this film (even if it weren't in actuality) seems like a vehicle simply created to showcase Streep. In honoring Thatcher, it succeeds only partially, as it glosses over many important events with mere montages and shows more than a few ugly sides to her character. But Streep is successful in making Thatcher both the object of ire and sympathy (and the Oscar-winning makeup is also incredible). If you want to see an example of a film that could have been great relegated to merely \\"average\\" status by an impotent script and fairly lazy direction, this is the one for you -- because Streep's performance ensures that it won't be a total waste of time!

0425263908|5.0|When I started to read this book, I took a step back and thought twice but when I started the book again, I couldn't put it down. Yes, it like 50 Shades but it so different in different ways. I loved how the aouther allowed one to see into a woman who was hurt so bad. I have been there and want out so bad. This book as allowed a healing in away for all those loset souls. I like ther female can stand and still go on with life no matter how hard it can get. She has man she wants but is putting it on the line when he thinks its the best for the both of them. Can't wait for more about what will happen next.
0525478817|5.0|John Green, you sir know how to write. Plain and simple. This happened to be my first venture into a John Green novel, and no sooner did I wipe away the tears of the this book did I download his full anthology. This book had everything I look for in a YA novel, or any book for that matter. The characters were real for me. Mr. Green develops his characters extremely well, and the reader genuinely cares for what happens to them. The plot moves quickly and is effortlessly paced. As you probably know, the novel is at its core about two cancer patients who fall in love. But for me, the book became so much more than that. I don't want to give anything away, but I really took the book's message to heart. I have not read a book that has affected me like this one has in a very long time. As I referenced earlier, I am not afraid to admit that this book drew a few tears from me by the turn of the last page. I enjoyed every minute of this book, and I have heard the same from everyone that I have recommended it to. Please read this book. You will not regret that you did. I am not sure I will ever be able to forget Stars.<br /><br />Stay Classy Amazon!

B0023SDPS6|5.0|I read, actually listened, to this book by accident.  George Guidall is a favorite reader of mine and I was browsing audio books by reader.  Looking for something new I spotted Cold Dish and bbought it.  Having lived most of my adult life in the Rocky Mountain region I was thrilled to find an author who so eliquently captures the heart and soul of  Wyoming. The only problem now is that I read much faster than Craig Johnson writes.  I think in pictures and Craig Johnson paints them. If you want to learn about life on the high plains, laugh out loud and meet characters you want to have as friends - read this book.  Start with Cold Dish and read in order.  The TV show doesnt come close to capturing the book's appeal.

B005LAIGYQ|1.0|***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />Though the plot is fiction, there are obvious undertones paralleling the more well-known conflict between al-Qaeda terrorists and the U.S. rather than the \\"enemies\\" who were depicted. And following the legacy of The Green Berets movie, America was portrayed as morally perfect and organized while the opposition was portrayed as heartless and scattered. Everything in this movie was unrealistically favorable toward pro-American/anti-opposition propaganda--even the musical scores. The juxtapositions of the opposing interrogation methods were one of the most unrealistically-biased portrayals. The U.S. interrogated a drug smuggler by having a mildly-heated discussion in which the interrogator was trying to reason with the drug smuggler by explaining the \\"reality\\" of the situation. The drug smuggler quickly cracked. Meanwhile the CIA spy was interrogated by the opposition who were using savage means that included drilling through the CIA agent's hands. She never cracked.<br /><br />The drug smuggler was working with an old friend of his who had a largely unexamined motive to bring down the U.S. economy. He and his followers served as representation of the al-Qaeda terrorists. The friend was portrayed as a religious hypocrite who heartlessly had women detonate suicide bombs. One distressed suicide bomber was coolly told, \\"You will meet your husband in heaven.\\"<br /><br />If you ignore the biases, the movie is still mediocre. The focus revolved around the soon-to-be-father soldier significantly more than any other soldier, so it is evident early on he is going to die tragically. The acting quality fluctuated, but the most pitiful performance was between two of the soldiers discussing what trinkets they always bring with them when fighting. The actors acted tough at all times, so their attempt at a heartwarming moment remained an attempt. It is difficult to feel sorry for the stoic character because he doesn't seem human.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Alright, here's my 2 cents about the new album after 4-5 listens now.<br /><br />Production wise it is a loud, low-frequency heavy recorded album with deep bass guitar and bass drums so you may need to turn up the treble a bit.  I have read some reviews with concerns about the sound quality and I can see where those are coming from, however, I definitely recommend listening on a high quality stereo system and speakers/headphones.  I think the mix is great for the kind of music being played and I love how deep and upfront Geddy's bass is in the mix on this CD.<br /><br />I have to admit, it takes me a few listens on any new Rush CD for me to \\"get it\\" and this one is no different.  I don't think there's a band out there that switches tempos and parts of songs as well as these guys do where ideas seemingly comes in and out from nowhere, and it takes a careful listen to really appreciate.  So far my faves are \\"Clockwork Angels\\", \\"The Anarchist\\", and \\"Carnies\\".<br /><br />A quick rundown of my impressions of the tracks:<br /><br />Caravan and BU2B - not really new songs but both great, hard rocking tunes.  I loved hearing them on the last tour.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels - reminds me of Cygnus/Double Agent, a straight out rocker with frenetic drumming from the Professor.  Real nice vocal work from Ged as well.<br /><br />The Anarchist - great deep bass groove, lots of twists and turns.<br /><br />Carnies - love the chorus along with all the change ups and toward the mid to end of the song when it gets really heavy.<br /><br />Halo Effect - nice mid-tempo, mid-album change of pace but probably my least favorite track due mostly because the rest of the album is so stellar.<br /><br />7 Cities of Gold - heavy bluesy tune with a Malignant Narcissism riff in the opening, this one has not quite grown on me all the way - yet.<br /><br />The Wreckers - not sure how to describe this one other than its simply a beautiful song.  I can't get the chorus out of my head.<br /><br />Headlong - an instant classic, an awesome heavy rocking, winding tune.  Neil just beats the hell out his kit on this one.  Awesome bass line and incredible lead from Alex and I love the \\"Main Monkey Business\\" riff after Alex' solo.  It reminds me of some early stuff like Bastille Day and By-Tor.<br /><br />Wish Them Well - another heavy mid-tempo diamond in the rough in my opinion.  Although the background vocal on this one is simplistic, it fits nicely.<br /><br />The Garden - this one reminds me of something that Geddy produced off his solo recording with the opening acoustic guitars.  It's probably the finest ballad they ever recorded and unlike anything I've heard from the boys.  Just a beautiful song - gives me chills.<br /><br />In closing, I have to give this one 5 starts but, of course, the real judgment of this recording will be how it stands the test of time vs. other Rush recordings.  I do wish an instrumental would have been included on this album as these guys are the masters in that department but anyway I do hope they play the entire album on the upcoming tour.  Furthermore, it's nice to see all the Rush fans take the time to give their perspectives on the long awaited new album as I enjoyed reading the varying positive and negative opinions.

159562015X|1.0|My new manager has the book as a project and I read it and took the test with an open mind.  Completely disappointed with 2 of the 5 talents/strengths (not me at all in fact total opposite - rubbish) and wonder how the hell the test even tallied this information.  Also I believe that you should see your score on EVERY talent/strength so you are aware what is close but somehow didn't make the top 5.  The test will only give you 5 results and there are a ton of possibilities.  I fear any manager or HR person that follows the advice in this book without actually seeing that talent/strength in that employee (there is a version of this book for management btw which has instructions on how to manage a person with talent a, talent b, etc...) is in for a shock.  I'm glad work bought the book because after taking the test it was MONEY COMPLETELY WASTED and I'm left with more questions than answers.
B000F3A7LO|4.0|Instrumental stuff is great, guitar playing is great...but some of the vocals are downright awful and embarrassing. Some are good (Daryl Hall, Peter Gabriel) but whoever the screamer is and the girl is are really, really bad, just hard to listen to. I guess the material is supposed to be 'challenging', and as an album I think it's still worth checking out, but don't be surprised if you cover your ears or skip a song or two.

I think some people would give it 5 stars for acting and so would I, but the story was horrible and I guess I am just not into this kind of movie.  I loved his movie Taken, but The Gray is something I wouldn't advise just anyone to watch.

0345803485|2.0|I work in books and for the past month I've had a few people (women ages 25-50) every hour ask me for this book, adding 'I hear it's REALLY good'. But online I heard a lot of 'it's really bad'. No shades of grey but I sell about 15 copies an hour, it's crazy.<br /> I had read the blurb and flicked through, from what I gathered it read like mediocre fanfiction and I wondered what the fuss was about.  I bought it so I could have an opinion either way and this is the upshot:<br /><br />I was hoping for a plot but there wasn't anything much resembling it. Having said that however, it's easy enough to keep turning the page. Personally I didn't like the first person storytelling, or the character of Anastasia, who manages to say 'holy crap' every page in surprise, though she shouldn't be surprised by anything Mr Grey suggests or does by midway through this book. She's a hollow shell kind of character, so I guess perfect for what Christian Grey wants from her. I found myself stopping a few times, just to re-read a really bad sentence to make sure I didn't imagine it. Mr Grey is the only reason I kept reading it, he makes no apoligies for who he is and he's sort of funny even though he speaks to Ana like she's his dog and buys her expensive gifts when she pleases him. I want to know why he is the way he is, and I think that's why most of us continue to read it, his mystery. Or all the sex.<br /><br />I've spoken to friends, co-workers and strangers to get their opinions since I finished it and have found that people who enjoyed Twilight seemed to like this. (It may be because this book was originally Twilight fanfiction.)<br />I've also spoken to people who have never heard of fanfiction and from what I've gathered (and what they are willing to admit) the porn is why people think it's so good, some even think it's romantic. Those who know fanfiction well though, seem pretty immune to all that and aren't as wowed or simply think it's terrible and wonder how it was ever published.<br />I guess that's why it's a hit. So many people read fanfiction online and someone decided to bring it to the masses and see what happens?<br /><br />So to sum up, if you want an escape where you don't need to think, you may as well read it to find out what the fuss is about. It's a trilogy but set up so they pretty much just read through as one book. You may think it's rubbish or you might like it.

0553801473|2.0|Too many characters, too many plotlines, too many locales. Too many uses of the phrase \\"She/He was not wrong\\". GRRM along the way decided he wasn't interested in writing books (you know, those things that follow a compelling arc). Instead, he decided to simply tell a story. The problem is that the events directly following the action in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" are just not very interesting.<br /><br />ADwD has its moments however GRRM's unpredictability has become predictable. So, even when developments occured that I'm assuming GRRM designed to surprise, I've reached a point where I don't get too excited because, chances are, whatever you think is happening will be proved false in 200 pages or so.<br /><br />So, in summary, ADwD--even more than AFfC--was a disappointment. I'm not sure I'll bother with book six of the series.

0743289692|5.0|Infidel begins with the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh.  Stabbed to his chest is a five page letter addressed to Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  In her page turning memoir, Ayaan takes the reader on a geographical and religious journey through her past, detailing her life from the girl she used to be to the woman she has matured to today.<br /><br />Ayaan grew up with an eccentric grandmother, an erratic mother and she is the eldest of three siblings.  Her father drifts in and out of her life as the family moves from Somalia to Saudi Arabia, to Ethiopia and then to Kenya.  Ayaan details the traditional life of a Somalian Muslim woman from her earliest memory.  Ayaan has created a engaging memoir that takes you in the house and heart of a Muslim woman and her radical change that leads her to deny Islam's control of her life and become an Infidel.<br /><br />Ayaan escapes an arranged marriage in Germany and seeks asylum in the Netherlands.  She changes her name and lies to gain Dutch Citizenship.  She undergoes a cultural shock and a personal transformation as she figures out that she has been tricked by religion into complacency.<br />Ayaan attends college, earns her political science degree and runs for political office.<br /><br />Infidel is amazingly powerful book written by an extremely courageous woman.  I read this book aloud to my World History class and all of us were enthralled from the very first page.  We learned about Somalian history and why there are so many Somalian immigrants in our community.  We learned and had great conversations about the final days of Said Barre regime, female genital mutilation, the dangerous plight of refugees and refugee camps, arranged marriage, unstable countries, honor killings, the Muslim Brotherhood, child abuse and so much more.<br /><br />Infidel states, that of the three monotheistic religions only Islam has not been through a reformation and that for women, a reformation is essential for human rights.  Women suffer through arranged and forced marriages as young as 9 years old as well as honor killings by husbands and brothers.  If a woman is caught bringing shame to her family or committing adultery she will be killed by the male members of her family and no one prosecutes the men because it is their god given right.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali called for a change in Islam and is a crusader for Muslim women and their human rights.<br /><br />If you have not read Infidel yet, I suggest you get a copy and start reading now.  This is one of the most important books of the decade and is extremely timely as governments must find a way to incorporate new religious doctrines into their democratic societies and maintain human rights for all.ged and forced marriages as young as 9 years old as well as honor killings by husbands and brothers.

030758836X|3.0|First let me start with an apology because this isn't really a review for Girl Gone and more properly belongs on a discussion blog, but the Amazon reader-reviewers are far more thoughtful and articulate than the bloggers on the board I just visited.<br /><br />Flynn's first book, Sharp Objects, is a favorite of mine, so I looked forward to the release of Girl Gone. Then the literary reviews started coming across my desk and almost every one of them raved about Girl Gone and what a great summer read it is. And if the reviews on Amazon are to be believed, about 3/4 of you, the reader-reviewers here, find it a terrific summer read too.<br /><br />So, I forked over the $13 Kindle dollars and discovered that this is not a $13 dollar read. At least not yet, or maybe it's not for me. I'm over 30% through Girl Gone and the book has  stalled. I've moved on to Oliver Potzsch's The Dark Monk, and Christopher Moore's Sacre Bleu. But I really want a reason to go back to Girl Gone and finish it.<br /><br />Therefore, I'm looking for that %-mark where the story starts to pick up and carry me to the end. At what point does this book really become a thriller and not just a well-written exercise in he/she POV? Flynn's characters are beautifully drawn, I know what they should look like, and appreciate the candor of their conversation, but I just don't like anyone enough to want to continue reading.<br /><br />Sincerely, at what point does the novel get better?<br /><br />Thank you in advance for any comments. And to those of you that are offended by this discussion review rather than end-of-book review, I am sorry.

0307474259|5.0|His book Good Calories, Bad Calories is the best ever written on understanding food and diet in our world, but most people find the book too daunting. Here is the layman's version, but still gets to the \\"meat\\" of the matter. As somebody who exercies 3-5 days a week and has for 5 years, I have never understood why it doesn't matter how hard I work out, I will gain fat unless I take 95% of starches out of my diet. Many people have varying sensitivities to carbs, but there is no question I do. From riding my bike all over kingdom come as a kid, I was always fat and didn't understand it. Yes, I can eat a fair amount, but never understood why I would eat the same amount of foods as my friends but I was the only one gaining fat. If you struggle with obesity, read this book. It just might save your life. And this is not just another Atkins style book. To say so means you don't understand it!

B007I2BZIE|3.0|Clockwork angels is so over produced that it almost sounds sterile. The songs on this CD are going to be unbelievable live in concert! The 2000's and 2010's are going to be known as the decades of overproduction. This never ending \\"make it louder\\" mantra that the new generation of producer's seems to have is ruining great music. Everything from Vapor Trails on has been a sterile, overproduced, extremely loud recording. A real shame! It's VERY noticeable when the CD's are in shuffle mode! Try going from A Farewell to Kings to Clockwork and you'll see what I mean. Clockwork must be at least double the volume.<br /><br />The content of this new CD is superb! Halo Effect, Seven Cities of Gold, Headlong Flight, and especially \\"The Garden\\" are destined to be RUSH classics! At least in my opinion. It's great to have another concept album. It doesn't compare to any of the previous concept albums like -A Farewell to Kings, 2112, and definitely no where near Hemisphere's but still pretty good.<br /><br />I am excited about the upcoming tour! All we need now is someone to fix the recording.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|This was the first time where I can remember my 5 yr old son sitting down and watching a 2 hr movie intently. Wall-E was funny, entertaining and enjoyable for my son as well as the rest of the family. Considering the price we paid (less than $10 total) versus the price for some other Disney movies, this was also a cost-effective purchase.  The storyline itself also has some educational value, providing an interesting angle of what could happen (from a sci-fi Disney standpoint) if we do not take care of our planet. I would recommend Wall-E to friends and family without hesitation.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I highly recommend this movie! I read the source books many many years ago when I was 18 and at home for weeks with an illness. I read three complete Edgar Rice Burroughs series at one time - the Tarzan, John Carter of Mars and Pellucidar series.<br /><br />I loved the old Tarzan movies, even though they were nowhere near the books as written. I saw an adaptation of the Pellucidar books on TV as a mini-series, I believe. It was pretty mangled but I enjoyed it as well. Cut to first day of John Carter - I eagerly flocked to the earliest show I could get to and was entranced. What a relief - this one, though not getting everything exactly as in the books, had the spirit and sense of wonder I got as a young man reading the books. The production values were great, and the actors very good - especially the actress who played Dejha Thoris, who stole my heart. I recently started watching the first season of True Blood and was excited to see her in that show (though not nearly as much as I would've liked to have seen of her.)<br /><br />I was lucky because I usually try and see movies that I anticipate liking without reading reviews, so I was able to form my opinion and enjoy the experience. I wish everyone had been able to do the same, as the reviews in major news outlets panned the movie. What a shame. Others here on Amazon have done a great job of describing the movie, and so many have talked about the marketing that I won't comment on that. I do have to say that before the movie came out, there were many who were confused because there was a 2009 movie called \\"Princess Of Mars\\" starring Traci Lords and Antonio Sabato Jr. that was a straight to video release. I have not seen that one, but have heard it was shot in a very short time on a very sparse budget.<br /><br />The first thing I did when I got the Blu-Ray was to download the digital copy via iTunes. This is a true digital download and not in UltraViolet format. It is just as good on the smaller screen as it was in the theater. I will watch this movie many times.<br /><br />For the unjaded, this is a  terrific Science Fiction/Fantasy movie with lots of action and a good story.

B003Y5H5F6|2.0|This movie is a black hole that sucks all of the joy out of a once decent franchise. Kate Beckinsale in bondage-ware cannot save this steaming pile. As some are fond of quoting main press reviewers, I would suggest a trip to the Rotten Tomatoes website, where this movie has a rating of 27%. That's not too far from, say, Ishtar at 19% or Transformers: Dark Side Of The Moon at 35%. So if you must put credence in mainstream reviewers, you might want to avoid this one. Just by chance I happen to generally agree with them when it comes to this movie.<br /><br />If you //are// successful at checking your brain at the door for this one, you are still subjected to plot holes, disappearing characters and a zombie-like walk through by the main star, who must have been paid a bundle to agree to come back to make this movie. They say good things come in threes - this is proof that adequate things also come in threes - this being the //fourth// installment.

0345803485|1.0|50 Shades of Grey... What is going on? Why is everyone soo into this book?! Thank god, I didn't buy it myself!! I cant identify with either character and especially the hunky bigillionaire. Mostly, I just want to hit Christian. I definitely do not want him in my sexual head space. I have read some pretty risky stuff, but the characters are ALWAYS developed enough for me to care, and the plot is usually viable no matter what risky stuff happens. I was not masochistic enough to make it beyond 28% of this book. It hurts.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|The movie awesome. I can't wait until the second installment of Captain America. Also putting Captain America in with the other Avengers (Ironman, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow was a stroke of genius).
B007IXWKUK|1.0|After reading the first one I thought this one might be better, NOT.  It's hard to imagine that the author would be so transparent in her story and unbelievable.  You are again left with what was an obvious story line to suck you in to reading the third one.  Certainly no better than the first and certainly will not purchase the third, or any other book by this author.  Horrible writing unless you are a teenager.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I've had the pleasure of seeing Prometheus twice. The first occasion was my first exposure to IMAX/3D and it was easily the best presentation I have ever seen in a theater. That prompted me to share the experience with two UK friends who were in town for my 50th birthday. Yes, I'm old.<br /><br />The most difficult thing to overcome when reviewing Prometheus is separating the incredible presentation from the story. Should I review the experience, or just the movie itself? I have chosen to comment on both elements.<br /><br />The opening shots immediately draw you in and establish that you are about to witness something special in terms of presentation. As the camera pans over the surface of a moon, you are part of the experience. As with Avatar, you are transported to a different world. The first shot of the ship is also effective, with the roar of the engines. Kubrick would probably turn over in his grave at the technical error of portraying sound in space, but it does add something for the viewer.<br /><br />Prometheus is quite ambitious. It does a good job of explaining some of the events that led up to the mission in Alien. We are shown some of the discoveries which prompted the Weyland Corporation to explore deep space. A crew is sent to search for an incredible secret, which I won't reveal here. Unlike other films in the Alien franchise, the presence of an android is explained from the beginning. David (Fassbender) is accepted for what he is without anything being hidden. The one thing that does remain consistent is that the android knows more than he admits. Where did he get that information?<br /><br />There is more than one alien species present in Prometheus, plus the humans. The story explains the origin of the type of ship discovered in Alien and we experience a small thrill of recognition. Ridley Scott balances new information with previous events in an effective way. I came away feeling like I knew a lot more about this universe, but I didn't feel that the original film had been betrayed in any way.<br /><br />It took me several viewings over a number of years to raise my rating for Alien to 4.5/5. Perhaps because I know that film so well, Prometheus had more of an immediate impact. However, there is one thing preventing me from rating the film as highly. The character of Fifield (Sean Harris) is a blatant flaw in the film. He's a British geologist with the personality of an idiotic criminal. He's clearly intended to provide comic relief, and I admit that the audience did laugh at his comments during both viewings, but his inclusion felt so out of place. Up until that point, the film had me fully engaged. The story seemed plausible and interesting. Fifield would never have passed any serious attempt at psychological screening by the Weyland Corporation and would never have become part of the crew in any realistic scenario. His inclusion pulled me right out of the movie as soon as he spoke his opening dialogue. His scenes with Millburn (Rafe Spall) were all ludicrous and I'm forced to deduct half a point just because of their presence.<br /><br />Everything else worked.<br /><br />I'm not against the idea of humor in a serious movie. Vickers (Theron) and Janek (Idris Elba) did have an amusing exchange which was handled in a far more intelligent manner. Theron played her part well and her icy personality was believable.<br /><br />The highlight of the film for me was the unexpectedly wonderful performance from Noomi Rapace. I liked her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Dragon Tattoo trilogy and was pleasantly surprised to see her tackling a role in English. Like Alien, the movie ends with a fight for survival, and Shaw (Rapace) is the equivalent of Ripley. There's one sequence which made me laugh because it was so outlandish, but Rapace played it totally straight and still had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for her. This will upset some people, but I think she was a more effective character thanSigourney Weaver's Ripley. I like both tremendously, so I guess it doesn't matter.<br /><br />Prometheus delivers in terms of story, action, and special effects, and most of the acting is good. The conclusion left the possibility of a sequel and I wouldn't be sorry to see that happen. It's always tricky when a franchise is continued after a long absence, but Scott really pulled it off. See it in IMAX/3D while you can and buy the Blu-ray when it is eventually released.Sigourney Weaver's Ripley.

B007N85ZXY|1.0|I suppose that there may be a hidden gem in here somewhere, but after the first four tracks, I couldn't bear the pain of trying to find it. Did I expect traditional arrangements of Stephen Foster songs? Of course not, this is Neil after all. But neither did I expect Mr Young to rework them to the point of being unrecognizable.  The band may have found the Americana concept intriguing, but they should have burned the tape after the first playback. Actually, the way it sounds, maybe they didn't even bother listening to what they put down. I don't know how anyone could.

B0085A9J18|5.0|The Raid is an Indonesian action flick where the title of the movie sums up what happens, a raid. Sound's lame because there isn't much story/character? That's what that old fart Ebert thought too, however I liked how the Raid skims over it's story and goes to the action, because when you pay for your ticket to see The Raid: Redemption, are you paying to see some unnecessary padding for an action movie where a guy crys about the meaning of life, or are you paying for psychotic Asian dudes screaming and beating the living s*** out of each other? Ebert should stick to the Human Centipede 2 and let action fans that actually enjoy this genre judge this film on it's own merits.<br /><br />So for a second in the opening you see this guy with his pregnant wife, and start thinking to yourself \\"wtf is this boring tripe?\\", and that's basically the director giving you a minute to find your seats and start munching on popcorn before suddenly we see a group of SWAT guys driving to a huge apartment complex while being briefed on their mission: take out the drug lord. Once they break in using realistic tactics the s*** hits the fan in the best way possible and the rest of the movie for me was a blur of ass kicking.<br /><br />The stunts and the choreography are incredible, the fights and the tactics all have an inventive wit to them to keep the whole story interesting, at no point in the movie did I go \\"that's stupid and unrealistic\\". The weapons used range from machetes to assault rifles, and they're all used (well the sniper rifles were a bit underutilized) in even more frantic fights. When the movie isn't a bunch of guys kicking each others asses it's the remaining SWAT members laying low and assessing the situation, still keeping the film entertaining without being mindnumbing.<br /><br />The moment when I went \\"holy s*** this is badass\\" was when a guy has a fluorescent light rod stuck in his neck and is still beating up two guys at the same time, jesus christ just thinking about this movie again is giving me a stiffy.<br /><br />Also it looks like a Hollywood remake is in the works, I'm surpised they haven't announced yet the inevitable remake of the US remake.out this movie again is giving me a stiffy.<br /><br />Also it looks like a Hollywood remake is in the works, I'm surpised they haven't announced yet the inevitable remake of the US remake.

B0007TKNII|5.0|I have always loved this movie and wanted to own it for myself inside of always borrowing it from my friends. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it either. So, when I gound the movie for a very good price I bought it immediately. When it arrived in the mail, I was excited to see that it was in excellent condition and I knew I wouldn't have to worry about it not working. Then, when I watched it for the first time, there was no problems. I am very happy with this purchase and I will be shopping here again.

0345803507|5.0|Very good book for the type of book it is.  The trilogy moved along smoothly.  Some parts made me laugh, some parts made me cry.  The people that were so critical of these books simply didn't read them for what they were.  Will these books ever become American Classics? More than likely not.  As far as originality... it was a cross between Pretty Woman and Cinderella. That being said, some parts were very repetitious.  The two main characters couldn't be within 3 feet of each other before they were all over each other.  The books are written from the perspective of 21 year old virgin, who's first sexual experience is BDSM.  Over all they were well written and fun to read.  I don't know if there will be a book four of this set... but if there is, I will buy it and read it.  I would probably read any other book this author wrote.
B0044KU7KU|4.0|I'm one of those that really did not give MCR a chance because they were emo or punk or I don't know; I was just judging I admit. Then out of the blue, when this album came out, I just happened to turn to MTV2 and saw the music video for Na Na Na, and it literally blue me away. Not just the song, but the visual style of the music video.<br /><br />And then Sing is an even better song and a better music video.<br /><br />But, here's the thing. It's a Post-Apocalyptic concept album--the same with Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns. And they both came out around the same time. It was like when The Prestige and The Illusionist were in theaters. Most people saw The Prestige (A Thousand Suns--and with very mixed results, but I loved it), and not enough people saw the Illusionist (MCR TTLOTFK). It's a shame too many people were fussing about how they hate Linkin Park's experimental career instead of giving MCR a chance. In other words, ATS sort of cast a shadow over MCR since they both had similiar albums and ATS was a little bit more contraversial.<br /><br />I have listened to Black Parade; it's been in my CD for a while back a year ago. And I can truthfully saw that this album is better (and I have no reason to be bias toward one or the other, but I can say that Linkin Park's ATS may have helped me like this album more).<br /><br />If you liked this album, you would probably like Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns, and vice versa.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm a sucker for survival after the end of the world stories and Wool doesn't disappoint. The first few chapters are a bit of a slog but push through and you'll be rewarded. The characters are well written and the basic theory is interesting and internally consistent. Although sold as an \\"omnibus\\" it's realistically just one book. Buying the original books separately would have been like buying a chapter.

B007U1FEJE|4.0|I had heard and caught nothing but good buzz about this newest and most unlikely, and unexpected, album of the Beach Boys, yes the REAL Beach Boys, meaning with Brian Wilson in the line-up. So I finally picked this up the other day, for reasons I'll explain later.<br /><br />\\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" *12 tracks; 39 min.) starts off with a mind-blowing 1 min. a cappella (with some piano) of the guys, just harmonizing. It sounds heavenly, and as if it came in a time capsule from 45 years ago. The title track (and 1st single) follows, and it is quite good, but certainly not the best song on here. \\"Isn't It Time\\" is just of several songs that reminisces (\\"Remember those nights we spent just you and I/Little did we know how time would fly\\"). \\"Spring Vacation\\" is as light-hearted as anything on here (\\"Spring vacation/Good vibration/Summer weather/We're back together\\"), and back together these guys are indeed, and what a delight it is. Most songs are written by Brian Wilson and producer Joe Thomas, although Mike Love does write a nice \\"Daybreak Over the Ocean\\". But the best songs on here are back-loaded, starting with \\"From There to Back Again\\", which is perhaps the most 'classic' sounding Beach Boys track on here. It is followed by a short (1'30\\") but amazing and pensive \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\", in which Brian Wilson pnders \\"Sometime I realize/My days are getting on/Sometimes I realize/It's time to move along/And I wanna go home\\". The closer (co-written with Jon Bon Jovi) is an equally outstanding \\"Summer's Gone\\".<br /><br />In all, this is a shockingly good album and easily the best Beach Boys album in the last 35 years or so. I had the good fortune of catching the Beach Boys last week here in Cincinnati on their 50th anniversary tour, and what a fantastic show that was. They played 2 full sets, comprising close to 50 (not a typo) songs. They played songs I thought I'd never, ever hear live, and also the title track and \\"Isn't It Time\\" from this album, and frankly I wished they had played a few more from here, but I'm not complaining. What an outstanding evening of music that was. It was after that concert that I just had to pick up this album. Glad I did. \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!I wished they had played a few more from here, but I'm not complaining. What an outstanding evening of music that was.

0345803485|1.0|If you enjoyed Twilight, you'll, more likely than not, love this. If you have an education and an appreciation for even the most mediocre of writing, you'll hate this book. The characters are one dimensional, the plot is elementary and the writing is poor. Period. That's NOT debateble. I read halfway through it and stopped because there was no need to continue. The book does NOT need to be 500+ pages. There is literally nothing significant driving the plot. I stopped around page 350 because there was nothing else that needed to be said. It's the typical \\"girl wants a relationship, boy wants a sex buddy\\" except this boy wants a sexual slave for weeks at a time. Even the erotica is lackluster. It's not anything special and certainly not as addictive or titillating as many other reviews are saying. The story is also incredibly unrealistic. Anastasia has the mind of a homely 14 year old girl living on a ranch in the midwest, yet she's actually a gorgeous senior in college who had no email address until Christian bought her a MacBook Pro (I hope I'm not the only one who caught the fact that jobs sent her LETTERS IN THE MAIL asking to interview her post graduation. Who actually folds up their résumé and cover letter into an envelope and puts it in a mailbox? Not a 22 year old college student that's for sure.). She's never had any sort of sexual encounter, but somehow she's a professional at oral sex. She's never had any sort of sexual encounter, but somehow she's willing to sign over her sexual freedom to a troubled billionaire who wants to use her as a willing submissive (read as: sex slave) for weeks at a time?! C'mon that's just ridiculous! The way she describes sexual experiences is SO immature you can't help but laugh when reading it. You're 22, Anastasia. It's your vagina not your \\"down there.\\" Christian Grey is also ridiculous. He has more depth than Anastasia, but at the end of the day his life is still impossible. He's supposed to be an incredibly attractive, self-made BILLIONAIRE who's only 26? Oh and he cures world hunger in his free time? Sure that's TOTALLY realistic. In the 350 pages I read, I'm pretty sure she doesn't even mention how exactly it is he made his billions, which wouldn't matter if the story wasn't already absurd. Along with being an abercrombie model he's also supposed to be some sex god as shown by his ability to invoke orgasms with as little as a look in Anastasia's direction. Everything he does sends Anastasia into sexual ecstasy and every orgasm is, of course, earth shattering and better than the one before. It's absolutely ridiculous. When I did some research and found out that this story started as Twilight fan fiction I was not surprised. The relationship between the two characters is very Edward and Bella minus the glittery vampires. They're drawn to each other for some reason they can't explain, they slowly become obsessed with each other and eventually Christian opens up to the idea of changing his ways while this woman, who was once independent, is now at the beck and call of this man who before the end of the book had no plans of committing to her. Out of all the men to want to love you, Anastasia chooses the one who makes a sex contract for all of his women to sign? Maybe as a 20 year old college student, I'm too young for the targeted bored middle age housewife demographic, but this is seriously an awful novel.<br /><br />I'm also not really sure how they're going to turn this novel into a movie when 90% of the dialogue in Anastasia conversing with her \\"inner goddess\\" or biting her lip.
B000SEI230|4.0|The book was beautiful. I love how Landon felt for Jaime. He truly loved her.  The book wasn't long and that's probably a good thing.  Overall I thought the book was just ok. I probably would've gave it 3 stars but I gave it 4 stars because I loved loved the movie and found it to be much better.  The book is very similar to the movie with some differences but I just really found the book not as good as the movie and that's rare.  Usually books are much better than movies.  However, if you loved the movie like me than I would still suggest you read the book.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|This album can't touch \\"mykonos\\" or the self titled \\"fleet foxes\\". Its not a bad album, but if you are expecting the brilliance of the first two albums, you will likely find this suffers a bit by comparison.  Fleet Foxes first two albums were truly inspired; they have spent more time in my stereo than any other over the last 5 years.  Certainly start with the early music if you are new to the group.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|You ever hear the saying \\"Just because you love each other doesn't you mean you should be together\\", well this book makes that statement more true than ever.  They truly are head over heels in love with each other.  They way she feels for him is beautiful, his feelings for her is beautiful too BUT they really don't need to be together.  Their relationship is very dysfunctional.  They cause more havoc when they are together than when they are apart.  He's crazy about her and he is likely to go to jail for all the things he'll do for her.  In real life, their relationship would probably end with a murder suicide situation. One of those, \\"if I can't have you nobody can\\" type of situations.<br /><br />Some viewers didn't like the type of relationship the characters were involved in but that is the point of the story.  It's beautiful yet a disaster.  She's running way from life and he's bringing her back into it.  I love the story because it show the bad sides of loving too much or being with someone that is not healthy for you.  The characters had major flaws too, for example, Travis is just waaayyy too possessive and that's not good at all.  Abby wants to satisfy everyone except herself and that's not healthy either. For example, she knows Travis is bad for her but her desire to satisfy him won't allow her to leave. That's not good either.<br /><br />I like the book and it was definitely different from the many other romance novels.  I think people that didn't like the story just isn't open to seeing the bad sides of love and probably are hopeless romantics.<br /><br />My only concern is that I wouldn't want readers to read this book and believe the behavior of Travis and Abby is acceptable because it's not. It's still just a book.

B004LWZW42|4.0|X-Men: First Class<br /><br />This was quite a surprising movie. It reminded me that with a good script, and being true to the fan base, you can have a good film with relatively unknown, or at least, up-and-coming actors. They all did commendable jobs of filling the shoes of the more famous actors. Magneto, Professor X, Beast, Mystique--they all came across perfectly.<br /><br />I was also able to appreciate the feel of the movie. Set amid the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the film drinks deeply of the 1960s. It was Mod Squad Meets Blofeld, with the hip youth--Professor X chugging after his degree (a nod to Feynman),  Mystiques hip fashions, Shaw's stylized submarine (a la Austin Power's mojo jet). And not to mention Bacon's Ace Ventura hairstyle, and Scooby-doo suit. It all works.<br /><br />Yet the film retains the distinctive X-Man-ness of the first four films. And that may be a weakness. Some of the plot elements were already dealt with: the anti-mutant serum, accepting a mutantness (\\"Mutant and Proud\\"), \\"outing\\" mutants,  government friction, etc. These were all covered in earlier movies. Not only is this boring, but sells the franchise short. There is more to mutanthood than was depicted.<br /><br />And the clich&eacute;d gentleman's club was a bit over the top, along with a second house of ill repute. One per film, please. And there were two prescient bald jokes. One per film, please.<br /><br />That's the bad, aside from Jackman's funny but predictable potty-mouth. None per film, please. And killing off the black actor was also a movie clich&eacute;.

B004SEUJYG|5.0|George Patton was the scion of a wealthy family in California. He was an athlete and sailed his own boat to Hawaii in the 1930s to assume a command. He was a member of the US Olympic team in 1912, competing in the modern pentathlon.  He served in World War I and his interest in armour began here with command of the US Tank Corps.  The movie takes up his career when he was assigned to replace General Freydendall after the battle of Kasserine Pass in which green American troops were routed by the Germans under General Rommel. The movie is pretty accurate although Patton had a high pitched voice, unlike the growling baritone George C Scott adopted in the role. Having read a biography of General Marshall, I don't believe that Patton was as much at risk of being sent home as is depicted in the movie. Marshall and Eisenhower well well aware of Patton's strength as a troop commander. He, himself, recognized that he was no politician and was marginally suited for high command in which politics are as important as military genius.<br /><br />The movie has established the reputation of Patton with the public, which has a probably hazy impression of Wold War II by now. It is well done and the Blue Ray version is a visual treat. Scott won an Academy Award for the role, which was well deserved. Karl Malden does well playing General Bradley and, as Bradley was technical advisor for the film, it is no surprise that he comes out of it as the wise adult to Patton's brash immaturity at times. Some of the scenes that appear exaggerated, such as the \\"weather prayer\\" and Patton's belief in reincarnation, are accurate and add to the man's reputation as an eccentric. The movie is excellent and holds up well after all these years.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|These ten tracks are quite a departure from Fiona's previous works.  Fiona has always presented a turbulent frame of mind, but she really seems to be having fun with expressing these conflicting emotions on her latest release.<br /><br />It's true, the sound quality is a bit lacking, but not to the point where I found it distracting or annoying.  I think so many of us are used to multi-million dollar productions, that anything less than pristine, auto-tuned, multi-tracked songs is baffling.  But if you can get over that, you'll thoroughly enjoy the truly acoustic sound of these bare-bones tracks.  Piano and drums never sounded better together.

0316023744|5.0|As a longtime World War II buff I have read most of the major works on that hellish conflict written in English. Only a few months ago I perused Max Hastings excellent \\"Inferno: 1939-1945.\\" Hasting's bookis more anecdotal and opiniated than that of his fellow Brit Anthony Beevor. These are the two one volume histories of the war I would recommend in a course of study on that terrible time. Beevor's great work is a tough military account of the World War II which claimed over 60 million persons and untold hell throughout the world.<br />  The book is divided into 50 relatively concise chapters. In 800 pages of clearly written prose, Beevor covers all the major campaigns of the war including:<br />Hitler's invasions of Poland, Czech, France, Scandinavia, Holland, Demark, Lux., Beligum, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, North Africa and most importanly the Soviet Union. On June 21 the Wehrmacht attacted the Soviets with an army of over 3.5 million troops.<br />The major battles on the Russian front are all given coverage including: Leningrad, Stalingrad, the tank battle of Kursk and Operation Bagration in which Stalin's hordes attacked the German home land from the Vistula to the Oder and the capture of Berlin.<br />The Pacific War is also covered in depth featuring American and Japanese strategy. We witness the horror of such jungle infernos as Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and the dropping of the atomic bombs over Hiroshama and Nagasaki which brought the long war to an end. Over 1 million Japanese died in the futile war against the United States and Great Britain.<br />General Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines is discussed in depth.<br />Beevor discusses the strengths, weaknesses and rivalries of such Allied military commanders as Eisenhower, Montgomery, Omar Bradley and among the Russians: Zukov and Konev.<br />Mussolin and the Italian Fascist movement is discussed as well as the Allies campaigns up the boot of Italy to Rome.<br />Beevor, who has an excellent book on D-Day, does well in his chapters on the D-Day invasion of France on June 6, 1944<br />Beevor devotes several chapters to the shoah of the Jewish people by the cruel inhuman Nazi regime,<br />The Sino-Japanese war and the civil war between Mao's Communists and Chaing-Kai-Chek's natonalist forces are covered.<br />William Slim, Claire Chennault and Vinegar Joe Stilwell's battles in the CBI theatre are explored (China-Burma-India).<br />  In addition to succinct coverage of military operations, Beevor is also good at examining the political and military strategy pursued by the leaders of the major participants in the slaughter. Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin and Hitler's plans are stated in language a general reader can comprehend. The book contains several excellent and well drawn maps, has an extensive bibliography (found on the author's website) and extensive footnotes for further reading. It can be read with profit from cover to cover or a person could focus in on a particular subject of the complex war.<br />  We are fortunate to live in a democratic society free from the muderous regimes of the Nazis, Soviets, Italian and Japanese war machines. This book is not for the squeamish. There are many bloody horrors in these 800 pages. The book is an essential one volume popular history that will much discussed, quoted and used in studying World War II.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|As with most authors, George R. R. Martin is beginning to run out of gas, writing wise. Or purposely churning out dogs to pad his income on this chronology.<br />The book takes you away from the main characters and fills it with dull ones which hold no interest.<br />It also adds new dull characters, on top of the old dull ones.<br />Also too much redundant passages as well.<br />I think HBO is going to have to take some extreme measure in artistic license for this stretch and possibly the next for 'Game of Thrones' to avoid being canceled. It is rumored that the next book will possibly be as bad as this one.<br />Martin is no spring chicken and notorious for slow writing.<br />Will he even be around to finish this saga ?

1439152799|3.0|I enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books,  especially The Forgotten Garden. This was my second favorite.  I think she had a great idea, and it started out INCREDIBLE, but fizzled towards the end.<br /><br />From the description, I was expecting that it would be my all-time favorite book. I was disappointed though, because I felt as though she could have done so much more with the mysterious parts of the story, especially the sounds in the walls. She left several loose ends that, once tied together, could have made the story unbelievable! It felt like she had the skeleton of a masterpiece, and she was just in a hurry to finish it.<br /><br />I wish that he had made this book into a trilogy. Had she...it could truly have been epic. Such a disappointment.

0143034901|5.0|WOW! What an amazing read. This book is so full of twists and turns, it will keep you guessing until the end. I am a HUGE fan of gothic literature, and an avid reader, so it is hard to keep me guessing. However, I was stumped many times with this one.<br /><br /> I have to give a warning though. If you are someone who wants an easy read, this is NOT it. I had to stop after reading 200 pages and skim for information. There are many MANY stories and characters involved in this literary masterpiece, so I had to take notes to keep everyone straight. I also had to take marginal notes on the side.<br /><br />Rest assured, for experienced readers and fans of gothic literature, this one is a home run!

0307592731|5.0|Having done a lot of backpacking in the Sierras, the premise of the book sounded very appealing. What I didn't expect was a life story that was very touchIng and instrumental to her success in achieving her goal. Her first day on the trail was so difficult that most people would have given up saying it was a complete mistake. But she had something in her that kept her going. Solitary hiking & camping can be very intimidating when you're so far from civilization, especially the nights. And her relentless desire to keep going when you know she's really suffering physically. It is a great story and one that should be made into a movie.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Zombie Apocalypse is real in this TV show depiction of the graphic novels.<br /><br />The character depictions are strong, the visuals and the CGI are actually incredible (especially in the first episode where there is a half-bodied zombie), the storyline actually existent.<br /><br />A lot of times zombie stories are simple: ooo zombie, ooo the main character must outrun them. The walking Dead questions that stereotype and actually creates real, tangible drama between the human characters. They feel, they love, they make decisions that hurt others (cheating, choosing to commit suicide, etc.).<br /><br />Don't be surprised if you watch it in one (or in my case two) sitting. Be prepared to buy season 2 from Amazon or iTunes, as the [[ASIN:B005LAJ22Q The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season]] set doesn't come out until August 28, 2012.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|These headphones have finally broken in for me (about 150 hours), and the sound quality is now so outstanding that I feel compelled to provide some praise for them.<br /><br />Sound quality: In a word, excellent. Out of the box the highs were slightly dominating, though not to an unpleasant degree. Given ample break-in time, the bass response slowly matured and is now in perfect balance with the rest of the spectrum. The term \\"reference\\" is entirely accurate; the bass response is not overdone nor is it overly modest. There is absolutely no muddiness in the bass. However, I think that the range where these phones really excel is the high end; the clarity provided by the high end response is unlike any other hi-fi system I have heard (I think the response goes up to 39kHz). In light of this, other sound systems sound slightly muffled after listening to these phones.<br /><br />Imaging: The soundstage is very wide, in the best possible sense. You feel very immersed in the sound, and every voice has it's own identifiable place in the spatial mix.<br /><br />Comfort: The pads are designed such that nothing is actually touching the cartilage of your ear, so there isn't much \\"ear fatigue\\" that comes with other over-ear cans. The strap seems to be hit-or-miss for most people; for me it feels fine. I could wear these for hours. The fact that the drivers are so far from the ears gives the sound a very unobtrusive quality; at times you can forget you're even wearing headphones. The fully open back also contribues to this effect.<br /><br />The build seems solid. I'm not sure how far these will stray from my desk so I doubt that will even be an issue.<br /><br />Finally, I highly recommend driving these with a dedicated headphone amp and/or a quality DAC. The difference they make is significant, and, for the quality of these phones, most likely worth it.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|First of all, the movie is very true to the book. It leaves out Katniss' toughts, some scenes like Prim's goat and the Avox girl, and changes the ending a tiny bit, but other than that it condenses a book that takes several hours to read in a movie format remarkably well. The movie even adds some subplots.<br /><br />I have to compare this book to two other serires: I think I read the whole 7 Harry Potter books in a couple of weeks, three at most. I only read the first book of the Twilight saga, and found it too high-schoolish. The Hunger Games falls somewhere in between: entertaining, not a grown-up book, but not as simple as Twilight either.<br /><br />I'll definitely read the next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so happy they finally came out with temple run on the kindle fire it makes me so happy love it
1936608898|5.0|I have read many books on health, nutrition and weight loss. Compared to everything I've read thus far, this is my favorite. The authors present their information in an easily understood, conversational manner. However, it's not \\"cutesy\\" or dumbed-down, either.<br /><br />This well-written book strikes the perfect balance between too much information and a too-simplistic eating plan. Let's face it, not all of us absorb medical jargon with great enthusiasm, and some of us are sick of those diet/health books that contain 200 pages of condescending fluff. This book provides references and recommended reading if you want to go further, but it isn't a science journal. It also isn't a lightweight entertainment book that you cast aside after one reading. You will probably want to refer to it again and again because of its enlightening information and practical advice. Money well-spent.<br /><br />Do you think you've heard it all and you know everything about health, diet, weight loss? Tired of the whole subject, but still struggling with crappy health issues or excess weight? Try this book. It's a road map to optimal health.<br /><br />The first part of the book explains how our bodies grow unhealthy. The second part is the plan to regain or improve health, which includes weight loss - if applicable. No matter what your health issues are, and how much weight you have to lose-or not, you will be able to use the information in this book to both feel and look better.<br /><br />Be advised - this is not another fad diet book or wacky health plan. This is the real thing, and when they state it will change your life, I really don't think that they are exaggerating at all.<br /><br />This book is a must-read for anyone who is frustrated and struggling with poor health, diabetes, auto-immune issues, weight loss, or even those little \\"annoyances\\" like allergies, frequent sinus infections, headaches, etc. It's also a must-read for people who think that they are reasonably healthy and doing everything right, but still haven't achieved optimum health. So really, this book is for everyone. Give it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.d doing everything right, but still haven't achieved optimum health. So really, this book is for everyone. Give it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I love reading Sophie Kinsella books.  Loved the Shopaholic series (except the last couple with the baby, which was just too much) but all her other non-Shopaholic books have been excellent!  This one was great - woman blurts out her 'secrets' to a total stranger thinking that she will die in a plane crash - only they don't.  And it turns out she keeps bumping into this guy to boot.  Great read.  Keep em coming Sophie!

B005LAJ1O0|3.0|I used to be so into this show. I would wait all week for it to come on, and when the time came I'd be curled up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn waiting rather impatiently for the opening credits. BUT, as the season progressed I found a couple of things that were starting to get on my nerves a bit. One being the character Tate. He was interesting at first, but by the end of the show you just want him to disappear. All he's ever done is wine about Violet and pine over her constantly. That's all there is to him, really. The next annoying part of the show was probably the maid. I have nothing against the older woman, since her part in the show has promise, but I don't like the fact that they have the slutty version of her prancing around trying to seduce Ben multiple times in every episode. Seemed a bit like a desperate cry from the producers saying, \\"PLEASE WATCH OUR SHOW\\", because really, her part could have been toned down a whole lot and the show would have still been just as good - if not better.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a novel that stands as a testament to the drama and tension of the world we live in, but the ending was less than I'd hoped. To get that little bit of unpleasantness out of the way, I felt that Peter Van Houten had far too large a role in this story and his very presence at the end managed to poison what was otherwise a very heartfelt and contemplative denouement. Sure, there are ways to possibly rationalize why someone would've behaved like that, but it just got unbelievable and he needed to have exited the story for good a few scenes earlier. Recommencing praise, the writing, characterization, and voice were all of the highest caliber, and it's a pleasure to have this coming from a story that doesn't feature superpowers or other paranormal/fantasy elements that have all but subsumed the YA genre. One last thing to quibble over, video games really became something of a crutch to form the setting as the story went on too. More could've been done to vary what the characters were doing while having their dialog, but overall the book struck just the right tone and had a substantial load of surprises, wit, and charm.<br /><br />When it comes right down to it, this is a book that needs to be read. It's excellence defined and entertaining to boot. Bravo!
B004EPZ08O|3.0|Final Destination was amazing when it first came out, but it's just been getting cheaper and lazier it seems. The only fun I really got out of this movie was the twist in the end. As a matter of fact, whenever anyone I talk to mentions this movie, all they have to talk about is the twist. Nothing else is really all that great. It's just another alright FD movie, with more CGI. I think they should have stopped around part 3. I'm just waiting for them to explain this \\"death\\" entity in more depth, and when they make another one, I hope that's the direction they'll go in.

1589949811|5.0|If you like board games or card games The Lord of the rings: The card game is a must buy.  It can be played solo or up to four players.  In this game you have your own deck and you are against one encounter deck.  You have to complete quests while the encounter deck is throwing enemys and other things at you.  When the game eventually gets a bit boring you can buy expansions!  There are 14 expansions and more coming out!  In The Lord of the rings: The card game you can build your own decks to fight enemys and complete quests.  With each expansion you get a bunch of new cards that you can add to your choices of what to put in your deck.  This THE best game i have ever played i will enjoy it for a long time.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This is a beautiful movie, even if you did not like sci-fi, the scenes are so beautiful, colors so vivid, Cameron truly created an entire world of beauty.

1400069289|4.0|Hi, I just finished reading \\"The Power of Habit: Why we do what we do in life and Business\\" and have to admit that it was a good read and went much quicker than I expected it to be.<br /><br />I approached this book coming from \\"Get Things Done\\" by David Allen, and \\"Seven Habits from highly Effective People\\" by Steven R. Covey, so I was looking for something that would be a tool for adjustment.<br /><br />After saying that, the book does deliver a message and it is not too bad.  I won't go into deep analysis in the message, or how it pertains to me and how it revolutionized my life.<br /><br />Having said that, the book attempts to straddle the genre of Self Help / Corporate culture / Societal observations and change.  It does successfully cover these topics, but for me it felt it accomplished this task of breadth at the expense of depth, so the message presented is a little simpler than expected, which I am sure that other reviewers would go to in greater detail.<br /><br />One thing that did surprise me was that about a whole third of the book was related to references and support of the statements that Charles Duhigg presented.  From the back flap, he says that he is a journalist, and I guess one of his habits is he needs to substantiate his claims and observations with references of where those views came from.

B007VTVGFQ|4.0|I'm not going to say much about the music, which I'm sure will be discussed at length by others. Suffice to say that your opinion of previous Fiona Apple albums (mine is positive) is unlikely to change with this one. \\"Hot Knife\\" is my personal favorite track, a jazzy/tribal/choral number accompanied by tympani and occasional sparse piano.<br /><br />Rather, let's talk about the Deluxe Edition packaging. It's a forty page booklet (not counting the sturdy card stock cover), styled like a composition notebook, and filled with handwritten material: song lyrics, recording credits, and many doodles in pencil, pen, and crayon. One appears to be watercolor. There's a foldout 10x10\\" version of the album cover with a pencil sketch of a dog on the back. (Fiona shows herself to be an able and imaginative sketch artist.)  Also included in the package were two 4.5x6.5\\" glossy photos: One of a piano with Fiona's name cut into it, and the other a hair-obscured picture of her face.<br /><br />I had no difficulty removing the CD and DVD from the front and back covers of the booklet, but if you're not careful, a scratch might occur.  Overall, the deluxe package is of high quality, well worth a couple of extra dollars even without the DVD, and moreso with it. It certainly has more personality than you'll get just downloading the MP3 version.

This book leads you on a journey and keeps you hoping things with turn out well for her family.  Learned a great deal, but was sad for this family.
0345803485|1.0|I am appalled and dismayed that this writer has somehow (through her contacts in the television industry most likely) sold SO MANY copies of this really badly written book. It's clear she's been highly influenced by the Twilight series because the energies of Edward and Bella are obviously imprinted on the more shallow characters of Ana and Christian Grey (as in fifty shades).<br /><br />I realized by the end of the first chapter that this was a \\"cheap thrills\\" story and the author probably also read a number of Nancy Drew Mysteries and Harlequin Romance fluff pieces to create the main body of this book.<br /><br />E.L. James does have one skill, the ability to make her readers turn to the next page but the further you go into this book, the more you'll feel like you've binged on the worst junk food! I skipped forward to read excerpts of later chapters and found that the characters stay fairly two dimensional throughout. I opted for self control and refused to ingest anymore of the empty calories that Fifty Shades of Grey spoon feeds its readers, and gave the book to a neighbor. Although in doing so, I may have lost a friend and my closest source for borrowing a missing ingredient for one of my recipes! And that is a perfect analogy for this book - too many missing ingredients.<br /><br />Here's my list of complaints and/or reasons not to buy anymore books from this series:<br /><br />1) Main character, Ana, is graduating from college as the story begins and allegedly has some wit about her since she's a good student, HOWEVER; she's a virgin AND has never masturbated (or as Ana would say, \\"touched myself DOWN THERE\\"). Okay - we all know that unless you're bound by strict religious moral codes OR have an aversion to your own body and sexuality, you're going to have at least touched yourself \\"down there\\" and more likely have had sex by this time. So, how does this sexually out-of-touch college grad end up having \\"multiple orgasms on cue\\" every time she hooks up with Grey? Grey sneezes; Ana bursts into orgasm, Grey takes off sweater; Ana bursts into multiple orgasms, Grey looks deeply into Ana's eyes; Ana is overcome with cascading orgasms...R-E-A-L-L-Y???<br /><br />2) Main male character, Christian, is a gazillionaire at the ripe age of 27 years (yes, that's TWENTY-SEVEN) and, exhibits the self-control and controlling nature of a man at least in his mid to late 30s. [WHY could you not have made him just a bit more believable Ms. James? Christian could have been 33 years old and still looked like Adonis AND interested flighty Ana.]<br />  Just for the sake of comparison let's look at 2 other 27 or 28 year olds; Prince William and Mark Zuckerberg for instance. Both are extremely rich and accomplished for their ages yet neither of these real life guys could hold a candle to the confidence, success, sexiness, and steely self-control exhibited by the amazing 27 year old Christian Grey! Subsequently, this book has more in common with a bad Sci-Fi/Fantasy than an actual erotic romance.<br /><br />3) Besides the fact that Ana is way too old to have never had any physical intimacy by herself, or with other partners, the author also depicts this character as flaky, impressionable, and totally lacking in maturity or true self confidence. Ana bites her lip, blushes, stammers, stumbles, rolls her eyes, yet somehow considers herself to have an \\"Inner Goddess,\\" which completely contradicts her other habits and behaviors.<br /><br />4) This is NOT romantic erotica. I mean from the sex scenes that I read, I would say this is some pretty boring, run-of-the-mill sex stuff. I just re-read \\"The Lover\\" by Marguerite Duras - now that is erotic romance. (It was also made into a fairly good movie). Ladies/fellow readers; if you want to read a real erotic romance that has a similar story line as SHADES, check out \\"Every Night I'm Yours\\" by Christie Kelley. Jaci Burton and Joey W. Hill's books will also provide plenty of erotica -- IF you REALLY want steam and not just a thin little mist.<br /><br />5) The author is British but writes about American characters and does a really bad job of placing them in the US Northwest (which she, James, is obviously unfamiliar with). She also has Ana, Christian, and other characters using Brit language which is really bizarre. I'm still not sure what the heck a \\"rucksack\\" is!<br /><br />In closing I have one suggestion for Ms. James. Practice some erotic awakening in your own life so you can \\"write about what you KNOW!\\" If you cannot bring yourself to write the word \\"vagina\\" then you shouldn't be writing in this genre.

B004ZZS4CC|2.0|This book is so so. I was able to read the whole book except the last part. It is nothing but diary entries, and I found it boring. Some parts of the book seemed to be written by someone else. It states that she was held captive for all those years and never went to school during the time. At times the book seemed to be written by a child ( which is understandable), but then it would switch to sounding like a very well educated adult was writing it. It would have been better if it stayed the same throughout.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|I admit, I was initially disappointed with \\"The Absence,\\" having been so very fond of \\"My One and Only Thrill.\\" But it grew on me with repeated listenings, as I put my preconceived notions aside. Stylistically, \\"The Absence\\" is more akin to \\"Thrill\\" than \\"Worrisome Heart,\\" full of bossanova flavor, but peppered with more South American rhythms and spiciness this time around. Can't wait to hear what corner of the world Melody will take us next!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a WOW book. I have never read anything like this before! If you like erotica, then this is what you want to read. I just wonder how many \\"Shades of Grey\\" babies there will be in 9 months!!!!
0240815807|5.0|Whether you are new to recording or a seasoned pro, you will no doubt experience a lot of \\"Aha!\\" moments when you read \\"Mixing Secrets.\\" Mike Senior explains even the most technical processes clearly and simply, with that trademark British humor that makes everything a little easier to digest. To say this book has fundamentally changed my approach to studio work would be a gross understatement. It will train you to use plug-ins that you may have never used or understood before; it will also train you to use what you have more effectively. \\"Mixing Secrets\\" is definitely one of the best (and cheapest) investments you can make in your studio. Also, I highly recommended buying the kindle version and installing the app on your recording computer so you can take advantage of the embedded links to the audio samples.

In what was once North America lies the brutal empire of Panem, divided into twelve districts subject to the cruel rule of The Capitol, whose residents lead frivolous lives of complete ease supported by the never ending toil of the districts' population.  In District 12 lives young Katniss Everdene,who labors to support her mother and younger sister  by illegally hunting.<br /><br />To emphasize its complete authority, each year the Capitol puts on the Hunger Games, brutal fights between young boys and girls chosen by lot from the districts.  In Volume I Katniss becomes her district's female tribute and serves alongside a boy she barely knows, Peeta. In Volume 2 Katniss and Peeta, assisted by Katniss's best friend Gale and others, begin to resist the Capitol's hegemonic control, and in the final volume the conflict comes to a violent, somewhat equivocal, end.<br /><br />Its best to buy the three volumes of The Hunger Games together because once you finish one you'll want to start the next right away.  Katniss and her compatriots are appealing, if not always very likeable, and the brutal world of Panem is well described.  Suzanne Collins' writing is sometimes uneven and never rises to literary heights, but she knows how to tell a compelling story. I appreciated the fact that the trilogy ends without an \\"they all lived happily ever after\\" ending, and that even the \\"good guys\\" have some warts of their own.
B0086700CM|5.0|it cool n a fun game to play wen bored its the best game that I hv been waiting for it to come out on kindle fire
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read a lot but I rarely pay this much for a book because the truth is that they are rarely ever worth it. Not this time! I loved this book. I am an avid reader of mysteries/thrillers and within a few pages or chapters I have the entire story all wrapped up. About 50% of the way through, when I started to feel the same way and a little disappointed, this book threw me a twist that was so shocking I gasped out loud and I was thrilled about it. What a great plot. I enjoyed the writing style and the different first person accounts. It was really unique and different. It was entertaining and I couldn't put it down. Even better than that is I didn't want it to end. My feelings toward the characters were all over the place and my mind was spinning trying to figure out what was going to come next. It's a roller coaster that you want to keep riding over and over again.
0345803493|3.0|There was way too much repetition. She came undone was mentioned way more than necessary. Don't even get me started on her bloody inner goddess!!! That goddess was mentioned 15-30 times at least!! I get that Ana's ego was pumped when something went her way but come on. Couldn't the author come up with any other way to say it than IG? UGH!!! An editor should've pointed these details out. I did like that Anna was standing up to him more. Telling her he was smothering her,that she needed freedom and that she wasn't asking permission to spend time with her freind (Jose)she was informing him that she was doing it. Signs of hope. Until he informed her that the doctor was coming over to do something to her (w/o asking her first) because he didn't want to wear a condom. Not for her comfort at all. When she points out that it's her body he says its mine too, she just basically goes along with his wishes. This girl lets all of her sense and self-respect go for good sex and an overbearing, control freak of a man. While I did enjoy the book the first one was better.
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|Barbarella Psychedella.  Jane Fonda and Roger Vadim's trippy collaboration based on an equally trippy French comic book by Jean-Claude Forest.  A 41st Century Earth envoy is sent in search of a missing scientist and is thrust into a series of Perils of Pauline style fate-worse-than-death scenarios that actually aren't too bad.  Quite nice, really...<br /><br />For anybody in any doubt, this is the real thing.  Barbarella, as she was seen on the big screen in 1968.  Much has been made of a PG version of the movie, but this isn't it.  In fact, the PG cut has never been issued on home video - VHS, DVD or now Blu-ray.  What you see is what you got in 1968, rated R in some territories, X in others.  If you're expecting anything more racy or graphic than you've already seen, you may be disappointed but that's your problem.<br /><br />If you're looking for a charming, satirical sci-fi sex comedy from the sixties this is it.  It's one of those movies, like Sellers' \\"The Party\\", or \\"Casino Royale\\" (1967), \\"What's New Pussycat\\", \\"Modesty Blaise\\" or \\"Candy\\" that could have only been made in that brief flowering of psychedelia in the 1960s.  A much-underrated and maligned classic.
B00356CO1E|4.0|I just started working out to this video for 4 days straight. The first day, I was ready to give up, but looking at that slim dress in my closet gave me enough motivation to keep going. I flooped on my bed a couple of times because I was tired and I was only into it for 10mins. Pittiful right? I know. I'm ony 185 pounds. I have a membership to the gym. I can tell you that working with this video for 30 minutes will have you sweating them calories away. Your heart rate stays up as well. That's what we want anyway right? It's better than being on the treadmill at the gym for an hour or 2 wasting time.<br /><br />I enjoy how Jilliam encourages you to keep going, even when you feel like dying. The videos are only 27-30 mins long. My body was hurting the next morning. that's how I know it's a workout. Not as much now becasue i'm steady with it twice a day.. You can't go wrong with these DVD's. I'm looking for results now! Are you? I also purchased her other Dvd's.. Im going to work this body out.. I'm ready for the challenge..
B004R739LE|5.0|This review is for the Lowepro LP36329 Orion DayPack 200 (Gray).  My rating 4.5 out of 5. I can always use a little more padding to provide supreme protection. It's a quality-made backpack which provides great protection for your equipment in the bottom half, and an open space in the top half for anything else.<br /><br />The backpack is 18\\" H x 13\\" W x 6\\" D.  It does a great job of keeping its contents stable. It provides adequate padding and protection for your equipment. The zippers stay tight and won't open/slide by themselves.  This bag is a worthy competitor against other camera backpacks out there.  The bottom half has dividers, while the top is open space without any dividers. So if that's what you're looking for, this bag is great. The bag is comfortable to wear for an hour or more since it's padded well. The bottom of the bag is padded well enough in case the bag were to accidentally fall about a foot, it would provide enough protection for the equipment inside.<br /><br />There is a buckle strap to provide additional support for locking the bottom half to the top half.  On the front, there are two flat pockets for small items (ex: memory cards, wires, HDMI cables), cell phone, paperwork, or thin guides.  There are two mesh side pockets, which I use for AA batteries. You can't fit water bottles in these pockets, but it is possible to hold a flat flask in case you roll with one.<br /><br />The shoulder straps are well-padded, and the back of the backpack which lays against your back is also padded and both are comfortable.  The zippers are great quality and feel like they will last a long time.  There is a horizontal zipper in the middle of the bag to open the bottom half of the bag. This area is 6\\" D x 11\\" W x 7\\" H.  There is 3/4\\" padding all around the interior walls, with removable padded velcro dividers, allowing for interior customization . The dividers are 1/2\\" padded.  With all dividers, you can create six separate slots for lenses.  I usually fit four lenses and my XSi or 5D in the center. Or store two lenses and two cameras.<br /><br />The top zipper opens to reveal the top half of the pack.  In the top area, there a mesh flat pocket, 9\\"W x 6\\"H, for user guides, memory cards, batteries, etc. The top half of the backpack measures 6.25\\" D x 11\\" W x 9\\" H.  It can be used for flashes, video lights, diffusers, misc large items, folded rain poncho, etc. The front of the top half has light padding, much less than the bottom half.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I enjoy reading this book bundle series, However, I am not always at a good stopping place when my kindle fire battery shuts off.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a really great book. I found myself staying up late just to get a couple more chapters in! lol
B0079XPUOW|5.0|The book is well written, has humor in it, very enjoyable to anyone who likes light science fiction (i.e. no heavy quantum mechanism or anything like that).<br /><br />The only problem with the book is that after the main story ends and ends well (not a good ending, rather a good way it writes it off), the book nose dives into something that makes no sense beside being a page filler.<br /><br />I skipped it and therefore have fond memories of the book :)
B0086700CM|5.0|finnally temple came out on kindle fire! !!!!!!!

1936608898|5.0|I have been an avid student of nutrition, weight loss, and disease prevention for years now. Ancestral diet and lifestyle helped me lose weight and become much healthier, but after a couple years I needed to recharge and refresh my commitment. I did a Whole 30, and I lost 13 pounds, and saw improvements in my skin, sleep, and energy levels again. Even for those of us familiar with paleo/primal nutrition, crossfit, and the like, this book offers alot of new information and great ideas for helping you maintain tighter compliance and make new strides. I HIGHLY recommend it, especially for those needing more practical advice on \\"HOW\\" to start a new way of life. You will feel so good you won't believe it, I promise!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great! I really would recommend it. I played it for hours and didn't get bored at all!!!  there is a whole bunch of games that you can unlock and play. get it u wont be disappointed!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I could play this game for hours a great time waster fun for the whole family to keep thier skills up trying to beat their high score
B003HGKJ3W|5.0|A-Ha is a Norwegian synthpop, europop band that was founded in Oslo in 1982. They were an extremely popular band in Europe and throughout the world in the 1980s and their album, \\"Hunting High and Low\\" was the cause of this sky-rocketing fame. Their title track, \\"Take on Me\\" and \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V\\" took the world audience by storm.<br /><br />This deluxe edition is a set of 2 cds - the most notable tracks being, \\" Scoundrel Days\\"; \\"October\\"; \\"We Are Looking for the Whales\\" and \\"Maybe, Maybe\\". It combines remixed versions of some of the tracks from their earlier albums and some other demo versions of the same tracks and a few live renditions from a concert of theirs in Croydon. It is absolutely superb - I love every single section of this compilation!<br /><br />The packaging is neat and compact, the sound recording exquisite and the album cover is attractive enough to grab your undivided attention. For those who've never heard of A-Ha - this band is similar to Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), Depeche Mode, Pacific and Orchestral Manoeuvers in the Dark (OMD). It is an absolute 'must' for all those who enjoy the predominance of the synthesizer with strong, foot- tapping drum beats. Just go for it - it is a worhty purchase indeed!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|i rewrote this on the site.  I apologize for the review.  It was my error and when I figured it out felt like such a fool.  No logic gene,  I am so sorry for that review.  I love it and it is all I hoped it would be.  Again, I am so sorry.  Thanks for the opportunity to correct a wrong.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think the game is fun but a little frustrating at times. There are a few glitches at times like when I want to turn it jumps and it also lags a bit but not all the time. Over all I really like the game and will continue to play it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|LOL. IMO people read this boo because they want see how bad it is haha. its going to keep its throne as the bestseller
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had heard about all the hype surrounding this book and thought why the hell not.  So I read all three of them and it was just not a pleasant experience. I was ready to be done reading a couple pages into the second one, but I always feel I have to finish the set to give it a good review.  While it kind of did get better in the end, I just did not like it enough to save my opinion of the whole thing.  I thought the general plot idea was a good one and could have turned into a really great book with the right author.  The bigger idea of Ana helping Christian through his issues was a good frame.  Unfortunately, I felt that the whole \\"carrying out\\" of the plot just sucked. It isn't even about the quite vivid sex scenes.  Those were not a problem for me, because I feel that any mature adult can handle that. In saying that I could have taken them in better if I thought they served a purpose.  While some did, most of the time I just felt like it was thrown in there because it could be. The HUGE problem was in the dialogue.  Holy hell.  I think that Christian and Ana had the same exact 5 conversations throughout the whole of the three books.  I'm talking exact replicas of lines written before. I think I had to read about Christian's berating of Ana's biting her lip one million times if it happened once. Overall, I felt like it ended up being an author that figured \\"I want to write a book with a crazy amount of sex scenes.  Alas, I must put dialogue for it to be even considered for publication.\\"  I say read it to form your own opinion because it is a book that will forever be popular, but don't expect anything extraordinary.  I am so shocked about the hype and praise surrounding these books - I can't even fathom.  And God help us for the talk of a movie.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona Apple is just amazing, i think is the best songwriter nowadays. \\"Tidal\\" was an amazing debut (she was only 18!), \\"When the pawn...\\" blowed my mind in 99 and \\"Extraordinary machine\\" was great (although the leaked version was better than the released one).<br />\\"The idler wheel...\\" is much better than every fan of hers was expecting, and we were expecting something great, but this is just....an instantly classic piece of art.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game gets passed around by my whole family!  We all want to add to the icy village coming to life thru all the beautiful &amp; cute characters ;) . &quot;Scrat chasing &quot; &amp; family making are great fun too!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I luv this game!  it is awesome! Me and my little brother play it all the time. !!!!!!! plus it never gets old.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the hunger games. It is a great book. The book has action and adventure. I definitely recommend this book for strong readers. Once you start reading the \\"Hunger Games\\" you can't stop reading it. If you are interested in buying this book, then I bet you will like it (or love it)! :-)
0143121006|4.0|This carefully researched and compellingly written investigation into the death of an English school girl in Old China is both disturbing and significant. It has all the twists and turns of a fictional detective story, with a convincing conclusion. I was glad I read it, but at the end it left me angry. Not only that this crime occurred, but at the reaction towards it from those in authority. Pamela Werner, the gutsy victim, deserves the recognition and the partial sense of justice this book provides.
0452289963|5.0|I wish everyone could read this book and take from it what is meant to be taken. What an amazing read!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a game you want to keep playing over and over again. #1 game. Super fun! I play it like every day.
B000QRIGLC|1.0|What a terrible book. I don't know if this was the vet's doing or his coauthor (most likely, both) but the book reads like propaganda. Mixed in with the story is the constant talk of how the \\"liberals\\" are tying his hands behind his back. The liberal media is making them, from thousands of miles away, make bad decisions that could cause them harm. He spends the first half of the book setting up his political enemies as the cause of the disaster he ultimatly describes. If your a Republican to the core and hate liberals / the media then you'll enjoy this. Fellow Libertarians don't waste your time. Liberals, don't even bother looking at the cover. The thug that wrote this book is nothing more than a man who regrets murdering 3 unarmed goat herders, one of which was 14 years old. Keep that in mind before reading, or defending his ideas, this man wanted / wished he had thrown a 14 year old kid off a 1,000 foot cliff... what a disgrace. This book is propaganda for the military and the right wing at its best. Blame the enemy for your decisions, then show how your decesions failed and caused terrible things to happen, let the audience put them together as if they made some sort of academic discovery on their own.<br /><br />I was hoping for a story, as the subtitle describes, instead I got the GOP manuscript written by a wannabe war criminal. If you want an intelligent and unbiased truthful war story without the political rants, check out \\"The Outlaw Platoon.\\" Blows this book away.<br /><br />In regards to his decesion to not throw a teenager off a cliff: \\"It was the supidest, moth souther-friend, lamebrained decision I ever made in my life.\\"<br /><br />I didn't believe all the bad reviews, I bought the book and found out the hard way.
B004LROUW2|1.0|I've read all of his books and this was just...horrible and long. So repetitive it was unbelievable. I just ended up skipping chunks to get through it.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|This book certainly kept my interest and was fun to read, but it all falls down in the end with a compeletely unbelieveable explanation of events.  I know, I know...it's a thriller, not supposed to be real life, but it was not well tied together, simplistic and far-fetched.  Take 2 parts Bourne Identity, 3 parts The Professional and shake, and you have this book, but with a bad ending.  I also thought Baldacci's Absolute Power was similarly lacking in cohesion.
0345803493|4.0|Okay, I was staying up late reading this book as well.  I don't know what it is about this series.  I agree with the negative reviews that it is repetitive and seems as though the characters are falsely immature.  But I couldn't put it down.  The sex scenes were not as erotic as I hoped it would get.  But perhaps because the scenes are same sex different location.<br /><br />Spoiler<br /><br />I thought Ana made up with Christian too quickly but I liked the addition of the crazy ex.  I thought that the helicopter crash was a set-up by Christian and am a little let down to discover the real cause on the last page of the book.  But I will still keep reading and give this one 4 stars.  Why if it has so many issues?  Because it pulls me in!  I do regret that this book above others is leading the charge of a good erotic romance novel.  There are several others that are considerably better.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|I always loved this movie and I still do. Loved getting my little goodie in the mail and I watched it immediately. Absolutely nothing wrong. If you love fantasy, dragon, Knights in armor kind of stuff, you'll love this movie. You can't find this movie anywhere it seemed. Thank you Amazon!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|doesn't cost money to make progress and scales well in difficulty. only down side is it gets a little laggy when the battles heat up.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Nora has once again produced an excellent grouping of tunes!  I highly recommend this selection to anyone who has any of her previous CDs; you will not be disappointed.
0345529057|3.0|I was told this series was The Hunger Games for adults, but they do not read as fast and I'm having a hard time getting into it. Also the book seems to jump around a bit and I often find myself having to reread a paragraph or two. I've been on the first book for more than a month.  . . . So I don't know about the rest of the series. I'm thinking about waving the white flag on this one and pick up something else.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I can not believe that this poorly written book has received so many good reviews and \\"wow!\\" comments. The characters are unrealistic, their behavior is a subject for psychoanalysis, their relations are sick, their motives are unclear, their future is certain - no possible future for this type of obsession, aggression and selfishness.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I love the predictions,  there is simply no better app out there.  However,  use on the droid has a bit to be desired with the physical keyboard.  ? At the end of any word capitalizes the word and caps lock doesn't work.  Caps lock in can deal without.  You'll get 5 once I stop having to retype words when using a &quot;?&quot;.

B00846F1YW|3.0|for the kindle. needs ability to enlarge the picture. very difficult to see small items.  game is ok<br /><br />A little homegrown but ok
B001608R5I|5.0|Go buy this record now.  In lieu of a digital download card, the actual soul of Jack White will leave the vinyl disc, travel through the stylus, into the wires, down to your amplifier, through that and out to more wires towards your speakers, and out though the woofers and tweeters into the room in which your stereophonic system is playing.  It will then enter your body and possess you for just under an hour and have you doing and thinking of things that you have never done or thought of before.  This is far superior to a standard digital download and I recommend the experience to for everyone.  The only drawback is you (when controlled by the spirit of Jack White) may start to tear apart old furniture in your house and begin to craft it into musical instruments that cannot be made or assembled in a mere 48 or so minutes.  Be careful of this.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this just from reading the reviews from the BJ Parent console and comparing to this Diono Buggy. I have the BJ City Mini GT. Transitioning from a snap & go with cup holder to nothing blows! So I bought the Diono Buggy and do not regret it. Can hold more than enough for me right now (have a 3 month old) bottle, wristlet, bottle water and the blackberry with room to spare...good to go! Best $10 spent.
B007FGPYTE|5.0|I wear black on the outside because black is how I feel on the inside.  Also, if I seem a little strange, that's because I am.  I am also unlovable at times.
B005TZFYNE|5.0|Ok so since Rated R Rihanna has changed alot. She became a bit slutty in my opinion and when Loud was released i bought it and was a bit disapointed not fully but it was a little less awsome then Rated R. Now i am in love with this dam album! Everything except We All Want Love and Cockiness are stellar tracks! I love \\"Drunk On Love\\" \\"Rock Me Out\\" and \\"Watch N' Learn\\" if only the remix of \\"Birthday Cake\\" which at first i hated but now i love was on here.<br /><br />Overall: 4.3/5
1440503257|5.0|Though I probably won't make some of these recipes, it was wonderful that the author put a brief description and which Harry Potter book that featured the recipe.  I also liked the fact that the author gave substitutions or what exactly a treacle was.  Who knew it was a sugar based substance!!<br /><br />I've tried several of them, mostly notably the creamy onion soup.  It was the bomb.  I added a toasted piece of french bread over the soup and it was a very memorable Harry Potter like French Onion soup.<br /><br />Overall I loved the book.  I found myself looking up chapters in the corresponding HP book to read about the food and relive that part of HP.  It's been said that the most intense memories for someone involves food.  Even though I've not tried them, it helps, at least in this Muggle's eyes, to daydream about butterbear.
B006XBSAP2|3.0|To start off all the singles on this album are stellar! really they are but the rest of the matieriel just falls flat, especially the ballads. Circle The Drain is really one of the non-single songs thats actually good. Also the album is a bit too long if you know what i mean. i would have perfered two discs instead of one overpacked one.<br />Overall: 3.5/5
0399230033|5.0|First of all, I was puzzled to see that this was published in the mid-90's. I would have sworn it was read to me in my childhood during the 70's. It has that timeless quality (which is nice).<br /><br />My 18 month old son LOVES LOVES LOVES this book (calls it 'Goooood night coco'). It's a hassle for us to read, because there is very little dialog/narration... the parent must make up the story as you go. When asked to read it five times in a row, it gets shorter and simpler each time.
B007BFZGAG|1.0|I cannot stand this guy or his rapping! the only songs i like were Far Away and Still Got It but neither are on here! Rack City has got to be the stupidest song since Black and Yellow! Grrrrr my friend is a better rapper and he cant get a deal but this guy can? wth!
0805092447|5.0|...maybe even enjoyable under 12 months. Fun to read, the little man loves it, learns colors and animals. Fun, fun fun.
0307914550|5.0|The book was informative and gave a great story.  I have since added chi seeds to my diet and have modified my workout routine, slightly, to enjoy running more vs running to train.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love math and I love puzzles.  (Most people will groan here and move on to the next review.)  And I love CrossMe!  The graphics are very nice, it is easy to figure out how to use.  You can become quite adept at it after just a couple of puzzles.  There are MANY puzzles to keep you occupied, from easy to very challenging.  I would highly recommend this app for anyone who enjoys nanograms, soduko, etc.
0099579936|1.0|This is the most immature, poorly written, repetitive, unbelievable nonsense I've ever wasted time reading.  My mom told me it was stupid - I should've listened to her.  Instead, I gave into all the hype and was seriously disappointed.  The author has the writing skills of a 4th grader, at best.  Don't waste your time.  I worry about the intelligence level of the people who gave this book even 3 stars.<br /><br />Quite possibly the lamest book in existence.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Draw Something has to be my favorite app on my Kindle Fire. It works perfectly. Most of my family has acess to this game and we play for hours together. I am glad to finally see this app being supported by android! I reccomend getting Draw Something if you enjoy cherades or other guessing games. Overall, a wonderful app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Although the sex was kinky and it almost never quit, the story itself was so good.  Once you get thru the 1st book, book 2 & 3 are hard to put down. I hope there will be a book 4 & more!!!
B006ON41FC|4.0|its ok. its the type of game you play when your board. get it if you want though i like more, i guess, entertaining games.

B002L4QP0M|1.0|I will say from the outset that I dislike Jeffrey Archer very much, his arrogance pomposity and disdain for those who do not measure up to his perceived level of self importance is repugnant.<br />In a moment of weakness I decided to read one of his novels, what a mistake. The shallowness of the plot is pathetic, the characters are completely predictable as is the plot, the actions of the hero are so ridiculous as to be laughable and the villain guesses correctly at almost every turn not to mention the shot that hits the hero at an impossible range. As for the idiotic scene where an imposter collects the hero from the Swiss police, well that sealed my opinion of JF as a novelist.<br />If this is the best that JF can do then heaven help those who thought this was \\"riveting\\" and \\"thrilling\\", have they never read a really good novel by talented writers? Read the novels of Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancy, Frederick Forsythe and although in a different era and genre read the fabulous books of Bernard Cornwell and Wilbur Smith. These writers had TALENT and IMAGINATION, JFs efforts are pure trash.<br />By the way I live in Franklin TN, I have no idea why Amazon thinks I live in TUNISIA.

B00785P2QC|5.0|u should buy a fun time killer and a money waster u spend a LOT of money on it do get.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a fun game to play with your friends.  I love watching the drawing as it was originally drawn and waiting to see what my friends guess.  Some of them are really good artists!  I suggest using the coins you earn to get more colors as soon as you can.  The fall package is best, because it has brown that you use a lot, orange and green - which you need to draw trees or grass or leaves and things.  THe hardest part of the game is having the patience to wait until one of your friends draws something for you, so get a lot of friends to do it and you won't have to wait too long!

B0076I624W|5.0|Highly underrated movie. A great story well told with wonderful performances. It is not short, in fact it is long, but I find that it holds your attention right up to the end.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Like so many series you need to read other type of books in between to keep your interest. Even the best writers fall into this problem. I read 5 in a row, which is about right. Then read something else, and went back and it was wonderful.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game. there are times when it glitches but not that many. cures boredom and gets u in to the game.
0062183591|4.0|I am impressed with this book.  Dan tells us the truth about ourselves and he spares no words.  I loved reading the excerpt so I can image what the rest of the book would be like.  I recommend this book to people who want to know more about how they really act.  The part about the truth is it has to be uncovered, because we all leave out some facts.<br /><br />Review by: [..]
B0086700CM|5.0|ok you complainers. it is here!! I love this game. who cares if it is repetative. the course changes and there are goals to work toward. what more could you ask for in a game like this. I have had no issues on my kindle fire with it. loved it on my ipod still love it on my kindle. go temple run!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|So simple to use! I love the extended forecast, the maps, etc. Download, install & use were easy & quick! Love this ap better than weatherbug
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a good movie - opens your eyes to the control that larger corporations have over the food that shows up in our markets.
B007SGM084|5.0|Just when you think it's all about the sex, it changes course.  Then you think it's all about the sex and intimacy and it changes again and becomes a psychological thriller of sorts.  By and large, this trilogy is a complicated, beautifully written love story that takes you on a journey that is exciting and elicit and worth every penny (and the time spent reading it)!!  I do not save many books to be reread in the future, but this is certainly a keeper!!!  Laters baby.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is amazing! you can decorate, draw, and do more things on photos! its works amazing on my kindle fire...so if you like spending time on pics .....this is your app :)
0345803485|3.0|I bought the book knowing it was dubbed \\"mummy porn\\", however was not expecting this. Nonetheless I could not put it down. Yes the book has been driven by publicity, but I think it is because it divides readers. I think for a first book, it is to be commended. And now it is to be made into a movie, the author will have the last laugh.
B0086700CM|4.0|its much better on my bros ipod verses the kindle fire its also hard to get the person to move side to side to collect coins so...other than that I liked it but I'm not impressed giving it four stars
B007D3V0MO|5.0|Not since Moving Pictures has a RUSH album been a first listen fall in love type of album for me. I love every RUSH album. I am into RUSH as much as anyone and I say anyone in the world! My RUSH credentials are as follows ( and I do believe if you claim yourself a fan you should be able to back it up, lol)I discovered RUSH during their Power Windows tour and fell in love so quickly I knew I had to see them. I found out at the time they would be playing at the Nassau Colliseum in New York the next month so I quickly got myself a ticket to see them. I have not missed a tour since. Every time they played the colliseum I fought my way (sometimes literally) to the front row allthough my tickets were usually somewhere in the third level as they were the cheapest tix.I also like to give Geddy Lee's 'MY FAVORITE HEADACHE' album a plug as it is much like a RUSH album and a little gem in of itself. If you love RUSH you own that album. In Neil Pearts abscence due to the hardships he was facing at the time that was the only taste you got in a seven year period. Instead of continuing on about how much I love RUSH (and I hope I didnt bore you)I will get into my review of Clockwork Angels. I would have loved to review track by track (cant you tell) however, too many people allready have, and did do a mighty fine job at it I must say.Anyone who has not given this album a five star rating and just not absolutely gushed over this effort has just not \\"got it\\" yet, it just has not clicked yet. As I was eluding to earlier this album took a few days of non stop listening to (just about) for her to strip of all her garments so to speak. Now totally bare ALL of her beauty is there to see and feel. The title track and 'The Garden' are two of RUSH' best songs. Its funny I had commented on a top ten song list of RUSH that you could easily pick fifty RUSH songs to make a top ten list, that was before clockwork angels came out. \\"Clockwork Angels\\" the song and \\"The Garden\\" could easily be top ten songs of all RUSH in my opinion.\\" Wish Them Well\\" I see as a major live song to be played with the verse \\" all that you can do is wish them well\\" thank your stars your not that way turn your back and walk away,dont even pause and ask them why turn around and say goodbye' being sung along to by the entire crowd \\"Closer to the Heart\\" style! I hope thats the case as it is my prediction when I see them in Brooklyn New York baby!O.K. so as promised I will not go into this thing track by track and therefore will close by saying this is one of RUSH' best efforts. MOVING PICTURES, HEMISPHERES,2112,PERMANENT WAVES,SIGNALS, A FAREWELL TO KINGS AND CLOCKWORK ANGELS ( not neccesarily in that order)is the class I would put this latest masterpiece in.Dont forget to listen, listen, listen and read the lyrics along while listening to the album. She will reveal herself in all her beauty I guarantee it, and if not, you dont get RUSH no matter how much you think you do.Just a great album man!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Indispensable for those of us that ride motorcycles, I never leave the house without checking accuweather first.  Very good app that I recommend for everybody.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game to fill your boredom...I highly recommend it! it has great waysto keep you interested...objectives and coins to buy powerups...and the best part? you can easily earn coins in game rather than purchase them!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I like movies that give a explanation of real life things that we don't know. For instance is there a god or not? Are aliens real or not? This movie states god or chairman has what seems like business people. make things go. Kinda like angels in suits you can say. It shows that everything happens for a reason. That if you spill your coffee in the morning that; that little action could have a HUGE effect on the rest of your day, your life. Like that five minutes you spend cleaning up your mess you could miss your ride, then maybe stop for a bite somewhere you wouldn't have, and meet someone you wouldn't have and etc. Etc. I always say that, that every decision or event has a ripple effect and changes everything and this movie is exactly that following, Matt Damon. He met a girl in the bathroom as he was preparing to give a speech. He was supposed to meet her for that one time so she could encourage him to give his speech. But not only does she do that she and him look like they fall in love. And that isn't part of the plan. That is the problem and therefore your movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far so good.  keeps me occupied for hours trying to reach the goal.  some of the gamed should come with directions.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Wow. I was amazed. An instant classic for me. I mean it's like Superbad and kill bill met and had a child And it kicked ass. You get the humor that makes a great comedy, along with the fights/kills that make a action movie. I wouldn't really say it's a superhero movie, but the concept is there. Nicolas cage and his daughter in the movie really make it come to life. You're going to love that duo. It's just not what you're expecting in a great way. One of those movies where when you first see it at times your, like \\"Oh shit!\\" and your really entertained. It's defiantly a must see for all ages 17 and up. I'd give it 3 in a half stars honestly.
B0076WFTS8|1.0|After reading the review of G. M. Dobb \\"lord_vinyl\\" on the Amazon UK site, YES there is crackle throughout cd 2, mostly on the Sneaking Suspicion disc. This is a shame as this has never been mastered correctly for CD, and the box set was expensive here in Spain. It is truly sad that the time and effort put into this boxset that EMI could not check their work. I am not sure if it a result of bad disc or a problem overlooked by the mastering engineer at Abbey Road. Anyway you would expect more from Abbey Road and EMI. A very careless on glaring error on their part, it really destroys the whole excitement of this long awaited package. Check your work, not the best way to represent one of the UKs greatest bands of the 70's Refund please!
B0086700CM|2.0|its really buggy it sometimes doesnt jump the sensitivity is bad i like it wayyyyyyyy better on ipad and ipod
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I love what Scalzi does, I'll just put that out there. Old Man's War is a great series and Fuzzy Nation is a perfect balance of wit and gravity. Redshirts is a fascinating premise which, as a science fiction fan, I complete enjoyed the exploration of and complete poking fun of the genre. However, I think that the balance exhibited in Fuzzy never quite materialized here. I think I would have preferred a longer book that took more time in swinging back and forth between the solemnity of life and relationships and then over to the self referential genre wit of the book. Similarly, the Codas at the end of the book are a brilliant theory, but I didn't feel invested in the characters enough for whom their point of view was taken. While they were interesting, they weren't compelling. Ultimately though, I love that Mr. Scalzi brought something so innovative to the space and love that he continues to do so. I will still buy any book he writes because I know it'll be worth the read.
0307269752|3.0|The life of this girl who had this unusual tatoo intrigued me.  She had such tremendous obstacles to cope with and she was ingenous.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|I've been a huge fan for decades. I just listened to this new offering from begining to end and NOTHING got my attention until the last song, The Garden which shows some sweet melodic guitar work, EVERYTHING else just sounds like the worst of the worst from Rush, recycled melodies and grooves.<br />I don't even see how I could enjoy this live. Expected more from them and sad to say but their best work is way gone for me.
0316017930|5.0|I'm a 10th grader and I found this book to be a easy read but it has a high vocabulary. The words in this book will help me on the SATs and in college. It also motivated me to work hard when I read the Success stories. This book create discussion amongst teens and should be used in the classroom. I really loved this book. I encourage all to buy it!!
030758836X|5.0|I just finished this book after not being able to put it down, and reading over half of it one overnight this week.  I agree with the reviewers who say this book becomes a priority, a matter of urgence to find out what happened.  I think this is a masterpiece, a fun read, a gripping read, a thriller, but not a thriller you forget about the next day.  This one is simmering in my brain and actually changing my own behavior.  I also don't want to give too much away, but to me this is more a psychological thriller than anything else, about marriage and relationships.  It's really about something.  It's kind of an object lesson wrapped in a story line, and says something extremely profound about how we treat the ones we love, and how we come to take each other for granted, and how we sometimes don't want others to know the \\"real\\" us, or punish people for getting too close and seeing our faults.  I'm struggling a bit with the ending as well, but I've come to believe that it's a perfect ending (or as perfect as a story like this will be able to have), because there really is no ending in real life, much of the time.  It's a razor-sharp ending, requiring the story and us to stay on guard.  Which I believe is appropriate for these characters and this story.  And what it says about the characters' future, and ours, is very chilling.  But also hopeful.  Again, trying not to insert spoilers but: we can reinvent ourselves, we can treat people differently.  We don't have to be on auto-pilot.  We can be who we want to be.  And, sometimes when we are pretending we are more real than we realize.  Very fundamental themes.  This is the best book I've read since Time Traveler's Wife which is the best book I ever read.  So I have high praise for the book and intend to read Ms. Flynn's other books now.  (I should mention that I'm a long-time reader of Entertainment Weekly and read its promotions of the book, but decided not to read the review or interview with the author, until after I read the actual book.  I didn't remember/realize that Ms. Flynn used to write for Entertainment Weekly or remember that I used to like her writing in that publication, until I read the review last night.  I'm so excited for her that she's soaring like this and can't wait to read what she writes next. - but I can't imagine she could possibly top this book though, for me, at least in terms of the themes she has explored.)
1595828753|5.0|The graphic novel is a perfect continuation to the TV series. The characters are written and drawn beautifully, and the Parts 1 and 2 both contain both the depth and lightness of the Nickelodeon show. It feels about the same length as one episode in terms of the plot points, and takes about the same amount of time to read as to watch.  HIGHLY recommended.<br /><br />Having read the first two now, and watched the new Legend of Korra series, it makes me miss the original series that much more.  The graphic novels have made me laugh far more times than Korra, and the plot feels much less forced and drawn out. Can't wait for part 3.
B005HSL626|3.0|I am not saying I hate it its pretty fun and gr8 but all you do Is slice fruit! Peace out!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|couldnt put the kindle down this story is soo amazing never expected an author writing a type of story like this !
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Angry birds is lame. Who would want to through birds at pigs? LLLAAAMMMEEE! I only bought this app for when I have nothing to do. Go to your friends and see what they think. My friends thinks its berry and I agree. Don't take my vote for it test it out see what you think. Do you agree with me?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|not just a calculator. it allows me to keep track of my calculations so I can go back and review them. I have a business and it is great for all my calculations when I don't need to run a tape. my be able to do that as well. did not rate it right away. waited a while until I used it.

B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a fun, addictive game with only a few issues. Every so often, I'll start out and the character will randomly jump and the only motion the game takes is jumping, a ridiculously fast and easy death, so an overall great game with a few issues
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is really awesome!!!!!! I didn't get the mighty eagle but that's fine with me. If you 3 stars on every level then purchase &quot;ANGRY BIRDS UNLOCKER .&quot;
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I really love this game. and to the people looking at reviews for advice, the one-star-raters are technically wrong. you can have a lot of fun just by paying nothing. you don't need the bells and whistles to have fun!!

1936608898|5.0|I have read all of the paleo/primal books over the past two months, and I have to say that It Starts With Food is the most user-friendly of them all. Yes it contains much of the same nutritional science as the others - why grains are bad, why sugar is the devil, etc. - but what sets this book apart are the easy-to-understand analogies and explanations. Even when they warn the reader about \\"science-y\\" content, I found that I could follow along without needing to bust out my Intro to Nutrition textbook or a dictionary. More important than the nutritional overview is the actionable steps and guidelines provided in the Whole 30 program. I found that the other primal/paleo books are missing this, or, if they have it, are too compromising in some ways. I love the no nonsense approach in the Whole 30. I NEED the no nonsense approach. Tell me that I can follow the 80/20 rule, and I will give myself every excuse to maximize that 20% with crappy food.<br /><br />It Starts With Food is the paleo/primal/GOOD, CLEAN FOOD/ textbook that everyone should read. The Whole 30 is the program (not DIET) that everyone should try. After all, it's only 30 days. And it might REALLY change your life.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Everybody this is the best app ever now that I got it with adds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />And first of all its better!!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I Love the new update this is by far the best keyboard on android, anyone who doesn't have it need to get this one.  Typing on touch screen has has never been easier. I can now type faster than I use to on my blackberry.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|For those who do love the source material, with all of its foibles, it's just tremendous fun. And I mean FUN. I always enjoy and appreciate good science fiction, but it's not that often that I genuinely have FUN reading a book. I don't know any other author that could have pulled this off without having it come to pieces. It's doing the same thing that Galaxy Quest did, only better, in my opinion. Slapping around all of the Trek tropes with glee, but also with a clear love for all of them.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I recently early Oct 2012, wiped my phone and reinstalled SwiftKey 3. All it does is force close. I just remembered 18 Oct 2012, that I copied SwiftKey 3 to DropBox. I just now reinstalled it. It works great. I just noticed a funny rather peculiar thing. My older version number is 3 3.0.1.330. The version number of the one that could not install is 3.0.4.343. In other words a down grade or maybe miss labeled on the about SwiftKey 3 stats page. Oh this is not the first time Amazon has upgraded with downgrade. They just recently did it with OfficeSuitePro. I don't know if this is a developer issue or a store issue, but it needs to stop. Get the updates right, get them in order.<br /><br />The issue that is going on with this app causing it to force close is a huge problem for its users especially me with my typing skills. Give the low stars some thought if you must, but remember it is due to a problem that will be fixed I hope. It is available on google play and you can still download it on Amazon free as a Trial for 30 days. Who knows, they may have the issue resolved by then. This is a great app.<br /><br />Today 19 Oct 2012, I noticed that Amazon Store is trying to get me to update my backed up version to 3.0.4.343. It is the version that is corrupted. Amazon, take it off your store until it is fixed. Don't do your customers this way. If I upgrade to this and it is corrupted, I have to reinstall my backed up version and set up my perameters again. I will lose all my saved data.
B0086700CM|5.0|great app. works amazingly on my kindle fire. I think I have developed a minor case of OCD while playing this but super fun. :) great for keeping kids busy. a must have and its free!!!! download now!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Happy to see this movie is finding redemption here on Amazon. I just watched the movie on Blu-ray and was entertained throughout. There were a couple of slow spots and just maybe the CGI gets a bit clunky. But overall the story logically completed the Hero's Journey story arch. Too bad the show was so poorly marketed. But for those of you who are trying to decide to purchase the Blu-ray/DVD, I say, go ahead. If you like this kind of story you won't be disapointed. It has everything: Beautiful Princess, awesome graphics, interesting culture, well drawn characters with some depth to them and a hunky and heroic hero.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|After Megadeth put out \\"Endgame\\", I thought it would be almost impossible to top that and kind of lowered my expectations for \\"Thirteen\\". I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear some very amazing songs on here. Maybe not each one is mind-blowing<br />but they are all extremely good with the exception of one song I will single out.<br /><br />The song \\"Fastlane\\" is just cheesey lyrically and even though the songwriting picks up towards the end of the song, it reminds me too much of dumbed-down hair metal.<br />With the exception of that song, the album re-visits alot of different styles the band did on prior albums but never loses the thrash metal attitude/spirit.<br /><br />Other than that, I can't find alot wrong with this album. I'm aware that a couple of the songs were old demos that Dave wanted to complete and that there are also certain songs that were made for soundtracks or videogames featured here. As long as they sound good, I don't understand why some reviewers are making such a big deal out of that. Maybe some Megadeth extremist fans didn't want those demos touched but honestly I think \\"New World Order\\" and \\"Millenium of the Blind\\" sound amazing. Fans with the mindset that I just described should remember the reworking of \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" with the female vocalist of Lacuna Coil (which was also amazing).<br /><br />Some people will be disappointed with this album because they expected/wanted more after hearing \\"Endgame\\" but really Megadeth doesn't need to keep outdoing themselves on each album. Appreciate it for what it is, a collection of some really good songs (and one sub-par one).<br /><br />For old fans of Megadeth, definitely pick it up.<br />For new fans, start with either \\"Rust in Peace\\" or \\"Countdown to Extinction\\"
B002ZDAD9I|5.0|I'd be curious to know what the hold up is with this being released in the U.S. It was released in Great Britain SIX YEARS AGO, but STILL has not been released in the USA.....all the other Argento movies are available except SUSPIRIA, which, to many, isy Dario Argento's best movie...

1451629184|5.0|It was so difficult to read what this young woman tolerated from the tender age of 11 at the hands of a sexual sadist.  She was very brave to write this book as a warning of what is really out there.  I recommend this book (as a warning and to open people's eyes)...and so that Jaycee benefits somehow from her horrible experience.

0374203032|5.0|Since at least the time of Herb Simon, we've been told that \\"Economics is descriptive, not prescriptive.\\"  Yet many economists and other pundits persistently contend that all transactions with positive economic value make sense.  This casual assumption should be challenged regularly. \\"What Money Can't Buy\\" works well as that kind of reminder.<br /><br />In a pluralistic society, we rely on \\"economic rationality\\" to accommodate public acceptance of consensual transactions in moral gray areas.  Obvious polarizing flags remain.  Some people pay others to have abortions or sterilization operations.  Political factions in some countries are paid to advocate international interests that conflict with local customs.  People with a strong sense of values will have strong opinions on these transactions.  Sandel tries to get us to see that there are some times when economic rationalism should not rule the world unchallenged.<br /><br />Sandel raises many arguments to which there are reasonable counterarguments.  It's vital to watch for \\"slippery slope\\" disagreements.  There are situations in which people stand on principle without regard to apparent economic efficiency.  Dictatorships, especially corrupt ones, are inherently more efficient than democracy, but this misses the point of ethical government.<br /><br />Some of Sandel's observations can be explained away as distractions.  Big game hunters shooting walruses for the Inuit do not even change the outcome that the meat goes to the Inuit winter larders.  It's hard to see how the world is changed by letting a stranger pay to pull the trigger.  Other examples are open to arguments by the those determined to argue.  People who miss this book's point can distract an audience while demonstrating ubiquitous applications of economic vocabulary.<br /><br />While Freakonomics tell an interesting story about how most behavior can be expressed in market language, \\"What Money Can't Buy\\" raises the important point that there are things money SHOULDN'T buy.  This makes a great discussion book or a gift to someone who's a deep thinker.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed the plot but had a really difficult time getting past all the repetition of certain phrases and actions.  If Christian Grey \\"cocks his head to one side\\" again I think I am going to barf.  The characters also frown A LOT and there are other repetitive phrases that bothered me.  Maybe I am too analytical but I am having a difficult time with this.  Be prepared for this.  The book is worth reading though, even with the repetition.  Enjoy!!!

It's just a sci-fi movie claims to be a mystic film, dominated by the ridiculous idea of looking for an origin, an answer to why we exist. Any attempt to fill this why, of course, results in a failure, fueled by the philosophy (again, The Gods Were Astronauts) that we are creations of a superior alien race and that somewhere in space would be the answer. Screenwriters: read Georges Bataille before attempting to make a film like this. It's sad to see a great director like Scott get lost in the midst of a story so naive, in which the characters are poorly developed, engulfed by tons of special effects, except for David, the android, by far the best character in the movie. However, a good character is not enough to save the movie. Why Ridley not spend his talent adapting works such as \\"The Man in the High Castle\\", \\"Ubik\\", \\"Stars: my destination\\" and \\"Memoirs Found in a Bathtub\\" for the cinema? These books need you, Ridley. Please read them and make great movies with them, not movies like \\"Prometheus\\".

B0086700CM|5.0|I had no clue as to what this game was about, and I didn't think it would be fun. Then, my bff showed it to me and I got all excited. At first, it's a little hard, but keep trying and you'll love it!

B007VGXS8M|3.0|I didn't get the black screen bug. The only problem I had was when I first got it, it was 'unable to install'. I just tapped the install button and it installed without a flaw. I had no problem with the extra 40mb because they installed very quickly. The game was fun, but the time limit wasn't.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it Sooo awesome you should really get this app it something to do when your bored or something to do if you simply just wanna have FUN
B0086700CM|5.0|this game works just like it did for the ipod. it is better then ipod.and i have not had any problems. awesome fun game too.
B007VT6QSI|1.0|how bad this album is, and yet how much people like it. I realized, many people (the masses) just don't understand what they are listening to because they aren't musicians who have recorded, and then unfortunately some know but just don't care.  If it tastes like bubble gum, chew it, who cares if it's got aspartame in it. Some I guess just like the sound and his voice, which I can't understand, but to each his/her own. This 'album' describes without words how twisted and fake the music industry has become, and how advertising and money have skewed the public's opinion and understanding of what not just 'good' music is, but what true music is. That is to say, what it was before the technology and software that now exists to clean up any vocal or instrument track, and make even Ashlee Simpson sound good. Technology can be used in good, non-invasive ways to enhance music, but this isn't that case. This is about people taking a marketable kid, making him a star, and continuing to throw the coal into the furnace to power the train onward. Real music is an art that takes many years to develop and master.
B007MXB9XK|4.0|The Pop Up Book arrived in excellent condition and will be very useful as my children and I learn how to create pop-ups.  We plan to make thank you cards, holiday cards, etc.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I gotta say i was a little hesitant to buy this, as some of the reviews stated that the product did not do what it said it would do. However, i don't think the people who left those reviews knew how this product worked. Or they were just one of the few unlucky bunches that received a dud.<br /><br />With that being said i have to say that this product absolutely does work! for everything you want to sound louder and cleaner. Plug it into your laptop and run your headphones or desktop stereo off of it and it will make a big difference. Plug it between your phone and headphones and listen as it makes your headphones not only louder but sound cleaner. I prefer to not use an eq setting because when i have the eq turned off it does an amazing job. the other eq's aren't necessary as this does its job as is with no eq setting. I really like the rechargeable battery. I don't know how long it lasts, but im going camping this weekend and i will find out then.<br /><br />Note- If going camping, and have some portable speakers that are not powered,but are not very loud because your ipod does not power them near as much as your computer does, this amp will change that! Perfect for portable amplification for trips! I own HD428 sennheiser headphones, and even though they aren't very expensive, they sound very good, and with the amp, they sound like $200 headphones! my friends have tried the before and after using the amp and are very impressed. Im a very happy customer, and will be spreading the word about this amazing lil device...and did i mention its cheap!??? :)
B00884GR0W|1.0|it will always never let me get the pickaxe I have no idea why so I deleted it someone tell me what to do
0099579936|1.0|Just downloaded the sample and was utterly gob smacked by the style of writing, it is so random.  The scenarios flit to another one very quickly with absolutely no depth or substance.  One minute Ana is chatting to her mum about candle making and then the next she's on the phone to her step dad.  As for Christian Grey he needs a punch for being so arrognant.  The main female character Ana just acts like a complete idiot with a predictable \\"falling over\\" when she walks into his office on her visit to see him etc etc.<br /><br />I agree with the other comments on here about it being written by a teenager.<br /><br />Read a Lesley Pearse or Lisa Jewell novel - both superb authors who write beautifully, take you on a journey and do not use unnecessarily complex words to describe something simple.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the many choices of translations, don't have to be online to read (only if you want to save bookmarks, notes, etc.)  ive been using the plans to keep me accountable for daily reading, ive really enjoyed getting into the Word. also love that its FREE!!

B006GKHE6G|5.0|Runs beautifully on my evo 3D. I guess that it would run well on a single core 1.5 processor as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book!  The story line kept me interested. Was the type of book you pictured each character in your head.  All of us want or think we know a Christian Grey! Couldn't wait for book two and three.  Wish there were more!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty awesome...great way to waste time....however I don't like the fact that you have to beat all the games in one group before you can open a new one...also there are way too many ads!!!
B007549W62|4.0|The plot has been well described elsewhere, so I'll get right to what I like and don't like. At times, they're the same thing. The idea of several very different people essentially trapped in a bunker is not all that different from the essential setup for [[ASIN:B0010YSD7W 12 Angry Men]] or [[ASIN:B00000K3TO Night of the Living Dead]]. The tension in all of these cases is partially created by external events (the nuclear bombing here) and partially by the dynamics within the group. The result here is treachery, murder, paranoia, and all manner of deception.<br /><br />This aspect strikes me as both a great strength of the film--there is no candy-coating for the situation, no [[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath]]-esque glimmer of hope along the way, much in the way such a situation could well play out--and a great difficulty with the film. It's not exactly fun to watch. But the film is, at least to me, undeniably powerful and quite astute in its observation of the fragile human psyche, and I do recommend it for those who know what they are in for.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Saw that market billing services were enabled with the last update. I don't think so. uninstall pronto. liked the game prior to this update.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great solitaire game...love that it gives you move hints when you age stuck. this is my &quot;go to&quot; game ahem I cant sleep.....free version is fine to me!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Great movie from Ridley Scott and crew. Some people said it was not a prequel of Alien or it was not a prequel of Alien in a classical way. I saw it last night and it is absolutely a real prequel of Alien. As James Cameron did a fantastic sequel of Alien, Ridley Scott made of Prometheus a solid and polished film : huge huge huge sets, great photography, great music, a good script and very good acting. And the special effects and creatures are very detailed and realistic. At the last scene of the film, it migh suggest a sequel....who knows !!
B0086700CM|5.0|I recently downloaded Temple Run on my Kindle Fire,  the graphics are way better than the iPhone version. If you don't have this. DOWNLOAD IT! :D
0812993292|5.0|Harold Fry's sudden and unlikely journey to see a forgotten friend Queenie, in hopes of starving off the cancer that's killing her, starts with a seemingly careless couple of lines scrawled on a hastily written note in response to her letter. What first appears to be a break from boredom in the daily monotony of retirement, Harold decides to walk to the postbox to mail the note. But he doesn't post it, instead he continues on to the next box, and the next, never letting go of his note.<br /><br />This starts the pilgrimage of Harold Fry; which turns out to be a mental pilgrimage much more so than a physical one. Along the way, quirky slices of life and humanity present themselves to Harold and he, in an almost \\"Forest Gump\\" fashion, sees and expresses wisdoms that impact those around him, as well as himself.<br /><br />He begins to reflect on his relationship not only with his wife and son; but with Queenie who played an instrumental role in his life despite the fact that he had hidden from the memories of that time together.  As he walks, his mind delves into a long history of missed opportunities, misunderstandings, failure, and deep hurt; all of which pushes him further down the path to meet with Queenie. Author Rachel Joyce gives us just glimpses into the past at a time, expertly weaving the present to the past, revealing just enough to make us wonder if Harold will complete his journey of understanding and forgiveness of the past, and his present.<br /><br />This is a journey that perhaps most of us on some level understand and relate to, and that is what makes the unlikely pilgrimage of Harold Fry's journey so good.
B0086700CM|1.0|this sucked so bad I bet something else couldn't suck so bad u run u run u get a new person u go and run so much more. and my sister. tried to steal my kindle to play the stupid game and I'm like NO the game sucks.
B007MDB71O|4.0|This is one of the most enjoyable sci-fi movie I've seen so far with a fun storyline and great visual effects, one that sci-fi fans and children would enjoy watching. The ending is one of the best that I've seen by far and it makes you wish that a sequel will be made soon. I hope that Disney would change their mind and actually do it.<br /><br />The PQ and AQ are quite good but I'm not satisfied with the Extras as I'd expect more from a sci-fi movie. There aren't any background info on set designs, alien designs, costume designs or CGI development stage. Maybe it's shown on Disney's Second Screen but I haven't had the chance to load it yet. The Deleted Scenes were not complete and are quite \\"rough\\"; with visible green screen, \\"rough\\" CGI rendering and sketches even...unlike the Deleted Scenes shown on the Star Wars prequels.<br /><br />Lastly my advice to you guys is to keep in mind that the original story was written in 1912 so keep your mind open...don't try to complicate things by thinking that the storyline is ridiculous or it's illogical coz human beings can't breathe on Mars or it's foolish coz there aren't any aliens living on Mars. Just sit back and enjoy this movie...after all, it's a Science Fiction movie...
B0086700CM|2.0|it makes no sense is he running away or in circles<br />and its a bor you could do more with the game I don't understand it the only thing I like is the coins and that was intertaining
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Usually, when there are books that have sequels, I read the first and leave the rest.  I just like to say, \\"Yeah, I know the basics of the plot.\\"  However, with these three books, I guess that I was intrigued to learn what crazy things would happen next.  I have no idea how the books will be made into movies, since there are so many taboo events; however, I am envisioning a Basic Instinct-like trilogy: seductive but leaving more up to the imagination.  All in all, I enjoyed the books, not for their depth but for the entertainment.
B005ZCUA26|5.0|I purchased this to convert an HDMI signal to S video for an older but very nice projector , it works great no distortion easy to use . Follow the instructions that come with it and you should have no problems .
0345803485|5.0|This series Is awesome! It's not as bad as some people make it out to be, so give it a shot!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Written in a confusing style.  The first half of the book is informative about North Korea, its people and politics but the good is destroyed or very nearly destroyed by the second half of the book. The second half does not flow, is full of confusing narrative and adds very little to the overall learning.  I rated it as I did becasue the subject is little written about and did add somewhat positively to the body of liturature.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game is so fun to play I canny play with friends family and people from facebook I love this app everyone that has a kindle fire should get this is the best game in the hole world I just love it cant stop playing I ones fell at sleep playing it love it.... :) ;D.
B0064W65UM|4.0|Moore's story takes place in a not-to-distant Britain in a world that has, for the most part, fallen apart. Disease and economic collapse run rampant outside of England, and is kept out seemingly by the strong hand of a fascist government that \\"saved\\" the nation. Now, however, a mysterious man wants revenge on those who rule the country, and he plans to gain his vengeance while bringing the entire government down around him. \\"People shouldn't be afraid of their government-government's should be afraid of their people.\\"
B001NLCBJI|5.0|I'm super biased, but this is a gorgeous, well written, well acted movie.  It's funny for people who understand subtlety.  Great movie all around.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|After Dark Passion Play and the introduction of the new female vocalist Anette Olzon, it was easy for many to lose a great deal of faith in Nightwish. With a few shining exceptions, Dark Passion Play came off as half-hearted, confused, and above all bitter. While some are quick to blame the new group configuration, truly, Miss Olzon did the best with the compositions she was given - the quality of the vocal performance of Miss Olzon wasn't the problem - Tuomas simply wasn't at his best.<br /><br />This sad state of affairs, however many detractors it may have gained, or fans it may have lost, is clearly at end. Imaginarium is a riveting return to form, an amazing reminder to all who listen to it, not just what Nightwish is truly capable of, but what great music really is. Inspiring, thought provoking, and armed with, not just the stellar production values one would expect, but compositions that hold nothing back.<br /><br />This is not an album with a handful of great songs and enough padding to be shoved off the top of a building, this is what one would hope for in any album - multiple memorable, enjoyable pieces of music that not only stay with a person, but stay for all the right reasons. Layered and profound lyrics are overlayed upon, not just the masterful work of the core of Nightwish, but upon the Choirs and Orchestra worthy of the highest musical standard. It is more developed, more mature, and impressive than what most artists could ever hope to produce.<br /><br />While the term \\"Epic\\" is thrown around to the brink of meaninglessness these days, here the term could scarce be more genuinely appropriate.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Nightwish, this is why. If you're a fan of grand and intricate music, roving and beautiful soundscapes, and songs with meaning and depth, this album is for you. And, finally, if you're a former fan, who turned away after Dark Passion Play in disappointment, this is as clarion a call to return as could ever be.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|This is by far the best Harry Potter Movie.  It's the single movie that made me decide to actually read the books.  I'm glad I did, it ended up being well worth the time.
1410433765|2.0|I read this book before I read The Corrections. Unlike The Corrections I did read Freedom all the way to the end. Patty starts off strong and confident then-in typical misogynistic fashion-is turned into the stereotypical Crazy Lady. I kept reading out of sheer stubborness, a mistake I won't make with any otherr books. Walter was a good character, then he meets the very stereotyped Asian Indian woman and becomes a hateful obnoxious jerk. The only character I liked at the end was the one I hated in the beginning, Richard. Richard actually had a little bit of development. The ending was stupid and insulting--no wife would have reacted that way. When I finished reading The Corrections (which was horrible, and I could not finish it because it got so disgusting and offensive) Freedom suddenly sounded like The Corrections' second draft. Really. Put both books side by side and compare chapter with chapter. I get the feeling Franzen only writes so he can condescend to the reader and have his ego puffed up. I won't be reading him again. I'll read Updike, Oates, Beattie, Hemingway, Faulkner and the other true greats.
B000W10AEI|3.0|While the first two Harry Potter books have a special place in my heart for the mere introduction of such a fantastic world, this movie struggles in its own medium due to being TOO faithful to the books.  Sometimes an adaptation needs a little more to survive, and while there is an update in CGI effects in this movie compared to the first one, it just doesn't seem to do it for me.  It's not a bad movie, though.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|LOVE, love the new punctuation popup!  And the auto-space works almost perfectly.  The predictive text is better than ever.  LOVE this new version even more than before.  Five stars!
B003L20ICO|4.0|Very surprised when I watched this with my wife.  There were so many moments where this movie could have become a typical one, but it never patronizes the audience.  Impressed.
0812993292|5.0|A sweet, kind-hearted, and ultimately hopeful novel about the difference between the way we live and the way we hoped to live.  Endearing characters and a very original plot filled with unexpected moments make this book a pleasure and a gift.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love it. It's addicting &amp; exciting. Try it for yourself but its all fun. As for spending money... pay attention to what you are doing. It is your money so if you don't want to spend it then you surely don't have to.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|When I first saw the cover for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children I knew the book would be something fun and unique.<br />And it certainly is. While some of the ideas in this book (particularly the photos throughout being linked to the story (more on that later)) fall flat, the story is certainly fun.<br />Jacob's grandfather never fails to have extravagant stories from the past about people he knew. Some can turn invisible. Some can build living things out of objects. And there's plenty more. It all seems like the rantings of an old man who has lost his marbles.<br />Upon this premise the book progresses. The plot is fun and imaginative and the characters are well developed. The ending definitely leaves it open for a second book, and in my opinion is very abrupt.<br />My one gripe came with the pictures. Throughout the book, characters or places are described and photos accompany them. In the beginning, I found this kind of neat. But by the end of the book, I was tired of it. Often, I felt information was crammed into the story to make the photo work within it. It made it all seem somewhat unnatural. I'm sure the author's intent was to draw us in , but I would have been perfectly happy (and enjoyed the book more) if the photos were left out.<br />Overall, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a fun read. If you like fanstastical (is that word?) worlds of make-believe, this is the book to read.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|The book has a very clever premise and is very funny. I think that you can see Pratchett  hand a little more than Gaiman's. Being more a Gaiman's fan it worry me for about this long!<br />Great fun book!

0446585025|5.0|Let me start off by saying, I don't generally read biographies, or really anything that any celebrity has written. Really, I just read novels. A friend of mine said this was a funny book and I love Ellen, so I picked it up. It is a quick, short read, however, I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Is it over-priced? Yes. Does it have any new and exciting ideas? No. Is there even really a story? No. Is it funny? Yes!<br /><br />I would say this isn't really a book, but more just funny rambling miniscule stories. But I loved it. It was fun to read - and to me, that is what matters. I didn't expect anything profound while reading this - I just expected Ellen. The book makes you happy and in an odd way, makes you feel good about yourself. Maybe it's just because you are chuckling and all the endorphins are racing, I'm not sure.<br /><br />Worth checking out for a light-hearted, silly, feel good read. Much like Ellen herself...Without the read part. ;)<br /><br />Be kind to one another!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Fifty shades of Grey can be compared to a spiced up Mills and Boon with a twist. You certainly do not have to have any intelligence just an open mind. We would all love to meet Christiaan and be whisked away into the sunset - I am constantly surprised that sex has so many possibilities. How this book ever topped Harry Potter leaves me speechless. The end of the book unfortunately leaves you with no option to buy the second and eventually the third book.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|The package only had 3 movies in it. the additional disk were duplicates to make up the set. once again, added dvd's with production stats were included instead the the last movie, Resurrection. it was not in the set. Idod't want to the set back but i would like to have the last movie.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Edit:  Apple Care tech I talked to was wrong.  Took it to an apple store and they replaced it, and the new one works fine,<br /><br />Original: If you're using this with one of the new (2012) Macbooks, it won't quite work as advertised.  It can charge the battery.  Or it can power the computer.  But, it can't do both at the same time.  I spoke with Apple Care Tech Support, and they confirmed that this is how it's designed to work.  Too bad.  I was hoping to avoid paying $80 for an extra charger.

1936608898|5.0|It Starts With Food, by Dallas and Melissa Hartwig, is hands down the best thing to come out since Robb Wolf's Paleo Solution! It's timely publication is exactly what the paleo community needed as mainstream media begins to become more and more aware of this style of eating and labeling it the \\"caveman diet\\". It Starts With Food (ISWF) sets the record straight...this isn't about what our primal ancestors ate, it's about making you more healthy, here and now.<br /><br />Who would have thought a nutrition book could be a page turner??? To be honest, I sure didn't. When I first sat down with ISWF, I had my highlighter, my colored pens, and Google up and ready to go. I was expecting to need all of these to help me decipher all the research science that accompanies so many nutrition books (Have you tried reading Good Calories, Bad Calories cover to cover yet?). ISWF is different, it's like your sitting right there with Dallas and Melissa just having a conversation with friends. ISWF is as casual as a story, as enthralling as a secret, and as mind blowing as only the truth can be. And that my friends is why you keep turning the page wanting to know more.<br /><br />Every chapter is loaded with the perfect blend of science and practical application. Whether you are new to the whole paleo gig or a well schooled veteran, there is something within these pages to learn and share. Starting with the role of hormones. ISWF helps decode the direct effect that food has on your hormones and as a result on your day to day activities. Sorry kids, but just because you made it past puberty, doesn't mean hormones can't have a nasty effect on your daily routine. ISWF then takes you through the Good Food Standards, a set of 4 criteria for recommending which foods we should eat.  Guess what? These standards have nothing to do with calories, grams, timing, or measuring (thank the Lord! we don't need another diet book!). After the good, the bad, and the ugly are identified, a challenge is presented. You know about it, have heard about it, and maybe even have done one before: the Whole 30. A challenge to eat by super squeaky clean good-food standards for 30 days in your own personal experiment. But they don't leave you there at the end of your 30 days, ISWF breaks down strategies for long-term success, meal planning, and special populations,  because this is so much more than 30 days, this is your life!<br /><br />Bottom Line: ISWF breaks down the technical \\"science-y stuff\\" that dictates the do's and dont's of paleo into regular everyday conversation.  It gives you the backing and support you need when people ask you those hard questions, like...What's so wrong with beans? Now you have the words to mumble something slightly more intelligent other than \\"Uhh...Dallas and Melissa said so...\\" which is really the point of the whole book--\\"Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for the rest of his life.\\"<br /><br />So whether you are looking to change your lifestyle or to refresh your passion for healthy eating, It Starts With Food should definitely be in your Amazon check-out cart in the next few minutes!sented.

Teach a man to fish and he will eat for the rest of his life.\\"<br /><br />So whether you are looking to change your lifestyle or to refresh your passion for healthy eating, It Starts With Food should definitely be in your Amazon check-out cart in the next few minutes!

B007SGM084|5.0|I was weary of paying so much for the triology. I think that the cost is too high. But with that said, I am very happy I did buy it. I have not been able to put it down. Putting aside the carnal parts of the story, reading the development of a relationship is what I am hooked on. I have never in my life grinned while reading a book. I cannot help myself when I read the exchanges between Ana and Grey. I can understand how some people may not like the book because they focus too much on one aspect. The who storyline is facinating and has me hooked. How can you love and dislike a character at the same time. I am halfway through the second book and can't read fast enough. I just wish the kindle had a better voice to the read to me feature so that I could still enjoy the book while I am unable to sit and read. I would recommend it to anyone.

0345803485|5.0|This was my first time reading an \\"Erotic Romance\\" and I will say that I was blown away.  I absolutely loved it and couldn't put it down.  I was up 'til all hours of the night trying to finish it.  I read the entire series one weekend while we were on vacation at the beach. My brother's Mother-in-law who is in her early 70's was reading it too and she and I were racing eachother to finish it.  The whole weekend my mother (who is in her late 60's and is a conservative, Southern Baptist) swore up and down that she would never read that \\"filth\\" but then by the end of the weekend after hearing all of us talk about it she decided to take my books home with her to read!<br /><br />My husband and I could definitely learn a few things from this novel.  We aren't going to start whipping eachother or anything but we could definitely use a little more romance in the bedroom.  I can't wait for E.L. James to write the entire series again through Christian's eyes!

B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This stellar classic of American literature is about the sustaining power of dreams, the synergy of partnership and the heroic sacrifice of one man for another who needed help just to get through the day. Steinbeck's masterful novella is played out by a pair of itinerant farm workers traveling together during the Great Depression. The large, muscular and mentally challenged Lennie is  dependent on the small but world-wise and devoted George. The villains are the vicious and newly married Curley, son of the ranch owner, and his trampy wife (who remains unnamed throughout the book.) With the financial help of Candy, a fellow worker, George and Lennie's dream of owning a small farm seems within grasp, despite Curley's bullying of Lennie. But the emotional bullying of Curley's wife proves destructive to the gentle giant. In the end, George and the farm hands remain loyal to Lennie despite an horrific crime he accidentally commits.<br /><br />Film and stage versions have mutilated the roles of Curleys' wife and Lennie, softening her to appeal to the female audience and hardening Lennie, but the evidence of CW as an unsympathetic character is there on the page: a) the mistrust of her by the reliable and world-wise George and the other men; b) her frequent visits to the bunkhouse where she has no business; c) her provocative posing in the bunkhouse doorway where the sun exposes her legs through her thin dress; d) the gloating pleasure she takes in watching Crooks, the black stable buck, shrivel in fear over her threats to have him lynched; and e) the way she titillates the vulnerable Lennie by sitting close to him in the barn, encouraging him to caress her hair, knowing full well her closeness will stimulate him. She's a vicious tease, getting off on her sexual power over men.<br /><br />Many have touted Curley's wife as a misunderstood victim of her times, but making excuses for her would be a travesty. She's one of the earliest examples in American literature of a well drawn female villain, an archetype of the otherwise powerless slutty female using her sexual power over men to gain some sense of control in a world where women had little power outside narrowly defined roles.<br /><br />After threatening Crooks with lynching, Curley's wife goes after Candy and Lennie, demonstrating her power over them as well. At the beginning of the scene she comments about the \\"weak ones\\" (her words) being left behind while the others went to town. By the end of the scene, she has asserted animal-like dominance over all three men through emotional bullying. Together, both Curley and his wife fulfill the villain role in this drama, and of the two, the wife is the more destructive. Curley is a physical bully whereas she is an emotional bully, viciously attacking \\"the weak ones left behind\\" and gloating over her conquest.<br /><br />((...She turned at last to the other two.<br /><br />Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. \\"If you was to do that [lie about Crooks to get him in trouble], we'd tell,\\" he said quietly. \\"We'd tell about you framin' Crooks.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tell an' be damned,\\" she cried. \\"Nobody'd listen to you an' you know it. Nobody'd listen to you.\\"<br /><br />Candy subsided. \\"No ...\\" he agreed. \\"Nobody'd listen to us.\\"<br /><br />Lennie whined, \\"I wisht George was here. I wisht George was here.\\"<br /><br />Candy stepped over to him. \\"Don't you worry none,\\" he said. \\"I jus' heard the guys comin' in. George'll be in the bunkhouse right now, I bet.\\" He turned to Curley's wife. \\"You better go home now,\\" he said quietly. \\"If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was here.\\"<br /><br />She appraised him cooly. \\"I ain't sure you heard nothing.\\" [meaning nobody would listen to him]<br /><br />\\"Better not take no chances,\\" he said. \\"If you ain't sure, you better take the safe way.\\"<br /><br />She turned to Lennie. \\"I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself.\\" She slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And while she went through the barn, the halter chains rattled, and some horses snorted and some stamped their feet. [Even the animals sense she is dangerous.]))<br /><br />What is there to misunderstand about such cruelty? Perhaps CW's apologists are confusing the screen/theater versions with what Steinbeck first put down on paper. Perhaps they're projecting onto her their personal desires that women always remain the warm, cuddly, \\"sugar-and-spice\\" creatures of the fairy tale. Perhaps they should watch FATAL ATTRACTION and get a stronger dose of female villainhood.<br /><br />It is condescending toward women to assume they're incapable of being strong villains.<br /><br />Every villain has reasons for their cruel, antisocial behavior. When the villain is male, who makes excuses for him? Why should we excuse CW as a \\"misunderstood?\\" Because of her gender? No, that's a double standard.<br /><br />The book celebrates the anti-heroism of George, who devoted his life to the comfort and well-being of the meek and vulnerable Lennie. It would be a sad mistake to dishonor that noble intent by warping the story into some statement on female victimhood, as the '92 film did.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0088FODUM BIRDBOY-1: Prince (BIRDBOY: STORIES FROM AN AMERICAN ORPHANAGE)]]<br /><br />[...]or and disappeared into the dark barn.

0345803485|5.0|Some of the reviews on the fifty shades of grey books make me laugh. I am not sure what people were expecting when they read the books but no one has ever made these books out to be award winning novels. They are just for fun! Its so nice to be able to escape your hectic life for a while and become obsessed with the characters in this book. Does Anastasia say \\"oh crap\\" a lot? yes, but that is because her character is a 21 year old naive college girl... what else do you expect her to say? I read all three books in a very short period of time and I was actually pretty bummed out when I finished, not because I didnt like them, but because they were over. I really hope the author decides to write a book in Christians perspective because I dont think we are done obsessing over him. I have suggested these books to many of my friends and they have all loved them. When reading these books, dont expect a classic... just enjoy it and have fun!

B004EQAVHI|5.0|As a fan of the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, I was hesitant to watch the film version as I didn't want to be disappointed. However, I am pleased to say that I was not disappointed in the slightest. The film was just as amazing as the book was and with three strong performances from Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, and Keira Knightly, I was incredibly satisfied with the character portrayal. Highly recommend.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|The title description speaks for itself.I won't bore you with a song by song review because all the songs are amazing from the beginning to end...Classic sound with a modern twist.Rush is that one band that will never disappoint.They remain one of my fave bands ever,if not favorite and I'm sure they will still put out albums after this release.If you're a Rush fan pretty much from the beginning,this is for you.You won't take the disc out of your player.Yes,I still buy cd's and will until they are not made anymore  Rock n roll!!!!  \m/
0099579936|1.0|I initially had no desire to read this book but I became ridiculously curious and decided to give it a go, purely for laughs. And my, what laughs it provided.<br /><br />First, the writing of the novel is atrocious. The author desperately needs a thesaurus and some imagination because halfway through the novel, I couldn't believe how many times Ana 'flushed' or how 'tenacious' Kate was. So repetitive and so boring. Secondly, the plot itself is...different, though incredibly unbelievable and unrealistic. There was little to no character depth and yet, the author managed to make nearly every single character frustrating, especially Ana. I'm deeply irritated with the lack of female empowerment in literature in general but Fifty Shades of Grey is hands down the worst representation of a woman I've read thus far. To have a female main character be instantly drawn to a man and then being so easily taken by him is unsettling; Ana may be unexperienced but that doesn't mean she had to be so willing.<br /><br />I'm not finished with the novel and I'll complete it because I've already invested time in it but I would never recommend this book to anyone.

B002BY77CW|5.0|I've always been a big fan of The Hills and Lauren Conrad.  I enjoyed seeing the teens grow and head off to college.  I've heard about a lot of reality television taking a toll on the people involved and leaving them out to bleed.  I've also heard that it's rough out there when there's so much peer pressure and temptation.  In a mild way, this book deals with this using characters, not Conrad.  However, I do belief that she's reflected a little on her life in reality television.  It's a nice, light summer read.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My whole family loves the Hunger Games books.  The books are read fast, especially by the teens in the family.  Actually, the teens are rereading now, and that is rare for them to enjoy books enough to reread them.  If you haven't read any of the trilogy, please start with the first book so you'll be in the game.  I don't have time to reread them like the teens, but I am saving them for a winter read when things slow down a bit.  Rule of thumb: these books are a keeper.  Warning though, if you loan them out, they probably won;t be returned, as they are hot books to reread.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Simply put, just a beautiful album. Unless you're still living in the 90's you should definitely give this album a listen.
0345803485|3.0|I have to admit that I am not as impressed with this book as others. There are some pretty good \\"adult\\" scenes in the book but I still don't understand all the raving reviews. I found this book to be very drawn out & I find Anastasia as confusing as Christian. Because my sister bought me the whole trilogy, I will continue but I can tell that the emotinal instability (which both Christian and Anastasia seem to suffer from) is going to continue & after a lot more beating around the bush, they will get married and live happily ever after. Idk? I guess I'm immune to the 50 shades fever :/

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I couldn't concentrate on the story because the writing is so terrible. Repetitive, stumbling, and just painful all round. I don't understand the hype at all, such a disappointment. Please, no more.
B0087240Z4|5.0|First like many of the reviewers here I have been a big fan since my first time listening to the band back in the Siamese Dream days. Over the years in one way or the next I've collected a large inventory of the SP songs and listen often to a lot of the old stuff. I've even got moon studio demo records, mashed potatoes, gravity etc etc. I have stuck with the band through thick and thin holding onto hope that Billy would find it again. After the past few ho-hum efforts I wasn't really all that excited about the Pumpkins releasing a new album. I had moved on and have started enjoying other comparable bands (such as The Silversun Pickups) but with Oceania I'm sucked right back in. This album delivers most everything that has been missing. As others have said...it sounds like a band playing a compilation of songs they enjoy playing and not a band going through the motions and playing the notes exactly how dude wants them played or in other words there is personality to this album. This album has a very fresh sound without the cringing feeling like Billy has leaped into the abyss of short sighted creativity gaps.

1401937519|4.0|Such a wonderful book with wonderful truths. It's written from a very objective point of view and I actually prefer that. I have been attempting to study The Course for years now and it's so heavily written that it requires breaks of reading other spiritual lighter books, such as this one.  I really appreciate that what Anita experienced is so aligned with The Course and is yet another validation that it is true.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the end of Anita's book - particularly the last 4 chapters.  The beginning talks about how she was raised and the beliefs/illusions she was raised with and how it affected her. It was itneresting, but it did tend to drag on a bit (hence the 4 stars). I wish the book would have been only about her NDE and her perspective after, but then we wouldn't know what incorrect beliefs she had at the beginning of her life to cause her cancer, would we?<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed and felt very uplifted when I read it. I particularly enjoyed the Q&A portion of the book. We ARE all One.  If only everyone could try and learn things and read through a spiritual perspective rather than a human perspective.<br /><br />We all need to remember \\"We are not human beings having a spiritual experience.  We are spiritual beings having a human experience.\\"  --Pierre Teilhard de Chardin<br /><br />Namaste.
B007UXSDYU|2.0|Just when you thought that things couldn't get any worse during an apocalypse, along comes The Divide to prove to you just how much more depressing things can be.  The Divide tell the story of a group of 9 people who are forced into a nuclear bomb shelter when a nuclear war breaks out in the world above them.  Among the group is Micky (played by Michael Beihen), the owner of the shelter, who is none to pleased with having to share his new residence and the supplies inside of it with the other people.  Micky barks orders, makes snide and racist comments, and generally acts like an ass to everyone else while the world outside can be heard being destroyed by explosions.  Micky eventually learns that treating everyone like a jerk is a bad way to form solidarity amongst a group of people.... unless you want them to be in solidarity against YOU.  He learns this lesson too late as the group becomes tired of his antics and revolts against him, taking him prisoner in his own \\"home.\\"<br /><br />From there, the remaining group members degenerate,  Morals begin to decay, despair at the likelihood that they'll never be saved starts to take it's toll, and living conditions become disgusting.  This results in a \\"divide\\" (probably the reason why the movie gets its name) between two factions of people.  They consist of those who are miserable and doing nothing, and those who are miserable and acting like degenerates.  The latter group hoards all of the food and supplies in an attempt to force the former group into joining them in their debauchery, which includes repeatedly raping one of the female survivors and acting like swine.  The whole situation continues to break down until there is a final confrontation between the two factions.<br /><br />The movie does a great job of painting a bleak picture of what would obviously be a horrible situation.  The bunker is dark and uncomfortable.  The conditions become so bad that you can almost smell the stench building up through your screen.  Also, the acting is decent, and everyone is believable in their rolls.  However, the good aspects of this movie stop there.<br /><br />Though the first 20 minutes or so are filled with a good amount of suspense and intrigue, the majority of the film is depressing and boring.  For over an hour and a half (the remained of this film), the audience is treated to multiple rapes, lude references, people deficating on the floor, whining, body dismemberment, and some very dull conversations.  While I understand that the director is trying to convey just how bad this situation is, 90+ minutes is way more than what is needed to make this point.  In fact, it actually becomes torturesome for the viewer to have to sit through much of this just to see the conclussion of the movie.  We are also treated to images of everyone suffering the affects of radiation poisoning and unsanitary condition, EXCEPT for the character of Eva (played by Lauren German) who seems to keep relatively clean, well-kept, and intact despite the lack of showers and exposure to radiation.  Why?  I don't know, but I think it might have something to do with the fact that she's cute.<br /><br />The characters, though well-played by the actors, are two-dimensional at best.  We have hardly any backstory on them, and while it isn't always necessary to have long histories about each character, it is troublesome for this movie.  This is particularly true in the case of Michael Beihen's character.  He obviously has some deep-rooted hatered burning inside of him, but we never get to see why.  We get a glimps or two of some pictures of his life prior to the war, but nothing is ever explained about what happened to that life.  With no backstory and little of anything else, we are never given much of a reason to like any of the characters early on in the movie.  And as the show wears on, the few reasons we did have to like any of them are stripped away until all of them become deplorable.  By the time this movie is over, it's hard not to find yourself hoping to see all of them die.<br /><br />There's also the case of the masked \\"soldiers\\" who invade the compound early on, and kidnap the youngest member of the group.  Did I forget to mention them?  Well, that's ok, because after they make their grand entrance a half-hour into the movie, the writers forgot about them, too.  This is a shame, as these individuals shake things in the bunker up quite nicely.  They break, grab a girl, shoot some rounds to scare the other survivors, and leave with the girl (still screaming) shoved into a plastic, biohazard bag.  Shortly after, the group attempts to see what's going on outside (and to rescue the hostaged girl) using a biohazard suit that taken from a soldier they killed during the altercation.  A man is sent outside, and he discovers a group of scientists/soldiers similar to the ones that attacked them conducting experiments, as well as an area where children (including the one who was kidnapped) are being kept in some type of suspended animation for an unknown purpose.  After the advernturer is chased back to the bunker, the door to the shelter is sealed shut.... and none of these things are ever dealt with again.  The soldiers... their \\"lab\\".... the children they've got locked away like lab rats.... all of this could've made this movie 100 times more interesting, but instead it is all forgotten and used as an excuse to have the bunker welded shut (a feat that could've easily been solved with a cave-in of the buildings above over the shelter without leaving as many unanswered questions or causing as much confussion).<br /><br />Probably my worst complaint is the end of this movie.  The final five minutes feature a character making decisions that do not make any sense for them, and performing an escape attempt from the bunker that is so remarkably simple, everyone else inside looks dumber for not having thought of it sooner.<br /><br />Overall, this movie had lots of potential, but eventually deteriorates into a waste of time.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|Anyone else out there hear how horrible the audio is on this disc?  If you don't, I challenge you to compare this mix to any album Rush released in the mid 70's - 80's.  I can't hear any ride cymbal, the crashes decay too fast, and the vocals are over-processed and too loud.  The sound is muddy and crushed and I'm upset that the boys didn't point this out.  A professional band should produce a better product than a basement recording.  What a shame because there are a few good songs on this disc and I like the heavier direction they took with this, compared to their previous release.  No complaints about the playing, as usual, its top notch.  As another reviewer pointed out there is too much singing and not enough instrumental sections.  I agree.  To me, these breaks are what make Rush stand out. Without the breaks, they start to sound less like Rush and more like every other rock band.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent album, but after the shine wears off and I want to listen to Rush I probably won't reach for this.
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is a cool game.I mean like its cool to play it when you hag noting to do. in my spear time I play it or whenever I'm bored so yea ... that's all I have to say woo bye
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn works magic with words! I haven't even finished the story yet, but it is so beautifully written that I had to review it anyway. Amazing. I never want this book to end, except that I can't wait to read more of her work.
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|The Innkeepers is a creepy haunted hotel film. Basically, Claire and Luke work at a hotel that's about to close and they want to prove it's haunted. Madeline O'Malley is the ghost and her design is amazing (the scene in the bedroom gave me chills!). The acting was fine and I actually liked both of the main characters. The comedy bits were also a nice addition (not a horror/comedy though). The music was also well done. It's a slow-burning type of movie; the movie generally moves at a slow pace.<br /><br />The tension it builds works for and against the film. Sometimes, the tension would be dreadful and lead to something terrifying. Other times, the tension would be too long and lead to a weak scare or nothing at all. Which leads to another point, it's not as scary as it could've been. The scares are limited for a 1hr 40min film. The slow pace may also make some people slowly drift away; I'm personally a fan of all horror, especially slow horror though.<br /><br />There is some blood and frightening sequences, no sex or nudity so it's tamed compared to other modern horror films. Definitely recommend to any fans of slow horror.
030758836X|2.0|I loved reading this book, until I got to the end. It's ingenious with a great plot. I felt cheated, because it's a long novel and after I finished it I felt like I had wasted my time. A satisfying ending would have been more appropriate and appreciated. The author is obviously a brilliant writer. But I have to ask myself, how can brilliant people be so stupid?
B001LOYRP8|2.0|I LOVE Michael Jackson, but the additions to this album and the remixes are horrible.  MJ never swears in his music, and the remix versions of his songs are filled with vulgar language.  I am NOT a fan of Akon, Fergie, will.i.am, and most definitely NOT Kanye West.  The only reason I chose to purchase this is because of the final track FOR ALL TIME.  I am highly disappointed that such low-class selection of artists was chosen to remix his classic Thriller songs for a 25th anniversary edition album.
B003B02O14|2.0|I discovered John Grisham about 6 months ago and to date I have read about 8 of his novels. \\"The Partner\\" was my most recent, and also my last. (\\"The Appeal\\" was almost my last). I never really cared for Grisham's endings, but I put up with them because he's so good. But this book was the last straw. After I finished reading it I felt like I had wasted my time. I felt cheated because of the crappy ending. The only way Grisham can redeem himself in my eyes is if he write a sequel and therefore rights a terrible wrong.
0345803485|5.0|I don't get all the negative reviews. EVERYONE I know that is reading this or has read it can not put the books down. I usually take me a while to read anything but these books keeps me on the edge. I am actually on the 3rd book now and I am getting worried about it coming to an end. Yes this is fantasy and a pretty good one at that. The writer in my opinion is amazing. She sounds and writes like a real person which is why I love it. You will find yourself reacting as if the female caracter is you. Love this book.....I wish the story would just keep going on.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is uber addictive! I find it very hard to put down once I've started! You will definitely enjoy it.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|it would be better if you could hook it up to a printer. other the that its good. make it a better price.
1439127700|3.0|Everything is either Ikes fault or Nixons. Thats all you need to know. It didnt matter that JFK was an inexperienced, drug addict, and incompetent. It didnt matter than LBJ was your tyipical Democrat grifter. Giving away free stuff for votes and becoming immensly rich in the process. Dont know if i can go much further in this mess. Tries to be Halberstam but just isnt. Nixon and Ike evil. JFK,Truman,LBJ all well meaning but duped by the rascally republicans. You would almost think the writers worked for Time mag
B0054JZC6E|3.0|nothing special. it has a bit of lag and doesn't respond very quickly to your touch. however the games are entertaining.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just what I wanted! my favorite is the quick look at temperature forecast for two weeks. I haven't had any problems.
B007NZDES0|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DVD/CD!  Made me feel like I was at the show again!  That was the absolute best show I have ever attended.  SADE FOREVER!
0553381687|4.0|This book is by far one of the best fantasy-epics I have ever read. Martin's characters are so deep and his world is alive with wonder and excitement. Every page is mesmerizing and every chapter is unique in that it takes a different character's perspective each time. I was originally brought to this book because of the popular show on HBO, after reading this book I may not go back to watching the show. The book is leaps and bounds ahead of the show and does a much better job of completely telling the story the way that Martin envisioned it. The devil is in the details and George R.R. Martin is one devilish writer.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|If Fifty Shades of Grey was like a bottle of 2 Buck Chuck, Fifty Shades Darker is like a deep-fried Oreo. You know without a doubt that nothing good can possibly come of consuming it. You know it's so thoroughly disgusting, right down to its core, that it will probably drop you where you stand. Yet somewhere in the back of your head, a little voice whispers \\"Eat me...I'm gooey and sinful...You know you can't resist me...\\" And then you spend a week pounding it out on the treadmill, or in this case, curled up reading Pulitzer Prize winners, to purge yourself of the horror. At this point, I think it goes without saying that, against my better judgment, I checked out the second book from the library. Thank God my temporary insanity didn't inspire me to actually BUY it.<br />Within the first 5 minutes of the book, Ana has cried, whimpered, moaned, cried some more, and generally reaffirmed her overall lack of appeal. Within 10 minutes, she's decided that the scene at the end of the last book--you know, the one that inspires her to leave Christian, the one where he gets his rocks off by savagely flogging her with a belt--is her fault. Oh really? I have to slap myself and double check to make sure the feminist movement wasn't just a figment of my imagination.<br />In other news, our intrepid 'heroine' has expanded her vocabulary of expletives to include 'holy cow', 'holy s***', and, under conditions of extreme duress, 'holy mother f***'. Christian's vocabulary, however, remains largely unchanged, and unfortunately retains such gems as 'laters, baby'. When was the last time you heard a grown American male say 'laters, baby'? Oh, that's right--never. I'm pretty sure the last time I heard it was in Bend It Like Beckham. While I'm on the topic of annoying phrases, let's discuss 'just-f***ed hair'. Ever since the first reference, each subsequent one increases my desire to 'just-f***ing' dig my eyeballs out with a rusty shrimp fork so I can no longer succumb to my brain's traitorous urges to actually READ this chaff.<br />In summary: Ana's a spineless, whiny, whimpering idiot. She hems, haws, bites her lip, occasionally shows a flash of defiance, and then goes right back to her \\"woe is me, I couldn't possibly deserve this Greek god of a man who's hung like a hippo and gets great joy out of beating me\\" schtick. Worse, the one appealing part of Christian's character--the kicking a** and taking names part--degrades into a whiny, Ana-like, I'll-die-if-you-leave-me sad sack. Between the parts where he's scolding her for everything under the sun, anyway. The combination of Christian's character degeneration, the pointless stalker plotlines (WHAT do either of these characters have going for them to inspire stalkers?! Enlighten me, please!), and Ana's insipid and obnoxious inner goddess doing all kinds of gymnastics has me feeling dirtier, more shameful, and about 10 IQ points lower than I did when I started the book.<br />Some might argue that E.L. James' ability to make millions of otherwise sensible people cast aside pride, judgment, and literary taste and pick up her books is the sign of a great author. Personally, I think it's stubborn refusal to believe that someone could write something that mind-numbingly horrific twice. Well, ladies and gentlemen (I'm sure there's a few of you out there reading these books), I'm here to tell you that Ms. James has done the unthinkable. As a matter of fact, I'd be willing to bet she's written something that mind-numbingly horrific THREE times. Since I have yet, to date, to take the shrimp fork to my eyeballs, I'll probably wind up reading the third one, and undoubtedly hating myself a little bit more. At least I'll have fun 'just-f***ing' tearing it to pieces when I'm done.
B00846REIS|1.0|First..I bought this book because I was really missing Fifty shades which I loved..so when I saw this and how people were saying this was even better I got excited and thought what the heck? Well what the heck is I feel as though Sylvia just took what Ms. James wrote and just made it slightly her own.  She had no original ideas of her own this was a complete copy of Fifty.  Second..most people who hated fifty make fun of the characters names but I would much rather read about Christian and Ana then Gideon and Eva.  I don't understand why she copied so much of fifty and why people would say that it's better when it's the same.  I would agree the writing style is a little better and not such like a child wrote it but I don't feel what these characters feel at all unlike in fifty...I do not recommend this if you have read fifty as the whole time I am reading this I feel like I am reading a mock story such as The Hunger Pains instead of The Hunger Games.  I wish I could say this felt like a book all it's own but truth is it didn't...this is one author who took someone's idea thinking she could revamp it and didn't quite deliver.  Waste of time and money.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.It gave a modern insight into an old problem in India.<br />I had read a preview and couldn't wait to read the full book. It kept me enthralled.<br />It was easy to read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is very fun if you like puzzles. highly recommend this game worth every penny.  you will enjoy it.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|Ok I was very much excited when I got word her new cd was going to drop. So with no delay I went to pick it up (Huge!!! Mistake) This new release is just terrible. I don't know where to begin. First off the music has no soul to it at all, and eventhough she is a good poet the tracks are just plain boring and have no direction. Extremely disappointed with it. There should be a recall on this album. So it may be another 8 years before she releases another cd and I can only pray she gets back to making good music.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a great time waister then after the tenth time I'm over it then some else bores me and I'm back on....great on my kindle though
B0088WJQ1G|5.0|Glen Hansard's new album (\\"Rhythm and Repose\\") is the kind of album to curl up and listen to with a glass of melancholic red wine.<br /><br />I have found myself moved to tears over and over at the quiet beauty and sadness interwoven in the music of this album. Glen's voice and the strong-but-quiet bluesy guitar blend and create an experince I've been craving for more than I have ever known. It has been love at first listen.<br /><br />I've never heard of Glen before purchasing this album based on Amazon's snippets, but he has quickly risen to the top of my go-to albums.<br /><br />Thank you, sir.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think this app is great! I try to go on when I can. iitbis very addicting. I also like bakery story a well. I give it a thumbs up!!!!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Not to take anything from the rest of the album, but The Garden is the best song from them since 'Losing It'.  It's very reminiscent, but so much better.  And, yes, the rest is the best since Counterparts, easily.
B0086700CM|5.0|F.Y.I u know u could have just gotten this game @ 1mobil.com b4 it came out on KF app store . Anyway this game is amazing I'm saving up 4 karma lee!!A MUST GET GAME !!!!!!!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This product is awful. I purchased from a local store after reading the IGN review which gave it 10/10...called it a \\"Masterpiece\\". This thing is a disaster and completely ruins the hand tracking. First when you set it up, re-calibrate immediately. But right off the bad you'll notice that the little square on the screen showing what Kinect is tracking is all distorted and the edges are black. This is due to the \\"fish-eye\\" effect of the Zoom lenses. Even after calibrating, launch Kinect Sports and just hold your hand in a spot on the screen...you'll see the hand pointer jump all over the place even if you're not moving. Also playing the boxing you will see your characters erratic movements as the tracking fails due to the Zoom being attached.<br /><br />Save your money - I am definitely returning mine. This is one of those things that seems like a great idea but it just plain doesn't work. I wish it did.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE \\"Extraordinary Machine.\\" I confess I may be overreacting in this review because it's nearly 180 degrees away from everything that made \\"Machine\\" one of my all-time favorite albums. But how else am I supposed to respond? \\"Machine,\\" while mostly melancholy and wistful in tone, had a variety of sounds, styles, and tempos. Nearly every song had a nice melodic hook or two. She took great care with her metaphors. (On the new one, they often make me wince.) The album was theatrical at times but never overdone.<br /><br />And, remember, the album was book-ended by two songs, the title track and \\"Waltz (Better than Fine),\\" that let a little light in. She sounded like someone who was coming to terms with her struggles in life. She was gaining perspective, even wisdom. There's nothing like that on the new one. She sounds like she's stabbing at the same wound, over and over again. I say \\"stabbing\\" because this is a violent-sounding album. While I'm sure she's not faking the pain that she feels, authenticity is only one of many necessary ingredients for a really good performance. Her pain makes for some ugly and unpleasant listening, to say the least.<br /><br />I guess I'm supposed to imagine that her abandonment of pop song-craft is a sign of artistic growth and maturity. Many of the glowing reviews I've read have said as much. I don't buy it. I like pop song-craft. And I think you can be incredibly sad--if that's what you're trying to communicate--and still construct a decent melody, and arrange the song in a way that complements the theme and tone, and make sure your words cohere into something sensible. The reason why some self-consciously serious artists eschew pop hooks and catchy melodies is because it's HARD to write pop hooks and catchy melodies! At times, I admire the percussive piano and sound effects that she and her collaborator create, but a little goes a long way. Long before the end of the record, they become monotonous.<br /><br />The new album is relentlessly bleak to the point of being nihilistic. There's not a funny or light moment on the whole record, as far as I can hear. I keep reading from the critics that she's \\"finally grown up\\" on this album--as if there's something more realistic or honest about what she's feeling now than before. I don't see it. I'm a grown-up with several more years under my belt than her, and her experience of life is very different from mine or anyone else I know. Life can be incredibly painful, but it's still good--not to mention filled with beauty, love, and friendship. And when life is bad, isn't it the case that we often bear some (not all, but some) of the responsibility? It seems like a fully mature human being would have the wisdom to see this--and be able to laugh at herself a little bit.<br /><br />Besides, what exactly is she getting so worked up about, anyway? Failed romantic relationships... again? Even if anger is your theme, there are so many other things to be angry about in the world. Why not look outside of oneself every once in a while and say something meaningful about--I don't know--the human condition, injustice, senseless violence, greed, the elusiveness of peace in the world?<br /><br />As it is, she's covered this same ground every time out, except this time she sounds depressed to the point of being mentally ill. Seriously. It's hard to enjoy a singer-songwriter whose health and well-being I can't help but worry about!<br /><br />\\"The Idler Wheel\\" is a perfect rock critic's record. It's hard to listen to, humorless, and self-consciously serious. Those of us who actually pay for our music should think twice. It's an ugly, hate-filled (toward herself as well as others) record, which I never want to hear again.<br /><br />The new album is relentlessly bleak to the point of being nihilistic.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. There is so much detail and graphics. I have been playing this since about a week ago and i am obsessed with it! And so is my family. My sister and i play it all the time. But the only thing I didn't like about this is that it took a very long time to make it to the amazon app store...But it was so worth it!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I think its kinda lame<br />it should actually have ninjas in it<br />if I were you I'd buy it but not play it all the time
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I knew I was getting a book that had rave reviews but did not know exactly what it was about. Once I started reading I was drawn in, shocked, educated and filled with suspense. It is a must read for those that are not easily offended.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run<br />but I think they should have more stuff you can buy<br />best game I own<br />and they. should. make stuff last longer
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A must read. Thrilling, Entertaining and Educational of other life styles. It is not for the faint of heart or narrowminded.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|its coooool but personally<br />I wish they had more birds &amp;<br />more angry birds(free) stuff<br />I would buy it if I were you but I wouldn't play it all the time
1416550534|4.0|The House at Riverton was a slow start, but as I continued through the next couple hundred pages I found it to be absolutely a terrific look into the history of house servers and maids. Then the entanglement of love affairs and giving up of dreams and then the murder, deaths, and and and... but, you have to wait it out until almost the end of the 500 page book. I did enjoy it after all.
1444737090|5.0|I'm not a big book reader, but I love cats and heard about this story in the news.  I bought the Kindle addition for my iPhone and it has been the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon.  Truly inspiring and emotional, the book will draw you in and you won't be able to stop reading it until you have read the entire book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very accurate<br />seems to be correct every time I 've checked it.  I love it and never have any problems with it and its free awesome!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a really great game. I'm loving the animations, the dialogue ow cute, and you cant be the price. FREE!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I'm enjoying it but don't like a lot of the animal and baby puzzles. we'll see what puzzles I can add later. I do like the different levels available.
B007UXT6O6|3.0|I recently rented this movie and, I must say, I don't know what all the hoopla was about.  It was just OK in my opinion.  Maybe I need to watch it again, but it'll have to be free.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|is there going to be a sequel please make one this was the best most awsome book I ever read
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is like WOW!!!!! I love this game it keeps you on your toes:-) So if you have downloaded this game it's a must!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so addicting and so fun! updates are great and always looking forward to getting to the next level! play this game!
0525423656|3.0|I loved Matched but cannot say the same for Crossed. I thought Crossed was too slow moving and redundant. I do not think the relationship between Cassia and the other characters especially Ky were developed as well as they were in Matched. Plus, the journey to get to the rising was not described in way that made me feel the hardship of the trek.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I am not really sure why this book has such great reviews. The typo's in it are so glaring that I am literally rolling my eyes and sighing with frustration. Its not just 2 or 3 errors, its chapter after chapter...and I am not an English major, but these mistakes are minor and just in need of a good proof-read. I read Thoughtless and Effortless by SC Stephens right before this and thought BD would be a good follow up...WRONG. The plot is pretty sloppy and the whole thing just seemed messy. I get that Travis was supposed to be the bad boy...but it is a bit unsetteling how often he will beat people up just for glancing at or joking with Abby. Then the whole singing the Rolling Stones song---kinda silly. I dont even think their connection was properly written, I couldnt get the connection and I really didnt get the \\"Im in love with you\\". I dont think there was enough effort in establishing their friendship/more than friendship before the I love you's came. Many others out there that are a much better read. Start with Thoughtless...this will seem ridiculous after that.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I enjoy playing this app. my niece and I play together.<br />This app is for the whole family...easy enough for youngsters, yet challenging enough for everyone else.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the game is fun. still having trouble visiting friends though. it keeps saying it has to update and then restart but when u do that it still don't work.
B005RUV714|5.0|We really wanted to watch this season and Amazon made our wish come true instantly!  Recommend to anyone who wants to view episodes quickly to download with Amazon!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101-in1 games is fun but some are actually kind of hard and impossible like cross wires I cant pass it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a good game you can get upgrades and buy new characters (no real money required) .My ipad is an ipad with no glitches and when you have an ipad like that you find games realy good (unless they are realy bad) and if you don't have an ipad like that then.... you bought a retarded ipad.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read for my teenage son..he finished it in about a week. He was a big fan of the series.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Great doc on one of the best minds of all time.  Music and message will be passed on for eternity.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It keeps your attention well because of the variety of mini-games and the necessity to unlock more as you progress through them. However, the touch controls are a bit inconvenient for some of the games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I purchased the book because of all the conversation around the movie. I had no idea what I was in store for. But after the first chapter, I was hooked. I felt genuinely connected to the characters, and the pages literally turned themselves as I was anxious to see what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Great book! I highly recommend it.
B007VTVGAQ|2.0|Wow - I was expecting some amazing things, given her previous work (which I really like) and the press hype. But these aren't really \\"songs,\\" since there's little or no melody. Just voice (that's all over the place), piano, and percussion. Not for me, sorry.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really loved this novel and the combination of magic, history, and romance that the author used! It was the perfect medley for my taste.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I liked this book. I was expecting a twilight type book with erotica (I could not read Twilight, felt like a 12 year old wrote it). I was pleasantly surprised. A bit too much repetition. I get it... he has long fingers! lol but all in all I liked it enough to read the second one in the future
B007P6VM04|5.0|I have enjoyed the TV program all season and was eager to hear the music at will.  The CD is great.  The delivery was fast and the product as promised.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is awesome.  Well developed characters, good pacing, and incredible action.  Every minute which passes is too long for the next book.
B0056JENTE|5.0|Well to be honest I have no idea why this is showing up in my reviews list because I never bought this.  I have, however, seen both movies and they are both really good.  Especially course code.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Gave this cd the first listen too on the ride home with the windows down. Liked a few tunes and thought 'Not Bad'. Gave it a second listen with the windows up last night so I could really hear the lyrics and the music. I liked it ... I liked it a lot. Makes me think Darkness On The Edge of Town (my personal all time favorite album). Some tracks really go back to that vintage Bruce that made me fall in love with his music and I agree with another reviewer ... there are similarities to his music styles from the past decades. Listening to it closely, I find it moving and personally, I love Jack of All Trades. I think the album really strikes a chord, has a good theme and sends a good strong message. No one does it like Bruce does. Nice little tribute to Clarence in the fold out too (we'll all miss you Big Man). Now if I can just get that dang 'Death to my Hometown' out of my head!!! Way to go Bruce, thanks for another great album!
B007R6X9IK|5.0|So far, this is best of Gahan... together with other Soulsavers. I never expected this album to be this good, quite honestly. But it is. Dave improved tremendously in his writing skills and the music and production is just perfect.<br />It's bitter, introspective, atmospheric, melancholic. Gets better and makes more sense with each listen. You can sense that Dave is bitter and even disappointed in things and values that he held on so tight for many years and after everything he has been through... That's not a teenage-angst thing in any way, but words of wisdom and experience. He is experienced, he has been through many things and survived! Those kind of people can always tell a tale and have so much to offer, even when the tales don't always have a happy end. And the tales of real life are just like that.<br /><br />Thumbs are up for Dave, his GREAT Soulsavers effort and the next DM album.<br /><br />Update 14/07/2012:<br /><br />This album is a gem. It has grown on me SO much that I literally cannot stop listening to it! It's SO powerful and emotional. Even though this is quite different music than Depeche Mode, because of Dave, I consider it up to their best.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Sound quality isn't great but the price is.  I use the headphones with the headband under my chin instead of as intended so that they are easy and quick to put on and to remove.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|After watching this during Movie Night at my church, I have to give a three warnings.  First there is some violence which I'm sure is the reason for the PG-13 rating.  Second, have tissues or a handkerchief close at hand. Third, it helps if you are a Christian or at the very least open-minded about Christianity.<br /><br />Four of the main characters are Law Enforcement Officers.  Some have faith and others don't.  A series of events leads them to make a resolution.  This resolution tests the courage of their convictions.  There is action, adventure, intrigue, faith, and even some laughs thrown in.<br /><br />One more thing, you may think there are some unnecessary moments but if you watch the whole movie, you see how all the pieces fit together like a giant puzzle.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|If you like suspense-driven movies, Frozen is for you. It is about surviving the unsurvivable, and what happens when people are thrown into a deadly situation beyond their control.  In essence, Frozen explores the psychology of people who are torn between the fear of being trapped and the need to continue to live.  It is this tension which drives the film.  I would not call this a horror film, and to be honest, I have no idea why it was marketed as one.

0141044586|3.0|First of all one must really appreciate the wealth of information provided by Ferguson as the pages are flooded with lots of historical tid-bits - most of them relevant - and a lot of rich context, though the information picked to provide 'context' is biased in many areas. Nevertheless, there is considerable effort to furnish the matters being discussed with a historical background.<br />Ferguson is evidently from an elite Oxford/Cambridge type of background, and he is not shy about show-casing his educational background which he, unfortunately,  also uses to impress on the  reader (i felt) a greater weight of credibility than his sometimes unfounded assertions deserve. Furthermore, while his presentation is clear the academic/formal language used is not effective in hiding sometimes very simple and rehashed ideas - however when presented in a convoluted academic style one can mistake simple ideas he presents as somewhat more credible.  This is the downfall of the elite schooling system in Britain - the over-emphasis on the use of language (form) over content resulting only in alienating the average reader and confusing others. In any case I had to strip away linguistic decorations sometimes to find that the ideas presented were surely creative enough but also very much debatable.<br /><br />As a fan of the British system-building and with much interest to hear what made the West, in my view, so great in many ways, I must say I was disappointed. I have known the British as self-critical, fair and above all, modest. That is not the sense I got from reading Ferguson's work. The pages seem filled with sometimes unjustified pride and quite a bit of skewed and biased assumptions that seem to favour Ferguson's strong attachments to his ethno/religious background. He certainly tries to pass all assertions off as 'scientific' or evidence-based. And, it is this area that is the weakest in this work: selective use of evidence and using this info to 'construct' the context heneeds for the assertions he makes. (I refrain from using the word 'fabrication' as I don't think Ferguon is aware that his understanding  of the context he has constrcuted is subjective).<br /><br />While Ferguson's work has many interesting points the most crucial associations and claims he makes are what are best characterized as 'observations' rather than analyses. For example, he asserts that Ottomans fell behind the Europeans partly, and perhaps mostly, because of their interpretation of the Koran and Islam (a supposed non-interference approach in Godly matters of which 'science' was understood as one). While this is a very good point to start from it emerges that this is basically a theory he presents for which there is no real evidence rather than the 'association' he makes between the Ottomans' religious standpoint and their decline. One wonderes why during the scientific ascendance of the Muslims, for 600 years or so before the period he discusses, the same religion (Islam) and its teachings didn't stop the Arabs/Persians of the time to contribute to the accumulated knowledge which the Europeans so wisely capitalized on and took to much higher grounds. Were the religious viewpoints and interpretations of Moores and the Ottomans so different? Well we don't know because the the the idea (while interesting) seems to be more at the gut feeling level with Ferguson and he does not really test his theory. while my gut feeling is actually also the same as Ferguson's I have not yet been able to claim what we does because I feel the evidence is lacking. Ferguson isn't bothered though because this type of logical error is dotted all over this work.<br /><br />Other matters are also somewhat puzzling. One does not know on what basis one measures a civilization sometimes. The fact that the Chinese had set sail before the Portuguese and upon arrival in Africa instead of loot and plunder (which he admits was the norm for the Europeans) the Chinese seemed to almost naivelyshow-case their civilization and inform the Africans that they were simply there, seems to be almost a laughing matter to Ferguson. Any ambitious, focused and driven European would leave no room for such 'soft' approach and would seize the opportunity to maximize their profit. And he goes on to mention that the Portuguese did just that. Brutality and disregard for human life is subsumed under the heading of 'competition' as the first Killer App.<br /><br />This matter is made further interesting in that in the comparison between the Spanish and the British, brutality, the same  matter which in the first chapter was value-free (i.e. OK as long as it provided a competitive edge) is presented as one of the reasons for the 'failure' of the Spanish in comparison with the British in the American (mis)adventures.  In other words, a matter which was not considered important in previous chapters is selected as a determining factor in later chapters. Furthermore, in comparisons made between  Spanish and British America (Latin America and North America respectively) we walk into murky grounds as the near total decimation of the native population by the North Americans is given a light mention (please refer to Chomsky for the extent of violence and genocidal force unleashed on the North American natives)  yet we are taken on a long journey of the gory details of Spanish atrocities in Latin America, and we are reminded that the softer approach by the British was, amongst the many other factors, key to the success of a united North America and a mess of a disunited Latin America.<br />In the end one does not know if brutality is effective in furthering 'civilization' or whether it hinders it.<br /><br />Many other sticky points abound in this work. But I did enjoy it. I enjoyed the wealth of information presented. I enjoyed the sometimes unique observations and analyses. Had Ferguson simply presented this work as his personal observations peppered with some facts of his choice,but mostly as a unique way of looking at past events, I would have thoroughly applauded his effort. It is his absolute and sometimes arrogant belief in the objectivity of his observations and his stress on evidence, which in reality is very selectively picked, that the reader might find somewhat irksome.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|The sound is different on this album, her voice is more synthesized and not as natural.  That said the album has very good flow, enjoyable songs and helps me relax on my drive home or while at work. I want to thank Norah Jones for making my day a little better and hopefully yours too.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I'm not one for fiction but I was intrigued by the premise.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I find it strange that some of the reviewers thought the story was too violent or disappointed with the ending. Really?  Do they have any idea what it must have been like in those times, on the plantations?  Yes, there is rape, incest, violence and heartache.  I would consider this plantation to be what I consider normal for the period.  And I'm sure that there were many that were far worse.  Do any true antebellum stories have a happy ending?  I bet that's more rare than a flying pig.  Get a grip complainers, there was no silver lining for so many.  Children died, mental hospitals were a nightmare, spousal violence was commonplace, mistreatment of slaves and the thousands of indentured servants tell of a different, more horrific story.  Read your history!<br /><br />I thought the characters were well developed, recognizing the number of people that played a part in the book.<br /><br />The narration of this book is amazing.  You won't be disappointed.

0756968801|3.0|Alex Rider isn't any ordinary school boy of 14 years old. No, he's in fact part of the Secret British Intelligence Agency, called M16. Our adventure is soon drifting towards Venice, where Alex was told by Yassen on his previous mission that he had to go seek out Scorpia in order to learn about his father and his destiny. He soon finds the terrorist group Scorpia, and is recruited with ease into their ranks after Julia Rothman, one of the head of Scorpia, show's him proof of his father's assassination performed by M16. As the novel progresses, so does the characters, but Alex discovers a flaw within himself. He is unable to perform cold blooded assassinations! Whatever the circumstances of the young boys abilities, Scorpia had never planned to keep him alive long enough for him to excel within their ranks. Within a few days time, their new project, Invisible Sword, will be launched and hundreds of thousands of London School kids shall die! Including Alex Rider!<br /><br />  Scorpia, the fifth book in the Alex Rider series, was thrilling and adventurous! For one, I haven't read any of the previous book in the series, and I could jump right into it, The book gave me some back story and the plot was really easy to pick up. The book, has a lot of action from the very beginning, which I find rare in many novels. The mystery in the book is really well written, and I didn't expect what was Scorpia was planning or what Invisible Sword was. The author did a really great job putting some emphasis on the characters, and if you look close enough you can see their wit or their emotions in general, which was really easy to relate with. This is what made me so into Alex's adventurs. Without any emphasis on the characters a story, with a great plot, will go nowhere! As good as the characters were the relationship between characters was lacking. Maybe it's the fact that I didn't read the first four books but throughout the book Alex is usually alone and I couldn't decide whether he loved or disliked his father. Maybe Alex himself couldn't decide either but none of the less it was a bit disappointing. The setting description was fairly well done, yet I sometimes found myself lost in the reading and couldn't really quite understand where the character was.<br /><br /> As you guys might know, I'm a huge fantasy fan, and this book changed my perspective on mystery/adventure books. If they'd be all as good as the Alex Rider series, I think I'd be addicted to that genre!oved or disliked his father.

0385737955|4.0|Thomas wakes up inside a large elevator also known as the box. It's pitch black and he can't remember a thing! The only memory he has is his name. He's soon brought out of the box and greeted by many young boys. They call themselves gladers and they tell Thomas that two years ago they went through a similar process as he did. None of the gladers remember anything before they arrived at the glade. Thomas soon learns that the glade is sourounded by brick walls and has four gates. The gates lead off into a maze which has been mapped and searched ever since the first gladers have arrived. Once night falls the gates close and mechanical creatures called grievers roam the maze searching for prey that couldn't get back in time. After Thomas' arrival a girl is sent to the glade. The very first girl since the beginning. Doubts begin to arouse once people start remembering Thomas from the past. Why did they send the girl? Is Thomas involved in any of this? Will they ever get out?<br /><br />  The maze runner has a great edge that makes it stand out. The plot is very original and easy to follow. I suspect that it will go on and develop even more, but this book would of been a great stand alone novel. Of course the intelligently thought out plot was guided by the suspense and action. Right from the beginning! I swear, there's no 100 pages waiting time before you really get into the story and the action. The story line really started off with a big burst of energy and a fast pace, which it ended with aswell!<br /><br />  Okay, I'm sorry that I mention this a lot guys, but the characters are super important! James Dashner did a really great job and really encorperated the characters style with their environment. The characters all seemed to reflect the situation they were in. The story also showed us a good side, where we could see the going-ons of the Glade. For example: who did what. Who were the leaders. How they stayed a live. These questions were answered and demonstrated a few times right at the start of then novel. This meant that the \\"roles\\" were filled up and you could imagine them as a small society.<br /><br />  I enjoyed the confusion that the characters brought. I could easily step into Thomas' shoes and try to find out the mystery behind the glade for him. Of course, I wasn't able too. I liked how they gave a few clues and hints as they went along but not enough so that you could discover it easily. Sadly it seemed as if they revealed the \\"secret\\" in like one chapter and I couldn't get the full suspense that the unanswered questions brought forth to the table.<br /><br />  James Dashner really knows how to bring in his audience. Even to compell them to buy his second book. Atleast he did a wonderfull job with me and I have bought and started to read The Scorch Trials, which is the second book in the series.

1591396190|4.0|A great deal of business literature has been developed to pinpoint ways to beat the competition. Porter dedicates a lot of thought to describing barriers to entry and differentiated product offerings. What is so great about Blue Ocean Strategy is that you no longer have to worry about competitors. Find a market that isn't yet saturated with players. Be creative and open your mind beyond the obvious markets that already exist and are probably in a phase of decline. Well worth a read.

0345803485|1.0|I bought this for a bookclub (and wonder about the choice). Hadn't read erotica like this since high school and that is where I would put the level of literary quality. Let's look at some basic aspects...<br /><br />Storyline: Some of story and Grey's past vaguely alludes to Steve Jobs - who met his wife when he gave a lecture at Stanford where Laurene Powell (the future Mrs. Jobs) was a grad student.  In the book, Ana asks about Grey's being adopted (as was Steve Jobs) during her interview.  However, that's where ANY similarity ends...Grey doesn't seem to bother with work - sending emails to Ana while at work meetings and flying cross country to see her after not seeing her for 24 hours...Can't imagine Jobs blowing off work like that...If this is how distracted Grey gets, it's a wonder the guy created any enterprise, much less a billion-dollar empire by the time he is 26 y.o.  As for Ana, can one really believe that a recent college graduate in English would NOT have her own laptop and be essentially clueless about a computer except to write emails to her lover?...<br /><br />Character Development: For a character who is so \\"innocent\\"(she is about to graduate without ever having had a boyfriend or getting drunk), Ana's thoughts seem to have quite a lot of foul language...<br /><br />Description: How many times does Ana say her lover is \\"hot\\"? With so much emphasis on his looks, why didn't the author bother to give a better description than copper-colored hair, grey eyes and tall...oh and \\"freaking hot\\".(Really?!)...<br /><br />Details: With the number of times the author mentioned Grey run his hand through his hair or picked up Ana's chin between his fingers or she bit her bottom lip, one would imagine a lot of raw areas (besides the sex scenes). Explicit sex scenes give good ideas for readers, which may be why it became a best seller. However, if you want something that is well-written or with substance -- go somewhere else.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is one of those bands I'd heard on the radio a couple times but never really thought to look up and give a solid chance for a long time.  But I started hearing more and more of their songs and then listened to the whole album on spotify. Considering I usually just use spotify it is rare that I will buy an album, but I cant help but support this band as they completely stole my heart and soul after listening to the album a couple times.  It just blows my mind that they can create such amazing songs with a string instruments (my typical music style ranges from Metal, to rock, some rap, and dubstep and pretty much anything in between).  I was surprised this album became an instant favorite for me after one listen, since its not my typical style.<br /><br />This band has amazing talent and great potential.  If they tour in the U.S. I will be certain to buy tickets and I will purchase any album they release if it is half as good as \\"Sigh No More.\\"<br /><br />The only con I have to say about this album is that I'm afraid I'm going to listen to it soooo much that I'll get bored of it by the time the next album comes out later this year :D.<br /><br />Overall, this album offers a new sound and new musical direction, at least for me.  I will be a die hard fan of Mumford and Sons for a long time to come if their music stays as amazing as this debut album.  The melodies are catchy and the lyrics are very good and meaningful. If at first you don't like this album give it another chance or two. It took me longer than I am proud of to sit down and give them a sure chance but I am very happy I did!

B000TEUSJU|3.0|Certain films exist that it's vital the viewer know something about before attempting to watch. These films push the limits of cinema in unexpected ways. They are best described as Extreme Films. Ilsa She Wolf of the SS, Bloodsucking Freaks, Martyrs, Kichiku Dai Enkai, I Spit On Your Grave and numerous others belong in this category. Caligula is a hard film to really watch. It's somewhat of a confused mes with graphic violence, hardcore porn sex scenes and an overall feeling that the filmmakers had lost control. If you're a fan of the more boundary breaking types of cinema you will enjoy this film. If not stay away.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The world of Wool is an amazing invention. Everyone lives in a silo, most of which is underground. If you cannot take it any more you get your wish and they let you go outside!<br /><br />I was surprised just how much details there was in the world of the Silo. The Silo is a fully realised world that reeks of a humanity striving hard to survive. The characters are well drawn and feel like complete human beings. The series builds book after book and it is hard to put down especially as you advance through the series.<br /><br />I have started reading the Molly Fyde series by the same author. It is a different kind of SF, far more conventional, but still very well written with good strong characters.<br /><br />The omnibus edition is tremendous value. I feel as if I stole the book at the price I was allowed to buy it.

B000FBFN1U|4.0|If A Clash of Kings was considered a sequel, then A Storm of Swords can be considered its own magnum opus. Martin's writing is just as stellar as ever and the plot moves along at a steady pace. I do not see Robert Jordan's failings creeping into Martin's writing. Holding to the theme of a quasi-history novel, Martin begins to stir things up a little bit more with some magic-related things. You may dislike certain characters, but by the end of this book, you will better understand them and their desires.

0060512806|5.0|I am late to the party. I recently discovered Neal Stephenson's name on a NPR list of best 100 Sci-Fi. I read \\"Snow Crash\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it, although now it is somewhat dated. Then I read \\"Quicksilver\\". Neal Stephenson's writing style is one that I have come to love. Through \\"Anathem\\" to \\"Zodiac\\", just incredibly good stuff. If he is not a true genius, he sure fakes it well. I came here to buy everything else he has written and ended up writing this review. Thus far, I have enjoyed Neal Stephenson as much as I enjoyed Dan Simmons (read everything). Cryptonomicon displays Mr. Stephenson's true genius. He succeeds in weaving complex math, humor, good plot lines and wonderful character development together into one of the best books I have ever read.

B004ROPSHA|5.0|I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn the summer I turned 16. I knew it was a classic and I just wanted to read it quick and cross it off on the book list I was building. I didn't know that when I began reading it that I would finish it in less than a week, and then go back and re-read passages.  The book tells the story of Francie Nolan, a girl growing up in early 1900's Brooklyn. Francie's story weaves through themes of poverty, pride, family, and the wonders, heartbreak, and humor of childhood and teen years. There's great dialogue and colorful characters to love and hate. It's amazing to be able to relate to a character, when the time gap between is about 100 years.  This book is awesome, wondrous, beautiful... I just finished re-reading it again after years of not touching it, and I was reminded why it is one of my favorite books, it still resonates with me today. This should be required reading for kids in school, and their parents :)  Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed!

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Oh, Fiona. You wonderful, magical creature. You strange, raw, intuitive iconoclast. I remember the first time I heard \\"Shadowboxer\\" on the radio, and was sure I was hearing a middle-aged chanteuse from another era. Then I saw you on SNL performing it, and was shocked to see that voice coming from a fragile, teenage waif. Fifteen years later, not much has changed. You still project both fire and fragility. You've still got your husky, world-weary alto. Your literate, confessional lyrics and emotional delivery. But you've also grown so much.<br /><br />When last we heard from you, almost seven years ago, some pop producer had added a glossy sheen to the intoxicating demos that you and Jon Brion had made. And yet he couldn't bury your passion and pathos. This time, the silly record execs have clearly decided to let well enough alone. \\"The Idler Wheel\\" is your most raw-sounding record to date. The songs mostly come down to your voice, the piano, and percussion. But, oh, the magic you create with these few instruments. The complex and inventive arrangements, the voice that can flutter like a butterfly or wail like a banshee, the unpredictable beats and textures.<br /><br />When first the world tried to make you a pop star, you fought against it, kicking and screaming and protesting at the phoniness of it all. Then you grew up, and all the battles turned inward. Now you disappear for years at a time, so long that your fans might have even fooled themselves into thinking they've moved on. And then you reappear, with another set of songs so compelling that we remember why you're irreplaceable. \\"The Idler Wheel\\" is a portrait of a woman mature enough to know that all confrontation is really self-confrontation. In \\"Werewolf\\" you start to chastise a former lover, but quickly take responsibility instead: \\"I could liken you to a werewolf the way you left me for dead/ But I admit that I provided a full moon.\\" On \\"Left Alone,\\" you begin to complain of loneliness, but then lament \\"How can I ask anyone to love me/ when all I do is beg to be left alone?\\"<br /><br />The album closes with two songs that find you exploring territory you haven't since your first album ... the erotic kind. \\"If I'm butter then he's a hot knife\\" you purr suggestively on the final track. So glad to know that, in the midst of all your passionate self-confrontation, you're also making time to have some fun.How can I ask anyone to love me/ when all I do is beg to be left alone?\\"<br /><br />The album closes with two songs that find you exploring territory you haven't since your first album ... the erotic kind. \\"If I'm butter then he's a hot knife\\" you purr suggestively on the final track.

B002EDH0FE|1.0|Before I saw this movie, I had never heard of the Watchmen.  It seemed like something I would enjoy - heroes with a dark twist.  Except there really weren't any heroes - just a bunch of morally bankrupt badly costumed losers.  I have no idea what the hell the plot of this movie was  Perhaps my brain blacked it out to protect my conscious self from realizing that movie was actually worse than I remembered it.  Do not watch, do not buy.
B004M8AL6E|5.0|After the links not working for several weeks Amazon developers fixed it and refunded my purchase while still allowing me to watch them. I appreciated that. I watched all 4 and it was an interesting mini series.
B007BLDFWG|3.0|I definitely expected more after hearing the reviews when it 1st came out but it was disappointing & the ending was horribly unsatisfying. Great acting by Elizabeth but not a great movie.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I was so disappointed when I read the first book. I skipped much of the same throughout the book I am very broad minded but found this quite over the top
B003JLA4KS|4.0|I've been a Rush fan since I was 12, I'm 42 now.  Watched this on Blu-ray last night and was very pleased.  I thought some of Gene Simmon's comments were a scream.  The old footage, the interviews with the band, producers, musicians, managers and the fans is all very well done.  It made me proud to be a Rush \\"nerd\\".  My only wish is that there had been some discussion of Hugh Syme and the band's amazing album covers.  Highly recommended viewing.

B00881VLCE|2.0|This program has some really good puzzles but the program itself is rather cludgy.  There are frequent problems getting the puzzle pieces to link and moving the puzzle and pieces is also problematic.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Now that I read the first part I can understand why so many people liked it and wanted more.<br />Surely a masterpiece destined to become a classic.<br />I suggest to buy this Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5) because after reading this first part you will want to read the rest!
B003H9MSPG|5.0|My co-worker bought a full automatic nerf gun and would occasionally ambush us when we walked over to him with problems. I decided to get all 2nd amendmenty and get one to protect myself. It provides more range and accuracy (especially after removing the air restrictors and boosting up the string of the spring. It's louder now but I'm getting some felt to put inside to fix that.<br /><br />Bought a couple hundred darts and extra magazines so I'm ready to go if any impromptu nerf action pops up at home or in the office.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|By far the best of the 3 books - I did not have to skip repeats quite so much and enjoyed the story line
B0061Q13V2|5.0|This book is an absolute must-read.  Let me be very clear, do not believe some newspaper articles that claim there is no corroboration, there is tons.  Dominique tells the unvarnished truth about life with the Karolyis, life in an abusive household, and her own personal struggles and failings.  She is unflinchingly honest.  And she is not a bitter person.  This book also tells of redemption in all things.  And best of all, it tells about the sister she never knew she had.  Dominique is a happy, well adjusted woman.<br /><br />And gymnastics needs major changes, USAG needs major leadership changes, and the Karolyis need to be out of any gymnastics influence in this country.  Help Dominique to bring these things to pass.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|\\"Not Your Kind of People\\" by Garbage is not as experimental as \\"Version 2.0\\" or pop perfection like my personal favorite \\"beautifulgarbage\\". Is this the band's best album? No. Isn't horrible? Absolutely not! A lot has changed in the last 7 years since the band's 2005 album, \\"Bleed Like Me\\". My favorite foursome broke-up and Shirley Manson got remarried and even went into acting. And then a couple of years ago, it was announced that Garbage was making a new album and so ever since then, I waited patiently and hoped that they still had that soul and passion to create a pop/rock masterpiece. When I first listened to \\"Not Your Kind of People\\" I was slighty disappointed. There was something about this new release that felt sluggish and too serious. Some of the melodies were rough-around-the-edges and Shirley's vocal seemed drowned out over the loud guitar licks. It was not until the fourth listen, that I began to appreciate the odd beauty of \\"Not Your Kind of People\\". I've always admired Shirley's strength as a woman, her songwriting is so honest and infectious, she's very smart and she's not afraid to show her vulnerable side on these 15 tracks. This album has some so-so tracks like \\"Felt\\", \\"Bright Tonight\\", \\"Show Me\\", and the title-track which feels like a morbid children's song to me? But trust me, there are some magical songs here as well including: \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\", \\"Sugar\\", \\"I Hate Love\\", and \\"Control\\" which sounds like a freight train coming right at you! There are also some very cool, hard-rockin' tracks that have incredible hooks like, \\"The One\\", \\"Battle in Me\\" and \\"Man on a Wire\\". I think the two best tracks are \\"Big Bright World\\" (pure genius), and \\"Beloved Freak\\" (so heartbreaking). I sincerely hope that Garbage make another album in the future! They are beyond talented and there music has made me happy and gotten me through some trying times ever since I was a teenager. Even though I don't think it's their strongest work, I can truly say that this album is anything but \\"garbage\\"! Enjoy.s album is anything but \\"garbage\\"! Enjoy.
B007XF0X6G|3.0|Watchable if humdrum sequel to the 2010 remake of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" brings back Sam Worthington as Perseus, once again living in his small fishing village with his young son when Zeus (Liam Neeson) comes calling. Unsurprisingly, Zeus demands Perseus' help once again when Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Aries strike a deal with the nefarious Kronos to unleash the rest of the Titans and rule human kind. Setting out with a party that includes Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike, replacing Alexa Davalos), Perseus treks across ancient Greece in order to defeat another army of giants, monsters and similar CGI creatures.<br /><br />Director Jonathan Liebesman (\\"Battle: Los Angeles\\") replaced Louis Leterrier for \\"Wrath of the Titans,\\" a formulaic sequel that oddly jettisons the intention of its predecessor's reshot ending (which brought Gemma Arterton's heroine Io back from the grave, only to have her character be deceased from this sequel's opening frame!). The film also lacks Laterrier's set-pieces - not to mention its 2.35 widescreen dimensions - but still functions adequately enough as an effects-filled fantasy for genre fans and younger viewers. Worthington seems more relaxed here and the 3-D - though once again converted in post-production - is much more effective than \\"Clash,\\" boasting little ghosting and an overall natural appearance.<br /><br />Warner's combo pack includes a satisfying 3-D Blu-Ray presentation of the film plus a copy of the standard Blu-Ray, DVD and Ultraviolet copy. Extra features are highlighted again by a \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" with behind the scenes featurettes plus storyboards and over 10 minutes of deleted scenes also offered on the regular BD disc. A lenticular 3-D cover also graces the 3-D combo pack.

B00782O7IY|4.0|This year's reigning Best Picture Oscar winner, \\"The Artist\\" is an emotional, lovingly crafted paean to Hollywood's silent and early talkie era, beautifully performed and entertaining despite a somewhat hollow story line.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin is marvelous in his Oscar winning turn as George Valentin, a Hollywood silent movie star about to see his box-office fortunes fade as the industry veers into the era of talking pictures. George's fall is contrasted with the improbable rise to stardom of Peppy Miller (the lovely Berenice Bejo), who accidentally bumps into George and lands on the front pages of the trades - launching a career that sees her quickly spring into the limelight. But while Peppy's movies generate tickets, George's life free falls, with the former star losing nearly everything except the companionship of his faithful Jack Russell terrier.<br /><br />Michel Hazanavicius' film pays tribute to the heyday of Hollywood in the `20s and `30s, all of it framed in 1.33 B&W and lusciously scored by Ludovic Bource (sans a controversial quote from Bernard Herrmann's \\"Vertigo\\" that still remains in this Blu-Ray edition, despite reports it was going to be replaced for the home video version). Dujardin's mannerisms and physical performance are just remarkable, helping to carry a film that relies heavily on the expressions of its cast to relay its rags-to-riches/riches-to-rags story (there are few title cards present in the film). The luminous Bejo is terrific too, while supporting turns from veteran character actors (John Goodman, James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller and Malcolm McDowell among them) lend some American domestic appeal to the the French-made picture.<br /><br />If there's a quibble I have with \\"The Artist,\\" it's that the film takes a bit too much time getting to where we all know it's heading - and tends to languish in George's despair and darkness during the final third (something not uncommon with French films) before doing an about-face in a bouncy finale.<br /><br />Sony's Blu-Ray of \\"The Artist\\" is framed in 1.33 and boasts a nicely detailed, though at times inconsistent looking, AVC encoded 1080p transfer; some sections of the film appear completely smooth and digital in nature, while others appear to have some intentionally-added grain. The DTS MA audio is fine, and extras include a blooper reel, Q&A with the cast, an Ultraviolet copy, and a number of other behind-the-scenes featurettes, in which the American actors seem a bit surprised by how well the film turned out (co-star Missi Pyle even refers to Dujardin and Bejo as \\"the French leads,\\" not by name!).
B007SGM084|5.0|I throughly enjoyed these books they where in my opinon well written and very entertaning. I hope the aurthor is set to write some more,
B0085776BG|1.0|The movie its self was absolutely insufferable, the only redeeming part was that it was so bad that it was funny.  The actors felt uncomfortable and out of place, the attempt at a story was trite and predictable, and nearly every scene was shot in front of a green screen.  It was poorly put together, and the ending left the viewer bored and unmoved. It had a solid set-up to be a good movie, but it ended up being a huge let down and two wasted hours of my life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was obsessed with these books literally could not put them down. I got the kindle app on my phone do I could read everywhere I had to go. Reading them for the second time!!!!

B006YZOXHQ|4.0|Dino DeLaurentiis produced a pair of psychedelic comic adaptations in 1968: Mario Bava's \\"Danger: Diabolik\\" and the high-flying BARBARELLA, which arrives on Blu-Ray in a marvelous high-definition transfer courtesy of Paramount.<br /><br />Writer Terry Southern and director Roger Vadim were placed in charge of bringing Jean Claude Forest's French sci-fi strip to the big-screen, and did so by tailoring the project around star Jane Fonda, then Vadim's wife and who fits quite snugly into a bevy of tight-fighting costumes as the title character. Here, Fonda's Barbarella is an Earth astronaut sent to the far reaches of the galaxy in order to track down missing scientist Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea), whose Positronic Ray threatens the welfare of the universe by virtue of its sheer power. En route, Barbarella encounters a blind angel who has lost the ability to fly (John Phillip Law); engages in futuristic intercourse with David Hemmings' Dildano; butts heads with the \\"Great Tyrant of Sogo\\" (Anita Pallenberg); and becomes the subject of the \\"Excessive Machine,\\" an organ that generates feelings of arousal instead of music.<br /><br />\\"Barbarella\\" is very much of the era, no question, with its individual highlights being more satisfying than the sum of those parts. Barbarella's memorable opening striptease sets the tone for an intentionally silly, campy romp that features one of Fonda's more disarming performances and appropriately \\"out there\\" visuals and sets, credited to Mario Garbuglia but reportedly supervised by comic-strip creator Forest himself. Shot on Italian soundstages, the film has a unique artistic design, punctuated by stylish production design and outlandish costumes, and Claude Renoir's attractive widescreen lensing gives you plenty to look at throughout. The music is also a huge plus: Charles Fox and Bob Crewe's infectious `60s pop scoring functions in much the same way that Burt Bacharach's classic \\"Casino Royale\\" did a year prior, with laid-back, groovy melodies and colorful orchestral underscore working in concert with each other. The end title track, \\"An Angel is Love,\\" is one of my personal favorites, a vocal performed by Crewe and \\"The Glitterhouse\\" that splendidly caps the entire picture - not a classic, but still an entertaining romp for sci-fi/fantasy and comic-book aficionados, similar to how DeLaurentiis' big-budget \\"Flash Gordon\\" entertained audiences over a decade later.<br /><br />Paramount's Blu-Ray of \\"Barbarella\\" looks just about perfect. Fine details, colors and contrasts abound in an AVC encoded 1080p presentation untouched by any obvious use of DNR. \\"Barbarella\\"'s visuals are a huge component to its appeal and Paramount has done the picture justice with a wonderful transfer here. On the audio side, the DTS MA mono sound is decent - though a 5.1 remix would've been welcome - while the original, three-minute trailer (in HD) is also included, along with an attractively designed slipcover with fold-out artwork from its original promotional campaign.
B007SGM084|2.0|I have to admit I read the series just to know what all the hoopla was about, and I have to say, I still don't get it?<br /><br />I didn't connect with the characters; most of them annoyed me in one way or another. There were too many filler (added just to make it longer). Really? This whole series could have been one book.<br /><br />It's completely unrealistic. Some people have called it romantic? Really folks, what's romantic about a possessive man? Unless your five years old, no one should be telling you when to eat, or sleep, or pee for that matter!! Really??? I thought women these days were empowered, independent, and smart.<br /><br />I would have like the book better is Anastasia was the sex freak!!
B0078Q2HAA|3.0|If you want to understand Thatcher, if you want to see what motivated her, this is is a waste of time.  If you are interested in an absorbing story about a woman coming to terms with loss, this is a very good psychological drama.  As a movie I quite enjoyed it.  As a story about someone who had power and traded family for it, it is a compelling and interesting drama.  Making it about Margaret Thatcher was just a move to put a name to an interesting story.<br /><br />As for the story of Margaret thatcher, there is so much that is missing and so  much that was skipped over, ignored, trivialized or just plain missed.  Part of the problem here, of course, is there is not enough time in two hours to cram a worthwhile biography of Thatcher, so any movie will disappoint.  So it seems the writers and director didn't even bother.  There is nothing on why this total outsider took control of the party machinery and ran it like a well drilled regiment for 11 years.  Nor is anything on why they suddenly mutinied on her.  Nor is the much on why the battle with the Coal miners was so important, how she achieved the victory and the hard work involved in preparing for it.  The level of emotional involvement she created is totally missing from the movie.  Read any comment about her on you tube or here on Amazon and you will see even 20 years on that people care a great deal about her and what she did.  How she managed to create that level of involvement both pro and anti is totally missing.<br /><br />As an interesting drama, this movie is very good.  Ms Streep richly deserved her award for her portrayal of a formerly strong woman coming to grips with the loss of a husband and the fading of her mind.  As history, this is total bunk.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool was a fun read.  A living social commentary, with human relationship drama mixed in.  Some nice twisty plot turns make for some innovative surprises.  Especially early on in the series. Reminded me a bit of the movie \\"The Island\\".

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I went into this a little hesitant thinking it was just a movie for kids but I was really pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was. The film looks incredible in HD, you can see every little detail. A great piece of work by Spielberg!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because I heard it was a popular romantic novel. I did not realize this book was an erotic story. I didn't even know what erotic entailed. Having read 120 pages of this book, I'm positive that I don't like erotica. (I find it creepy and disgusting.) The main characters were lax in morals and self-respect. Private physical relationships are honorable if there is love, respect, and trust. Christian, the male lead, cheapens physical intimacy by separating love and sex (and making sex cynical). I could not finished this story.
B00846REIS|2.0|Ok I am a huge fan of 50 Shades and Beautiful Disaster, so several fo the readers read this one, so I thought I would give it a try. The story could have been so much more, I felt like the story didn't flow as well. In addition, I understand they are crazy about each other, but really after one week they are falling in love with each other. I mean I get the craziness and possessiveness, but I don't think the author did a good job of really laying the foundation of \\"why\\" to make it more believable. They also address Mr. Cross had issues, but they never went into them (again, like I said, it just felt like they skips parts/scence/explainations). The sex/love scene were predictable, I mean sometimes they were in different locations, but it just did not seem creative.  I also found myself, like 3 times, considering picking up another book, which is not a good signs. On another note, the price I paid for this did not seems comparable with it's worth, comparing it with other books I have read recently.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was racy and should be classified as porn. The best part was the email messages that were clever and witty. The characters were predictable and stock. Lonely, ugly, awkward female catches the attention of handsome, rich, successful male who finds her irrestible.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|I love all of Justin Bieber's Music but this is 10x better than his previous albums. I thought it would be hard for him to top Under The Mistletoe, but he did. He has a mature voice and will have a music career for the rest of his life if he wants it. His transition from teen pop to adult contemporary/R&B/mainstream pop/rock guarantees it.
1401234542|5.0|A little bit on my background as a Green Lantern fan, before I begin. Before the New 52, I'd never read a Green Lantern comic. Not completely, anyway. I read a little bit of Blackest Night while browsing in a library one afternoon, and I've perused an issue here and there while shopping in bookstores, but before DC relaunched its universe, I'd never actually read one in its entirety. Having watched nearly every animated and live-action TV show and movie that's featured Green Lantern since the year 2000, television and film are the extent of my Green Lantern knowledge.<br /><br />With that in mind, know that if your experience with Green Lantern is similar to mine, then the first volume of the New 52's Green Lantern should be very accessible to you. You should know that Sinestro is the leader of the Sinestro Corps and one of Hal Jordan's greatest enemies. You should have a bit of background on Hal's romantic past with Carol Ferris. You should be aware that Hal was recently discharged from the Green Lantern Corps. BUT THAT'S IT. If you want to know the whys and hows of any of these past events, read some pre-New 52 GL, or save some time and money and look it up on Wikipedia. But you don't really need any of it to enjoy this book. It's a story that, as long as you have a little bit of familiarity with the characters, stands on its own. Geoff Johns spins a great little tale, and sets up what's sure to be an intriguing mystery in the coming volumes of Green Lantern. Mahnke's pencils are great, and the art team's use of shadows and colors is excellent.<br /><br />For newbies who have no idea who these characters are, this may not be the best title. But if you've got at least a little familiarity with world of GL, this one gets the green light.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Not many know & fewer care, but in N.E. Pa, there is a small village called Camptown, a few miles out of Bradford County seat, Towanda.  Everyone September, I travel Rte. 6 to Camptown in order to attend a little-fair where chicken is barbecued, runners compete, & local musicians do their stuff.  On the way into Camptown, I always play a very cool c.d. called \\"American Dreamer: Songs of Stephen Foster,\\" by Thomas Hampson, and before entering the Church picnic-grounds, I read again & again the Pa historical blue & gold plaque commemorating Stephen Foster's likely visit and composition of \\"Camptown Races.\\"  It's mystical music, a mystical place, and starting THIS year, I shall load Neil Young & Crazy Horse's musically outstanding & lyrically profound \\"Americana\\" into my car's c.d. player.  Poor boy \\"Old Tom Dula\\" will sound so pleasantly alive at the old Camptown Races site, and kicking his feet while hanging-on to Neil's representation, a brand-new \\"Americana\\" soul.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I didn't know much about this book or author before it was recommended to me.  I must say I really enjoyed the book.  It was an easy read and unlike a lot of mystery/drama novels I read, it wasn't predictable.  There aren't many novels I think about after I finish them, but this one did.  I would say this is a must read whether you are into this genre or not.

B004J4WN0I|4.0|So, when I was first exposed to this series, it sent up a pantheon of red flags.  It was urban fantasy, a genre laden with dreck outside of the works of Gaiman and Powers.  It involved druids and Celtic pantheons.  Two more clues that this would be horrible Shakespearean slashfic written at a 9th grade level of prose.  There were werewolves, talking wolfhounds, and pop culture refences de jure.  Surely all these warning bells must create a carillon that would warn away all but the most escapist basement dwelling fantasy grognard troglodytes, right?  I thought so as well, but was pleasantly disappointed.  What I got out of Hounded was a surprisingly well written political thriller whose main players just happened to be magical creatures from other planes of existence.  This sort of writing is fairly prevalent among the massive heaps of dross that inhabits the urban fantasy genre, but Hearne hits a very difficult bullseye with this book.  It is irreverent and laden with pop culture references, but remains serious enough to tell a competent thriller story.  It is urban fantasy involving multiple fae liasons that are tastefully done off screen, and yet retains a sense of fantastical wonder despite or perhaps in spite of the main character's situation and stature.  In short, this book hews to a lot of urban fantasy, celtic fantasy, and thriller tropes without falling into being a hackneyed example of any of the above genres' stereotypes.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a huge Rush fan from the beginning - at the age of 45 I've had years to listen to all of Rush's songs over and over.  I was a little afraid of this, their 20th album, since most bands often do one last \\"meh\\" album before they fade off into obscurity.  I've had issues with Rush's albums ever since Power Windows - they mostly didn't have that \\"oomph\\" of albums past.  They were more of a collection of a few OK songs, one or two good ones, and a whole lot of \\"meh\\" songs.<br /><br />I must say that this album will BLOW you away.  Almost every song is a winner.  Some are quite lyrical and beautiful, and some will knock your socks off.  The mixing of this album is the best I've ever experienced.<br /><br />Others have done song-by-song decriptions and have done a great job of capturing the feel.  I will say that one song for me stands out more than any other:  Headlong Flight.  This song has probably already joined the list of \\"base-line\\" songs to use to test out stereo systems.  I mean . . . WOW!  I didn't know you could get that deep of a tone in percussion and bass in a song - I thought when I first heard it that my stereo settings were messed up and I had the bass set for 11 - but no, it was at 0 - the song will really let you know if you have a good subwoofer/speakers, and you'd better make sure loose objects in your entertainment room are secured or that you don't have weak glass in your windows - be warned!<br /><br />Kudos to Geddy, Alex, and Neal - you hit a homerun with this album.

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|A lingering, sentimental look at the mentality and habits of Jiro Ono, legendary sushi chef and Japanese national treasure. The long, personal chats with Jiro and sons, plus an exhaustive investigation into every aspect of his business, are balanced by an overly generous dose of shallow focal-range, slow-motion food porn. Like many stereotypical wise men of his age and nationality, the old master also has plenty of sharp, stirring wisdom to impart. Though he doesn't come right out and say it, it's easy to see the parallels he hopes you'll draw between his dedication to the kitchen and the nuances of a rewarding life, and my breath caught in my throat on more than one occasion. A great vehicle for deep immersion into a very traditional Japanese culture, this is far deeper and more rewarding than it initially lets on.

It's obviously intended as a blunt parody, but lord is it ham-fisted and dim-witted. Loaded with bland, easy puns and flat punchlines, it's satire in the same vein as Meet the Spartans. The film is set in the year 2018, so naturally the president is played by a porn-grade Sarah Palin impersonator. After reaching office on the back of a \\"Yes She Can\\" campaign, her big re-election effort involves sending a new mission to the moon, with a black captain, which is publicized as \\"Black to the Moon!\\" These are the big-laugh moments. Amidst such broad strokes, a few good bits do manage to slip in (there's something about a space zeppelin that's oddly hilarious), but they're like tiny dots of light lost amidst the hustle of a smeared canvas. I may have cracked a smile once or twice, but I groaned more times than I could count, and when it was all over I felt like apologizing to myself. There's a place for this brand of comedy in the world, I guess, but it's not with me.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|It's nice to have Hammer Studios back making horror films. This was the stuff I grew up on watching creature-features on Saturday afternoons with actors like Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt in their stable of stars, and a low-budget sensibility with a particular affinity for day-for-night shooting, busty ladies in tight corsets and pea-soup-thick atmosphere.<br /><br />However, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is not quite a horror film as it is a supernatural mystery. And it sadly doesn't have the tightly-corseted ladies, but as far as atmosphere, the cup runneth over. Endless mist, sunless days, torrential rain, candlelit hallways and always something lurking in the back of the frame.<br /><br />The plot of the film is very standard for a turn-of-the-20th-century haunted village story. A young widower (Radcliffe in a very mature performance) is sent on behalf of his law firm to clear up the estate of a wealthy recluse in a remote British town. The villagers in the town want him gone for unknown reasons, but he goes to the old mansion called Eel Marsh (sounds like a nice place, doesn't it?) and uncovers an unearthly presence and a mystery that has been taking the lives of children there for years. With his own child coming to visit him, he endeavors, with the help of a kindly man (the always great Ciaran Hinds) and his troubled wife (Janet McTeer, great in a small role), to give the ghost what he believes it needs to end its reign of terror.<br /><br />I'm always a little leery of ghost films because the cause of the haunting is usually far too mundane and that always leaves me wishing that it's not such a mystery as to why it's happening, and rather just have it HAPPEN. It lends a greater mystery and discomfort to the viewer and leaves us to ask questions after the film ends. That was my biggest problem with Robert Zemeckis' WHAT LIES BENEATH. That's also a bit of a problem here, but because of a nicely twisted ending, we find that their solution to the mystery isn't enough.<br /><br />Radcliffe really leaves Harry Potter behind in this film, and it's wonderful to see him really embrace this role. He's someone who is very wounded deep within his soul, and it makes sense that he would be more willing to explore the world of the unknown searching for answers. Hinds is once again great at a supporting role as the only man in the village who seems to be unafraid of what Radcliffe's character is doing, but there's a deeper weariness to Hinds as is revealed later. McTeer is wonderfully manic but not over-the-top loony as the still-grieving mother to a child long dead.<br /><br />This film embraces mood and atmosphere in favor of blood and shock, keeping with the tradition of Hammer Studios well. There are three or four really cheap but effective jump scares in the first act, and this is honestly the first film in years that I actually did feel my heart skip at some of those moments. Once that calms down, the cheap scares make way for a sense of genuine dread, which is something director James Watkins handles pretty deftly. Most of the film is very quiet, which makes the frightening noises that come out of that quiet much more effective. He also is adept at framing his shots. Many of the moments of the film look as though they could be gothic-era paintings.<br /><br />Sadly, the film becomes pretty sluggish in the third act as they feel they've found the solution to the desires of the spectre and do what they can to sate those desires. If the film had more of an adult appeal, I feel that this would have been more of a character study rather than a film of actions and consequences, but since it's Daniel Radcliffe, they had to make it more teen-friendly. I don't feel that those roles are far off at all for Radcliffe, having done a play like the extremely dark EQUUS, and they suit his seemingly perennial five-o'clock shadow and his intense and piercing eyes.<br /><br />Radcliffe is a young man who, even if he hadn't been in one of the most successful franchises of all time, would still have eventually become a star, and THE WOMAN IN BLACK is decidedly good evidence of that.e most successful franchises of all time, would still have eventually become a star, and THE WOMAN IN BLACK is decidedly good evidence of that.
0618918248|4.0|Dawkins talks about the God Delusion. There is no question about the delusion. The real question to ponder on is whether it is a good delusion. In the modern race of monkeys scrambling up corporate ladders, so many scrounging around for a livelihood or just fighting for survival, does it add any value? As some famous guy (was it Nietzsche?) said, if God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent Him. Really? What's the value?

0307719219|1.0|\\"Is this really the jacket for this book?\\" I cannot help but reading the praises of book again and asking this same question when I was 1/4, 1/2 and then 3/4 done with it.<br /><br />This book is not half baked - it is not baked at all.  It is rather thick, with tons of stories, comparisons, all trying to support - well, support what?  Supporting a theory basically saying \\"what sounds good to us is good\\", while what the first \\"good\\" really means was very vaguely mentioned or described, but NOT well-defined.<br /><br />It is a book suffers tremendously from over-simplification and over-generalization of complicated issues.  The authors must have realized this, and tried a few times to even distance themselves from their baby, basically stating that their theory would not work that well since there are other variables.<br /><br />Was Steven Levitt, whom I do enjoy reading, being tongue-in-cheek when declaring this book \\"brilliant in its simplicity...\\"???
1401233791|5.0|With the hype of the Dark Knight Rises coming up, I figure that as a hardcore Batman fan and enthusiast, I should probably invest some time into reading into Bane's original comic book introduction. And after I did, I now get why Christopher Nolan chose him to be the villain of his final installment in his Batman series. Sure, he's not the infamous Joker, and yes, following Heath Ledger's performance is going to be tough, but reading this comic alone has put some faith into me for the next movie. Because Bane is the next logical choice for a solid, challenging villain.<br /><br />Now, again, I'm a hardcore Batman fan. But I'll blame it on my young age for having never read the original comics beyond whatever got compiled together into one neat package. Before this I think I've only read Scarecrow Tales, The Long Halloween, and the Killing Joke (all of which I highly recommend): I know a great deal on Batman in general thanks to a life time of research, but I never read the full stories with my own eyes, and I was never familiar with Bane outside of what I saw in the Batman video games and movies. Now knowing what I know thanks to Knightfall, I'm pretty disappointed that most media seems to depict Bane as less threatening or less intelligent than he really is, because, yeah, he's kind of a guy you don't want to cross paths with. I've included a succinct summary of why in the spoiler area below this review, based on just this volume alone.<br /><br />Trust me though: Just read Knightfall for yourself and get immersed into a very suspenseful story arc, both for Bane and for Bruce Wayne. Thanks to this, Bane got bumped up to my second favorite villain. And he's only in second place because my love of horror and psychology prevent me from downgrading The Scarecrow to anything less than number one. :)<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br />So, why is Bane awesome and threatening? He beat Film Freak to death with his bare hands, broke Killer Croc's arms like toothpicks TWICE,and he's the only villain to have ever completely defeat Batman. Granted, he only snapped his spine and could have rendered him paralyzed or killed him - sure no biggie, he's only the damn Batman - but he's the only villain to have put him out of commission for a period of time. And he's one of the very few villains, if not the only one, to have figured out that Batman is Bruce Wayne, by merely using his brain and paying freakin' attention. He's both a physical threat AND an intellectual one.<br />*****SPOILER?*****

7885726770|4.0|I have been reviewing movies in my own mind for over forty years so I'm a little bias (in a good way), towards the older movies  they are usually done better. even if, they are in B&W.  Don't get me wrong I love B&W.  This is the best out of the three versions. Zoltan Korda 1939.  This original version is closer to the source and more credable and truer to the original script.  Back then Hollywood still had a sort of 'British feel' to some of their movies, especially the ones about Historical events.  Only drawback is: This apparently came from Korea and every time you replay this dvd, you have to go back to the main menu and block the Korean subtitles....No big deal for having this original at a fair price.
B004FQX59I|5.0|There are other, more full-featured releases to choose from, but don't bother. After almost three and a half hours of viewing, the only thing you'll want is time to savor and digest. In any case, the subject disc includes a commentary track from Director Oliver Stone. (Excellent and engaging, by the way.) Please note that like so many studio re-releases, the original theatrical release is *not* included here. ([[ASIN:B000MNOX94 The Natural]] was another offensive example of studio double-dippage.) The extra 17 minutes included in the JFK Director's Cut is mainly comprised of two scenes which in my opinion only slow the narrative. Your mileage may vary. The original film made such an impact (some of the scenes entered the public consciousness almost immediately: \\"Back and to the left\\") and was so meticulously assembled (JFK won the Oscar for Film Editing) that a Director's Cut is unnecessary. Unfortunately and as far as I know, the theatrical release was never available here in the USA in DVD format. The more expensive [[ASIN:B0000542DJ 2-disc set]] includes several featurettes and is commensurately more expensive.<br /><br />The film speaks for itself, or at least it will, after you've watched it a few times. Well-paced John Williams score and an all-star cast, many actors willing to make small roles memorable. Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Sissy Spacek, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Martin Sheen, John Candy, Brian Doyle-Murray, Michael Rooker, Jay O. Sanders, Vincent D'Onofrio.<br /><br />Those interested in political assassination thrillers should also see 1973's [[ASIN:0783226853 The Day of the Jackal]].
B004IJY4L0|5.0|I very rarely write reviews, as I typically can't be bothered.  However, in this case i must make an exception.  This is a very atypical release in this genre, as most every song is quite good.  Normally I find 2 good songs out of 10 on your average album.  If you are even remotely interested in this type of music, you should spend the money here.  Enjoy, I sure am.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|The best music takes time.....at least for me. If something hits me on one listen, I usually am pretty much done with it - no legs. I don't like to make a quick judgment or some knee-jerk reaction to an album. Artists (true artists) spend a substantial amount of time and effort creating a piece of work to be digested as a great meal should be enjoyed with time. With Oceania, I see the ties to the past but I feel that they are done with a reverence of what made them special in the first place and not in any way trying to recapture some lost glory. Not sure why people need to focus on if this album sounds like that album or why Billy's voice doesn't growl or this or that and so on. Enjoy the music for what it is; don't lock yourselves or SP into some cubby hole timeline. If this isn't for you, go enjoy the album or albums that makes you happy. I for one really enjoy this album and feel Billy has matured both musically, lyrically, and emotionally. This album feels more like an album of collective individuals than any other SP album. I am blown away by Nicole Florentino's bass playing- she is in the zone. I also love how Billy trusts Mike Byrne with the drumming duties- at first listen, you can hear the SP signature drum sound but also with a style of his own. Very impressed. Thank you Billy. Cheers.

0307730697|5.0|The first Navy SEAL book I read was \\"Lone Survivor\\" (which I loved) and It set my expectations high for this book. Although the intensity of action was mild, the story of a man, a warrior, beating the odds, faith and most of all family was unmatched. Mr Brown and his family are true heroes and what these men and women do and sacrifice for their country is unreal.<br /><br />This book is just amazing..  From trainings, to the battlefield and mostly life as a man... A family man.  These guys are real and althought they sacrifice a lot including family, this book goes inside their homes and shows you what true love and sacrifice is all about.<br /><br /> 5 star, great read!!!!!
B007VTVGAQ|3.0|Well this is certainly a different album than her previous three, which is both good and bad.  The highlights are \\"Every Single Night\\"  \\"Daredevil\\" \\"Regret\\" and \\"Anything we Want\\"<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />Fiona really does some great new feats with her voice on this album, pushes it to places we haven't heard before.  On \\"Daredevil\\" there is a fantastic part where she sings/screams, \\"Search me out, look at look at look at ME i'm all the fishes in the sea\\".  As well as some very heavy vocals in \\"Regret\\".<br /><br />It is also good to see her moving on artistically and trying new sounds, even if they don't always work out.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The songs sound like demo recordings.  This was of course intentional and how Fiona wanted it produced.  However, because they are so sparse with little variation in instrumentation, they all start to sound the same.  It's hard to tell a few of the songs a part.  The production just isn't interesting or captivating.<br /><br />Many of the songs are very chaotic and random in their percussion, which gets annoying.  Especially on the ugly \\"Jonathan\\" which is very unpleasant to the ears.<br /><br />After ending \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" with the beautiful \\"Waltz: Better than Fine\\" I had hoped she was starting to move away from the pain in her life and make some more uplifting songs.  There isn't really a \\"Better than fine\\" moment on this album.  It is all very dark and depressing.  Though watching her live, she does seem to be very happy while singing \\"Anything We Want\\".<br /><br />What Fiona hasn't seemed to move away from is writing what people would characterize as \\"breakup songs\\".  She said a while back that she only really writes music when she is faced with difficult circumstances and needs to work through it.  It would be nice to see her tackle some different subject matter though, and make an album that isn't filled with regrets about past lovers.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />For those wanting melodic musicthat is fun to listen to, this album is definitely not it.  Fiona has given us those with her previous three albums.  This is a big departure for her, with a few highlights and still worth buying for long time fans.  Lyrically, she is still a very strong song writer, and has included some great moments of wit in the song lyrics. The deluxe version is well put together, everything comes in her \\"journal\\" of sorts with hand written lyrics and sketches, a dvd of current live performances.  However, the 2 postcards included are pretty ugly.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />After repeated listens I do have to say this album is one that grows on you.  However, the 3 star rating will remain, some of the songs just feel much weaker than the rest.  \\"Regret\\" is probably lyrically the strongest on the album, and maybe my favorite track.  I said before that it was \\"all dark and depressing\\" which isn't necessarily true.  Fiona does provide moments of empowerment and optimism.  In Daredevil she sings \\"Say I'm an airplane, and the gashes I got from my heartbreak are the slots and flaps upon my wing, and I use them to give me lift.  Give me anything and I'll turn it into a gift\\".  Very clever!  and indeed, optimistic.<br /><br />Hot Knife also leaves the album on a playful note, with Fiona screaming, \\"He EXCITES ME, must be like a genesis of rhythm\\"  and then singing about a \\"dancing bird of paradise\\".<br /><br />She just did an interview with Billboard Magazine in which she said the album was actually recorded 4 years ago.  Which means it was finished in 2008.  She said it sat around for years while her record label went through management transitions.  From how I understood, this was by her choice to not release it sooner.

B007URVZJ6|3.0|If you are writing a basic book such as a novel that comprises of text then this is useful guide.  But I have to agree with what Barry Krusch says above.  If you use Microsoft Word for a more complex book such as a non-fiction one that includes picture you are going to face an uphill struggle and this book(let) does not help you with this.  In fact it might even mislead you into a false sense of security, down which you may find yourself in a nightmare world of a formatting quagmire.<br /><br />You see, once your book has been written in Word, you are then going to have to save the book as a HTML file, copy and paste your HTML into an HTML editor program, with which you are going to have to modify the HTML \\"class\\" tags, headers, and footers etc.  Ultimately you will need to move your book to another program such as Kindle Writer that will create your final Amazon book. Actually Kindle Writer enables you to create your book from start to finish without using Microsoft Word at all with full control of what the book looks like regardless how complex it will be.<br /><br />Then you will want to optimize your images, which is what you are going to want to do to reduce your file size and will need to use a program like Paintshop Pro or a freebie such as Gimp, the latter having quite a hefty learning curve.<br /><br />And, of course, if you want to do some fancy tricks like turning footnotes into hyperlinks that take your reader to source material that you have quoted, you're obviously going to be in the HTML world and that of OPF.  Kindle Writer puts you in HTML world gently, and does most of the HTML formatting for you, using a special template that covers all eventualities.  Proofing is done through the official Kindle Previewer program.<br /><br />The book that I am reviewing is therefore somewhat misleading and quite useless if  you want to do more that write a simple text based book, but if this what you are writing then it is quite helpful.  But even here Kindle Writer is a much better option that Microsoft Word.ter is a much better option that Microsoft Word.
031262820X|1.0|This book doesnt live up to the hype that comes with this author's name. The character developement is at the level of a high schooler and the plot is all over the place. The story doesnt pick up until there is about 50 pages left and then youre confused if the story is about a gay couple, a preggers sister or a girl getting married. I was very disappointed with this book and i dont think ill ever read a book from this author again. I love chick lit, but this book just doesnt measure up.
0553386794|3.0|This review covers my impression of not only the first book, but the (currently) 5 books of the series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire'.<br /><br />Some novels are like bags of potato chips. Each chapter is a chip. The purpose of each chip is to make you want to eat the next chip. At first they taste good, but after a while you're eating  not because they taste good, but because the last chip you ate made you want to eat the next one. When you've finished the book you've eaten, not a meal, but a bag of potato chips. Less than satisfying.<br /><br />Now there's nothing wrong with a bag of potato chips now and then, but `A Song of Fire and Ice' series is like eating 5 bags of potato chips in a row. You keep thinking there's a meal at the end of the journey, but it's just more chips. J.R.R. Martin is great at whetting your appetite, but not very good at providing satisfying resolutions.<br /><br />A Song of Fire and Ice (of which A Game of Thrones is the first book) is wide and long. It creates an alternative world where most of the action centers on the continent of Westeros, which is much like Medieval Europe. There are knights and swordfights and jousting, but like pre-Enlightenment Europe, the lines are blurred between fact and myth, between science and magic and religion. (What better place for an author to imagine?) There is an almost fetishistic attention to clothing, armor and Coats of Arms (called Sigils). Sex, violence, power and betrayal figure prominently. Martin is a competent writer and a great storyteller.<br /><br />But after the first three books you begin to sense Martin is running out of steam. He has so many plot threads going you sense he doesn't know how to tie them all together. The world keeps getting longer and wider, but there is no sense of cohesion tying these threads together.<br /><br />Just to be clear: A Game of Thrones is a fine book, in fact the first three books are quite good. But it's important for readers to know that while each is a novel, they are part of an unfinished story which begins to fizzle in book 4, and continues to fizzle in book 5. If you read the reviews from disappointed fans, you understand that it isn't just because the books aren't good, it's because they had such high expectations after the first 3 books. This is a testament to the great promise the `A Song of Fire and Ice' makes, and ultimately fails to deliver., they are part of an unfinished story which begins to fizzle in book 4, and continues to fizzle in book 5.

B0055QYKQO|4.0|The Gigabyte UD3 has been excellent so far. The stock settings for the motherboard are pretty weak, but it's extremely customizable. I've personally found that the included profiles (including memory profiles) don't work well at all, and cause the PC to be unstable, but as long as you know what you're doing, they give you free reign to alter each and every setting individually when set to Manual.<br /><br />The board runs cool and supports all of the hottest features today such as USB 3.0 (with internal header) SLI and CFX, Sata 6.0Gbs, and PCI-E x2.1 (not x3.0).

B0086T77MG|1.0|My wife and I almost watched this video before watching season 2. Luckily, I stopped it before we got too far in, because it contains all sorts of spoilers. I don't understand why they positioned it at the start of the season; it should be at the end.
B000HA4WT8|1.0|I didnt expect much and it was not. Was really surprized where these supposedly teens find money for custom made cars but realism was limited to Tokyo streets which looks fantastic on any night. The movie itself dont make sense--yes, cars moving fast, yes, chicks are hot but we never see anything appropriate for ages over 13. And all those underground criminal activities kinda strange and pieces dont stick together. Avoid.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a \\"must read\\"!  I couldn't put it down.  There were so many twists and turns.  Some I figured out, some I didn't.<br />The end was a shocker!!!  All I couldn't think, was that poor child.<br />I will definitely purchase more novels from Gillian Flynn.
030758836X|4.0|Wow! Another great novel, that kept me turning the pages, by Gillian Flynn.<br />Dark, twisted and utterly enjoyable.<br /><br />On the morning of Nick and Amy's 5th wedding anniversary Amy disappears leaving signs of foul play. All signs point to Nick as being the number one suspect, or do they? The story is told in alternating chapters, one being through Nick's narrative and the other through Amy's diary.<br /><br />With so many twists and turns throughout the story I found my sympathies constantly changing. I was satisfied with the ending and found the last paragraph to be brilliant.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well this is probably my 1st review ever or at least 1st in 10 years.  I saw a review of Wool and thought what the heck I'll try it and got caught up almost immediately.  Really fast paced, well written story with some very, very surprising twists and turns.  It's really much more about the human condition then anything super futuristic but I enjoyed it througly nevertheless.<br /><br />Well done!

B007WA56SC|4.0|Fans of Kylie Minogue know that it would be a difficult task to rummage through her 25 year career and widdle it down to just a few choice selections of her biggest hits.  But thankfully, it has been done for them!  \\"The Best of\\" is a single CD collection that presents what is being billed as the \\"cream of the crop\\", the \\"icing on the cake\\", the \\"choice cut\\" of Ms. Minogue's fabulous career.  While it mainly works, combining the modern disco beats of her most recent work with a small serving of her past hits, the exclusion of a few \\"must have\\" tracks mar the package.  \\"Shocked\\" and \\"What Do I Have To Do\\" would have served the public better than \\"Never Too Late\\" and \\"Give Me Just A Little More Time\\".  But there is always \\"Ultimate Kylie\\", a double disc set release a few years back, for new fans to fall back on.  Kylie has slowly been creeping into the American market, hopefully package will help new fans jump on board and old fans reconnect with one of the world's biggest pop stars.  And in the end, \\"The Best of\\" is a fun collection that is purely pop.

076115678X|1.0|Where do I even start? I expected a great read and good tips but within 5 mins I could see this book wasn't worth the paper she printed it on, I kept reading and after pretty much reading the entire thing this is what her book has shown me.<br /><br />Number 1 this book is nothing but a pack of hair tips you can find on any good hair board.<br /><br />Number 2 not only is her method built off other people and Irish and African's ideas but she is taking the credit! When I was young my mom always left a bit of conditioner in my hair to make it silky and it worked. The woman who wrote this book is standing on the shoulders of generations of curly haired women to make herself a fortune by selling her products!<br /><br />Number 3 she demands that you must not use your hair dryer at all if you plan to straighten your hair but you can if you want to be curly. Where does she think she gets to write the rules to our hair? If it is okay to use your dryer for curly hair then it is okay to straighten it but of course if she told you that her hair care products wouldn't sell seeing as how she hasn't made any for anything but curly hair products!<br /><br />Number 4 the jokes ever 5 seconds like \\"it's a pain in the tress\\" \\"curl up with this book\\" and much more are sickening after about 10 minutes of trying to read her book. Does she want to be a comedian or a hair care guru? Make up your mind already.<br /><br />Number 5 she acts like her way is the \\"only way\\" she doesn't focus enough on oils and her few hair recipes are bland and any child could make up one like that, she does not go into the different oils and their benefits.<br /><br />Overall save you money and go to longhaircarecommunity for the best tips or Google what you want to know on cowashing.<br />This book is her own personal rule book to lead you to using her hair care products, don't fall into her trap.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Yes concept album. It got me excited too, but every Rush album is a concept/themed album. Ah, but this one follows a story line a la 2112 and Hemispheres. Intriguing right! Well, not really. Compare side A of 2112 that clocks in at 20:34 as Hemispheres clocks in at 18:08, I have taken both of these journeys many times over the years and they actually feel like cohesive journeys. Like I'm taken to another place. Those two pieces 2112 and Hemispheres cover more ground in less than a third of the time then CA does in its 60 plus minutes. CA is a casual trip, you can wear sandals if you want to.<br />Okay, boo hoo, I'm crying about CA not being the EPIC Rush album I've been craving for all these years. I understand that will not happen. I love all phases of Rush, some more than others.<br />And as for the sound debate, I think it could sound cleaner. But I gotta believe Rush and co. did this intentionally, whether it was for effect or ambiance I don't know. At least it doesnt sound like that hot mess Vapor Trails.<br />Back to Clockworks Angels. I enjoy this album. I really do. I think it offers snippets of their career in each song, just snippets though, it's still a modern day Rush album (not complaining). CA is Rush's best album since Counterparts, yes Counterparts was Rush's last really good album, top to bottom, front to back kind of album you can listen from beginning 2 end without saying meh? You could compile the best songs from Rush's last 3 ablums and make maybe one decent album, ya I said it. I'm gonna get hate for that one from the Rush zealots. It's okay to love a band and critique them at the same time, (like you do with your children). But some people over do it on the praise (just like with their children). All I will say is \\"Rush ya did good boys, not great, but it was good\\" as I pat them on their collective back.

B004QOB8SY|5.0|I discovered this gem of a television series after it had been shown on PBS but before they knew for sure a season 2 would exist. Like thousands of fans I waited, re-watching the three episodes in season 1 until everyone around wanted to kill me or break the discs, and hoping the next three would be worth the wait-hoping I would not be disappointed.<br /><br />I wasn't.<br /><br />These are three excellent episodes that stand among the best Sherlock Holmes tv/film adaptations I've seen (and I've seen quite a few). This is not, however, something to buy and buy the first later. This season picks up right at the end of the last season 1 episode and moves full steam ahead. First season was introduction, this is the three best stories in the Holmes canon, all with excellent writing, beautiful acting, and a wonderful modern twist.<br /><br />A Scandal in Belgravia: A modern retelling of A Scandal in Bohemia, we are once again introduced to Irene Adler-The Woman. She is not an actor however, nor is she a thief-as she is in the Guy Ritchie version. No, now we have a dominatrix who tries to bring everyone around her, Sherlock, Mycroft, etc. to their knees. The script, written by Steven Moffat, is full of the wonderful dialogue between Sherlock and John, as well as hilarious and character developing moments. One of my personal favorite parts is the furthering of the relationship between Sherlock and his landlady. Mrs. Hudson is awesome! The best scene, talked about in other reviews, takes place in Buckingham Palace with John pulled from a crime scene and Sherlock wrapped up only in a sheet. They might not act grown up: as John says, \\"We solve crimes together, I blog about it, and he forgets to wear his pants-I wouldn't hold out too much hope.\\" But it held out a lot of hope for a great series.<br /><br />The Hounds of Baskerville: Another marvelous modern retelling, this time from Mark Gattis. Many attempts have been unable to catch the mood of the story, which is less of a mystery and more a Gothic horror. This, he did perfectly, transforming a Gothic horror into a near modern equivalent: conspiracy theories. Baskerville is a British military secret lab with all sorts of potential for wild and terrible experiments. Sherlock and John travel together, soon joined by Lestrade-once again played excellently by Rupert Graves. Here, Sherlock faces fear, true terror, for the first time with less the happy results. Wonderful evolutions of the series' groundbreaking use of text on the screen is used perfectly here to allow us access into Sherlock's 'mind palace'. A wonderful retelling that is much better than the previous seasons second episode.<br /><br />The Reichenbach Fall: The one we all waited for. And it did not disappoint. Both of the previous episodes had contained little teasers of Moriarty, as if he peeked from behind curtains just off-stage. Now, however, Andrew Scott is given free reign to bring his take on the consulting criminal to life, bigger, badder, and more insane than ever. We watch as he slowly unravels his plan, as everything slowly falls apart in front of us. The conclusion of the series left me weeping, as it did many others. A third season has been promised so all we can do is wait...again, though we now have six episodes instead of three to keep us company.<br /><br />This is one of the best series on television in any country with excellent acting by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman-the best Holmes and Watson duo I've seen since Jeremy Brett and his two co-stars and Rathbone and Bruce. The writing, the cinematography that would be excellent in big budget films, and the wonderful blending of modern day with all that is essentially Holmes makes this a must have for fans of the great detective, British Mystery series, or simply great television.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It is very additive! It's better on the kindle fire because the screen is a lot bigger,  it seems to move a lot faster which is very challenging!..Love it!

B00004L8J4|1.0|This video actually looks like someone went into a theater and taped it as it was playing on the screen!  I have never see a \\"real\\" movie play like this...the sound is distorted, the playback is scratchy, and even the whole screen doesn't show up, it has a black line across the top portion of the screen during playback.  I just assumed that the video was used was the reason it was so cheap...I didn't realize it was a rip off!  Not even going to try and send it back, it only cost $3, just makes me mad that my son now doesn't have his video!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|If you like Nicolas Sparks, this book is one of his best.  Personally, when it comes to one of his stories, I always read the ending first before buying his books.  Sure, it's a spoiler but he has stung me too many times by killing off a main character, turning a wonderful love story into a rediculous tragedy that leaves the reader grieving instead of rejoicing.  There is enough pain in real life without inflicting it needlessly in a sappy book.  I read to escape and find some joy in fantasy.  This one ended a bit over-dramatically but it all in all, it ended well; so I bought it.
0807014273|3.0|\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" left out the reason for our existence.  It assumed that this life is all there is.

0307888908|4.0|I think what struck me most about this book is how different Hoffman and Casnocha's career advice is from the traditional wisdom of approaching your career with a well-defined long-term plan. The problem, as anyone who is actually working in a fast-moving industry knows, things change quickly. Not only do our goals change as we accumulate new experiences and perspectives, but the playing field changes rapidly--which means advice from people like Stephen Covey to \\"begin with the end in mind\\" don't necessarily apply to careers anymore. Things change. We change. And we have to approach our careers with that mindset. It's along the same lines as advice offered by Tim Ferriss in \\"The 4-Hour Work Week.\\"<br /><br />The greatest value of this book comes from the fact that Hoffman is in a very unique position to be offering strategies for career success. As cofounder and chairman of LinkedIn, he has had excellent insight into the workforce. The career trajectories of more than a hundred million people are being tracked on the professional networking site, offering people like Hoffman a top-level view of how the careers really evolve and grow in the workforce.<br /><br />Not only is the book full of tried and true strategies and tactics for the modern workforce (much different than that of our parents and grandparents), but that each chapter ends with some homework to put those strategies into practice. In a way, it's like having a career coach helping you along by pointing out specific things to try.

B004XANKVO|5.0|I've been using this backpack for several months and absolutely love it! I'm generally an unorganized person, but this bag makes it so easy to keep everything in its place. There's one section with a large, sturdy compartment for my laptop, a smaller, softly-lined spot for the iPad, and several little soft pockets perfect for a cellphone, MP3 player, or camera. Once all of the gadgets are stowed, there's a second large section with enough room for several changes of clothes, an outer compartment great for books and sunscreen, side pockets for water bottles, and a crush-resistant compartment at the top good for glasses or other breakables. Tons of little and medium-sized pockets are scattered throughout the various sections, so it's always easy to stash and find the chargers and other little items that get lost at the bottom of lesser bags. I just love the way this bag is set up.<br /><br />As far as durability goes, this backpack has held up well. And, despite the fact that I usually have it packed with a bunch of stuff, including a heavy laptop, it's very comfortable to wear. I have quite a small frame but the straps adjust to fit me snugly and comfortably. Overall, a great backpack perfect for packing and carrying tons of gear!

B001U0HAYS|4.0|PLOT SPOILER!<br /><br />This film is not a classic, but it is worth watching to see Robert Redford & Faye Dunnaway in their primes.<br /><br />The story line is good until the very ending -- then it yields to the paranoia of the times (1975): Big Government & the CIA controls everything, even the New York Times.<br /><br />A better ending would have been to re-write Redford's \\"random\\" choosing of Dunnaway's apartment to hideout.  Make it less random, and more \\"accidental\\".  Then in the end we discover that it is not her apartment, but a \\"safe house\\" and she has been sent to kill him (unbeknownst to the first assassin, Max Von Sydow).<br /><br />That final layer of excitement -- two assassins out to kill him -- which one saves him?  Or not?
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|\\"I'm trouble,\\" she said ...<br /><br />Wow! Seven years later, she has grown into her talent.<br /><br />\\"Idler Wheel\\" is a cohesive album that showcases FA's ability to sing her poems with her beautiful voice that just haunts and stirs and communicates ... and ... just ... wow.  At the end of \\"Regret,\\" the way she squeaks the final lines, it really just fits the song so perfectly.<br /><br />\\"I'm weak,\\" she says.<br /><br />I love the spare, almost desolate sound of this album - from the heartbeat of the bass on \\"Valentine\\" to the industrial rhythm of the percussion on \\"Anything We Want,\\" and the simple piano arrangements throughout.  Fiona doesn't really play her piano on this album (although she is quite capable with a keyboard) - she pretty much pounds a handful of notes and chords to accompany the poetry.  That's fine.  It works.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of music throughout my day and I've kept her three albums end-to-end, in almost all of my playlists.  One of my biggest complaints about FA's previous albums has been the overproduced flourishes: symphonic strings, spaceship and carnival sounds, etc., that I submit were the trademark of chief clown Jon Brion.  (Listen to some Aimee Mann that he produced - same story.  It really doesn't age well.)  For this reason I tended to prefer her live performances which focused more on the way her vocals are complemented by a piano.  Her \\"unplugged\\" appearance served as a shining example.  \\"Idler Wheel\\" has a consistent sound that is purely Fiona - there will be no mistaking these songs for any of her other work.  This work will endure.  The album is infectious - right now I absolutely need it - at least twice a day.<br /><br />Thank you, Fiona, for the great album.  While I wish we didn't have to wait seven years, it has been worth the wait and that is your privilege.  I look forward to your next album, but mostly I wish you happiness, whatever that means to you.<br /><br />\\"But look at yourself<br />You'll see you're still so young<br />You haven't earned the weariness<br />That sounds so jaded on your tongue\\"
0061692042|5.0|CANADA<br /><br />Truly a different and wonderful work of words, described with pure power and poetry, a story told that is satisfying, pulsing, intriguing, unforgettable.<br /><br />Dell and his twin sister Berner are the children of bank robbers.  Living in Montana, the twins have no friends but each other.  Their parents, Bev and Neeva, run into slight money problems and their father, Bev, decides the best way out of this dire financial situation is to rob a bank.  His planning and plotting are unrealistic and sloppy.  So, Neeva steps in with advice and a somewhat better idea.  Things go awry, they are arrested and sent to prison. Their children are left alone, perplexed, and full of anger at their parents for putting them in this situation.<br /><br />Dell and Berner are only 15 years old when this takes place.  A friend of the family steps in to help the two children avoid ending up wards of the state and living in an orphanage.

Ending up in Canada, Dell meets a cast of characters he never dreamed possibly existed.  Dell ends up living in the barren prairie lands of Saskatchewan under the guardianship of one Arthur Remlinger, an American who now resides in Canada.  Remlinger is not who he seems and harbors many dark and deep secrets. Both  Remlinger's life and Dell's crash together in many different aspects which only lead to disaster, calamity, and ruin.<br /><br />Dell tells his family's story over a span of fifty years, with wit and grace. What happens to his bank robbing parents?  Do the twins ever see them again?  Are they convicted of their crimes?  Do Dell and Berner stay together and live out their life as brother and sister?  Can the twins ever forgive their parents for breaking up their once happy family?  Does Dell remain in Canada?  What happens while he is in Canada that will forever change the course of his life?  Does Dell play a part in the horrible and terrifying hand that fate deals him?

Ford has nine other books I look forward to reading, one being the acclaimed INDEPENDENCE DAY written in 1995.<br /><br />If you are looking for a well written, well thought out, adverse book, full of characters that are fleshed-out, a fantastic story line, and consequences that bear down on everyone involved, this is the book for you.  Don't miss this one!<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam
0345803485|1.0|I read this book months ago and to be honest, I can't stop thinking about it. This is not meant as a complement.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book, I really did. It has all the promise of any great \\"guilty pleasure\\", but falls VERY short of the mark.  This is clearly the author's first crack at writing a book. The repetition in the book is enough to make you stop reading midway through. Just for fun, after reading the book, I went back and tallied the amount of times someone gasped, bit their lip, blushed, flushed, or murmured. Next I counted the various versions of \\"holy crap\\", \\"jeez\\" or the oh-so-serious \\"triple crap\\". And let us never forget (or forgive, for that matter) the super cheesy \\"laters, baby\\".  Who talks like that? Lastly, if Ana referred to her inner goddess one more time, I was going to scream. Needless to say, my tally marks exceeded the space allowed on my piece of notebook paper.<br /><br />My next gripe with this book (as if being so lazy as to recycle the same words and phrases wasn't enough) is how simply unbelievable the story is.  Despite seeing everything through Ana's eyes, she stills seems like just an average girl with nothing truly special about her. At least nothing special enough to catch and maintain the attention of the demi-god that is Christian Grey. Their pairing in just silly and the fact that this emotionally unattached man is willing to give up and change everything for Average Ana is even sillier. I guess it is a little unreasonable  to ask for a realistic plot from a book whose title character is a 27 year old billionaire who can fly helicopters, fluently speak french, is a classically trained pianist, AND a successful CEO. I don't buy it.  Please don't get me started on how a 21 year old woman goes from a virgin who has never touched herself and refers to her private parts as \\"down there\\" to a sex obsessed submissive \\"goddess\\" over night. The most comical part of the book was Christian's 100% success rate at screaming \\"Oh, Ana!\\" when reaching his 'peak'. Not only is it hilariously corny, it would be reason enough for me to never want to be intimate with  a man like that again. Ever.<br /><br />I would highly recommend putting this book down unless you are a fan of adventurous 12 year old writers taking a stab at BDSM novels. However,  I will give some credit where credit is due... the author was extremely successful at reminded the reader that Christian's eyes are very, very gray.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|I've been following RTF since the early 70's. Chick Corea Stanley Clarke, and Lenny White never cease to blow me away with their musicial capabilities. (Being a musician I am especially impressed) For this tour, Frank Gambale played lead guitar, and Jean-Luc Ponty joined the fantastic ride with his violin. I was honored to see the most recent RTF tour, and this release brings that tour live to the listener. These guys have a connection musically that brings you to another dimension. I highly recommend this CD/DVD if you appreciate musicians who have mastered their instruments. If you have been a long-standing RTF fan, you'll love this recording. If you're new to jazz/jazz fusion, treat yourself to something extraordinary. The double CD comes with a high-quality DVD; it takes you up close and personal with the band members; it illustrates their creativity, and gives some history/background to some of their tunes, with some live footage of the most recent tour. The Mothership certainly has returned!
B007HNFREW|5.0|I watched Season One's first episode, and I was very happy with it. I am almost done reading the book, and I knew the first show would not be a spoiler for me. The series is very faithful to the book. I am astonished. I had no problem with the sex and gore, because this is HBO and HBO is entertainment for adults, so they can make these kinds of racy movies without having to edit and sensor the bits that may offend. This is an excellent series, and I hope they do Season Two as A Clash Of Kings. I'm looking forward to it. If you like your fantasy with a dash of reality in it, this is a good series for you.
B0060AY85C|5.0|I read this book and found it difficult to refrain from re-reading passages, especially those heavy with such living and beautiful prose.<br /><br />\\"Carefully, carefully, Frank placed the bones on Cee's quilt, doing his level best to arrange them the way they once were in life. The quilt became a shroud of lilac, crimson, yellow, and dark navy blue. Together they folded the fabric and knotted its ends. Frank handed Cee the shovel and carried the gentleman in his arms. Back down the wagon road they went, then turned away from the edge of Lotus toward the stream. Quickly they found the sweet bay tree--split down the middle, beheaded, undead--spreading its arms, one to the right, one to the left. There at its base Frank placed the bone-filled quilt that was first a shroud, now a coffin. Cee handed him the shovel. While he dug she watched the rippling stream and the foliage on its opposite bank.<br />Morrison, Toni (2012-05-08). Home (pp. 143-144). Random House, Inc.. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />I could see and feel Frank's and Cee's emotion, reflections, and the unity that immense pain and the hope for survival brings to people who love one another.<br />So Lovely.
1401225756|4.0|Neil Gaiman's Sandman series has been one of the more critically acclaimed series of comic books.  What makes this series better than many others is its love of story.  Gaiman is a great storyteller, and he's in love with his craft.  This love exudes from every frame from every page; here, the focus is on legend, myth, and origin stories.  While the series picks up steam as it wears on, this first volume is a nice collection of the first story-arc in the Sandman universe.<br /><br />PRELUDES & NOCTURNES may be the weakest of all of the Sandman volumes.  While compared to the rest of the series, this first volume doesn't stand up to the rest, it does stand up well to other comic book peers.  The story revolves around Morpheus, the lord of dreams; he's been out of the picture for several years, held captive by an affluent occultist.  PRELUDES & NOCTURNES follows Morpheus as he escapes his captivity and searches to regain the power he lost years ago.  Unfortunately, some of these issues feel like \\"fetch-quests.\\"  Gaiman was feeling early pressure from Vertigo to make Sandman into a traditional superhero, and this influence is felt most vividly in this first volume.  Fans of the DC Universe will find a few familiar faces here (I won't recount their names here, because half of the fun is seeing them show up in such a strange setting).<br /><br />As I've said though, even though PRELUDES & NOCTURNES is one of the weakest volumes, it's still head-and-shoulders above many competitors.  Volume 2 ([[ASIN:1401227996 THE DOLL'S HOUSE]] really picks up the steam, and the series finds it groove.  I would recommend this first volume for anyone who hasn't started the series yet -- you don't need to love (or even like comic books) to love Sandman.  However, if you do love comic books, PRELUDES & NOCTURNES (and the rest of the series) is essential reading.<br /><br />In the past few years, Vertigo has been remastering the Sandman series.  While it was originally collected in paperback form in the mid 90's, technology did not allow seamless transfer of colors.  This \\"New Edition\\" is great for a few reasons: the pages are thinner (they don't get covered in finger prints), they are available in electronic format, and they really make the artwork better.  Especially apparent for the first three volumes of Sandman, the New Edition enhances the color by restoring it to the artist's original.  This listing on Amazon shows a few samples of the differences between the mid-90's edition and this current one.  Additionally, many users have complained about lack of Kindle support for comic books on other eReaders (iPad/Android/etc...), but Amazon has recently updated their software to allow for colorful illustrations.  It's no longer a problem; be sure to check this out!k form in the mid 90's, technology did not allow seamless transfer of colors.

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This new version of The Woman in Black is appropriately scary! I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Gothic-type movies. The return of suggestion and glimpses of a ghost and not the blood & gore of so many modern-day movies make watching this a real pleasure! Wonderful atmosphere, setting, dark images, and haunting music are all in place for a scary experience. Excellent!
B0080R7Q70|4.0|The Flower Kings' latest album, BANKS OF EDEN, is more of what you would expect from the Swedish progressive rock band. The instrumentation here is fantastic; guitars are soaring, the vocals and harmonies work well together, the drums are pounding (but never overbearing), and the bass holds it all together. For all its potential though, this album sounds familiar -- too familiar perhaps. One of the hallmarks of prog is the forward-thinking nature of its music. Here, the Flower Kings look to the past, rather than the future. This album feels as if it could have easily been released 30 years ago. This might be progressive rock, but there's not much forward-thinking about it.<br /><br />\\"Numbers\\" is a sprawling 25+ minute track. It is littered with great lead guitar, time changes, timbre shifts, and song-within-songs. It contains some of the best moments on the album. The remained of the album (6 more tracks) are standalone songs that feature the Eric Johnson-like lead guitar, the manic drumming (the band picked up a young, new drummer for this album), and lyrics based in spirituality. \\"For the Love of Gold\\" sounds like a solid Yes song, with its refrain interjected between cymbal crashes. The closer, \\"Going Up,\\" is an uplifting song that works great as an outro to the album. The lead guitar of Roine Stolt is more expressive than his voice, so it is only fitting that his solo brings BANKS OF EDEN to a close.<br /><br />Fans of the Flower Kings will enjoy BANKS OF EDEN -- it's a solid album by the band and one of the better ones in recent years. Fans of Yes, early King Crimson, and early Porcupine Tree will find something here to enjoy. Again, it's not a bad album, there's just nothing that elevates it against its peers. BANKS OF EDEN is good in the moment, but it isn't strong enough to create any real lasting appeal. The execution of Flower Kings can't be argued; I'd just like to see a bit more individuality.

0345803485|5.0|Wow thank you E.L James for such an inspiring erotica novel!<br /><br />After having some communication issues with my lady friend your book was recommended to me by a work colleague.  Long story short I managed to reconnect with her by quoting from your novel via SMS word for word!<br /><br />She now thinks i'm some sort of literary genius, a modern sexier version of Edgar Allen Poe if you will.<br /><br />Looking forward to getting by BDSM on later tonight!<br /><br />Thank You!
B004UIOUHC|4.0|This is an excellent browser and used in conjunction with my thrive browser. Slick looking and fast. With good visual appearance and search. Strongly recommended to give it a try. A company that's been around for a while and continues to put out good mobile product. A definite buy.<br /><br />Oh the one exception is the menu pressing to go to the home page doesn't seem to function. Hope I'm wrong but tried it on two tablets and can't get back to google with the one click.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am not quite sure why this is so popular.  The writer seriously needs a thesaurus for her next book.  Too many words and expressions are irritatingly repeated.  It was some-what obvious to me that the writer is quite young.  I will say, however, it is not a bad story and perhaps it was the narrator, as I purchased it on audio.  It may have been far better had I read them myself.  I DO NOT suggest audio.
1416550534|4.0|I finished The Forgotten Garden and decided to read all of Morton's books.<br /><br />This one started out rough for me and I had a hard time connecting with what was going on. I put it down, then decided to give it one more try. I enjoy the way Morton writes her characters. They are very full and well-thought out. I really felt like I was inside the story with them. The writing is fantastic - I enjoy Morton's style. I am glad I decided to pick this one up again. The only gripe I have - and this was the same with Garden - was the \\"present\\" time story. When the plot really gets rolling, you are pulled out and into the \\"present\\" day. I skimmed over those parts because I was more connected to the story of Hannah, Robbie, Emmiline and young Grace. Other than that little detail, I enjoyed this book very much and will follow with reading The Distant Hours.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I must admit I purchased very inexpensively and don't use very much. The features and layout is very nice. On my Toshiba Thrive its a nice addition even if I tend not to use word processors. Obviously the other reviewers convinced me on this app.
B006588YUE|3.0|Nothing fancy here, pretty much what you would expect for a stock cooling solution from Intel.  The base of this heatsink is very small, I don't think it even covers the entire processor.  There is also a very minimal amount of copper on the base.<br /><br />On the positive side it provides adequate cooling, just don't plan on overclocking.  It's also very quiet which is always a good thing.  Overall it's a decent heatsink for basic cooling, plus the price is cheap!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Blue LED Lighting<br />Easy to Install<br />Very Quiet<br />Cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />Small base<br />Minimal amount of copper<br />Average cooling

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus Edition by Hugh Howey, was the very first book I purchased for my new Kindle Touch 3G.  My reding experience has been limited to a few favourite authors throughout my entire life, never daring to venture further due to the cost of books.  Nevertheless, I tend to tear thru them if they are good.<br /><br />I have never read, nor even heard of Hugh Howey before purchasing this book... It was a gamble because this edition is actually 5 books in one, but the price was right, so I took a chance and bought it.  I knew nothing of his style, nothing of his previous works, nothing at all!  But, after reading the synopsis, I gave it a go.<br /><br />For the next few evenings I tore into the book, devouring the fantastic story contained within.  Try as I might, I was barely able to put the book down!  I was completely hooked.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the best book I have read in many years.  I completed the book in just five days!

0230709532|2.0|I used to read this to my niece when she was a kid many years ago, and she loved it. We'd enjoy opening the flaps and talking about the animals behind each flap. I bought this intending to give it as a gift to a friend (and got the mini edition so I could mail it to her), but even though the story is the same, this mini-edition is flimsy and the one I received was defective. The flap on the third page was improperly glued and tore the page. In my 10 years of shopping at Amazon I've never had to return anything, but will do with this book since I'd be embarrassed to give it as a gift! I'm buying the regular edition (board book) instead despite its bigger size.
0671646788|5.0|Before I go into my review, let me just say I was curious to see why there were so many negative reviews, so I read them. One that stood out to me was that the concepts were outdated. There is nothing further from the truth than that. Times change but overall people do not. People still have the same strive to succeed as they did 50 years ago, and the basic principles to do that are still alive and well today, as they are in this book.<br />Now let that segue into my review. Around 10 years ago, a business colleague of mine gave me this book and recommended I read it. Being that I'm not much of a reader, fast forward 10 years later, and I finally decided that I would read it. I won't go into details about the book, but let me just say that if you need motivation and a plan to do what you want to do in life, read this book. But the real shocker is, the outline for success still applies today. As I was reading, I didn't realize the book was written in 1959 until I got to the part where the author was giving an example of a friend being successful and making $15K/year. I thought it was a typo! But looking at the copyright I realized that this book was written in 1959. Wow, if I had known that before I probably wouldn't have started reading it and would've prematurely determined that the ideas were outdated. So that leads me to believe that some reviewers have done the same.<br />Bottom line: read this book, don't let the date fool you. The actions and reactions of ourselves in everyday life will never be outdated.

B0042J6VUS|3.0|I purchased this tripod to record videos for youtube, and picked this brand mostly for the low cost.  As long as I \\"set it up\\" correctly, I have no problems.  The problem comes into play when I set the tripod down, with the legs at the taller setting.  The legs do NOT lock into place, so nearly every time I wanted to make the tripod taller, one of the legs would literally slide back into its original place.  For this reason, my iPhone has often been dropped, as the tripod collapses from not being placed  perfectly straight down onto the ground.  Great idea, but the product could use some work.
1603427244|5.0|I received the book much earlier than expected. I am pleased with the layout, the spiral binding and the overall size. It has real photos of what to do and step by step written directions. Each method is evaluated for it's pros and cons and best usage. Nice book. I definitely recommend it. I ordered the other new book on Cast On and Bind Off. It hasn't arrived yet.

Also romance is in it so its 3 for 1 deal. I like it and I will continue to watch til I get the the season and episode aired now. which is like season 6-7 ... Not sure? But for anyone looking for a great series but not sure if this is right for you. I asure you to just watch the first 3 episodes and decide from there... i like it and im enjoying it so far.<br /><br />have a great day ...
0345803485|1.0|The only reason this book is so popular is because of all the publicity it received. The writing is quite poor...not much more than boring dialogue between the 2 main characters. Quite honestly this book appeals to many because it is a legitimate way to read pornography.I have no intention of reading the other 2 books in this trilogy nor do I plan on seeing the movie. I am not a prude but I don't understand this hype about a story that has little substance and lacks fluency .

B000SXOFL4|5.0|I've listened to this record many, many times. It provides a moody and hypnotic atmosphere. Just enough vocals to be satisfying without overdoing it. I'm a road trip junkie and I never travel without this one. E4 all the way.
B007P6VLRS|1.0|I read that this was supposed to be their big comeback album.....yeah, some comeback. Tracks 1 and 2 are excellent and trademark Pumpkins - the album goes downhill after that...no memorable riffs, songs, or melodies , and nothing NEARLY on par with any of SP's material prior to Adore.<br /><br />I thought Zeitgeist was better than this, and that's not saying much.<br /><br />Hopefully their \\"next\\" comeback album will be better.
B000TETJWW|4.0|In its best moments, this album blends smooth techno with the Enigma sound.<br /><br />This album is a departure from earlier Enigma concept albums in that it lacks much of the familiar sound repertoire and the unifying or repetitive elements of E1-E4. Instead, \\"A Posteriori\\" feels much more abstract and, to me at least, darker and stranger. There are fewer vocals and lyrics here than previous albums. I find this to be a refreshing change. \\"Message from Io\\" and \\"Dancing With Mephisto\\" are superb, but the rest of the tracks hold their own just fine.<br /><br />My one disappointment is the final track, \\"Goodbye Milky Way.\\" It feels different than the rest and I don't like it as a finish here. Instead, I moved it to another playlist. Problem solved.<br /><br />This is mixed beautifully in 5.1 so do yourself a favor and listen to it through good headphones with the lights off.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ok. I loved the first book for starters. I never put it down, and the same goes for the second book. However, as I got to the third book it seemd like the same thing over and over again plus a couple of dramatic scenes. I would have liked to of seen more reality and less fantasy. In reality nobody has sex as much as Christian and Anna. It was very intersting in the beginning but then it just old after about 20 scenes of the same description of sex. I loved the series but as I said previously there should have been less fantasy and more reality. I hope you continue the Christian and Anna story. Looking forward to more reality!<br /><br />-Miss Little
B00846REIS|5.0|If you are a person who doesnt enjoy cliff hangers I would wait until the second and/or third book are released.<br /><br />Overall this was a great read. And while many people are considering it similar to the story of 50 Shades and I can see both the similarities and the differences. This book is SEXY, and Captivating.. I received the book via express delivery yesterday (Thank you Amazon Prime) began reading it a 9pm and could go to sleep until I finished it (5am). I was entranced by the this story of how the emotional baggage we bring into relationship can not be carried alone. How sometime we true need our sigificant other to help carry the load. Each character has its on set of problems that are serving as thier handicap. I was sad not to receive alot of the answers by the end of the book, which only makes the wait for october even more dreadful.<br /><br />This was a great read.... well worth the lack of sleep...

1594202842|2.0|Everyone hates this mom except her older daughter and her husband.  Her younger daughter, on the other hand, likens her to Lord Voldemort.  I've read all the Harry Potter books and I think that even Voldemort has a tad more humanity than Amy Chua.  To illustrate:  When her kids presented her with handmade cards on her birthday, she angrily told them to take them back as the gifts were unworthy.  She berated her younger daughter in public.  She mocked her, ruined the card and then threw it back at her, demanding something better.  She repeated the process on the older daughter, lamenting that she hadn't written her a poem.  The girls, by the way, were seven and four.  I couldn't get past this.  Forget the fact that she made the kids practice the piano and violin at the expense of sleep, meals and friends.  Forget that forced them to practice while on vacation before they could go out and see any sights.  Forget that she didn't allow them to have playdates and sleepovers.  It all hinged on those cards; I couldn't forgive her.  She, on the other hand, seemed very proud of this fact as she dedicated a whole chapter to this scene, aptly named \\"The Birthday Card.\\"<br /><br />To read more, check out my full review on [...].

1594203334|3.0|I wasn't sure about taking parenting advice from a woman who gave her husband a threesome for his fortieth birthday but what the heck (by the way, read her article on that subject; it's rather hilarious: [...].)<br /><br />The book is a good read and I recommend it if you're interested in seeing how the Parisians raise their young.  While I certainly didn't take everything to heart, I did enjoy reading how those skinny French bitches put themselves first, always.  They take care of themselves:  physically, emotionally and sexually (as in, they still have sex and seem to enjoy it).  Some of their parenting philosophies definitely resonated with me.  First, they use free play to stimulate their young ones, as opposed to flashcards, listening to Mozart or taking as many classes as a toddler's schedule will allow.  This made me smile as I am loathe to partake in any class that makes me sing \\"The Wheels on the Bus.\\"  Also, I like the notion of letting our kids explore their world with a little more freedom and independence.  How much harm can a kid do in a big grassy field?<br /><br />Check out my full review of this book at  [...].  This is my blog about my quest to enjoy motherhood, as right now it sort of sucks.  I was hoping to get some good tips from the French and the book did deliver, in part...
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I won't repeat what the others have already posted in detail about this book being horrid.  Believe it, it is horrid.  Put \\"flower\\" \\"maidenhead\\" \\"pay your debts\\" \\"whore\\" etc in a random play word processor and you get this book.  Honestly, I suffered through book one thinking \\"OK, it is exposition for the series\\" and book 2 and 3 backed that up, good payoff.  Book 4, trainwreck.  Standing alone, I wouldn't go on to book 5.  Reading the reviews with book 5, obviously that is the opinion of a majority of readers.<br /><br />Don't start this series, there is no payoff.  Waste of time and money.<br /><br />Believe the negative reviews, don't believe the positive reviews from the fanboys.  Plenty of better selections out there.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I downloaded this app for my 8 y/o son but I'm playing the game more than he is.  Loads of fun!
B0086700CM|4.0|I hate when they say temple slippery when wet what kind of joke is that who cares if its slippery say slip and slide or something but its a good game better than brave and a good time killer. The store requires temple money while running. NOT real money
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you enjoyed \\"Hunger Games\\", you will definitely like \\"Catching Fire\\". The author continues the saga and the entire book reads very quickly (and I am Not a fast reader!).
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Im mean games are fun for a second...get boring affter a while...its a great time consumer though :) Overalll it was good for being free!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this is really fun and it never gets old best game on my kindle LOVE IT and is only 99 cents great deal!

B0086700CM|5.0|the best pass time of all time. you will have a great time and you will learn how to escape evil monkey things of death.
0375869026|5.0|This book is required reading for my daughter's new middle school. Beyond that, however, this is a wonderfully written and perfect book not only for kids entering middle school but for all kids and adults. Not only does it cover the story of Auggie and his image, but it applies to all people as they try to fit in and be accepted in the world. There is so much to this book that words fail me. Just do yourself, or a child in your life, a favor, and get it and read it.
B00365EVWE|5.0|I receive the item before the date, which is good. But after open the package, I found some flaws. The workmanship of the earphones is not pleasant. The quick manual was supposed to support different languages, but all of different sections are English. This made me to doubt whether this is a counterfeit product. And what make it more doubtful is someone said this seller is not an authorized dealer. But after several days listening, I am sure this is authentic. I don't believe a fake one can produce such decent sound for a pair of $45 earphones.
030758836X|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read this year...so far. Very good from beginning to the surprising end.
B000001GS0|5.0|Jochum recorded sets with the BPO and LPO.  The sound on the latter is superior but I do not find this a major problem. In the LPO I like most #s 2 and 4, especially the exposition repeat in #2/1. He recorded three great #4s, the  third w/ the Dresden Staatskapelle. I think that #s 3 and 4 suit him a bit more than 1 and 2.  His most passionate performance in either set is the BPO #3/1 on which he lavishes an explosive opening.  He paces and mines the depth of #4 perfectly in both<br />sets, but I find the #3s analogous to Bohm's inspired and unequalled BPO #s 1 and 2.<br /><br />My chief reservation concerns the first movement of #1, which is a bit too slow for me, especially cf that of Bohm/BPO + Munch and Van Beinum. The final three movements are exemplary, but I still prefer Bohm's explosive fourth movement.<br /><br />Peers #1  Bohm/BPO, Van Beinum/RCO, Munch/BSO<br />  #2  Bohm/BPO, Munch/BSO, Szell/Cleveland<br />  #3  Beinum/RCO, Szell, Bohm/VPO (his earlier 50s version, not his 70s version<br />  #4  Bohm/VPO, Munch/BSO, Szell/Sony,Klemperer/EMI
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fantastically fun and so worth it because it's free!! So much adventure but no cost at all! I highly reccomend this app.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Great movie and item.. Item came very quickly and was just what I expected.  Great movie for the kids or kids from 1 to 92 as they say.  Thanks again!!!
B00845PV16|2.0|I'm a Cage fan,<br />and i feel compelled to say that even he doesn't save this mediocre production...<br />Poor acting across the board, predictable plot,<br />supernatural powers should be awesome, but instead they came out unconvincing and not believable in this one, almost as a farce...<br />not worth $3.99, maybe $0.50
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best app in the world!!! every minigame was really fun and it brought back memories of old games I used to play such as air hockey
B004SBX112|1.0|Never getting ad free games again. This was a total ripoff and just took all the non-angry birds ads out. Havnt  even seen the full page sds ive been doing this for such a short time. Barely works and doesnt do what i want it to do. Does anybody know how to get money back?
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game... but it can get really old... but that's OK because everything does!!!!<br />I sugest this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B0086700CM|5.0|I played this game for 3 hours straight! I love beating my high score and unlocking new cheracters! soooooooo addictive:D
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I love it get some pictures pick them then draw,Color, write and anything else have fun drawing on someone and have a fun time laughing its a great app to do something when your bored I LOVE IT!! :)
B0071XO8RA|2.0|It's not good.  The villain is more of a cartoon than a character, the main characters are flat, and (worst of all for science fiction) the ideas aren't very interesting.<br /><br />A lot of reviews talk about how there aren't even that many spelling or grammar errors, almost like a non-self-published book!  Seriously, is that the measuring scale that we're using?  This book is decent for a self-published book.  But there's a whole lot of very good books that you could be spending your money and time on instead, as I wish I had.<br /><br />You've definitely failed me this time, amazon ratings.  I wanted to like this book, given that it has (right now) a 4.9 star average.  But that number is way out of whack.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|This was a random purchase for me - I mostly listen to older music but like to try out new stuff. I knew the artist only for the Dog days are Over, but never thought the Ceremonials would have so many good songs. If you are looking for something unique and worth the cost of an entire album, give this a shot.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Very fun, but it's a lot like the \\"New Super Mario Bros.\\" game. Otherwise it's lots of fun! My friends and I play this game a lot.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I don't necessarily love how political Springsteen's music has become, but I think this is his best modern album. The Rising and Working on a Dream both had 1 or 2 memorable songs, but that was it. Wrecking Ball only has 1 or 2 songs I DON'T love, and the album has a whole only grows on you. If you are an avid Springsteen fan or even just a casual listener, Wrecking Ball is worth the purchase.
B0087240Z4|3.0|I was going to write something long and drawn out here, but instead I have decided to just cut to the chase.<br />\\"Oceania\\", the latest Smashing Pumpkins record and first since their justly maligned 2007 comeback disaster \\"Zeitgiest\\" is about what you would want from the Smashing Pumpkins in the year 2012. Despite Corgan's insistence that the record does not play like any previous Pumpkins records, really this is the record the band should have released following \\"Mellon Collie\\" if they wanted to continue their arena filling response. The guitars are loud, the ballads melodic and stately, the songs are peppered occasionally with electronic undercurrents. The lyrics are occasionally embarrassing but most of the time perfectly acceptable, and while many people may get angry that this is really NOT the Smashing Pumpkins (though the only band where that complaint makes less sense to me is Nine Inch Nails as, on record, Corgan was always really the Smashing Pumpkins), the band here sounds tight and fluid.<br />So why three stars? Even though a few songs on the record really stand out, too much of it simply bleeds together. It's a good listen for sure with only few embarrassing moments (am I the only one who thinks \\"Wildflowers\\" is really terrible?) but never really rises above background noise to me.<br />So, if you are a Smashing Pumpkins fan from back in the day you will enjoy this record. It's a rare return record that doesn't just get by on the warm feelings you once had for the band. Newcomers, however, I think would be better off starting with \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie\\" as they provide better bang for your buck overall.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the reading plans and that you can share scriptures on facebook. this app also helps you read the Bible in a year.  my whole family uses it!
B0029LHWFO|1.0|The longer this two bit dictator stays in the oval office the more we learn about the man! There is just too much inconsistency in the book (aside from the drug use)which makes the readers head spin. His stepfather never fought the Dutch and was never a pow under the British. This is just one instance. There are several more. This whole book is a lie!!!!<br />Oh yeah, if Amazon does not post this review so much for the First Amendment.
B007MDB71O|5.0|When I first went to see this I didn't expect much just really liked the trailer. My girlfriend even wanted to see a different movie. Well I got her to see it anyway. Well after about 30 minutes she looked over at me an was like \\"ok, this movie is pretty awesome, good pick\\". We loved it. It's a thrill ride, with a interesting story, an just keeps you wanting more. They also picked the perfect actor for john carter. He plays thepart great. Definitely worth buying an all ages will love it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I can't say enough about this book!  It was a great great read!  I could not put it down!  Not only was the book great it also turned me into an Avett Brothers fan.  I just saw them in concert and it was amazing.  This book is great at well as the sequel.<br />Buy it!!!!
B007P3TMW2|2.0|Sandra Bullock and tom Hanks out act the rest of the cast. This makes you watch the movie yearning for more Sandra and Tom. Besides the kid is written just way too weird!Don't waste your time, buy Flight 93, it is the best made regarding that September day.
B0086700CM|1.0|This game is awful but u just run and collect coins while being chased by un reulistic skull monkeys. I guess if ur in the ages 4-8 u might like it but really ur just running.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Lots of easy courses for noobs, but even more challenging courses and some cool powerups. Very smooth and pretty app as wl, even on old hardware<br />Evo 4G
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book is a great way to help you start thinking about money and the world around you a little differently, just enough to open possibilities in your head.<br /><br />Well worth the read!
B005LZYL3G|5.0|Got this for my husbands birthday and he couldn't have been more excited ! It was really interesting and although I've always liked pearl jam watching this made me love them ! My BFF that watched it with us ended up being stuck on listening to more pearl jam too. If you thought you were a fan before this just wait till you've seen it ! Awesome !
0345803485|4.0|I read the reviews before I bought the book which was suggested to me by a co-worker.  [I must say that some of the reviews, howbeit negative, where well phrased and intelligently written].  However, I took a chance and bought the first of the trilogy anyway.  I just finished it.  I have to first say that initially and repeatedly, this book was disturbing on a number of levels.  Anastasia, who was in her early to mid 20's and a recent college graduate, often sounded and acted like a teenager.  I wanted to scream at her to kick him to the curb.  She would say something about him that was dreamy and fantasy-like and I found myself thinking \\"what the heck?\\"  I thought that even at her age, with the type of roommate she had, and her mother's four marriages (don't want to give too much away), that Anastasia would have been a little bit more \\"aware\\" of what relationships entail or what was/is acceptable and what wasn't.  Often her reaction to Christian was like an obsessive crush.  I haven't experience anything like that since the Beatles came to America.  And even at 14, I wouldn't have taken crap from Paul, at least not for long.  Then there was Christian.  Actually, I found him a little more believable despite his appetites.  Even his mercurial moods were not completely unbelievable.  So I would guess my most difficult relationship was with Anastasia.  Just for the record, Kate got on my nerves also.<br /><br />Now to tell you why I liked the book and will, at least, read Book Two.  The ending redeemed Anastasia for me, and I won't say anymore about that.  Christian is the one that held my attention.  Despite his mercurial moods, they held my interest.  I wanted to know, and kept reading to find out, what was behind all of \\"this.\\"  He gave off, at least to me, a facade that I believed shaded a deep and fearful past teaming with situations too painful and/or repulsive for him to face or share with Anastasia.  I felt a mystery was about to be unveiled and didn't want tomiss the drama and explanation.  I even began to develop my own theories about the why and how.  I could be entirely off base here and I guess I'll find out in the next few days as I read Book Two.<br /><br />I can't say that I disagree with the negative reviews, yet there was something that held me to the end of the book.  I finished the book last night and, frankly, want to read the second book to find out what happens next.  Wish me luck!
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is a very good run game! it is addictive fast paste and fun. everyone. of all age's will enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is the best game ever. I hate all the people that say that it is boring because i cant stop playing it is the best!!!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game has few controls and a lot to do like sommon strong allies and fight waves of enemies after enemies
B0086700CM|3.0|i was realy exited for this app. but it is sort of choppy when you run(on kindle fire) i think if it was fixed it would be 5 stars.
1475143389|5.0|The awesome thing about this book is that it basically covers everything you need to know to remove fat and put on lean weight. From top to bottom everything is covered in order to cover myths and the right way to do things. Also, the author is definitely genuine about wanting to help others. I had a special case for the diet being a vegetarian and I e-mailed him about it and got a personal reply with everything I needed to know. Overall this is a really well written book that addresses every misconception about modern body-building from an author who really cares about helping others.
B0018LMKIK|5.0|If you are a young lad or lass, you probably have never heard of CCR unless, you heard these tunes from you parents. But this group rocked on in the late 60's early 70's and they brighten and \\"enlightened\\" the young people of that era, and these young people were able to pass on to their children this great gift such as mine did to me. No critic should ever  be listen to or read about when they put down an artist or artists, when all these artists do is make music for the throngs of listeners and not for these snooty so called \\"professionals\\". Many of these had put down CCR for many reasons and never gave a chance to great songs like \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\", \\"It Came Out Of The Sky\\", \\"Feelin' Blue\\", which make your blood feel alive and you are ready to do \\"anything\\" in the good sense of the word. Listening to these and all of their well known songs such as \\"Fortunate Son\\", \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", \\"Traveling Band\\", and \\"Hey Tonight\\", as all the others will put you in a great mood because all of them are really good and there are  really no bad songs, all of them are great to listen. This cd's compilation of music is a great start, so give CCR a chance and you will not regret it.
B005LAIGLE|2.0|Anazon always puts me in touch w/ new movies and books. I was disappointed in this movie and the mundane story line.  Mark Wahlburg is so much better than this Grade B presentation of the underworld of drugs and crime. The excitment never happens and no intrigue in this plot.  Hoping for a better selection next time.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love temple run honestly. With Apple it doesn't really make mistakes and isn't so glitchy. With the kindle fire I mean its so glitchy. Also when you see how many miles you run it goes less miles than apples with or without coins. So please update!!!
B008ASLK8A|1.0|As a fan of RDJR i have to say, that he is the worst person to play this part.  Sherlock is not Iron Man with an English accent.  P.S  rob, if you ever read this review, and we are working on a movie together, please note:  i love your Iron man, and your Chaplin... and your Tropic Thunder... so accept, deep down, that SH was just not your bag, baby.<br /><br />WLmShakespeare (im not)
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. I found it very difficult to put it down. I could not wait to read the next two books in the series.
B0086700CM|4.0|there does seem to be some lag especially when going around corners. but that just makes me want to try it again!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This amazing and simple application is easy to navigate through, and is beautiful. The app is simple (it shows up in your notofication bar to easily check how much percent you have left, and the app itself does not exceed a huge size so it should be what your looking for. Its simple, and trustworthy. Some other features this app has it that it shows you running apps that drain your battery, a graph, and the temperature of your device, the health, voltage, and technology. The app is simple and exactly what I was looking for. All I wanted was to see the percent, which was in the notofication bar, the temperature, which was there, and battery health. and this app got five stars in my book.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I always thought that a diet would be grueling.  Well this plan isn't at all.  I don't like to think of it as a diet either.  It's a way of life, and it's working.  All I can say is, try it.  You have nothing to loose but fat!
1469984202|5.0|I'll admit that I am an avid sci-fi fan, but Wool goes way way WAY past that label. This is a story about people are, first and foremost. I would catch myself daydreaming about the book constantly, all through the day. I felt trapped in the silo the entire time I was reading it. I've bought multiple copies of this book just to give to people. I cannot recommend it harder.
B00884GR0W|4.0|this app is really fun, and if is just like minecraft!!!!!!!!!! this is a pretty fun app i highly recommend  it
1608191664|5.0|This book is not only informative but easy to read.  The material is not necessarily the most complex and one might often find themselves thinking, oh, I knew that--but Chang is great at articulating complex subject matter for the layman.  I recommend the book.  The seller was honest and it arrived on time.

0553386794|1.0|I only made it about 2/3rds through the book before I just couldn't stand reading about these horrible characters anymore.  I have never read a book with such a despicable caste of characters.  The characters who weren't evil were just so ignorant that I despised them equally.  I actually liked the writing and the plot generally, but just can't spend another minute reading about these horrible people.

B005LAIHY0|3.0|3 Star Film. 1 Star if you've seen and are a fan of the Alien franchise. 5 Stars if you've never seen the Alien films.<br />Superb visuals. Acting was decent to very well, in my opinion. Story was my main issue. This is set in the Alien universe, years before the first film, but this creates the issues mostly due to problems with the production staff. Ridley Scott was trying to make a not too direct prequel to Alien. However, the head writer, Damon Lindelof, was trying to expand the universe with whole new characters and a whole new franchise that wouldn't go anywhere near Aliens and Ellen Ripley. Basically a spinoff franchise. You combine these two visions and you get Prometheus. A disappointment for Alien fans (as I will discuss below) and a decent sci-fi film for those who have never seen Alien and its sequels. I will go on to say, however, whether an Alien fan or a new viewer, this film does have an ominous ending leaving old and new questions unanswered on purpose for hopes of a definite sequel.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />This was a complicated movie as it raised hopes for those of us who have seen the Alien franchise and eager to see this supposed prequel to explain the origins of the Alien. However, it didn't quite do that. As my post title says, this movie created more questions than it answered. This movie goes off in a tangent explaining supposedly who/what created the aliens and mankind itself, but there are just too many problems. First off, it doesn't really tell us where the Alien came from. Supposedly, some say the Engineers made them, indirectly, as some sort of biological weapon. Indirectly because if the engineers ingest the black spore liquid, they literally start dissolving. Other creatures are mutated into killing machines, such as the worms or maggots in the room with the Giant head turning into the snake like hammerpedes, or the geologist turning into some sort of hills have eyes super strong punk monster. Holloway, however, only had a very low dose of the black spore liquid so it was slowly killing him and mutating him. His mutated sperm was somehow able to impregnate a sterile woman, with what turns out to be some sort of facehugger, which attachs to an engineer and has some sort of xenomorph pop out of his chest, possibly an ancestral precursor to the familiar aliens as it does not fully have all their characteristics. This would make some sense if it wasn't for the plot hole of the biologist and the geologist looking at a mural in the room with the giant head of what is obviously an Alien that looks exactly like the ones from the original films. Why would the Engineers have a mural of the familiar Alien if it has never been encountered before (if you follow the process the movie has that I outlined above)? And why would they have a mural of it anyway, like it's some sort of god to them or something? Scott says if they make a sequel and it is successful, its successor (a third movie) would be the direct link between these new movies and the original Alien. Unless Lindelof is involved. He says if Scott and the studios want to work with him, they have to move the new franchise away from the old. I think this guy trying to sabotage the Alien prequel is more intense than the entire movie. I hope Ridley Scott and James Cameron get beck to trying to make a fifth Alien movie with each other. That would have to be great.

B003B2C92G|4.0|From 1995 to 1998 comics had a great time. We were blessed with wonderful comic books like xmen, spiderman, gen 13, and Spawn. For me, Spawn was at the top of my list cause, it was dark, twisted and deeply imaginative. Then came the spawn movie and this changed the world forever. We no longer wanted to see our heroes on paper: we wanted to see them on screen.  I think this caused comics to sure die out, and the guys that were reading the comics, wanted to put these characters on the big screen. Spawn was great, but there was something left out of the translation for me, probably because it wasn't r rated. It had to be pg13 to reach a broader audience, but it still worked. But we were not ready for that yet. Blade is the only comic movie that took that r rated risk and it worked. But now that spawn has been introduced to the world cinematicly and animated, mcfarlane should try again in rated r. I would love a retelling or a sequel. Just make sure its a gritty as the comic book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! Its hard to stop playing. I really don't want it to end. Cant wait to see what's next.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This movie was the start of a batman revolution.  Nobody realized it until the dark knight came out, but we knew begins was something special. If you read the comic book you know this was as close to batman as its ever gonna get. Hes an invisible ninja that stalkes his prey and picks them off one by one. His attacks are one hit  knockouts that lay yo ass out for hours. I like christian bale as batman I just don't like the way he sounds or the way his head looks in the batsuit. His head is too round and his voice sounds so forced. But on the other hand hes very intense, he takes his character seriously, and understands how to portray both batman and bruce. Matter fact this was the first batman movie where I was just as interested in seeing bruce as seeing batman. I think all the other characters were casted perfectly and they all play there parts very well. I also love the dark, gritty, small city atmosphere in the movie, so as to leave room for a bigger city in the sequel. I love this version of batman and your a fool if you don't love it or appreciate it.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|First off i am not very familiar with the offsprings full discography yet but this was the first full album by them that i have bought and man is it amazing. I listen to music all around the board from The Who,The beatles, Sonic Youth, Fugazi,The Stooges, Iron Maiden, Sex pistols. and punk is something that i personally love having bought The germs and sex pistols only album and the first fugazi record. I dont get it though when people say this isnt punk.....because in a way it sounds like punk to me. i am a guitar player too i have the tab book along with the greatest hits tab book and im sure it plays just like punk so.....whats the deal? i mean sure some of the songs are popish ( She's Got Issues,Why Dont You Get a Job) but songs like Have You Ever, End of The Line, Pay The Man,Americana(best example i think) and even Walla Walla sound like punk to me. Anyway the music is great there isnt a song i dont enjoy except that i have heard Pretty Fly For a White Guy, The Kids Arnt Alright, and Why Dont You Get a Job way too many times. Some of the voices such as the \\"Welcome\\" intro done by John Mayer i found entertaining also the Pretty Fly For a White Guy (reprise) was funny. Besides the music i like the concept of the album which is talking about how the american dream can go wrong or the lifestyle can be flawed. If you disagree with my opinion that at times this album is a punk album tell me why.
0345803485|2.0|So I felt for it.  I wanted to know what the fuzz is about and I realized the only reason this book is selling so well is because everyone keeps buying it thinking is going to be a good read.  Please do yourself a favor and buy it used.  I finished it, then started the second book; however, I loss interest since it was becoming redundant and quite frankly... annoying (inner goddess?).
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Thought this was such a fun movie.  I think it is completely an opinion. If you go and see with that idea it will be fun.  Russell Brand had some funny spots.  Yes there was some really corny spots...but so what it was fun!
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to use and can get addicting.  I love playing even when notnconnected to Internet...it has the ability in the app to run without Internet.
B007P6VLR8|2.0|...the fact that the vinyl version does not come with a free download card or link. That averages to two stars overall.<br /><br />Firstly the music. Overall, it's pretty good but nothing special. All this talk about \\"return to form\\" or \\"best album since Mellon Collie\\" is balderdash, but I am also willing to admit that I will probably need 3-5 attentive listens for things to properly sink in (the best since Mellon Collie is the criminally underrated Machina 1). This record falls in line with the 2 and a half previously released Teargarden EPs-decent, but not outstanding and nowhere near as good as the prior catalog. Nicole Fiorentino does stand out with some excellent bass playing (if it is in fact her; the long standing rumor is that Billy plays all of the instruments except drums on the recordings)-I was taken aback by how prominent in the mix and skillfully played the bass is on this record. But where this record really suffers-as do the other Teargarden EPs-is in the lack of Jimmy Chamberlin. I'm sorry and no disrespect to Mike Byrne (who does a commendable job here), but Jimmy's distinctly frenetic, loose, and jazzy playing is a key component to the Pumpkins sound. I expect this record to get better and more rewarding with repeated listens, but my first impressions hint that this will not be classic Pumpkins record in the long run.<br /><br />Now onto this whole vinyl/mp3 issue. Every major new vinyl purchase I've made this year (Garbage's Not Your Kind Of People, Sigur Ros' Valtari, Anathema's Weather Systems, and Storm Corrosion's self-titled album as a few of many examples), as well as most in the recent past years, comes with some sort of card or code by where you can download the corresponding record for your mp3 player free of charge. When I go digging through bins at stores, I notice big stickers plastered on the vast majority of newly released vinyl of bands I don't even care about that indicate this feature as well. It's a reasonable assertion that theinclusion of a free download with a vinyl purchase was becoming something of an industry standard. So why not with this record? I'm really annoyed and disappointed with this, and would give zero stars to this aspect if I could (averaging one and a half stars for the record overall, rounded down to one star to conform to Amazon's rating system). I very likely would have never purchased the $27 (after shipping) vinyl copy (especially now knowing how mediocre the music is) and simply purchased the $5 (as of this writing) download instead-the $22 is now a sunk cost to me. Now I'm forced to do one of three things: 1) Attempt to rip the vinyl, but that's far too much work for a substandard product, 2) Acquire the mp3s illicitly, which I don't plan to do as I don't steal online, or 3) very begrudgingly pay the additional money for the mp3 copy, which I see as a veiled form of price gouging. The vinyl presentation itself is beautiful (a thick cardboard gatefold and 180g heavyweight vinyl) and sounds fantastic, but man I am not happy about essentially being forced to buy the album twice in order to enjoy it anywhere besides my home stereo.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|Here's the deal with this book, spoiler-free: it's a Star Trek parody about how the unimportant characters always get killed off. The prologue is hysterical. After that, it's pretty funny as long as it's doing its Star Trek parody thing. Where it starts to lose steam is when it gets meta (I'm not going to go into this, because I don't want to ruin anything for anyone). Given what the author was doing, there was no way to avoid this, and it's still a fairly entertaining (and often funny) novel even after it eases off the parody and begins to tell its own story. My only real critique is that the book should have ended when the story ended. It didn't. Instead, there are three \\"Codas\\" following the end of the main story. They lose all of their sense of humor and try to get serious about a novel that had been entirely tongue-in-cheek. They don't work and all and a novel that could have ended on a light, fun note (as the main story did) instead ends with three consecutive bellyflops.<br /><br />Still, it's not enough to ruin the book, which was overall pretty darn enjoyable. It's a very, very quick read. You'll finish it in an afternoon or two. In the end, if you enjoy Star Trek or just want to read some less-serious science fiction, Redshirts is a good bet. It's not great but it's good enough that I will be reading some of Scalzi's other books.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The sample that was delivered to my Kindle was PG rated, the book that arrived was XXX. Don't wasted your money on this trash.
B006O6F932|5.0|This is much bigger and much heavier than I expected it to be. It is packed full of accessories which you seem to pay per piece for otherwise. It comes with desks and lockers and creepateria tables, all around a fabulous set that any Monster High fan will absolutely LOVE! Amazon's price with free shipping cant be beat so be sure to pay attention to who the actual sellers are. I am getting very disgusted with the gauging that goes on with third party sellers. You expect to pay premiums on ebay not here.<br /><br />I hope that other buyers will rate the product and not the price that they may have paid with someone other than Amazon because it is not fair to the product. Most people just look at the stars and move along and I have seen a lot of Monster High items that are getting terrible stars and only becuase the reviewer felt ripped off. Yes the price is high but so are Barbie Dream Houses, you get what you pay for in this case. I also recommend the Coffin Bean for $34.99, it comes with Clawdeen and a bunch of furniture! So for around $100.00 you or your princess can Ghoul out in style!~
0061692042|1.0|Admittedly, I have read (according to my Kindle) 34% of this book which I hoped might at some point become at least interesting.  It is well written and I guess some of the glowing reviews were submitted by those who appreciate repetition and exhausting detail told well.  I revisited these reviews in the hopes that possibly somewhere downstream there may be a shift of gears promising some emergence of character or events but there appears to be just more boring prose in the remaining 66%.  Thank you for those who have spared me the journey.  This book is boring on boring and I am glad that I only wasted the Kindle price.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|Like my review title says, this little app does just about EVERYTHING you could want from a timer/alarm clock app....especially if you add the GPS add-on.  The design is well thought out for an application that needs to be basic in core uses, yet provide a rich extension of customized settings and advanced features (e.g. the math-problem solving snooze feature).  Good stuff!  Try the free version, then once you see how great it is, support this type of creation by buying the paid version.  The ads in the free version are so non-intrusive, so tossing some cash to the developer is the best reason to upgrade.
1610454812|5.0|With all the previous reviews i can't really add anything except to say, if you want to read a story about sincerity, triumph of the human spirit and the inability to quit, read this book.<br />Yes it's about SEALs, but it's about SO much more. It's also laced with christianity which put me off at first but it's done compassionately and objectively and while it didn't make me consider christianity, it DID make me more aware of the strength and weakness of my spirit.<br /><br />It's a great story about a person we who did what we all want to do... be the best we can be.

0765316994|3.0|There are books that you read, and while the book itself was fun and enjoyable, you get to the end and get a little bit of an emotional sucker punch. And sometimes that's just what you want. Other times, you find yourself wishing that the emotional core might have occupied more of the landscape.<br /><br />Scalzi's Redshirts is one of those books. It's fluffy, it's funny, it wallows in the meta, and at the tale's end, there's a little bit of emotion pinging your heart. I'm not sure if it worked fully for me. I really enjoyed the three codas, and the strongest characterisation of the book occurs in them, but like an earlier Scalzi novel, Agent to the Stars, the emotional right turn feels at odds with the rest of the book's breezy, assuredly light but confident tone.<br /><br />Truth be told, I prefer Scalzi when his humor is sublimated a little bit further into the story. I prefer Old Man's War, Ghost Brigades, Last Colony, and Zoe's Tale to his more light-hearted fare like Agent and Android's Dream. But I did heartily enjoy his reading of the first chapter while on tour in Seattle, and when it came out, it was an auto-buy. His send-up of the Star Trek tropes was amusing and if you're looking for nothing more than that, you'll probably be quite satisfied. I was still pretty entertained over-all, even if this isn't climbing into my favourites' shelf anytime soon.

B0071XO8RA|1.0|I like many others bought this book based on all the \\"reviews\\" it had. Here we go...<br /><br />The first short story is actually pretty good and it hooks you really fast. You want to know what happens next badly. Then you make it to next short story and find all the interesting things to have vanished. Literally gone, without a trace at all. This book is boring and redundant. Its the same old song and dance that are many other books of all genres and I've personally seen them done better than this. This is a horrible book that should not cost money. The author should have left it as one short story. The beginning is powerful, amazing and beautiful. The rest is drivel that was cobbled together to make money.

B004K00NEO|5.0|Great film for both kids and adults. The blu-ray transfer is really high quality. The 2D animation jumps right off the screen and the 5.1 Dolby digital surround sound is terrific. The voice acting is top notch (Robin Williams kept us rolling with laughter) with a nice story that carries a good message. All in all, a great buy all for under 10 bucks. If your looking to add another animated title to your collection, don't wait, buy this you'll be glad you did.

0812550706|5.0|There it is, right out of Isaiah. Did Card have that passage in mind? In Ender's Game the human military machine certainly used childish innocence as a weapon. No cynicism or doubt to get in the way of the killer instinct built into our DNA. Surely, Isaiah meant the child will lead us after the Lion lies down with the Lamb, but perhaps only after we have defeated \\"The Enemy\\". Ender Wiggin is kin to Paul Atreides in Dune, never to know the life of a child, born to deadly responsibility beyond his years and destined to cause the deaths of billions. The Wiggin children exhibit childish emotions but their intellectual abilities point to a possible further  stage of human evolution. As with all Science Fiction there must be a mechanism, technology or something mysteriously powerful to make the story work. Star Trek has \\"warp\\" and \\"teleportation\\". Star Wars has \\"The Force\\". Ender's Game has \\"Little Dr.\\", a molecular disruptor and \\"ansible\\", unlimited range instant communication. The story makes clever use of Relativity, sending people off at high light speed fractions for a few years so they can return many years in the future. I liked the writing style and written dialogue. I was made to really care about how the characters felt and how they formed their motives. Most important Ender's Game has a nice tight story arc that makes a lot of sense and is fun to read.
B007VTVGAQ|3.0|Fiona has always been quirky, but her music has just gotten a little weird. I did like the different direction Extrordinary Machine took, but this takes that to a whole new level and it's just too over the top artsy and weird to be special to me. There are probably 3 or 4 tracks I can listen to and enjoy. \\"Anything We Want\\" is the stand out track to me. It has a catchy groove. Her other albums are better in my opinion, though I will say that her song writing and lyrics are exceptional.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|We used Word 2010 to make both kindle and print books as described in the this Building Your Book for Kindle. If you have only text and no illustrations this works just fine. But if you have the problems with a large megabyte book with graphics and pictures as described in the comments by Barry Krusch above, then Word is a pain. Even for straight text books Word is a pain and gives buggy translation to mobi.<br /><br />I have not worked with my books in Dreamweaver but after extensive trials with everything from Mobipocket Creator to caliber and Sigil i finally settled on Adobe InDesign with the Amazon plugin as giving the best most faithful translation to the mobi format. You can use Look Inside to see the result here http://www.amazon.com/Isis-Reality-fragile-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B007LCPNQ6/ and here http://www.amazon.com/Athena-enough-Egypt-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B007LCPW1W/.<br /><br />You get incredible control over formatting in one step and it is easy to do corrections in InDesign and repeatedly translate the book to mobi with no sweat and a one button click until you get it right.<br /><br />Why keep fighting MS Word's bulky translation to html when there is a much easier way once you get used to it. I follow the Smashword's Nuke'm design guide on how to set up your file for ebooks (Amazon's guide wasn't out yet)and it works just great. Lately we write the book in Word in book format so we can see the final print layout as we write. The days of the double spaced manuscript in letter format and Courier Font is long dead and has gone the way of the typewriter.<br /><br />Then we import the final Word manuscript file to Indesign and make the ebook. The learning curve for using InDesign is steep and not for the fainthearted especially if you only have worked in Word and you will be googleing constantly in the beginning as Adobe have their own lingo for everything, very frustrating. But once you learn it, it goes quickly.<br /><br />You now have the advantage that with an extra days work you can format the ebook to print format.  We put in headers (page numbers etc), change the space before on the H1 style and we have the print book ready to convert to a pdf file you can upload to createspace giving you total control over layout, fonts etc.<br /><br />Talk about easy production for the single author.extra days work you can format the ebook to print format.

1416972250|4.0|This book was one thrill of a ride.<br /><br />There was the action, and the romance, and the loss, and the puzzles solved, and the tying things up together. (For those of you who don't know, Cassandra Clare originally intended The Mortal Instruments to be a trilogy, but after publishing City of Glass, she decided to extend it to add three more books.) Everything that I love in a book.<br /><br />But there just seems to be one key element missing. That feeling of exhilaration, that feeling of contentment that seeps into my bones. Where was it?<br /><br />Cassandra Clare's world is undoubtedly unique. I love the idea of Shadowhunters. I love the angels and demons and vampires and werewolves and faeries and warlocks. The plot in these books was mind-gripping, nerve-wracking. The characters were adorable and caught the attention of thousands of readers.<br /><br />But Cassandra's writing is not enchanting. The world she has created is too simple. There were few plot twists. The problems that Valentine imposes are too easily fixed. Where is the ingenuity of a bestselling author? Where are the little details that escape the reader who later realizes that those were essential to the plotline? Where is that captivating feeling that only the best have mastered?<br /><br />I'm being harsh, I know. But I had incredibly high expectations for this last book in the trilogy (before it was extended). I had hoped-no, expected-that Cassie Clare would have made this last book epic and unforgettable. But alas, no.<br /><br />All the same, City of Glass was still a good book-but only good. The characters had developed even further, I'll give her that. The action had increased. The plot was slightly more complex.<br /><br />But all I can think about is how this fell way below my expectations. And I feel just incredibly disappointed.<br /><br />Source: copy borrowed from library

Hamilton weaves a tale that travels through time  so effortlessly that the transition is flawless. I enjoyed the history of Salem so perfectly intertwined with the story. I thought it was a brilliant read, and would recommend it to anyone who likes a great story with a little bit of magic. It kept me up late so I could finish it. Bravo Rebecca!
0765316994|3.0|Ah, redshirts. Any geek worth their salt knows about them -- random extras on \\"Star Trek\\" who die in almost every episode.<br /><br />But what if the redshirts knew that their fates were coming, and tried to stop it by whatever means necessary? That's the idea behind \\"Redshirts: A Novel with Three Codas,\\" John Scalzi's affectionate lampooning of sci-fi TV. It's a light, fluffy novel that touches on some philosophical ideas, but nothing too serious.<br /><br />In the 23rd century, Ensign Andrew Dahl is assigned to the Universal Union flagship Intrepid. It's a dream job for a xenobiologist, except that some of his new shipmates are acting a little strange.<br /><br />And soon he finds out why: the Intrepid has an incredibly high mortality rate. The captain, science officer, engineer, doctor and the handsome if dim Lieutenant Kerensky are never permanently injured, but low-ranking officers inevitably die messy, violent deaths. There's also a magic \\"box\\" that generates the answer to impossible problems.<br /><br />The widower of one \\"redshirt\\" has already figured out the answer -- a bizarre answer that calls into question the nature of reality itself. And with Dahl scheduled for an away mission, he and his fellow endangered officers will have to take drastic steps: go back in time to a parallel world, and find a way of stopping their problems in the 21st century.<br /><br />\\"Redshirts\\" is a fun idea for a story -- what if the disposable extras became aware of their doomedness, and tried to prevent it? There's a lot of metafictional twists and some contemplation of what reality is, but it never gets too heavy. It's a pleasantly light sci-fi story.<br /><br />It also has some fun with the scientific improbabilities of \\"Star Trek\\" and similar shows, although the world of the Intrepid is definitely much, much dumber than most (robots with harpoons!). And Scalzi inserts some rather un-\\"Star Trek\\"-like comedy at times, such as Kerensky (and his doppelganger) being deprived of their pants.<br /><br />However, it can get a bit confusing at times. And even now, I'm not entirely sure how you can time-travel into a reality controlling your own without that reality interfering in your plans. Scalzi... sort of explains it at the end, but also doesn't.<br /><br />None of the characters are very deeply developed or given much backstory, but I guess that makes sense since they are meant to be \\"extras\\" who have little development. Scalzi still manages to give them depth and texture that makes them likable, even doofs like Kerensky or the acid-tongued Duvall.<br /><br />\\"Redshirts\\" is a lightweight sci-fi adventure, but the gentle spoofery and humor make it a fun read.

B007UXTG8M|2.0|This movie didn't know if it wanted to be a melodrama or a porno flick.  It started off intriguing enough--a man with a serious sexual addiction that may lead to his undoing, but it ended up as just an idea.  We learn nothing about the man, or the problem that led to his being an addict or the fact that he can't seem to connect with women unless it's a one-night stand or they're women of the night.  Then when his sister enters the picture (and we know from her telephone calls that she's a problem) there's so much dysfunctional sexual tension between them that if it wasn't for the fact that they're actors playing the roles of siblings, it would be liable to creep you out.  And again, we learn nothing about their relationship, or why there's the heightened tension.  At one point he complains about always having to be her savior, but that simply isn't enough for the amount of tension in this film.<br /><br />If you want to see a lot of Fassbender's rump or member (which I'm sure was a prop) then rent away.  But this film is slow, and adding gratuitous sex scenes doesn't make it better.  And having the camera linger 45 seconds on a face (I counted) doesn't amp up the drama, it simply drags the film out.<br /><br />The trailer makes this film look a lot better than it is.  There is a reason this film don't go mainstream.  Next time I will wait until more than 23 people review a film.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|What a fantastic ride into sci-fi.  I've seen Avatar and Star Wars...and I really don't understand why critics say JC stole from these films.  Though I adore the Star Wars franchise, Cameron's Avatar was, in my opinion, a snooze-fest.  I NEVER understood the hype, but gave the movie kudos for the underlying moral lessons.  While watching John Carter, I never once thought of these other movies mentioned.  Instead, I felt I was watching an enjoyable romp that completely stands on its own.  John Carter's story is not only evolved and original, but humorous as well.  The pace of the movie is fast, the dialogue well-written and funny, and the John Carter character is a totally sympathetic hero.  A man who chooses to be alone, disillusioned by warring mankind, becomes the reluctant hero who is shoved into the ultimate quandry of Life: would one take up arms to fight for a cause?  We get to see John Carter's very determined struggle not to do so, but his compassion for Sola and the Princess, etc... get the better of him, and we get to watch a broken individual reach for Life and fight for it with the same stubborness he used to employ to remain alone in his existence.  Finding a way to get out of his messes and mistakes with humor and quick-thinking is way more reminiscent of Indiana Jones than any other science fiction movie.  All I can say is that the movie is well-made, fun to watch with the kiddos, and certainly stands on its own.  Critics be damned.  Don't they remember that movies are an escape for the audience.  While I'm a huge fan of Sophie's Choice, Schindler's List, and other movies with marvelous serious story-telling, sometimes I just need a little getaway, as well.  John Carter fills that escapism fun 100%.  Somebody buy these critics a bucket of popcorn and remind them that movies can be fun...and that this story was written well before Star Wars or Avatar.  If one were to read Out Of This Silent Planet by C.S. Lewis, one could find parallels, as well.  Stories have been recirculated since the beginning of time ~ and the story of John Carter incorporates these same themes we struggle with in our daily lives and see in other movies.  But what a wondrous and fun way to do so!!!  The critics can tear apart anything should they be so inclined, but shame on them for trying to bomb this movie!  It IS an adventurous original, written by Mr. Burroughs long before Luke Skywalker began his own story.  Have some sci-fi fun and enjoy John Carter.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|this app is awesome I really like it and it is super fun and easy to use the only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because it lets you look up its own pics by subject and it will give some random inappropriate pic every once and a while .  I looked up the word beach and it gave me a pic of some lady wearing a bathing suit with her buns sticking out at the end. but you can avoid this because it asks you if you want to look up ur pix on google and so that's wit I did and you can get some pretty good pox.
0739352989|5.0|I loved these three books. They were a great read and I loved the fact that I could start reading and 3 hours later put it down and not realize how long I had been reading.  E L James you really put out three excellent books and I am sad there are no more and wait in hopes you will write more books like this one.
B0086700CM|4.0|honestly if people are just gonna get all mad about how dumb they think this game is,  they need to shut up. yea so its not the best game in the world. It can be kinda glitchy but it didn't cost any money so what do u expect?  the get all mad about how you can buy things with actual money but it saysit right there in the description. and you need to just play the game to actually get the coins. so overall very fun and somewhat addicting
076115678X|4.0|This is a great book to support us curly heads!  I'm still working at accepting them 100%, but I'm getting there.  The dvd is so helpful, and the book is great to reference specific tips.  I liked it so much, I included it in a sketch: [...]
1466401885|1.0|I can't believe this book is so highly reviewed and got into top 100 list among all kindle books. The story was so unrealistic and the second half was just crazy. poker? gambler'gang? i have no idea why Abby is so attractive that every nice guy in school likes her. I also have no idea why Travis is so charming either. The whole flight club thing is not well-thought. Then when she starts dating parker, how is heaven can she still sleep with Travis? That is extremely unrealistic, and i don't even want to mention the diamond bracelet. The ending was just implausible. getting married? seriously, when you are 20 years old with a crazy violent and independent boyfriend? I think this book sends the wrong message and has really really poor plot management.<br />(Excuse my writing, not a great writer.)
0547569653|5.0|This was great!  Had the wonderful opportunity to meet him last night in Okemos, MI.  Great down to earth person with good tips, outlooks, and observations.  He was so pleasant to meet with and after spending several hours with over 250 people he was still upbeat and encouraging!  So enjoyed his book and meeting him!
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Our jazz station (90.7 in Durham, NC) had been playing Greg Porter's Be Good(Lion Song) in heavy rotation and at first I resisted liking it.  Usually I like more pure sound from jazz without any vocal inflection, but slowly I found myself singing the song and envisioning the narrative.  I could never catch any announcer identifying the artist so I used what I though was the title and googled it with \\"jazz\\".  That brought me to Porter's youtube content and there was the song!  I hated to cave and purchase an album for one song, but I wanted to play it for my wife and daughter because I thought it was so endearing.  Luckily for me Gregory Porter had made a great album's worth of music that could support the Lion's Song.  It still isn't my usual preference, but Be Good kicks off with four powerful cuts: Painted On Canvas-Be Good-On My Way Up to Harlem-Real Good Hands and rolls on up to Porter's version of God Bless the Child.  The album has a positive feel throughout, Porter's voice is a fine instrument, and the band takes great turns across the platter.  If you heard only one song from Be Good like I did you should feel confident that a purchase based on one song's merits can pay off in a great dividend of a record.
0099579936|1.0|Really, fan fiction based on Twilight series?  More like, I just got done watching the best sex movie, The Histoire d'O.  Maybe if I Americanize it I can be rich!!!  Guess it worked, 10 million copies of crap sold.
B007PVHANM|5.0|This was a great and informative documentary. I am only sad that they took out so much to get the movie to 2 1/2 hours (read that in an interview with the director). I would've gladly sat in the  theater for another half hour of looking into his life! This documentary gave me chills at some points and brought me to sadness in the end because we lost such an influential and great man. The only other disappointing thing is that I would've loved to see interviews from all his children...but it is still worth watching again!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome! I love it its amazing and addicting. I love to play it when I'm bored<br />everyone should have this game!<br /><br />~Roxas
0307279189|5.0|This book is in perfect condition. Also the package came before the expected date. I recommend this seller and recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about running, is new to running or/and an injured runner.
0439023521|5.0|The book in itself is imaginative and descriptively paints a picture of a grim world. There is action, romance, and imagery to amuse a reader for hours on end.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is great! I like how this is so EASY to use and it comes with a calender too. That is nice so when I go to work I have my work calender in front of me but I also have my Kindle Fire Color Note App so I don't have to bring my work calender from work to home. Thank you for taking time for reading my review. Thank You!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The first word that comes to mind is stunned. I'm stunned that something that is so incredibly bad can become a best seller. This writer is in dire need of a class or two or twelve in creative writing. Redundant descriptions, verb choices, and adjectives show how little about the craft this author truly knows. It's embarrassingly bad. It's not a surprise that this began as Twilight fan-fiction. When I was in college (I was an English major) there were a few students who were fan-fiction writers who wrote just like this. They all had the same problem: characters so boring because they were so perfect. Doesn't this writer know that it's the flaws that make the characters interesting?<br /><br />Don't get me started about the mental flaws that Christian Grey has. Those act more as a device to justify the character's actions instead of being a reflection of what someone who has suffered from abuse might actually be like.<br /><br />And Ana? As someone who was raised by strong women, grew up around strong women, and married one, I have to say that this character sets women back two hundred years. There's nothing real about her in the opposite way that there's nothing real about Christian, she's too screwed up to be real.<br /><br />I know that TV is lost because American love their trash \\"reality television\\" but dammit, don't pollute the literary world with this garbage!
B000N2HCM4|4.0|Growing up in such a dysfunctional family explains why the President has the views that he has. He definitely should not be considered to have an American view of our policies. He did not grow up in the US and does not understand our society at all. When he finally found something structured in Rev. Wright's church he attached himself to it. Unfortunately this is also filled with hate for US society rather than how to take advantage of opportunities and fit in.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is my favorite app by far i would pay 9.99 for this it has so many courses i play it everyday!

B004KKX80A|1.0|I am very dissapointed with this purchase. I had just opened the package and it was not Japanese packageing! Instead it came in the Europeian packageing and did not come with the right parts! It came with chinese verions of DF125, M, and F. Not to mention it also came with green and yellow energy rings! I am very disapionted and demanding a replacement!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have given it some hard things to find and for the most part it finds them and then I can enjoy them later. Pretty slick.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I think this is Rihanna's best cd to date.  I recommend it to everyone! It has DANCE TRACKS as well as slow jams.  Again, I would give it a 10 if I could.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am now addicted to Mahjong.  I have played Mahjong on my pc but on my Kindle Fire it has become a game I can't put down!  So simple and yet very challenging with wonderful displays, and trying to beat my own times, or just win a gold star! I also love the oriental style music and the little voice when I pair up tiles. Mahjong has become my go-to game so I haven't downloaded any others - I'm too busy with Mahjong.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved the plot, the writing, the characters. This book is a nice example of a great science fiction story, and will definitely become a classic. Can't wait to start reading the next one in the series.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|I feel like he cut past the theoretical stuff and got straight to what you need to be doing and how to do it. Easy read.
0345803485|3.0|Got the first book as a gift.  I admit I was curious when I read write-ups of the book and how it was being referred to as \\"mommy porn\\", the intrigue factor went up a bit.  My preference of erotica is a little more on the advanced side than most \\"mommies\\", therefore, main stream erotica, I really didn't hold out much hope for.  Honestly, I had a hard time getting into the story, it's pretty slow in the beginning but picked up towards the end.  As one reviewer mentioned, the female character \\"orgasimed at the drop of a hat\\", but I guess if there was a billionaire hottie behind me, maybe I can see the connection?  Although it's a stretch.  The writing is ok, I suppose I can understand why most women would find this book attractive, cause it's really just an escape.  However if you have never read erotic literature before, you don't miss what you never had, thus this book could make the average wife, mother, etc feel like they're reading a \\"dirty book.\\"<br />The other two books were loaned to me from a friend, and I had a hard time getting through the second book and I'm not moving much faster through the third. The sex scenes are so frequent it's almost to the point of being boring.  I find myself skipping over them to try to find the actual story line, which isn't riveting but I'm attempting to make the best of it.<br />As overall entertainment, it's an ok read for a rainy day, I can't recommend anything more than that.  It's unclear to me how they plan to make a movie of this?  I seem to recall Madonna dedicating part of her career to \\"exploring\\" BDSM with her music and it might have sold a few songs, but the overall effect sorta left people wondering \\"why?\\"<br />Fifty Shades in my opinion is the yuppie soccer mom erotica, and for me that sorta ruins the genre. I prefer my erotica a little more on the darker side, with less shades of grey.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You'd better set your 'Hard Limits' and 'safe word' in advance.<br />Being blindfolded means you relinquish control, scary. Entwined in this story not only about sex, ( but sex is so vivid, feels like you are experiencing her orgasms),but about trust, love, fear of loss, fear of rejection, acceptance and compromise. \\"We aim to please\\".
B001BR5NN0|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATESTS MOVIES EVER<br /><br />ONCE YOU START WATCHING IT YOU CAN'T STOP. EVERY PERSON IN THE MOVIE IS GREAT. FROM JUDD NELSON TO MOLLY RINGWALL AND THE REST. HAVING IT IS A MUST OWNED FOR DVD, BLUE RAY AND ANDROID. THERE'S ALSO GREAT SONGS TO THE MOVIE AS WELL. ONR OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO EVERYONNE IN THE MOVIE.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Didn't want to put it down. Amozon.com is so inexpensive and easy. I read a lot more now than I did.!
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Norah  Jones is a great vocal artist. When this CD became available on Amazon i had to have it.  Her music is very wonderful to listen to, easy listening and meaningful
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the most fun game I have ever played on my Kindle Fire. I think the game is an awesome way to test your reflexes, your skills, and a way to have fun.
