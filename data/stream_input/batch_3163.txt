B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very easy to play and I enjoy it very much n so do my kids! Would recommend for all ages
B00785P2QC|4.0|I'm enjoying the game, pretty fun! It's not quite the same as SimCity, but I like it none the less.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I read it following The Worst Hard Time which chronicled the Dust Bowl of the 1930's.  I had always wanted to read The Grapes of Wrath, but didn't make the time.  What a wonderful follow-up to another exceptional book.  I love Steinbeck's writing and how he created a fictional family who faced overwhelming ordeals that many real families had to endure during this terrible time.  It is a must read novel.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|it kept my attention and the book was very realistic.  It makes you realize how life is so tentative.I have already recommended it to a few of my friends.
B00DQ8GDV8|4.0|Very interesting read. Jared Diamond comes across as slightly condescending in his narrative but the subject matter is sufficiently gripping to make it worthwhile.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow I just finished half the book this morning. I couldn't put the book down. I'm still trying to figure all this out. Now I have to see the movie! That was the best book I've ever read...:)
B000XXI8G2|5.0|It is good boot , great deal .stand long time and still feel comfortable . Thinking to buy another pair sometime.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is really fun and very challenging!! I just wish you could have unlimited lives. Maybe the paid app has that, I'm not sure. I would recommend!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Trust me, when I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it looked really stupid.  My husband and I were looking for entertainment one weekend, however, and this movie was the only viable option because of time and a lack of other decent movies to see, so I looked it up online.  I read a review that was surprisingly positive and I noticed that the director was Guillermo Del Toro, who I really like, so I decided to take a chance.  Boy, I was shocked by how awesome this movie was.  It is an ACTION movie, not a deep and meaningful drama, but it has its own tender moments and also some really funny scenes.  If you're looking for mindless entertainment, look no further.  Also, the special effects are crazy good.  I liked the fella in the movie, too.  I didn't know who he was but I looked him up later and discovered he's the guy from Sons of Anarchy (which I haven't seen you can't help but notice Charlie Hunnam's blonde mane in the commercials).  Anyway, I think it's a kid friendly movie.  I don't recall any lewd language or behavior.  Of course, there is a lot of violence between the robots and the aliens, much like a video game.  If you're not into allowing your kids to see that sort of thing, skip it.  I would put this movie in the same category as something like Avatar in terms of awesome production, somewhat predictable plot, and decent acting.  I don't think you should be surprised by Pacific Rim if you look at Del Toro's prior work, like Cowboys and Aliens, for example.  This time it's robots and aliens.  I was really glad I saw it on the big screen, especially because of the amazing opening sequence.  Cheers, I hope you enjoy.
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|Best Audio of any RUSH Live release ever.<br />I saw two Clockwork Angels shows and treasure this CD set.<br />FANTASTIC!!!!!!
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this game<br />ta because it is a very  very very good game and that is all of it
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|SO Happy I can play candy crush on my kindle now!  The only thing I don't like is that I cannot use my lollipops and stuff... it's just like on my phone only bigger!!!!
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Really makes me feel good, it's a real pick me up,  I love this artist he does fantastic work.
B0056K4VZ4|5.0|This SACD, and this music.... WOW, WOW, WOW!  One of my fave CDs.  The sound quality, fidelity, is amazing.  If you like guitar-centric music (e..g. Clapton) you will really appreciate this, and even if you don't you will still love this CD.  Whether for a great listen or to 'audition' home audio equipment and hear it at its best... this is the CD to grab.  There's not a bad track on the entire album.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I finally gave into the hype and I can't stop playing this game! You won't want to put this one down.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|This is a remarkable film in both story and artistic presentation. Some folks think it is a little creepy, but if you are looking for a touching, imaginative and (potentially) classic Christmas movie that is less than 20 or 30 years old, this may be it. Don't look for much hilarity - it's more preachy and sentimental. But if you get sentimental around Christmastime, this movie is probably for you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot because it is kinda like subway surfers and I love subway surfers. And it's super cute,fun and funny.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I read Operation Parsifal first, which is the second book in the series, and it was a great read. I’m pleased to say Operation Armada, book one, was just as enjoyable. It appears that The Ian Fleming Files work well as standalone books, so it doesn’t really matter what order they are read in, and that’s a good thing. Damien Stevenson has a real talent for balancing just the right amount of detail and description so none of it gets in the way of the plot. The end result is a compelling story, rich in the imagery of the World War Two period, complete with all the technology and gadgetry of the time as well as the thrills and spills one would expect from a spy novel about the man behind the one and only James Bond.  Highly recommended, especially if you like to curl up in bed on a cold, dreary night and be transported to exotic locations on an adventure! An excellent book.
B00114RKT8|4.0|I happened onto the film on television and wanted to give the DVD to a friend.  It was a historical event and person of which I had never heard, a person who fought participation of English ships in the slave trade. I thought the acting in the film was very good.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|The start of a great series which keeps you interested and wanting to read<br />more.  Love this author and love the books.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|Fits the 5s perfectly.  The edges are a little sharp, not like they are going to cut me, but I'm glad I got the plastic one not the metal.  I've had Otterbox cases in the past and I think those are probably a little more protective.  This case is much better than the $20 case I felt like I had to buy the day I got the phone.  The buttons are easy to access.  The headphone jac works with the Apple style straight headphone adapter but I've had issues with larger plugs.  The charging port is easy to access, I haven't purchased the Amazon Basics chord but it works perfectly with the Apple style Lightening adapter.  I can't really notice if any obstruction of the speakers in the case.  The case has a slight ridge above the screen so you can set it face down and not worry about scratches.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun game while just sitting around and keeping yourself from being bored!<br />Solitaire is always a fun game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game. Very fun and addictive. Only issue is that it takes forever to replenish hearts. I ofcourse am not paying for more hearts, but love the game.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|the music, the music, the music! The story grips you, the performances thrill, the music carries you away. Listen on a good stereo system.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is awesome once you know how to use it. The tutorial could be better though. A hint: to move things from one place in your inventory you hold down on the item until it comes out of the box then you put it where ever . I had trouble figuring that out but once I figured it out the game got a whole lot better. ~Neon :D
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|It has been said that REFLEKTOR con taints unnecessary material.  I don't buy it.  This album is wonderful.  Arcade Fire is very good;  they can scarcely create a bad album.  Give this one a try.  If you've enjoyed their other stuff, you're sure to like this.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Everything in this book from its rich characters to its charmed history speaks to many different readers likes. As a 2nd book should, I'm eager to continue the series.
B00846REIS|3.0|Good book , if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey you will like this book. Both books have Simular story lines.
1419701533|5.0|I bought these for a group that reads  to the children of families at a shelter here in Phoenix. They were a big hit and the kids really enjoyed them!
B00EFYAWKA|5.0|JT is the man! He impeccably blends pop and R&B in a way we haven't seen from a male artist since MJ《gasp》. He knows what he's good at and never does more than that. Pusher Love Girl, That Girl, Mirrors, Give Me What I Don't Know (I Want), Take Back the Night and Murder are my favorites. The other 15 songs alone would make a great album.

0913866156|5.0|It is a big and beautiful Tarot Deck. With easy instructions to play, step by step. I really loved it.
0307743721|3.0|A litany of unlikely coincidents drive these stories forward. In an odd way they reminded me of Ray Bradbury. Relax and go with the flow of language, and everything is fine. Try to imagine people living like this, and you really wonder about the author.
B008M721MS|4.0|I love Skype not only for the calls but to talk to people. But..... you can't share screens which SUCKS.... So buy this app .
0345803493|3.0|It's hot enough, but I'd like to strangle the editor.  Or the author if she disregarded her editor's advice.  Not into the nickname.
0374104093|4.0|Given the size of my to-read pile, and my habit of *always* finishing series, I was hesitant to embark on yet another SF series. These days there are so many the prospect just seems exhausting.  However, Annihilation is such small book (with a trim size of only 5 by 7/2 inches, and 195 pages) that if the forthcoming volumes (Authority and Acceptance) are the same size, the whole thing could well be published as one respectable book with a more common trim size and three \\"parts.\\"  And I've liked some of author Jeff Vandermeer's other books, so . . . I started another series. I'm not sorry.  Annihilation emanates Vandermeer's trademark atmosphere of paranoia and disorientation, while being better focused and more accessible than some of his other books.<br /><br />Area X is a remote, supposedly environmentally contaminated area of the Southern Reach, created by some mysterious event.  The government has concealed it for decades while sending in twelve previous scientific expeditions, every one of which has failed, and every member of which has died in a variety of gruesome ways. This book tells the story of the thirteenth expedition, consisting of four nameless women:  The Biologist (and narrator), the Psychologist (and de facto leader), the Anthropologist, and the Surveyor.  A fifth member, the Linguist, apparently failed to cross the border into Area X. Though charged with scientifically exploring, mapping, and recording the area, and with observing each other, the expedition members are forbidden to share anything with each other.  Meanwhile, it becomes increasingly clear that the government has been lying and that the Psychologist is manipulating other expedition members. The Biologist discovers a mysterious tunnel (which she insists on calling a tower), there's an ominous lighthouse, and other anomalies. As fitting for the first part of a trilogy, this book introduces more mysteries than it solves.  I'm looking forward to the next two volumes (and to the movie, having read on the net that the series has been optioned for one).
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Got all of the hits, nice and hard. This is a great introduction to Shinedown.  Knocked it out of the ballpark.
0761174192|5.0|I bought this calendar as a gift to a cat lover. She loved it so much. It is great to have a new cat picture every day all year long.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|Nothing beats the live show, but with the different camera angles and sound mixed to cut down on the audience, it lets me relive the experience from my own home.  Love it!
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This is as good an insight into human behavior as I have ever read.  The information contained shows how to effect change by being in tune with and sensitive to the people who will be involved in the change you want to effect.
B005CGI4EG|3.0|I'm thrilled that MWC is in a box set. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. Two spindles hold the DVDs. There is no episode guide to give you a clue which episodes are on each DVD . I'll have to go online and download that and I'll put the DVDs in paper sleeves to help protect them. I would gladly have paid more if the packaging included episode guides and each DVD in a sleeve or it's own case like other boxed sets instead of having to do it myself.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The graphics is so beautiful the detail is excellent I can go hunting with out leaving my home if you love great graphics and excellent detail YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!!
030758836X|5.0|Just as expected. great book. awesome. good condition. bought this book as a gift for someone esle. now i am trying to use all the words required,
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Free is always good and why not use it? It has always been good for getting music from where I want or easy to download if I get a new phone.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I LOVE this show.  There are very few shows on TV today that I like.  The writers for this show are brilliant, and so is the ensemble cast, especially Jim Parsons as Sheldon. Since I'm not always home on the night the show airs I hadn't seen much of the 6th or 7th season. I now own the first 6 seasons.
B009MO5E10|5.0|We love this movie mainly because our last name is Wiley but great movie too with great actors and a good story line.
B00FY2TQMW|1.0|This was by far the worst of the fast and furious franchise. It was so completely ridiculous I couldn't stand to watch another minute.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Some SPOILERS!<br />I loved the other books and began reading the Divergent Series long before the whispers of a movie. When I first finished the book I would have rated the book badly, solely based on how upset I was about killing Tris.  After some time I realized that over all the emotions I enjoyed the book. Reacting emotionally means that I was able to make a connection with the characters and storyline, therefore Roth wrote a good story. I still have issues with the discussions Tobias made, they are uncharacteristic of his personality in the first two books, though this is the first time we glimpse his point-of-view.<br />Anyone who has already read the other books should definitely enter with an open mind. If you insist on happy endings...
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Loved this series. Very interesting historical drama with engaging characters and keep you on the edge of your seat plot.
0385350864|4.0|Lots of people want this book to be a continuation of the last one, but I applaud Helen Fielding for her approach to where Bridget is in middle age. Does she still have some of the same characteristics? Yes! None of us changes completely as we age and, I would argue, Bridget has adapted. Fielding's first book had some of the same characteristics and &#34;darkness&#34; as this one. Almost no one knows about that book, Cause Celeb, but I highly recommend it. It shows an even starker change in someone that lived a life like Bridget's, but made a radical change when she was young. This book kind of reminded me of how Marian Keyes takes something dark and injects humor around it to make a great story.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I didn't like the hip-hop 20s theme. The visuals were sometimes too dramatic. The cast was great and Dicaprio made a great Gatsby.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We didn't really need this but for the price I bought it to try anyway. Then I won a TV! I had a spot for another TV, but didn't want to pay cable fees for it. So now the new TV is our netflix streaming TV. I can't believe how easy this is to use. I stream off my Nook color. Quality is awesome. Never any glitches or lag time. Pretty neat! I can also stream youtube but haven't tried streaming any other content.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun game just cant find any friends to play along.  wish it didn't rely on friends at all. time consumer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|quite boring; probably interesting to young adults but any adult would find it banal.  Kind of like looking through a peep hole into the girls locker room in junior high.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|It's a classic that every family should own! I can't believe it's been 20 years already!! unforgettable cast including bette midler, kathy najimi and sarah jessica parker. This is a must have!

B009NF54ZE|3.0|I found this game to be really easy. Many of the items were the same from screen to screen. I had no problem with locating items.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Kids should really love this game. So will adults. At this point in my time on the game as an adult. The game play is smooth with not a lot of interaction with other players.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Nice follow up on a time to kill!  After seeing the movie you could picture the characters!  Well done!  Read all of Grisham's books - really enjoyed this!
B00CSGYLQI|5.0|This is amazing! The colors are bright and the mountain is sparkly. It's a pretty spectacular sized playset for the price. There's room for both dolls to play in with a castle on Anna's side and an ice palace for Elsa and tons of accessories and little junk (to get lost, ha ha!). Now all we need are the dolls, because they're are not included. The whole thing closes up so it's pretty flat to store under the bed when she is done playing. We are going to see the movie the day after Thanksgiving and Disney will probably start cranking out the commercials for the castle that day so I know she is going to want this castle badly! She is going to love, love this toy on Christmas morning.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Amazing fun I spend all day beating  the game over and over lots of puzzles beautiful graphics easy zoom but to much talking between puzzles
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Wonderful music by two outstanding singers.  I have their first CD also and this is just as good.  These two youngsters - both age 17 - show maturity beyond their years.  A perfect gift for any music lover - including yourself.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I need a clock that is easy to program, and only goes off when I want it too. My schedule is highly irregular, and this program helps me make sense of my needs. This is also good for appointment warnings, or call XYZ corp because your contact is in the office now. It is not as useful as a PDA, but for what it does, it exceeds expectations.
0545615402|5.0|Perfect addition to Harry Potter fanboy collectors. Well made, fells very sturdy. Fun read. The new Wizarding World Movie set to come out is based off of &#34;Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them&#34;
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I will probably have to watch this movie several times in order to get my head around it.... BUT ..... I can tell you that you won't lose interest in it or be bored. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. If nothing else, you have to keep watching it to see if you can grasp the essence of what the author of the book was writing about and how the story connects each time period with the other. It is almost 3 hours long but it goes by fast because of the story. It also has a large list of \\"A-List\\" actors in it. This film must have cost a lot of money to make and I'd say it was worth every penny. I gladly recommend this movie to everyone.
1423151054|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and was well liked by the recipient. A quality Disney product for the art lover.
B00G4EXNNM|4.0|It is a tall ask to recreate an album as seminal as the Everly Brothers \\"Songs our Daddy Taught us\\" and pull it off. The Everly's album itself was a selection of songs that the brothers learned as boys from their father, Ike Everly. In 1958 it was a risk for them to roll out this set, coming on the back of their first album including the huge hits \\"Bye Bye Love\\" and \\"Wake up Little Susie\\". Nevertheless while their song selection was rootsy the versions of Appalachian standards were characterised by the trademark superb harmonies and they made the songs their own. In \\"Foreverly\\" Billie Joe Armstrong and chanteuse Norah Jones follow their template begging the question is this intended as a straightforward homage and does it add additional value? The honest answer is both. The Green Day singers pairing with Jones is unlikely but it generally works. Billie Joe Armstrong \\"stumbled upon\\" the original record a couple of years ago and became obsessed with it. His heart set on doing an Everly's tribute he brought Norah Jones on board as someone who he previously sung with at a Tsunami Benefit Concert.<br /><br />Not heading for the Everly's more famous singles gives the album a more contemporary feel although with two lead vocalists vying for the mike it is rare that this new pairing actually trump any of the Don and Phil versions. It is however an enjoyable album containing a sterling version of the traditional \\"Roving Gambler\\" which Simon & Garfunkel and Bob Dylan also covered. Likewise \\"Long time gone\\" shows that Armstrong in particular has a voice which his work in Green Day could only hint at. Sticking strictly to the Everlys format largely works because of the presence of a woman's voice giving the songs a different feel. That said when it comes to an old murder ballad like \\"Down in the Willow Garden\\" you hark back to Nick Cave's version and the greater brutality that he injected. In this sense it is the sparsity of Jones's trademark smoky vocal on \\"I'm here to get my baby out of jail\\" which actually impresses most because possibly it's the least comparable to an Everly original.<br /><br />When all is said and done the versions here are respectful and well executed. For anyone approaching these tracks for the first time the wonders of the shuffling \\"Kentucky\\", the joyous raw fiddle of \\"Barbara Allen\\" and the sweet delight of \\"Lightning Express\\" await. There is little doubt that this collaboration will be compared to, what was also deemed at the time, an equally \\"left field\\" matching of Robert Plant and Alison Krauss on \\"Raising Sand\\". In the last analysis the latter produced a more varied atmospheric product, but Armstrong and Jones have not let the side down and \\"Foreverly\\" marks a successful collaboration from two unlikely collaborators.baby out of jail\\" which actually impresses most because possibly it's the least comparable to an Everly original.<br /><br />When all is said and done the versions here are respectful and well executed.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Hands down its the best keyboard app for android. It's the very first app I install on all of my devices and the first one I recommend to my friends. Puts the other keyboards to shame.  Now with the last two updates it gives users the ability to customize thier keyboard even further.  There's nothing else I could ask for in a keyboard. You need this app. Trust me. Try the trial version and see what I mean. And keep an eye out for sales,  it goes on sale every few months... But it's worth every penny at full price price.

B00A2H9WW8|4.0|Now a days, people seem to use weapons as a way to express their pain.  Be it a gun, knife, bomb or whatever else people can find.  It is hard to know when someone is on the verge of loosing their control over themselves.  Now imagine you are a teenage girl.  Going through all the thoughts and feelings that teenage girls go through.  Now imagine that you've held in rage for such a long time and have been mentally abused by your mother and kids at school.  You find out you can control things with your mind.  Your mind, becomes the weapon.  Anything can be used to kill those who have hurt you.  Even their own bodies.  What would you do?  Would you make them all pay for what they did, or would you just let it continue to go on and be abused?  Welcome to the problem that Carrie is facing.  With a religious nut of a mother, preventing her from living a normal life and a group of teen girls at her school, she has a difficult time.  One day, she finds that she can make things movie, just by thinking about it.  Something happens that makes her so happy.  Maybe she will have a normal thing happen.  Certain people take the torment to far and all hell breaks loose.  Carrie uses what she has learned she is able to make everyone pay.  Then, the end may not truly be the end.<br /><br />My mom and I went to see this.  I've never seen the original.  I very much enjoyed the movie.  First, the girl who plays Carrie, was amazing.  She played the innocent, scared girl SO well.  I actually almost cried at a few parts because I felt so bad for her.  She was amazing.  The lady who plays the mom also did a great job of playing the strict, scared mom.  The entire cast was very believable.  I have to applaud them all.<br /><br />Something else that was cool were the effects.  The scene with the blood on her, it just starts floating in the air.  Very cool.  Many things happen and the effects look great throughout.<br /><br />I like simple movies.  While this was not simple as far as how or why she could do what she did or what was going on in her mind, it was simple in the fact that everything really took place at her house or at the school.  That is easy to understand.  Those were the two places she was hurt the most.  You get to see her realize that she has to make her own decisions.  Only to have everything end in a bang.  Unless that is, it has not.y she could do what she did or what was going on in her mind, it was simple in the fact that everything really took place at her house or at the school.

B00GLX1MG6|4.0|I rented this movie and it stopped about 12 times while watching it.  Each time taking about 3-5 minutes to restart.  It was very annoying and really disrupted the movie.  If movie quality is poor it should let you know that before you pay the money for it.  the movie itself was very funny and would have been great if not for the difficulty in watching it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Compelling, interesting and hopefully a sequel  is in the mix. A good read.  Not my first and not my last..
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I started playing a couple of days ago. like the challenge of having to meet goals within a certain number of moves vs time. did great until I hit levels in the 20's. now really takes concentration.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|I had a lot of trouble downloading this game. It took about three try's before it finally worked, and its pretty fun!
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first, I found this book interesting but not very intriguing. It didn't really become good until the second part of the book. I finished it in a matter of days. This book kept me on edge full of suspense. It's the perfect book to read over a holiday break!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a great app. It's fun and challenging at the same time. I'd totally recommend it to everybody!<br /><br />Plus it has hints u can buy if u get stuck on one.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Frightening prediction of what is already here and sure to increase!  Fair warning!  1984 was the beginning, now All of Us are watching All of Us!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Liam Neeson plays troubled factory owner Oskar Schindler who is caught up in the brutality of Nazi Germany during World War 2. Schindler is a shrewd businessman who endeavors to save Jews by way of 'buying' them, so to speak, in order to employ them in his steel factory. Throughout the movie, we get a sense of the hatred that fueled the Holocaust, but we also see some glimpses of humanity and love for fellow man at play.<br /><br />Schindler uses his wealth as well as his position in business to bring many Jewish men and women to work in his factory. Unlike the inhumane work camps that the German government interred the Jews in, Schindler provided good working conditions as well as adequate housing, and other basic necessities.<br /><br />As we follow Schindler's work through the movie, we see that he is more and more despairing of his ability to help as many as he would like. Finally, we end with Schindler feeling beaten down and inadequate, despite his personally saving thousands of people from death.<br /><br />This movie is an important part of understanding the Holocaust and it's human cost. So that the saying &#34;never again&#34; stays true, we must remember that we are all part of the human experience. Schindler's List can help in this endeavor by helping bring an understanding of &#34;the other&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves it and that's what matters to me.<br />He laughed and laughed.<br />Challenging but not enough to cause frustration
B00BP0QPJE|4.0|Great book by a great author. They made a great movie of this with James Dean!  Check out other books by this great author.
B005AUWY90|3.0|Special effects fantastic, story NEVER grabbed my attention - the entire premise is not compelling enough to retain a 4 or a 58 year old's attention.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is great. It can stream Netflix on SuperHD setting as well. I just hoped that it had more tweaking capabilities  such as streaming videos from my computer, or my phone. That may be fixed in a future update? Only Google knows!
B007PVHMCG|2.0|Too little for the price!<br />I was expecting a large box... I hope my son likes the toy...<br />I guess you pay for the theme of the lego
0071410945|1.0|Not quite what I expected.<br />No great insight.<br />Formulaic and a bit simplistic.<br />Someone on a blog raved about this book - I didn't quite see it as anything worthy of a book.  Perhaps as a 2-3 page article.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It does an awesome job. I have it set to scan twice a week to clean my files. It helps keep my kindle fire running smoothly.
B004RC8NUQ|1.0|The DVD was scratched  up really bad.  Barley played. Before I purchased it.  It said it was in good condition.  Wasn't happy about my purchase
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS APP AND THEY LOVE it really I even told my mom and dad
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Needs more R&D and more Apps, if your TV has one available HDMI port, and is not a smart TV this is an okay solution to change that. If you have an Android phone/tab then you can connect via your Wifi and control the unit. in time i am sure this unit will be great because it has great potential. For the moment i am giving this item 3 stars.
B00F2HW220|3.0|Ayreon and Arjen have made the most awesome music and surpass  my own expectations!<br />However, Theory of Everything is very problematic for me. Yes, I downloaded the MP3 version.<br />The songs don't stand alone because it's all made up of short passages of music. Nothing here<br />that you could call a song. Therefore, just listening to this is very frustrating. I frankly cant identify<br />with the concept of this album. This amounts to a unfortunate disappointment for me. I just cant<br />listen to it all the way through. I'm not sure if I want to listen to it again. I can't believe that this<br />amounts to a step forward for Arjen. I wish I didn't have to say that about such a wonderful musician.
144937980X|5.0|Great for the beginner to get started to understand processing code. This book provided me the basic format to understand and write code in processing.
B000002KXO|5.0|Item more than I was promised. This CD is a must have, and such a fun listen! This is one of my favorites by this amazing band, and I bought to replace my vinyl, which is still good, but want to keep it that way! If you love this band, you must have this one!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|AWESOME. Can't wait until I see the new episode in the next few days. Great screenplay of a complex and bloody struggle against the establishment.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|good game it is very fun for me and my kids love to play it all the time good game
B0024FAG6M|4.0|I was fortunate to find this buy. It was always in the above $70 price range but found it for $16.19 one day. The packing was great. I waited for the Blu-ray edition but was disappointed in the quality of the HD. It's better just to buy the DVD version for less.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Not using for digital camera. Instead I bought it for another purpose. Using for backup of important data on old machine.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is AWESOME you have to get it you will love it I have a real horse named Rosie and she is awesome and I want you to ride horses and play this app too<br /><br />Love<br /><br />Ihascupquake
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|Definitely the best episode I have seen so if you didn't see it yourself then what are you waiting for
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Doesn't ring at set times and screws up the clock on my Kindle. Don't waste your money on this and don't bother with the freeware version either.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|Not what I expected. The acting was fine. The story line was boring, an airline pilot who is an alcoholic, ho hum.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I loved this book, but it was a little bit too long. Some of the very detailed information about Alma's study of mosses were boring to me.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Good story with correct ending but improbable it would happen at hearing. Also, using cocaine to get sober doesn't work. How many alcoholics will now try that after viewing this movie?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the game itself is maddening but so glad I can finally play it on my Kindle Fire!  it's taking a while to warm up to t h e Fire but this helps!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game has so many levels I love it you would download it is so awesome it can be chalenging
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Very underrated bluesman. You hear all about BB King and rarely Buddy Guy. This 2 CD set is his best work ever! I especially like track #4 (Messin with the Kid, with Kid Rock!) I like the Blues Brothers version, this one is fantastic! If you are a fan of the Blues or Buddy Guy, you need this CD!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for the past few months to finally get this game on my Kindle and I'm so excited it's FINALLY here!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome. It's a great game to play for pass time. Can't get enough of playing it. Awesome
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It is a good game. Compatible with my Fire HD. Only wish that the crowns came with the coins. Can be very addicting.
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|Easy read and one that the kids will be able t repeat quickly.  Love all of Sandra's books.  I highly recommend all he books.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's only been 24 hrs. But I like it so far. Picture quality is awesome. My only complaint has to do more with Chrome on Androids. than anything. It only works with  apps that can hook right into it on my Android phone and Nexus 7, It does not work appear to work with Chrome on the Android platform or any of the Google apps on an Android. But . . .  it does work well with Windows and Apple operating systems. I believe that it will work fine with Chromebooks also.<br /><br />Added . . .<br />Well I did get it to work with my chromebook. As I said before, the video quality is awesome. it was great being able to show holiday pictures on the TV. Audio just plain doesn't work. There's no sound for Amazon, youtube, or browser inserted movies. It'd nice to be able to look at pictures with the family. It would have been nicer to be able to watch movies.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The story kept my attention throughout.  The relationships between the servants and the owners was clearly laid out.  I felt the emotions that they must have felt.  The only negative is in how the book ended.  You were brought along with a specific relationship that never found its way to fruition.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|She's so good, so hilarious, and it is written very well (Of course, it's Tina Fey!)<br />She's such an earthy and brilliant person, and never bemoans any situation her life may have had in it.
B00318COS4|5.0|Fun entertaining and beautiful game. I just wish it lasted longer. I was bummed when it was over, but worth it if you like figuring out puzzles and really using brain power to get through.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Interesting fiction-non fiction book. Characters were strong and there was some sensitivity to love even in a fall back time zone
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I have a kindle and it has a updates that isn't working right now and I'm not sure what going on please fix asap  missing my favorite game for a week ago now HELP!!!!!<br />Great review 5 stars an wishing the upgrade gets better soon<br />....................HELP ASAP TRUE GAME STRESSED OUT !!!!..................<br /><br />The more I think and type the sadness miss taking over just come back to work out the problems .So going out of my mind trying to be patient for kindle updates .
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Haven't completed this book yet so I can only give it 4 stars. It did however capture my attention from page one. Grisham has a long history of writing good books.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics. Good storyline too. Interesting characters however, all in all, an above average game.Good game but not a great game
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Funniest movie ever!  Our whole family loves to watch it every year.  It never gets old, no matter how many times we've watched it.
B0055V0GQC|5.0|Rival Sons is THE BEST BAND I've heard in a long,long time.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who likes/loves,Zeppelin,Bad Co.,Badlands,and other like artists.ANYTHING Rival Sons is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|The Goldfinch has so many beautiful moments spread throughout the book. The first 1/3 is amazing and so perfectly done.  After that, you get the feeling that the writer decided to go with a stream of consciousness writing technique that rambles and meanders and all the while you have to wait for the story to begin again.  The reader gets exhausted, the story tedious. And, this writing illness gets worse as the book progresses.  Many long rambling passages of sheer boredom.  Editing would have helped immensely because a beautiful story is buried within.  I kept with it till the end and it was beautiful but I had to work hard for it...really hard.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|My 4 month old loves this!!! I am thinking about getting another one just so that we can have a back up.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Lots of fun to play, but a little challenging to earn enough money and coins for needed upgrades. Graphics and concept are great.
B00061QJZI|5.0|Bought for my two step sons.  They continue to enjoy it on occasion.  It is not my type of movie though.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is an excellent story well told.  As a son of the South, Grisham has revealing insight into his characters, and into the issue of race.  As a lawyer, he knows the legal process, and its shortcomings.  As a storyteller, he knows how to spin a plot, and keep the reader on the edge of his seat.
B00FWPWNKS|2.0|Same as Fruit Drops Part I.  The screen is too busy for my tastes.  I'm sure others will love it.
B00GO95BUU|5.0|Writing strictly about the movie, not the pricing issues on Amazon, I thought this was brilliant!  I love how many mysteries got solved, and how many more were brought up.  I don't think I got nearly as many of the references as I might have if I'd watched more of the original Doctor Who--I came into the second series just at the end of this last season and have been trying to catch up ever since.  But this was just amazing!  Excuse me, I'm off to watch it again!  Allons-y!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Doesn't everyone love It.  Play for hours  or until I run out of lives.  Make it my goal never to buy anything.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it ..........love it five stars! !!!!!! great app I love playing on my kindle. and its free yay yay
B000JBWWBK|5.0|I love the movie and so I bought the soundtrack.  I listen to it often, especially right before going to France for vacation.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone- Men or Women..its worth it... I suggest, parents & teachers should read it..
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I almost skipped this one because of the many negative reviews, but the other Reachers have been so consistently superb that I decided to give it a shot. Good choice! This was as good as its predecessors. It was most certainly not boring or repetitive or claustrophobic. It was clever and challenging with enough pace and action and twists and turns to keep it interesting and suspenseful throughout. I wonder if some of the critics have simply read too many Reachers in a row without breaking it up with other great authors, such as Micheal Connelly or Ian Rankin, and some history books or classical literature, etc. If you have enjoyed Reacher in the past, do not pass on A Wanted Man.  gcm
B003O86FMW|5.0|I fell into this book so quickly that I had to purposely avert my attention elsewhere in an attempt to digest the story. Most definitely this book is a fast read, but the implications are so far reaching yet comparable to our past and present that I recommend that the reader take their time to read this second book. Separation/isolation, forced labor, starvation, public beatings, executions, and the never ending fear of having everything you love taken. Only the truly perverted can covet the most precious thing thing we have to give, our love for another, and wield it like a weapon. As desperate as I felt throughout the story, I got what it was that our sponsor (Collins) had delivered....Hope Catching Fire.
147676459X|5.0|This book is brilliant and crazy. You are guaranteed to laugh, while at the same time asking yourself why *your* childhood stories and memories aren't this funny. I love the insight into being an adult with which we can all identity, discussed by someone who's artistic talents are only exceeded by her kooky sense of humor.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one of the best series that I happened upon at 3 am. I only saw one episode before it was cancelled but seriously...a hooker in space?. It is one of the most funny and inventive series I think has ever been put on TV. Worth all the time you spend watching...plus the vernacular is addictive! Thank you Joss Whedon.
B00005YU1O|2.0|this is a good view. i especially like when they both go to the club and watch a few acts. then she cries and shakes. they go back home to find the blue box. open it and she disappears. thats really funny. games.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Fun. Lots of layouts. Plenty of opportunity to be challenged. Glad the music can be turned off. Works well on the Kindle. Would recommend this version.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Of the two memoirs used for the basis of HBO's &#34;The Pacific&#34; series, this is the better-told story.  Not that &#34;Helmet for My Pillow&#34; isn't enormously compelling reading, it's just that Eugene Sledge's prose is more accessible and well-organized.<br /><br />The horrors endured by Sledge, Leckie, and their comrades are hard to comprehend over a half-century later, even with horribly-maimed countrymen and women returning from combat zones since 9-11.  As the pages turn, new descriptions of violence that leave us asking &#34;How can that be topped?&#34;, yet on the following pages new levels of human suffering are steadily revealed.<br /><br />That Sledge, an educated man but not a trained writer or journalist, tells this story so well so long after hostilities is testimony to his education, the encouragement of his family, his desire to set the record straight--even at risk of re-living the horrors, and his Bible-page journal.<br /><br />Though combat troops were but a small minority of the total number of Americans under arms in World War II, it amazes me that of the thousands who survived action against the Japanese, so few seemed to act-out their issues returning to peacetime violently.<br /><br />Read &#34;With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa&#34; for intimate, first-hand reporting of some of the most violent combat imaginable.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|It was a fun movie.  I really enjoyed it.  The fight scenes were way too long though and the ending was lame for such an &#34;epic&#34; long battle to end that quickly.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Slightly predictable but lots of fun. Very well paced and never dull. Characters well defined and worthy of consideration. Worth the time
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|Missouri singer Sheryl Crow has come a long way from her early years as a background vocalist for Michael Jackson. Since that starting point, she made her official recording debut appearing on Kenny Loggins 1991 album &#34;Leap Of Faith&#34;. She then signed with A&M Records to release her debut album &#34;Tuesday Night Music Club&#34;. It wasn't a huge success until the second single &#34;All I Wanna Do&#34; propelled her to pop status. She ditched producer Bill Bottrell to self-produce her 1996 self-titled sophomore effort &#34;Sheryl Crow&#34; as well as her third recording &#34;The Globe Sessions&#34;. She made a beeline toward pop radio on &#34;C'mon C'mon&#34;, while lamenting over a breakup on 2005's &#34;Wildflower&#34;. She reunited with Bill Bottrell almost fifteen years later with the politically minded &#34;Detours&#34;, and pulled things to a close on her final album for A&M- the soul music inspired &#34;100 Miles From Memphis&#34;. After a nearly 20 year association with A&M, she took up residency with Warner Bros. Records for the release of her eighth album &#34;Feels Like Home&#34;.<br /><br />Sheryl produced the album with Justin Niebank- the first time she shared a production credit since &#34;Wildflower&#34;. While it has been billed as her country music debut, musically &#34;Feels Like Home&#34; isn't much different from her previous work. In fact, it has more in common with her country-pop albums from the mid-2000's. She starts the album off with the song &#34;Shotgun&#34;, where she offers to take the wheel when her partner decides to be a relaxed driver. She celebrates spending quality time at home on the first single &#34;Easy&#34;, and pleads to a person fearful of commitment on the ballad &#34;Give It To Me&#34;. She delivers the inebriation anthem &#34;We Oughta Be Drinkin'&#34;, while getting songwriting help from Brad Paisley on the song about a single mother on the dating scene &#34;Waterproof Mascara&#34;. She pokes fun at celebrity culture on &#34;Crazy Ain't Original&#34;, while dealing with gossip hounds on &#34;Nobody's Business&#34;. She sings of a woman who faces growing old on &#34;Homecoming Queen&#34;, and trying to balance career and parenting on the closing song &#34;Stay At Home Mother&#34;. &#34;Feels Like Home&#34; is a good recording from Sheryl Crow. Though she may seem like a fish out of water, it shows she feels right at home in a new genre.lture on &#34;Crazy Ain't Original&#34;, while dealing with gossip hounds on &#34;Nobody's Business&#34;.

B002CNOA6S|5.0|A timeless film, the performance of Dustin Hoffman it is just brilliant. I usually don't repeat movies unless they are as good as this one
0385351399|5.0|While The Circle is my first Eggers' book, it won't be my last!  In particular, I was struck by two things:  the setting:  which is our new, all-invasive, digital world, dissected, and the main character, Meg.  Like Mitchell did with Scarlett O'Hara, Eggers protagonist is a throughly unsympathetic character.  But, rather than having her experience a predictible epiphany by the climax, he delves into her very soul with a meatcleaver.  By doing so, he stayed true not only to her character, but to the 1984-type warning he was trying to sound.<br /><br />A great read by a great writer who has something very important to say.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Never a dull moment. Should of had more chapters. Love hidden object games. Addictive.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautifully written story that captures the hell known as cancer. It will rip your heart out while giving you hope to move on.
B005OYHF0A|4.0|Excellent examples and easily described techniques for dependency breaking. Highly recommend reading it together with Fowlers &#34;Refactoring&#34; as the two books work verry well together.<br />Only negative thing is that the chapter names are sometimes distracting and when reading it on a kindle (or equal) the frequent jumping to references makes it hard to remember where you were (sometimes re-reading parts of a chapter repeatedly).
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So relaxing! Puts me to sleep in minutes. And I love that it has a timer to shut itself off.
B005HSL626|2.0|A quick teaser for the little guys. The boys enjoy smashing fruit. It is a little hard to stay focused.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Fun game slot like be jewel  hate this you have to write so many words before it lets you out.  Should let you write a few words or however many words you want. Like I said fun game<br />.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the app it's fun and like the p.c. game but I don't like how you can't lure animals into pens if that gets fixed the game will be perfect
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice age is not only a good game but an excellent movie. Our children at church enjoy the interaction of the animals. You really made a wonderful game for the challenge if our little ones. The three and four year olds.
B000FC12C8|5.0|cause it was really helpful to start my own business, for self motivation and motivate others to keep focused on their own business too.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Fool game, great graphics. Would like to be able to level up faster without having to rely on so many gems.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|Same thing,implied freebie,no way ,,pay,pay,pay,<br />I have removed these games from my favorites and carousel.<br />Don't bother to review<br />Alan
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Delighted to pay $8 to view this gem the same weekend as its premier in the UK! Certainly better than the cost of the theatre especially for two people!<br /><br />And by way of actually reviewing the movie itself, as opposed to Amazon's selling practices, this was a wonderfully executed piece and highly appropriate for commemorating Doctor Who's 50th.  It's a great union of new material and acknowledged history.  I do recommend viewing the mini movie &#34;Night of the Doctor&#34; for a little backstory to John Hurt's Doctor.<br /><br />Finally, don't blink. Not on account of Weeping Angels but because you might miss a brilliantly flippant but subtle quip. About what one would expect from Tennant and Smith.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Was waiting for it to come to kindle very fun to play beautiful graphics and its free to play its as good as the one on facebook
888370536X|5.0|This is an excellent pocket notebook for jotting down song bits and ideas. i bought it as a &#34;cheat book&#34; after seeing a picture of Glen Hughes (Deep Purple, Black Country Communion) using something similar. When you don't play with a lot of written music, it's sometimes useful to have a way to remember a song key or the basic chord patterns. This book is the answer.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very useful app. Graphics are pleasant and easy to navigate. Every thing is broken down for easy understanding making it very easy to decipher.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It took a little while for my wife to get into because there were some brutal parts in the book but she really liked it by the end.  I liked it from the beginning.  It was interesting and different, sort of historical fiction but in the present day.  It is hard to believe how the North Koreans live....
B00G4EXNNM|4.0|This album is great! Different than the usual stuff i listen to but i must say its a wonderful album.  However i must say something about one of the other comments, billie didnt have a sex addiction you idiot. He had a drug addiction.

B0082SU98U|5.0|I Loved it. This book should be required reading in schools, it was so uplifting, with such a great message.
1451666179|5.0|We love Allie Brosh! This book is twice the size of other blog-to-book offerings, so it was a nice surprise to see so much Simple Dog, Helper Dog, and crazy Allie of all ages in the same binding.

B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Good condition. Received a price refund on price checking since I ordered early. A lower price was found and they gave me credit. Look in inside for a paper with a &#34;Magic number&#34; for you digital copy verification. It is the only way to get what you paid for.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a talented writer and I thoroughly enjoyed this book that depicts a women's life (Alma) in the 1800's. Alma is such an interesting character and her life travels, relationships and studies tell us so much about her. There is also a Darwin/Spiritual theme in the book that was quite interesting. Some people complained about the scientific information about orchids, mosses and other plants, but I found it fascinating. Can't wait for another E.G. book..keep them coming!
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Be sure to look for the paper inside for the number to redeem your digital copy from somewhere. I'll have to read it.
1455521310|5.0|Sam Wingo was Special Forces and a man with a mission. He was also a family man and a patriot. His assignment had been a year in the making, after being handpicked for the job. It was supposed to be “fail safe.” So what happened to a top-secret and highly valuable truckload entrusted to Sam in Afghanistan? All he knows is that the original plan changed and left him running for his life.<br /><br />On the surface, it looks bad for Sam. Very bad. When he calls his immediate superior, the man has no encouraging words for him, only an order: Come in so we can work this out. But Sam hears an underlying message that holds only the promise of a future in some remote military prison --- or even worse --- so he decides to go it alone for now. His biggest priority is to clear his name, as his honor matters immensely to him. But where does he even start? He knows it’s a long shot and none of his choices are good, but he must find a way. “Someone had screwed him. He wasn’t turning the other cheek. He was a soldier. Soldiers were not wired for compassion or forgiveness. They were trained to strike back when struck.”<br /><br />Back home in the States, Sam’s son, Tyler, has just received news that his father was killed in Afghanistan. His mother is already dead. Now his father? What does he have left? A stepmother he barely knows and doesn’t love. That’s it. In his grief and rage, he reaches out to private investigators Sean King and Michelle Maxwell. If anyone can find out what happened to Sam, it is this pair. But no one could envision the resistance they would meet. And it seems to be coming at them from all angles, including, most troublesomely, their own government. Men in big, black SUVs keep turning up and warning them off in ways apparently meant to instill deep fear. Little do they realize that King and Maxwell don’t scare easily. And both being former Secret Service, they have a trick or two up their sleeves and ways of turning the tables. But thereare other people following King and Maxwell, and they don’t play by the same rules. In fact, they don’t play by rules of any kind; they simply want to eliminate all opposition in whatever way necessary.<br /><br />While the detectives try to help Tyler, they are beset by problems. The solution eludes them, almost beyond the point that it matters. At the last possible second, the shocking answer comes out. But it may be too late. Even more puzzling is the motive. No one could have foreseen it coming.<br /><br />With everything in the news about the Middle East, oil, arms, terrorists and endless scandals, David Baldacci’s latest thriller is not only highly relevant, it is also well timed. And the details seem so real that it’s hard not to wonder if the author is an insider; the tone is that authentic. An absolute page-turner, KING AND MAXWELL is Baldacci at the pinnacle of his game.<br /><br />- Kate Ayers
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is an excellent story,well deserving its status as a classic. The three short stories did not strike me as anything special. I could have easily done without them and not missed a thing.
1455525839|5.0|Corrie Swanson, currently a junior at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, has been searching for a killer theme for her thesis. After several dismal failures, she hits upon an idea that she believes will win over her constantly disapproving advisor. A century and a half ago, the story goes, a number of miners were brutally attacked and killed near a now-fashionable ski resort called Roaring Fork. Eyewitnesses at the time claimed to have seen a grizzly bear eating the men. Or at least that's what Oscar Wilde related to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle over a posh London dinner shortly after the deaths, according to Doyle's journal.<br /><br />Finally, Corrie has a solid direction. Studying to become a criminal pathologist, she wants to examine the bones for their bite marks. That's an area of forensics that hasn't seen much attention. What a coup if she can pull this off! The Christmas break arrives, and she rushes across the country to start her research.<br /><br />Initially, on her first day in Roaring Fork, Corrie feels a warm welcome from the police chief. Inexplicably, however, his mood changes overnight. She is beyond puzzled. Why the cold shoulder? Fortunately, before the sudden shift in attitude, Corrie had a chance to take a quick look at the bones. Even though access is now being denied, she thinks she saw something disturbing, and no mere padlock is going to keep her from confirming her theory. Sometimes, Corrie needs to use her head. This is one of those times. Her rash disregard for the law gets her into a heap of trouble.<br /><br />FBI Agent A.X.L. Pendergast comes to his protégé's rescue. He has a special fondness for the young woman. But Corrie is less than grateful, jealously guarding her project and her privacy. She bulls ahead with little thought of potential consequences. The subject is simply too tempting to give up on, maybe even good enough to catapult her to award-winning heights at John Jay, for she has an inkling that there is far more to this than anyone ever thought, including those two famous authors having a long-ago conversation.<br /><br />\\"Consider for a moment: what if Wilde heard the real story and told it to Doyle? And what if Doyle found it too disturbing to put in his diary? What if Doyle instead concealed some of that information in THE HOUND?\\"<br /><br />While Corrie is busy following up leads and reading town history, a serial arsonist starts terrorizing Roaring Fork. Whoever is burning mansions up in The Heights is making sure the families are locked inside. As gruesome as that sounds, it doesn't seem to be related to Corrie's work. Or is it? Besides, she's racing against time. An approaching storm is pushing her to pick up the pace, as is Pendergast's insistence that she go back home. She has stirred up emotions in this little town, and he believes it is far too dangerous for her to stay.<br /><br />Fans of Sherlock Holmes will devour Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's latest thriller, not only because of its connection to Conan Doyle, but because Pendergast bears a striking resemblance to the iconic detective, and has powers as eerily uncanny as Sherlock's. Readers will race toward the final page and, once there, will thirst for more.<br /><br />- Kate Ayers
B006RJTEIC|4.0|Great classic.  It was so was a look at what society may become.  Watching it today is even scarier how society is and may be going.
0439023513|1.0|I was in love with the first 2 books. They both had great storyline so naturally I was expecting a big bang for the finale. However, I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I felt like a lot of the details did not too much sense. For example, it took Katniss and group a long time to make into the center of the Capital but no time at all for the others to get there. Also Peeta was completely mentally destroyed in the whole book and he couldn't be with Katniss at all but magically after the war, they are married. I didn't see a point of killing Prim at all. Katniss already has a lot of doubt aobut Coin at that point already and what's point of her killing her own people. I showed that she's cruel but for an intelligent person like she should be, that was a really unnecessary and not very intelligent move at all. The book also ended really suddenly. It's like oh war is over so 20 years later Katniss and Peeta are living happily after. THE END. it was such a toned down and boring ending to an epic trilogy.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely disappointed. I hope the movie changes the story.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|As a long time Everly aficiando, it's wild to hear one of their albums done in it's entirety by someone else. I must say it's a job well done. Very nice that they didn't put there own 'spin' on any of the songs, just let them be. Maybe some concerts with the Everly's<br />would be in order?
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I would give it a 5 but I have run into some minor issues with things like being asked to spell words it hasn't shown me... for instance the German section asks you to spell K&auml;se (cheese) without showing me first. Still... It's great even with the handful of minor issues.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Awesome. I want to keep reading more about Sean and Michelle. This series grabs you from the beginning till the end.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|As an all-time-favorite-i-would-read-a-fishing-manual-if-he-wrote-it Brandon Sanderson fan, reading his books for me is always a karmic experience. I expected no less from Steelheart. So let’s see what did I hope this book will have?<br /><br />1) Original idea and world building. Although superheroes are not something new and are currently even a little bit overused in media, Sanderson still manages to make this topic fresh and it’s not just by renaming superheroes to Epics. They are not orphans from other planets or multi-billionaires or bitten by genetically modified spiders – Epics are ordinary people like you and me. Which leads us to…<br /><br />2) Moral dilemma or social experiment. Sanderson’s settings are always there to make us wonder about some interesting questions. What would you do if you got superpowers? Use them for greater good or for your benefit? I stopped dreaming about having superpowers long time ago, but those dreams usually involved invisibility so I can sneak in and eat as much candy as I want or flying. Not very humanitarian.<br />&#34;I know, better than anyone else, that there are no heroes coming to save us. There are no good Epics. None of them protect us. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&#34;<br /><br />3) Strong main character. David saw an Epic kill his father when he was little and is bent on revenge ever since. As always, Sanderson’s hero is not perfect – he has flaws, makes mistakes but in the end him (and us) learn a valuable lesson and make a right choice. Sadly, David never really won my heart. He always seemed too shallow either with his blind focus on revenge or with insta-love attraction to only hot girl he had prolonged contact with since… ever.<br /><br />4) Complex secondary characters. There is nothing typical or lacking in support roles, when Sanderson writes them and Steelheart is no exception. Each character is unique, has hidden depths and we learn more about them and get to love them (or hate them) as the plot unravels.<br /><br />5) Humor. Dark times need some kind of comic relief and Sanderson usually delivers it without a hitch. Steelheart has them in form of David’s bad metaphors and gang-member Cody who exaggerates his Scottish roots. For a reader to whom Steelheart is first book written by Sanderson, this might be good enough, but I have seen what he can do and this is a poor attempt of humor by his standards.<br /><br />6) Big twist. Every book by Sanderson I have read so far always had some big revelation near the end that changes your whole perspective of the world and characters. Some are instant, some are slow but they are always there. That is, until Steelheart. There are some surprise but not as earth-shattering as I am used to. Yes, I am spoiled.<br /><br />IN THE END…<br />Steelheart might not have turned out to be all I have hoped for, but for a young adult science fiction or dystopian fan it will be a great intro to the awesomeness of Sanderson’s writing. I can bet that original world building and addictive, intense plot is going to blow them away and turn them into adoring worshipers of Brandon Sanderson. If you are wondering what to read next – go with Mistborn Trilogy - you won't regret it!<br />As for fans of adult fantasy novels by Brandon Sanderson, they might find Steelheart lacking in some areas, but who are we are kidding, they are going to read Steelheart no matter what. Just like I am going to read the sequel Firefight, if nothing else I am intrigued to learn more about the origin of Epics.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy playing the game. It's a challenge the more levels you complete. You can play the entire game without spending any money.
B00BU1DH1M|4.0|Rebus is not navel gazing any more.  Sorry still seems to be the hardest word to say, but he's no longer wallowing in the past.  Fox has started hunting murderers and is completing his last case for Complaints.  Siobhan has developed into a mature leader, treating Rebus with the affectionate respect an erstwhile mentor deserves.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|I've been following this trilogy since the beginning and with The Black Eagle Inn, I find myself not only entranced once again by Fischer's portrayal of family, drama, and a war-ravaged country, but by his writing style and depth of the storyline it self.<br /><br />The main character, Anna, is fascinating, richly developed as she deals with scandal and drama while trying to maintain her life with the Inn.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot because the story is so worth reading.  I found myself visually captured by the descriptions of not just the characters, but of Bavaria itself, of the state of the country and I could almost feel the emotions of the characters as they live through a time which sits in infamy to this day.<br /><br />As a historian, I've been dedicated to this series, and continue to be impressed beyond words by how well researched it is.  Nothing is taken lightly, and it will tug at your heartstrings, but that's never a bad thing when it comes to historical fiction.  Once again, Fischer has a five star winner and I truly cannot wait to read more works from him again.
1401322786|5.0|Even though this was fiction, it makes you wonder about some of the things that people do because they want more and more and wind up with less and less until it's too late.
B005LAIH54|5.0|&#34;Clash of.....&#34; & this follow up are awesome movies despite it's numerous mixed reviews. A fantasy period piece that's action packed to the gills & epic with loads of monsters with some of the best special effects ever, & a star studded cast. This movie I rate right up there with others of the genre like 300 & Immortals. Some people are just way too critical. This is a cool film.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|By far, this was absolutely one of my favorite chapters of the Wimpy Kid series I have read. Thank you Jeff Kinney for making the series.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|just as fun as minecraft but its still different. it is its own idea. its totally worth getting.  finally came out on amazon
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Apparently the price went up from this morning but I don't care. That was a great episode and I forgot to set the DVR to record it before I left for my wedding yesterday so being able to get it at all was fine with me.
B008476HBM|3.0|I downloaded it for my wife because she wanted it but when she saw that it was on a tablet she kind of stepped back and she didn't read it, so i can't tell you if i like it or not, but all i can tell you is that it works since i tried it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I heard alot of chatter about Fifty Shades for years...finally started reading it a few months ago thinking it would just be gratuitous sex scenes....but the way the author has brought humanity, woundedness and redemptive love alive in the character, Christian Gray, has been amazingly seductive.  Can`t wait to start the last book....now.
B008NC2DF2|5.0|Beautiful packaging and artwork. Such a great album. It's the live DVD that definitely makes this edition worth it.<br />Check out the live version of The Apostate and you'll see what I mean:<br />[...]
B00CHCUR9I|5.0|If you're just getting into the World of the Walking Dead or have been a fan of the show yet not read the comic series yet than the Walking Dead #1 is for you.  The illustrations are top notch ,story fast paced and even reading on a Kindle I had no problem reading the font.  The Walking Dead #1 is a great start to the series, highly recommended and definitely worth the read.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great tutorial, learned lots of valuable skills and time savers in this book.  Makes it easy to apply to your everyday life, not just for when you're feeling motivated.
B00G0KY1UO|1.0|The game freezes every time we play :( I have a newer device with good memory and adequate space but this game still will not play correctly. I have not had problems with other games in the past.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Fantastic and lovable and poignant and endearing.  Jim Carrey gives a sweet, sensitive, nuanced performance as a mensch fallen happily/tragically/happily in love with an annoying/adorable/annoying free spirit.  Kate Winslett is flawless and should be given equal billing, time and again proving she is one of the great actresses of our time.  One of my favorite all-time movies, I'd give it a 10.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This story was good and told my death's perspective. it reminded me of when death takes a vacation. This story was very touching.

B000ID37KO|5.0|The Alfred Hitchcock classic is captivating.  It is thought by some that Hitchcock's fascination with accounts of actual birds attacking people in Monterey Bay, California led him to loosely adapt a story by Daphne DeMaurier, bringing us this edge of the seat nail bitter, The Birds.  Encouraging screenwriter Evan Hunter to develop the storyline and characters a bit more Hitchcock then cast those roles with such greats as Rod Taylor,  Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy and introduced Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels.  The folks living in Montego Bay were typical of the 60s' melodrama.  Nonetheless in typical Hitchcock fashion, the atmosphere of pure dread and anticipation captivates viewers of all ages.
0321934318|5.0|Since I have never used Lightroom before (I have always done my photo organizing in Photoshop Bridge), I decided the best guidebook would be a Scott Kelby book, as he is the best in walking you through the steps you need to take to use the program properly.  I have previously gotten his books on Photoshop Elements and Photoshop CS4.  This one on Lightroom so far is even more useful and more clearly written than usual.  I even enjoy his sarcastic comments which he sprinkles throughout the book.  Well done.  He gives you a great sense for how well the program is laid out.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|This is not the typical average-flight-gone-bad-and-resurrected movie.  It is tragic from the opening.  The stark realism of unredeemable choices may be depressing for some.  Character development and story line are somewhat lacking<br />however, Denzel Washington and the supporting cast is superb.  Serious subject with tragic consequences. Reality can be brutal.
B00F9040HU|4.0|The music very relaxing graphics great -2play the full version u purchase within the game , it doesn't mention that in the description of the game - I deleted it from my device only because it takes way 2 long during game play 2 load that was my only thing I disliked about it - the game is relaxing
B000002BFL|4.0|You can't go wrong with Bruce Springsteen.  It isn't my favorite of his, however I bought if for my husband who likes &#34;the Boss&#34; and listens to his music often in his car.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Powerful story about two very different cultures and adaptations necessary for a blended, adoptive family.  I enjoyed all the new learning that it presented.  Well done.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I read this on my I-pad while on vacation last week.  I liked the way the book began and it kept my interest throughout.<br />I felt bad for the actual bride at the beginning of the story, with her bridesmaids really not being there for her.<br />I thought the main male character was a bit desperate and they didn't marry for love, but in the end love conquers all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was so fun I have almost played for a year. When I first got my kindle I got it right away

B000XUBFE2|2.0|After hearing about this book from a friend and seeing that it was being turned in to a movie I had high hopes for this book. After struggling through 25% of the book I had to give up. The narration in this book is extremely confusing. It leads to a slow and boring read. I usually love historical fiction, but this is one book I would suggest passing on. I am probably going to give it another shot to try and finish the book, but at this point I'm moving on to the next book in my list.
B00C74HKF0|4.0|I love the doll she's a must for any fan of Audrey Hepburn my only dislike is hair mattel used way too much glue it's a mess I'm sure it can be fix overall I love the doll :)

B00BD99JMW|3.0|very disapointing ending. I felt that it was a total let down after the series. It was like the rug was puld out right from under you!
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|Story line was good and effects were good but was also very easy to predict what was going to happen which didn't make it as exciting
0920668372|1.0|I bought this book for sentimental reason/gag gift. Book was described as like new and it was... Unfortunately on the cover, there is an inscription from previous owner! Seller should have done a better job of noticing this... it was hard to miss!?!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is very fun and very addicting the minnions are hilarious. Its very challenging. The boss battles are very fun too.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a good read.  I enjoyed it very much even for as short as it is.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was there are parts that I feel could have been elaborated on more.  There were times I wanted more information and was instead forced to move forward in the story.  I understand this is simply how the author has written, but at many times it left me wanting more than was given.  4.5 stars is more appropriate than 4 starts, but that was not an option.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this book is a amazing book im a 12 year old I red this book but the movie dosint follow the book
B0064MPXFA|4.0|The series is very catching and it gives a good plot. It is definitely a series that I will continue to watch.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Good fun, well written with good characters and an engaging plot. Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore will keep you turning the pages.
B003G4W49C|4.0|At a surface level it is an entertaining light read that will capture the imagination of young teens and adults. However embedded within its pages is a fantastic study of human morality.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love this case! It has all the features I wanted with one exception. I wish it had a lower viewing angle. It has 3 now, but they are close to straight up and down. It isn't a big deal, I just prop it up on a book. I would highly recommend this.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Cool show. This season is acceptable, though I've not seen the same level of action that was in Season 1.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The graphics are great and the plot of the game is good too my only complaint is that the vault fills up way too fast and the fact that there are some bugs that need to be fixed. Other than that it's been hard too stop playing I think it's an enjoyable game.
0385008961|4.0|This is not a bad novel, although it is filled with stereotypes. This novel basically deals with corruption in the banking industry, and is actually more relevant today than it was when this novel was written. It is filled with stereotypes: the Socialist girlfriend of the banker is wise, good, and sexy while the religious director of the bank is everyone's uptight crooked capitalist. 1960s, anyone? Setting that aside, this is a readable if not great novel that does acquaint the reader with certain basics of the banking industry, and it does so in an entertaining and engaging way. RJB.

B000JMKOI2|5.0|I just reread this book over the weekend after watching the film. Normally I hate movie versions of books that I like, but this Factotum is one of the exceptions to that rule. I thought they did a good job with the film and portraying Bukowski's voice. Rereading the novel confirmed my thoughts.

0553293397|4.0|The follow-up to The Caves of Steel and the second of Asimov's robot mystery novels. Like its predecessor, it's a blend of genres, a pure murder mystery wrapped in the garb of a science fiction book. It is as you'd expect. A tight, sometimes clever mystery focused on how one might manipulate the Three Laws of Robotics, solved by our reluctant human hero and his surprising capable robot partner. Solid but not essential, read this if you enjoy Asimov's work or like the idea of science fiction mystery stories, but don't worry that you're missing an essential SF title if you give it a pass.<br /><br />This book was actually adapted by the BBC in 1969 for a program called Out of the Unknown. In its infinite wisdom (sarcasm!), the BBC erased the episode. No copies are known to exist.

076790382X|5.0|After living in Britain for 20 years, Bill Bryson returned to America with his English wife and moved to New England. Once there, he wrote a series of columns for an English newspaper generally about re-adapting to American life (but more widely about anything and everything that sprang into his head). This book collects those columns. The result is a brilliant bathroom book delighting in the quirks of American culture.<br /><br />Indeed, these columns are funny, endearing, engaging and charming. Unlike his earlier book that is roughly on the same topic, &#34;The Lost Continent,&#34; Bryon's bitterness is generally left on the front stoop, replaced here with a sense of humor and understanding. Oh, he's got criticism of American life and culture -- lots of it -- but it's filled with joy and smiles, and unlike the aforementioned book appears to come from a place of love rather than a place of scorn.<br /><br />Plus, since this is a collection of columns, the book lends itself to reading in short spurts. Perfect bathroom book! Highly recommended.
B00AJFEHAU|5.0|Daughter loves it.  Got here in time and Has a good sound.  Now have to find out when they put out a fill CD
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I loved this book. I have been caught in Theo's world all week, and will have difficulty adjusting to the real one.
B000FA675C|5.0|Fun book, especially if we consider that it is fiction and based on little other than the author's imagination. Don't take any of the hidden (or overt) messages in the book seriously!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved Veronica Roth's two previous books in this series.  So I anxiously waited for the release of Allegiant.  Feeling puzzled as to some of the angry responses to this book, I delved into it as soon as I could.  While parts of the book were distracting, I did get the ending and knew it had to be this way.  I love Allegiant too.
B00E6890VC|4.0|Great record. Sounds lovely and came packaged well. This album is destined to be a classic. Easy to listen to it in it's entirety.
B0081ISUOG|4.0|This app is great for short-term stopwatch &amp; timer usage (meaning it does not count in days, months, or years). The counter has a format that displays the hour, minute, second, and millisecond.<br />I like this app. It's a simple, customizable, easy-to-use app with plenty of options. It runs in the background, even if your device goes to sleep, so it's dependable.<br />The only drawback I've noticed so far is that it lacks an exit button. Another positive is that it's easy to force close (where as,some apps actually require a restart of your device, this app shuts down immediately when force closed).
B00EYRCD8M|5.0|Great album!!!! Came packaged well. This is our new family fave. After listening to the mp3s and clips from iTunes, the sound of her voice is even more amazing on vinyl. Great lyrics and the kids, ages 6, 8, and 10 all really love listening.

B00975L81Y|5.0|what ever you do dont listen to those that are badmouthing this album I have been a Cradle of Filth fan for 9 years I dont believe that their close to done. Its not right to slam a band for going into a different direction. Not all cradle o filth albums are symphonic that is a rumor. This is a very solid album with a lot hard hitting beats and vocals to match. Dani Filth is in his 40's and their as been no original members of the band sense dusk and her embrace. In a way Cradle of filth as been Paul and Dani and a few others. Please dont let other reviews who take swings at your perception of this album who do not understand Cradle of filth. Sample for yourself and make your own opinion and I would say sample everything that these masters of Dark metal have to offer.

B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Great special effects and action are the high points in MOS. The opening scenes on Krypton are beautifully realized and the designs are reminiscent of H.R. Giger for those who have followed his career (i.e., Alien, etc.). The fluid metal technology which recalled Terminator 2 was also especially cool.<br /><br />The middle dragged a bit but the final action scenes go on seemingly forever and are absolutely spectacular and intense.<br /><br />A few plot elements don't seem to make much sense (such as General Zod wanting to transform earth into Krypton which would nullify their superpowers, also mentioned by other reviewers here), but what the heck, it's a movie based on a comic-book character so I don't expect a Vulcan level of logical consistency. It's just plain rock 'em sock 'em fun as God-like super-humans decide to stage the ultimate fight between good and evil with our little rock of a planet as the battlefield.<br /><br />Cast was excellent overall even if the script wasn't always stellar, but again, it's a comic book based movie and I don't expect Madame Bovary. If I want that I can always read Madame Bovary. No thanks, Les Miserables at over 1000 pages by Victor Hugo was enough for me.<br /><br />It was also good to see Kevin Costner as Superboy's father. The leading man roles he commanded in the 80s and 90s are now long gone, but he does a fine job as Superboy's father who must mentor a very unusual son.<br /><br />So overall a very visually exciting and action-packed movie that delivers a lot of bang for your buck.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|I stumbled on this band when they opened for A7X in San Antonio.  They stole the show.  It is impossible to categorize them.  They are theatrical and over the top and yet the music is beautiful and mesmerizing.  They sing in Latin and English and while some of the music is rock driven, a lot of it sounds like an unholy church choir playing a funeral dirge or a somber hymn.  I loved it, it was innovative and completely unlike anything I had ever heard before.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Excellent quality for the price. I received these 2 days late, but I didn't really care too much about that personally. I'm no audiophile by any means, but these surpass any headphones I've owned so far, and for the reasonable price they're at, I'd definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality, affordable pair of headphones.

B008A36R2Y|3.0|I am somewhat torn as to what score to give this item. The first time I ordered from this listing I ended up with a fake arduino with discolored screen printing and bad components that died within a few days. The second time I ordered from this listing I ended up with a good Arduino Leonardo that has been working very well since I received it.<br /><br />In the end this listing is a bit of a gamble and it is hard to guess whether or not you will get a good board.

0553801473|5.0|Book 5!  Love this series!  Can't wait for &#34;Winds of Winter&#34;!  This one was a bit of a slow read, as there are plenty of characters to get caught up with from &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34;.  But once the action gets started, you wish &#34;Winds of Winter&#34; was there to grab and keep going!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I had to come back and edit this review because I have since had time to appreciate the ease and reliability of the Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player compared to other Web-content delivery devices. For the record, I have two Smart DVD players, one Samsung and one Sony. three Roku boxes, and I have used two Smart TVs, one from Vizio and one from LG.<br /><br />My original comments on the Chromecast (abridged version): \\"The good: Great price. Neat device. Great packaging. Easy to plug in. Comes with an HDMI extension, for tight spaces in some TVs. Easy set up. Good tech support from Google. The Bad: I bought it to push content from my mobile device and from my mobile network, not my LAN.\\"<br /><br />OK, some further explanation here, because when I first bought this thing, I misunderstood its capabilities. And, I might add, so did some of the tech support people at Google, who insisted we could get this to work on a Mobile Network. Fact is, if you think you can use this through your cell phone and your cell phone mobile Network, think again. You need to have Wifi Internet capability in your house in order for this to work. If you want to have content from your phone pushed to your TV, you need a different type of dongle.<br /><br />OK, so, originally, I gave the Chromecast a 1-star because it did not work from my mobile network and in the beginning Google gave me the impression it would. Now I'm giving it 4-stars. I'd give it 5 but it doesn't link with Amazon or carry the wealth of Web-content programming other smart wifi devices carry.<br /><br />The main thing is this. The Chromecast has a great interface. It's fast, and it shoots out HD as well if not better than anything I own. My Sony DVD player is a slow, old dog and constantly resets my router's IPs, which can be a pain in the arse. My Samsung requires that I re-initialize my accounts with User ID and Password every time there's a power failure or the device is unplugged. The Chromecast never does this.<br /><br />One bad thing, I have an older Android phone, running some pre-Jellybean OS. After a recent software update by Google Chromecast, my old Android became obsolete and refused to cast to the TV. You probably should be running an Android phone with jellybean 4.2 or better.Android phone, running some pre-Jellybean OS.

B007QA3AH2|5.0|It was better than I thought and funnier.  It had a good story line and I would watch it again.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I've used this app for quite some time and only now discovered their lengthy list of permissions - many of which I find invasive and extremely unnecessary. I'm promptly transferring all my data to Springpad (a MUCH better app!) and then deleting Evernote from all my devices! I highly suggest everyone take a look at the permissions themselves.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Loved it! 'Nuf said. Appearantly Amazon disagrees with my assessment. Enough not said. Well isn't that special. Here you go...
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I loved this book. Some of the negative reviews do have at least a grain of truth to them. The book does take you back and forth between characters without making it very far each time. However, this didn't bother me at all and I think a big part of the reason why it does this is because it is the first book of what appears to be a huge series. There is going to be a lot of world/character building. I thought the characters were pretty interesting, and there were interesting twists for each one, especially towards the end.<br /><br />For anyone reading the reviews, just remember, all of your all-time favorites have their share of bad reviews. I think the length bothered a lot of people who didn't want to take the time to get into a brand new world. I enjoyed the entire book, start to finish and I cannot wait for the next one.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|Like a bunch of Saturday Night Live skits sewn together. Jennifer Aniston still does a great job acting. But, this movie is pretty lame<br />from a story line and the rest of the acting is somewhat pathetic. Probably not appropriate for kids under 18, but your call.
B008133MDK|5.0|Left begging for more!!!! Both actors deliver +100% on performance!! One question....when does the next season start????? Need more now
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My girlfriend suggested I read this. Once I started, I couldn't put it down.  It's not the sex that keeps the pages turning, for me, it is the look at how we act, and feel.  Much better than my typical nonfiction.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|This book started A little slow but soon I couldn't put it down.  The only problem is that I have gift the next book now to see how the characters develop further.  Good for kids and adults with any interest in historical fiction regarding Mexico.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|Former UN investigator Gerry Lane is with his family when the zombie wave hits New York City. It's fast, swift and terrifying. In lieu of protection for his family, Gerry agrees to find the source, Patient Zero, at the risk of his own life. What he learns has less to do with Patient Zero and Ground Zero, where it all began--how it all began and who knew what about the zombie infestation first.<br /><br />I have not read the book and not having read it, the whole backstory is MIA and a few of the 'clues' to explain how Gerry came up with the idea of a pseudo-cure is vague though handled better than I thought. This could have been a muddling, confusing and very sub-standard zombie-apoc movie but the handling of the script and editing helps to give a more cohesive movie based on a book rather than a frustrating interpretation of the original concept.<br /><br />In terms of originality, all the credit goes to Max Brooks, for giving us an a-typical hero and a typical story-line that felt fresh. His treatment of the cause as much as the pseudo-cure is clever and different. There is hardly any gore but lots of scare moments that made me jump. The zombies in this movie isn't that far off the George A Romero version but enough differences make it feel fresh. The performance of the film itself, its characters, is a white-wash. This is no character study but all action. It's good action and done pretty darn well. Brad Pitt rarely emotes, and the only real surge of any emoting is a young Israeli solder. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, plan on reading the book and can't wait for the sequel.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Just what I needed. Cant buy this item locally anymore. Checked all major retailers in my area and they dont carry this item any longer.  My camera works great.  Unlike a lot of people I prefer this over telephone photos.
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|It is a fun game but it does have some pay to win elements. Playable without dumping extra money in but you have to do some grinding.
0143116738|2.0|I was also disappointed with this book and agree with the other 2-star reviews.  Reading about celebrities does not change one's life or change the course of education.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Zimmer's music does what film music should, augment the film whether the audience is aware of it or not. I actually think this particular score is brilliantly done. Sure, you can hear some 'Batman' influences, but that's all part of a 'Zimmer style and sound.' The little 'rising motif' in this score is worth it all, for me. Plus, the production is amazing by the recording engineers. I'd love to know how they make it all sound so fantastic!

I'm not sure why so many people had a problem with this book. I am now excited to see what's going on with the other characters in A Dance With Dragons. I highly recommend this book!
1492977055|4.0|As coloring books go, this one is on steroids, and the drawings are very fun and interesting. As an art book, it's not that great because it is pretty coloring-book-like in its print quality and presentation. So it just depends on what you want it to be: Coloring book (which is all it claims to be) = 5 stars; Art/drawing book = 3 stars. So I'll settle and give it 4, which I hope is good enough to help the author sell one more, because I really do enjoy looking at it and I can tell that they put a lot of work into it.

I never had content of individual stories, only the fact of the trains and the plight of the children, and this book puts a great period at the end of the proverbial sentence. It is great to learn the families who came from these children now have reunions and a history worthy of celebration from such a difficult past. &#34;Congratulations to all of you. You are from strong and enduring people&#34;.

Perhaps only her own laser-like-precision in word choices combined with her quirky, powerfully emotive drawings could ever explain her. Can you imagine a roller skating ninja riding on a unicorn's back who catches a fly with chopsticks and kisses it gently only to let it go into the clouds and then moments later catch it again for another round? Something like that. Plus, gorgeous, delicious darkness on all the edges. I would follow her anywhere, even the dentist, which says a lot.

B00CRJSWBQ|3.0|Z87 (i5 4670) is not noticeably faster than my previous H67 (i5 2400).<br /><br />USB external drive problems. I have a USB 3.0 hard drive that works fine on other computers, but randomly disconnects on the Z87.  When I have multiple USB hard drives plugged in, boot time goes from 25 seconds to over a minute.<br /><br />11/24/2013: Finally got an 802.11ac router  The on-board wireless adapter crashes every time I try to connect to the 5Ghz band. Asus gave me a RMA # for the motherboard., but was told that Asus does not do Advance replacement. Now I'm without a computer until they get the motherboard back to me.<br /><br />My Background: This is probably the 20th computer I have built, but it's been a while. Over the last 8 years my employer has provided me with Desktops &amp; Laptops. I have been pretty spoiled with the pre-built computers; unpack, plug-in, and use. I don't game at all, and only use the computer for Photoshop, proprietary accounting software, and the usual web/email. In my old age I really hate  wasting time troubleshooting problems.. In the future I'll probably stick to pre-built computers until I start having problems with them.

Maybe it's because I'm older now, but I loved this book. It was packed with great meaning and for some reason struck a chord with me. Definitely recommend it. Though I would recommend it for older kids (high school level or higher) because they might be able to appreciate it more.

0865478015|5.0|The Antidote by Oliver Burkeman is subtitled, Happiness for People Who can’t stand Positive Thinking and this subtitle sums up the main idea of the book. The prevailing view is that positive thinking leads to success in life and happiness. What Burkeman shows is that the opposite is often the case. He begins with the example of Dr. Robert Schuller whose basic message is to cut out the word “impossible” from your life and who is one of the foremost advocates of the power of positive thinking.<br /><br />The book contains a number of examples demonstrating the value of taking a negative path to happiness. Such ideas as enjoying uncertainty, becoming familiar with failure and valuing death are presented. Stoic and Buddhist perspectives are also described. Such favored approaches as positive affirmations are shown to be ineffective.  The views of Albert Ellis, Alan Watts, Rema Chadron and Eckhart Tolle are presented. The collapse of your apparent security is shown as a good thing because it represents a chance to confront life as it really is. The idea that the only constant is change is made clear.<br /><br />In sum this book enables the reader to think about life in a different way from the standard view of looking at things from a positive perspective. It provides a needed balance in our approach to living a happy life. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to have a better and happier life.

C... it was pathetically mis-casted & needed more superior/polished English actress.<br /><br />How many buildings and glass can you go through, If they were obviously looped it would have been a step up! There are a lot of<br /><br />directors who could have done much better. Ridley Scott, Spielburg the list could be endless. It started out pretty darn good then nose dive<br /><br />from, there. Much to fast proving he was not an ordinary child, the bus, please! Then the fire on his upper torso on drilling rig<br /><br />what did they use, apple final cut pro, lol beyond that of cheesy!
B0031P4FFM|5.0|The books themselves are great! They came in perfect condition and I'm very glad to have them on my bookshelf. They also arrived in a good time range. Thank you so much!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Wow. I'm an INTROVERT. This is so crazy to me because I've thought of myself as an extrovert. But I'm actually a highly sensitive introvert who's become very adept at faking extroversion. I can speak in front of a crowd with ease, but I always speak about things I have great confidence in. This book explains A LOT. Thanks to the author for writing a great book, it has truly opened my eyes.
0385503954|5.0|I loved this book. Such wonderfully flawed characters.  It prompted me to get his next book, which was not as good.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Note: I am one of Mr King's 'constant readers' and I think he is one of the best writers of American fiction. I saw that with absolutely zero irony and having read many 'great writers'. It is also true that I grew up on his books and became a writer of horror screenplays in no small part due to his influence.<br /><br />Big steam indeed.<br /><br />All this means is that I had some trepidation hearing that Danny Torrance's character was being revisited. I had no reason to fear. Like his best books this one tackles the mystery of the human condition through the eyes of the  most human of people. King takes on an intense journey that is both unique and familiar. Familiar because Mr King writes in a familiar cadence and this this is, after all a familiar character. But it explores the darkness lurking at the edge of the street lamp in a way that feels organic and terrifying. Just like it should.<br /><br />This is an album for the fans by the greatest of literary rock stars and I am grateful for it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|His best since A Time To Kill and A Painted House. A great blend of the courtroom and real life in the hands of a skilled storyteller.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I wanted to watch again before I go see &#34;Catching Fire&#34; . It was just as good as I remembered it. What I like about it  is that it follows the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Thought provoking how a society raises their children to accept death at the hands of other children, Suzanne Collins plunges the reader into a post war era complete with crime and punishment. Fast paced,action packed good adult fiction that kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Great movie, is like 1984 by George Orwell , is a science fiction movie and Christian Bale is so great
1936608898|4.0|A real eye opener! It's amazing what a difference clean eating makes. My life was so changed by this book that I bought several copies for coworkers and family.
B00FJSSK1O|5.0|Saw this \\"Livestream\\", all since involved in the DVD/CD production have done a great job capturing the night ,overall about as good a set-list as  you could expect over the no less than 3 hours ( including the orchestra-only  interlude). Great performance and sound quality start to end -personally would have loved \\"Tides Of Time\\" in there as well, but then someone else's \\"must have\\" would have had go to make  way for that, anyhow it all adds up to a well balanced look -back over Epica' s first ten years and several  studio albums to date<br /><br />The light show has had a fair few \\"thumbs-downs\\". Much of the time it felt like it did actually fit their music well, though also at some points the massed ranks of cold white searchlights do all seem very  OTT.  If now and again Simone and co all  seem to disappear entirely into some white light of the void then please do not adjust your set , it will pass and they will all reappear after a few  seconds. Nobody could have faulted the band if they had basically stuck to their 2012 touring lightshow.<br /><br /> All that said,  for me it did not detract  from the DVD near as much as in the original Livestream - maybe  since this time I was expecting it , maybe more camera angles to edit from has helped , along not least with vastly better sound quality . It NEARLY drops the end result down to just  \\"Four Stars\\", but in the end the sheer energy and originality of the performance just overcomes all doubts !<br /><br />\\"Retrospect\\" could well be taken to be the first Epica DVD, if so that is only true in part: Their [[ASIN:B000A2WMOA Epica: We Will Take You with Us]]DVD came out all of nine years back ,a live STUDIO re-recording of \\"Phantom Agony\\", re-ordered to round off with an acoustic set. No live audience (so no light show!),can't recommend too highly equally  for already fans or as intro to the band
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Another great CD by Katy Perry. The albums is full of great music. Plenty of catchy songs to dance to, this album shows Katy Perry is showing no signs of slowing down. A fantastic album!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|You have to love the electronic music of Daft punk but combined with anime visuals I highly enjoyed this. I remember being glued to the television screen back when mtv played the music video: one more time (you know when they used to showcase music videos and didn't fill their lineup with reality crap tv).
0375842209|5.0|The book begins a bit confusing with &#34;Death&#34; explaining himself, but after I got into the actually story and understood the writer's presentation, it turned out to be an excellent look at the wartime life of Nazi Germany. I did not like it that the writer told you about things to happen several chapters before they happened in the story, but other than that it was an excellent book that presented a very vivid picture of life at that time.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Anyone who loved Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy should own this. I highly enjoyed the movies and if you didn't then there is no reason at all to pick this up.
0525425772|5.0|JOhn Grisham does it again. He has written another young adult book that presents the essnce of a boy at early adolescent age. In addition, his story line gives the reader a vivid picture of life and conflicts facing Theodore. Grisham descriptive writing keeps the reader interested throughout the book. I think this series will become the &#34;Hardy Boys&#34; of the 2000's. I look forward to the next book in the series
B008D28HYS|4.0|This is A Very Fun Game, But I Would Love An Update Soon. The Regular CrossMe Game Has Been Updated Recently. Please Update CrossMe Color Soon.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I have always been a nonfiction guy. However, the combination of history and fiction woven together in this wonderfully crafted novel was superb. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history as well as an exquisitely written and constructed story.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I have both the 4500mAh and 6000mAh external batteries from Anker. For anyone wondering if this will charge the phone, here's a data point my my experience: The 6000 version will give my 1.5 year old Droid Razr a full charge, whereas the 4500 will only charge it a maximum of 90%. I'm therefore keeping the 6000 version and returning the 4500 version. The 6000 is also the exact same dimensions as my Droid Razr phone with a low-profile s-line case on it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is better than the one on Facebook much easier not complicated like the one Facebook the story line is better I love this game
159514188X|5.0|Its really good! I wish I had more time to just sit down and read it. The only problem I had was the cover was dirty so I had to wipe it off with a disinfectant wipe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun addictive feel good game. The music is an earworm.<br />The art is entertaiining. The games are challenging but give you a break at time.
B000ICL3CE|5.0|Released in late summer of 1985, The Head On The Door was the 6th album from The Cure and was in a few subtle ways, a big turning point in the career of the band. First off, the group went from being a three piece to a two piece to now a five piece with the addition of Boris Williams on drums and Porl Thompson on guitar and the return of Simon Gallup on bass who had been absent from the band for the previous three years. More then that though, it was a shift from the darker mood of earlier releases as well the experimental approaches found on The Top (1984). While they had released a couple of pop singles before, this is the first record to really feature a more commercial appeal and was a hint of what would come during the band's commercial peak during the late 80s and early 90s. There is still dark subject matter in the lyrics but the pop song structure is so apparent that you don't notice it sometimes. Robert Smith and the group contribute different musical genres (as they would continue to do in records to follow) including world music, dance pop, melancholy ballads and even stadium rock as found on &#34;Push&#34;, my personal favorite track here. The singles were the catchy &#34;In Between Days&#34; and the brilliant dance beats of &#34;Close To Me&#34; which features one of Gallup's finest bass riffs. Not as ambitious as the records to come but it works as a welcome start for those more interested in The Cure's later breakthrough period.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game!!! I play for hours and I'm 43 yrs old!! It makes me feel like a kid again plus I like the dragons in this!!!
B0026RLM8O|5.0|love weather report.. i listened to them while a high school freshman and was hooked ever since. Wayne Shorter is classic
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|this is a great movie for all the family. Now i'm looking the version with subtitles in spanish to send to my family in Mexico
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Great classic rock music. It takes me back to my college days at old Mizzou. If you wore out your LPs like I did. This replaces many of the songs.
0547396945|5.0|Very good story for teaching colors, shapes, differences, and beginning spanish! It is a cardboard book, so young children can &#34;read it themselves&#34; without ripping pages, and it is basic enough that actual beginning readers (I'd say 3-5) can read it themselves. It is also a little longer than I originally thought it would be, which makes for a longer story time at night!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|As soon as I installed it my battery quickly ran down and my Droid Razor got hot. Recharged and it did the same thing again. Went back to my Verizon store and they checked the battery usage for this app and found it to be very high. They removed the app and everything has been fine for the past three weeks.
B00G91WB3S|3.0|It was actually a pretty good movie, and I am so glad it didn't turn into another Superman Returns debacle (that was a terrible movie). It didn't have the wow factor that I wanted, but since I haven't encountered a superman movie that does, I wasn't disappointed. The special effects were awesome and so realistic, and I loved how they used flashbacks of his past to explain different parts of the movie. However, it just isn't one of those movies that I want to watch again like Avatar or Star Trek (those are my movie choices, but you may have others). Maybe superman's story is still too advanced for movie production today, but who knows it might just be me. I thought that this movie was pretty cool though. I liked it, but I can't give it four stars. More like 3 and a half.
B000V39KDO|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever! Everyone in the entire family enjoyed it. We have watched it several times. This copy is a gift for friend.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Super addictive. One of the only mobile games that I have completed 100%. Easy to jump in and out of which is perfect for a game on your phone.
B00992CF6W|4.0|my tilted says it all so yea it a good app you should buy it minecraft tabs: items block .....
B008RXYOKY|5.0|works as expected. But I later learned that firewire 800 is outdated technology and even though plugged into the thunderbolt port my external ran slow and then stopped working. This had nothing to do with the connection.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I felt it was well thought out and had relevant topics.  She gives many good examples of both how we hold ourselves back as women, as well as how the infrastructure is skewed against us. It opens a great discussion about how far we've come, and what is next on the agenda. Highly recommended!
B000004756|3.0|Great but lacking some of the fire from Friday night in San Francisco. These guys are phenomenal but this is my least fav of the 3 discs.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This book is a very fun read.  Painting a vividly astounding metaphor for a young boys journey across the Pacific Ocean in a life raft accompanied by a tiger . This story interweaves reality and fantasy in these pages of  epic survival.  Intelligent and well written this book will have you excited with every turn of the page !
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The only negative is that it needs more levels. I got to level 10 and done :( need more levels please
B000002A46|5.0|Amazing CD. Mariah Carey certainly knows how to bring out the holdiay seasons for everyone! This is a remarkable cd that you must have for the holidays! Happy Holidays!!
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|80's Reminds me of something Madonna would have made in the 80's.<br />Sounds dated,<br />I find myself tapping my feet BUT can't picture myself listening to this EVER AGAIN.
B00466HM28|3.0|So I have had the MPK mini 25-Key for about a year. I am giving it 3 stars since I am a little let down by the pads. I expected more from Akai. Now I guess for a sub $100 item it they do the job, but the pads are stiff, non responsive, clunky, and lame. The rest of the controller is fine and does the job, but be warned. If you have bigger fingers you will not be able to &#34;play&#34; the keys. I have to turn my fingers sideways to avoid hitting more than one at a time. If the pads are not all that important to you and you have micro fingers this may work for you.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is addicting and fun, but money hungry - you could seriously add up some money playing this.  Amazon has other match 3 games which don't ask for money to progress.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|If you are nostalgic for comic book stories, this is an action adventure film that fills the bill.  It takes a certain suspension of conscious reality in order not to get hung up on the violations of scientific principle, but if you can manage it you'll find this work very entertaining and the special effects a treat for the eye.
B001TH16DI|5.0|When I switched over from VHS to all DVD I didn't want to purchase each of these individually. Now I don't have to
0316204366|5.0|Excellent book.  Opens your inner eye to things one takes for granted.  A must for people who want to overcome to become
B003VANOFY|5.0|These are great and they have a good range.  The controls are wonderful and I can stop iTunes if I need to from the kitchen.
B00GO95BUU|1.0|$6.99? REALLY Amazon?  Been a faithful purchaser of episodes (including the specials) since you started the service, and this is clearly an attempt to gouge me.  When I first started reloading the page at 4 am EST, it had a price of $1.99, same as the others, but 'currently unavailable'.  Ok, I'll get it in a few hours...<br /><br />You have disappointed me Amazon.  There are all sorts of less than legal ways for me to see this, but I chose to buy it through you... until you pulled this stunt.  Hold on, its on Youtube now.  Talk to you later...
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Pleased with John Grisham after all these years. Most authors get caught up in writing quick novels for the money. John is still writing with the same mindset that he started with, maybe just more polished. It was enjoyable book. Thank you for not changing.
0345803493|2.0|I think the writing is poor. Also, I had a hard time getting into the subject matter. For many women, it's a hot and steamy romance. BUt I couldnt get past the impropability of this and the bad dialogue.
1451666179|4.0|A collection of hilarious shizzle she's posted on her blog with a little extras. Love the book and the whole concept. Read the whole thing in less than an hour though. A perfect gift to anyone IMHO.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved that Roth wrote this book from both Tris' perspective and Tobias' perspective.<br /><br />Also, as painful as it is to read, this was the perfect ending to this series.
1250038820|3.0|It's just a collection of pictures with little sayings here and there. Not the actual stories you see on HONY. Am a little disappointed but still.... Can't be helped.
1401938906|5.0|OMG!  Love this book so much!  I highly recommend it to everyone!  Funny, a fast read, enlightening and puts all that quantum physics stuff into practical terms with experiments to prove every theory.  It will blow your mind and change your life for the better.  Run, don't walk, click away and get this book.  You'll never see the world the same way again :)  I'm giving this as a gift to all my friends.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not a big SiFi fan but I loved this book. I can't wait to get Speaker For The Dead. I say get it. I don't care what your favorite genre is, get this book!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|One of the greatest fantasy novels I've ever read. Characters are extremely well developed, the world he created is beautifully peculiar and believable, and the story is a rollercoaster made by a master storyteller. Highly recommend it.
B000002KET|5.0|one of the better black Sabbath albums out their, and it`s worth the price. everything ozzy has sang on he`s been great at it.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|This book was an interesting mix of science fiction and history.  The time jumping aspect while interesting was not as facinating as the firebombing at Dresden and led me to do more research on it.  I believe that portion was more autobiographical which made it more real.  This was one of the many horrors of World War II that is not so well known.  Perhaps because it was perpetrated by the Americans and the British.  The title had kept me from reading this for years until I found out why it was so named.  Its a good read and a book that is hard to put down.  I look forward to reading more of his works.
B000002KFJ|4.0|love black Sabbath, they are one of the best bands out their, if you are a true ozzy fan then you`ll want all the black Sabbath albums he sang on.
B00F2362IE|4.0|would be a 5 but it takes too long to load and keeps going back to home or saying loading
B000FGGE68|3.0|If you like Mila's athleticism you will not be disappointed.  If you want a plot, go elsewhere.  Choreography is noteworthy; it makes this flic.
B000002IOY|5.0|Great Metal Album, not because is the overkill landmark. But the album is so original. Like not other album ever that had come out from the 80's metal sound. rock from beginning to end.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|This is a story that needed to be told.  I would have preferred more truth and less fiction injected to heightened suspense.  The acting was good, but not noteworthy.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Happy with this purchase.  Great option for kids and the extra pieces and options make it fun. Many colour options are available
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game  it's amazing all of the minions are amazing. there's<br />a lot of cool places to explore and my favourite is the vector battle .
B00E9A656K|3.0|Ok so the graphics are amazing and really awesome but the game overall was not quite impressive it was boring I mean all you do is press the gear button the whole time and you win so it wasn't all that coming from a girl it should really matter but I don't suggest this game to anyone don't waist your time
160774273X|5.0|This is the third bread making book I have used. The use of a cast iron pot is by far the better way to go to bake bread in the oven.No more fire bricks or spraying the oven with water. I aquired a second cast iron pot at a garage sale for a few dollars and make two at a time . Making bread ( good bread) is a science that you make into a &#34;art&#34; once you adjust the recipe to suit your taste.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! I literally play everyday :) Thanks for making such a fun app and a great way to interact.
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|It's a great game but u do the same thing over and over so I do not play it any more because it got boring
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Because it shouldn't take months to be able to move to a higher level, there is no sense in making it this hard, and everyone can not afford to buy the added help especially when there only income is limited, Thank you.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|if only there where more time<br /><br />its a great spin off of minecraft and its fun<br />but u get like 45 minutes so great but not great<br />if you want to buy the full version its 3.99 but good game over all
B0015KO52S|5.0|Fantastic album. Great poetry. Carolina story? is a very dark and moving tale. Of course, to find out the real story, you'll have to ask the milkman.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved it. It started slowly and was a little boring, but it picked up soon after. The plot was interesting and emotional. I loved how it doesn’t get sad until the end, saving me from the tears until the last minute. Jamie was such a genuine character and I love how brought out the best in Landon.  The way the story unfolds and builds upon each interaction with Jamie and Landon makes it such a good read.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|There are so many wonderful versions of songs on here, but Pretty Saro melted my heart. Man can Bob sing. Days of 49 just sticks in my head.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The most inspirational book I have ever read, and this is better than the Bible which I have read 3 times over many years.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Unfortunately not too many services support this technology yet. I hope many more in the future or this was pretty much a waste of money and natural resources.
B00004TDTO|5.0|bought for a dvd library and it was perfect. no scratches or problems with anything. great movie from the 80's
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I loved this story which is definitely not my genre, but it was a great story with a very warm and likable character in the likes of Alma Whitaker.<br /><br />I did not read the author's first book Eat, Pray, Love, but I did see the movie. I did not care for it. I totally believe that is because Elizabeth Gilbert puts a lot of feeling and warmth into her characters that just did not come through in the movie version. At least she did in this one.<br /><br />I am sure Hollywood will look to make this book into a movie as well and I will watch it. However, I am glad that I will see it with the knowledge of having read the book.<br /><br />The story spans the life of Alma Whitaker who lives to be 90 years old with all her thoughts, dreams, concerns and knowledge. It is a wonderfully told story about a woman who most would say lived an unhappy life, but she didn't feel that way. Her ups, downs, trials, tribulations and jubilation a make for a wonderfully entertaining read that I thoroughly enjoyed. Yes, sometimes it was a little too technical what with all the moss talk, but that did not hinder or distract me in anyway.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|This is an adequate headset if you are not ready to invest much in your Bluetooth headset.  It was easy to use right out of the box - though you do have to pair it since it won't automatically pick up.  To charge you need to use the provided power cord, but charging doesn't take long, so it won't be sucking up the available outlet that long.  The sound is okay, not great, but it works.  The only real drawback for me was that it will only work on your right ear.  So if, like me, you prefer to be able to move it around, you will need to look elsewhere.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A wonderful story narrated by death during a horrible time. A little slow at times, but it still held my interest. I'm really glad I bought it and read it. I can't wait, now, to see the movie.
B0058DRSHW|4.0|A classic read.  It's one of those books every one should read at least once. Some content is a little dated but the core ideas behind the book are brilliant.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This just another great one. Seen them all and this ones good too! DC as an aging Ops MIA then back in the saddle.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun fun fun  happy happy joy joy good game cant stop...oh no...help help help i cant quit this.darn game help
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|I know some of the information in this movie is contested by those at Sea World.  But I am willing to bet enough of it is not exaggeration to warrant the end of Orcas in captivity.  Almost reminded me of watching the movie &#34;Roots.&#34;  Orcas who cause &#34;trouble&#34; will be sent away, even as their pod grieves over their loss.  The Orcas all don't speak the same &#34;language&#34; which means some are never accepted and must spend most of their time in what amounts to solitary confinement.  They are treated as money-making merchandise; feelings and family units be damned.  Oh, and since it's more entertaining to have humans in the tank with them, safety be damned as well.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great novel - Me Before You by Jojo Moyes<br /><br />A very powerful and emotional read.  Do not miss this novel written not only a most creative writer, but one who understands the stirrings of the human soul.  Thank you Jojo Moyes.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|The most fun in a  &#34;Long Run &#34; while &#34;Taking It Easy&#34; as I enjoyed another &#34;Tequila Sunrise&#34; at the &#34;Hotel California&#34; !
B0094BB4TW|5.0|First is was free, easy to download and use. I was also impressed with amazon rep who helped me through it all.
B005LJITS0|1.0|This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen. Definitely the worst comic book hero movie. Why, Ryan Reynolds?? Why??
B0055D3EFU|4.0|Great movie, I bought this while traveling. It isnt the HD version, so it looks a lil grainy.<br />Sometimes horror movies look better this way.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This is an excellent easy-to-read book about a man's experiences in World War Two.  A lot of the book jumps back and forth in the character's mind.  I highly recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The plot of the Racketeer was far fetched but entertaining nonetheless.  After the first few chapters, the book took an unexpected turn but it kept me curious as to what would happen next.  I'm not a big fan of the main characters but they're definitely memorable.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There are many stories within this one story and all of them are captivating.  From the persona of Death, the narrator, to the hidden kindness of those who people the book they are all more interesting than macabre.  I read Anne Frank when I was very young and it scarred me since - have never seen Titanic or other historic catastrophic movies since, but this book just captivated me. As an aged R.N., I have seen the soul leave the body many times and I will never look at Death the same way again.
1250038820|5.0|I absolutely love it, the order arrived quickly, and the pictures/anecdotes are awesome. Now sits proudly on display in my living room!
0812982606|5.0|I am one of those &#34;15 days and lost patience and threw the book out&#34; guys when it came to reading Salman Rushdie's books.  I tried to read Midnight's Children and the Satanic Verses and quickly lost patience.  As the writer Arundhati Roy told him directly his books were exotic and hers realistic.  Turns out that &#34;Joseph Anton&#34; is truly realistic.  I read it almost in one sitting without loosing patience and completed my first ever book of Salman Rushdie.  A remarkable book written in elegant English that truly captures the agony that he went through.  An interesting observations is that he mentions many in the literary world, both in passing reference and close personal encounters but not the two I expected --- Nirad Choudhary and VS Naipaul.  Wonder why?<br /><br />Just wish all his books were this readable!
B00005N6KG|1.0|----------<br /><br />I bought these earphones for $8.64 last December.  I got about 5 pairs for gifts.<br /><br />DO NOT pay $60 for these!  I will write to Sony about this and also contact Amazon.<br /><br />Google this earphone...you can still get them for about $7.<br /><br />I want to know if Sony or Amazon is ripping off the people and I will find out.<br /><br />----------
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use and arrange favorite cities and regions. Accurate and quicker to than accessing local TV station's website. I always get my weather status and radar views here.
1423136802|5.0|Great collection of Percy Jackson books. I brought it for my daughter for Christmas. I know she will love it since she already seen the movies.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|While Divergent was fast moving and told a great story, Allegiant was so slow that even getting half way thru was very difficult.  So much so that I have read two other books without finishing Allegiant.  Very disappointing
B00ELXQYOI|4.0|A great read, with lots of fascinating information. It is written well and therefore easy to follow, although some things seem to be repeated.<br /><br />All in all it was very inspiring and exciting to look into the life and career of Jony Ive, so far, he is a truly passionate designer.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it.
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|Admittedly, I don't usually take self-help books seriously, and so I was referred to this one by someone who thought I'd feel differently about this one.  Well, I'm a tough nut to crack, but I can tell you that reading this was not a bad experience.  First of all, it's short, so whether I gleaned anything from it or not is a moot enough point.  It was an easy read, and it was easy to understand the concepts the author put forward.  They sound a little bit like Stewart Smalley from those old SNL sketches, but there is also scientific evidence that the methods in this book work.  Mr. Bello explains them well, and he offers methods that anyone can use to apply them effectively.  If you're interested in self-help and you need a quick how-to guide for improving your attitude and achieving your personal goals, you might as well start here.<br /><br />There are links to more information within the beginning and end of the book, and Mr. Bello also has other material out there so that, if you want, you can grow in his methods.  All it takes is an open mind!
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Not heavy on plot, but a good ole shoot em up in a dystopian future. Lots of explosions not much dialogue.
B0081ISUOG|1.0|Way way Too simple.  Too simple.  Nothing more than the standard one.  No reason to keep it.  Already uninstaled it.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I can't tell you how fun this game is just buy it and find out for your self you will not be able to stop playing
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|meets expectations, it saves cables, is very comfortable to use and quick to learn to program it is also extremely easy installation
B008Q09K2U|1.0|This is possibly DeMille's worst book. He uses a pathetic and boring technique as a  meaningless filler for about 50% of the book. This consists of a character paraphrasing various reports. There is no character development and in the typically corny stereotyped  American detective character, there is a wisecrack in every paragraph. It is impossible to do a detailed review of this book as it is complete rubbish. Whatever you do borrow this book from someone rather than buying it.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I found this book to be Enlightening, while at the same time, hoping it was mostly fiction.  Unbelievable that a whole country could be indoctrinated.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good story, rich characters, easy read,love John Grisham's writing.  You did not have to read previous story with Jake as main character.
B009UNH0EM|4.0|Wish the cord was a little longer but the quality is great..charges Bluetooth pretty quickly ..will be shopping a lot more
B00792EGES|5.0|I first got interested in Alter Bridge after doing a web search for Myles Kennedy after seeing his performance with Slash on the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame show. He sang better than Axel Rose could ever dream of singing. Plus he didn't do the stupid dance; he didn't have to because I was hooked. I wish they would tour the west coast so I could see them in Portland or Seattle. I am a big lyrics person and I truly love the song lyrics. How do people get so talented?
B00FN811SY|5.0|It has all the information you need about the bible , family, and it's clear and understandable. All questions answered.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|:) really great loved the original but this is great! Lot of fun looking forward to all the quests. Rating this app started playing today so hoping it will be a lot more things to the different quest and buildings.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is brilliant and witty. I've been a long-time subscriber to her blog, and a fan. When she revealed she was writing a book I had immediately intended to buy it. I was excited to have a hard copy of her work, and even more amazed when I read the new material released. Her stories make me laugh out loud, and I read them to anyone willing (or not for that matter) to listen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantastic read. Quick and addicting! I read it in one day after seeing the movie and I can't wait to read the next one!
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|When I first downloaded I was having a blast with the game. I was progressing along smoothly until yesterday. The game loads and tells me there is an upgrade, I can't play until I upgrade it. When trying to upgrade I get a popup saying that it was unable to open the page and asks me if I want to go to Amazon's app store (where I downloaded the app from) and when I get there there is no update. So 1 star until I can play again or I will uninstall. Which sucks because I was enjoying this game.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My daughter's present, was what she wanted and had the musics she said she needed.  The item came as scheduled and was being used immediately
B000ICL3CO|5.0|While The Cure have always been known to experiment with different musical genres, in my opinion it was never more evident as it is on this double LP from 1987. This was the beginning of the band's commercial peak that would last through out the late 80s and 90s. Most popular song here is obviously &#34;Just Like Heaven&#34; and it's a brilliant piece of pop heaven. Make no mistake though, The Cure still stay true to their dark sensibilities on &#34;The Kiss&#34; and &#34;The Snakepit&#34; but there is a certain playfulness to it this time which is different compared to the tracks on Disintegration, the album that would come after this. Robert Smith shows he can write a fun dance song with &#34;Why Can't I Be You?&#34;, a big favorite of mine and also includes a certain romantic melancholy with &#34;If Only Tonight We Could Sleep&#34; which is a beautiful and brooding tune, another favorite. Highly recommended, one of Robert Smith and company's best.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|someone at work told me about this show, so i decided to check it out.  season 1 was very good. i'm ready for season 2.
B000002HAJ|5.0|The Cure had made a big commercial breakthrough in 1987 with Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me and even bigger with Disintegration in 1989 but this 1992 LP became the group's biggest seller to date and reached number 2 on the billboard charts. Part of that was due to the album's lead pop hit \\"Friday I'm In Love\\" and it's a great song in its own right but like all Cure albums during this time, there is so much more to offer. The group cranks up their loudest guitar songs up to that point with \\"From The Edge Of The Deep Green Sea\\" and \\"Cut\\" which are songs filled with hopelessness and despair. You also get two of the finest ballads in the group's catalogue with \\"Trust\\" and \\"To Wish Impossible Things\\" which is such a beautiful song both musically and lyrically that I can't imagine anyone not breaking into tears hearing it. Another single here was \\"A Letter To Elise\\" that combines sadness with a catchy tune. This gets my vote as their third best album, the one to follow Wild Mood Swings (1996) wasn't as successful and while I think that it's a good record, it is considered the end of The Cure's top 40 period. Always an adventurous band that took more risks then they are given credit for, Wish is an album that deserved the praise it received during its day and should still be given today as an enduring masterpiece, not just because of its one radio hit.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great!!<br />As soon as i opened the package it only took maybe 5 mins to plug into my TV and start broadcasting.<br />The only thing I dislike about it is that there are very few apps to use with this but for $35 you cant complain.<br />And plus I mainly bought the chromecast to stream from my laptop to my TV.<br /><br />One bit of advice, you gotta have good wifi to broadcast or else you'll get choppy feedback and also change some settings around to accommodate how your wifi is.<br /><br />All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely buy more for the other TV's in my house.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I usually don't watch anything with Steve Martin in it, because I don't care for slap-stick humor, so it was with trepidation that I accompanied a birding friend to see this moving in a theater.  I LOVED it.  And then I bought and read the book (which was based on a true story, saw the differences between the book and the film, and decided that I loved them both.  So of course, I had to buy the movie.<br /><br />Having said that, I would like to clearly state that the character of Kenny Bostick in the movie, was supposed to be based on that of Sandy Komito, a real birder who was named in the book.  But in its traditional fashion, Hollywood so embellished the plot and the characters that they needed to change the names of the characters to avoid lawsuits!<br /><br />I've met and birded with Sandy Komito.  He is indeed a purpose-driven man, a superb birder and highly competitive.  However, there the resemblance to the Kenny Bostick character ends.  Sandy is kind, helpful to other birders, courteous and very, very funny!
B00C8S9VKM|3.0|I am a great fan of Bill Bryson. I have read all his wonderful books and have always loved his great sense of humor along with his tremendously serious  research on every subject he has dealt with.  A Short History of Nearly Everything fascinated me and Home was great. His travel books were delightful.<br /> This last book One Summer:America 1927 however was a great disappointment.  I found it tedious,too slow, with no sign of his usual humor. There was too much information. Unless one is really interested in aviation one quickly tires of reading about pilot after pilot and plane after plane and learning the details about how the planes were built, where exactly they flew, and where they landed. If one is a great fan of baseball I suppose one could find it interesting to read page after  page about Babe Ruth but unfortunately I am not and quite frankly I was bored. I read the book to the very end because I kept hoping that the old Bryson would suddenly make an appearance but this did not happen. It pains me to write a negative review about a book by a writer I so admire and I will keep buying every Bryson book hoping the old Bryson will resurface. Ariela Halkin Ph.D
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I've read a lot of S. King. This book gives us the style of writing used in earlier work. So it makes a good continuation, and sure if you find yourself often sitting next to S.King hearing the story ...his voice is deeper, and more disturbing.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love the fact that the pictures are multi-colored and very detailed! Have played other similar games that vaguely resemble objects, but these pictures are clear and easy to distinguish. The puzzles go from easy to extremely difficult, but are not timed and have no penalties for mis-cues. Great game tahat can be played for hours!
B009PHRIAE|5.0|If you are a recorder player, this is a must-have set. Frans Brüggen is the person who is mainly responsible for making the recorder respected as a virtuoso serious instrument. Back in the 70s his interpretations of Baroque music fired the imaginations of thousands of younger players, who went on to become today's conservatory-trained world-class musicians specializing in Early Music. Although Brüggen's scholarship was adequate for accurate period performance in the 60s and 70s, his interpretations sound out-of-date today. But his musicianship is still remarkable. When I play, or hear certain pieces played – for example the Corelli Folia variations – his interpretation, in my mind, is still the one by which all the others are judged.
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|Fun game but could be better if more specific directions were given for some of the games. I liked that the game sent me a daily reminder to play.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Very entertain. Level up quickly. Lots of different quest and challenges. My kids love it. Hours of fun. Very good.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game. the story is interesting and the puzzles are fun. lets face it...who doesn't like playing detective? G5 games do deliver. I keep coming back for more.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Well written and amusing, provides an interestimg review on how justice works in the US, a fine and enjoayable novel.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|A techno thriller far removed from the original, Dredd is full of action, fantastically gritty special FX, and a cast of characters to die for...
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Awesome movie one of denzel best of all time. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who love denzel
B007MDB548|5.0|Our daughter absolutely LOVES this movie, and how it ties Tinkerbell into all sorts of new characters! I definitely am glad we gave this gift to her.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|This information should be more readily available and Erich has done his share with over 30 books written on this subject
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Love this movie!!  I don't have little ones but I ordered it for me.  Buy this for your kids for Christmas.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|While the film started with a lot of action, in my opinion it really lacked the usual Ian Fleming touch, especially no Bond Girl :_)
B00D6OV57O|5.0|The music has a powerful presence and gives The Man of Steel it's flight.<br />I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I can't say enough about how much I love this show. I watched the entire season within three days of it arriving. The chemistry between these seven characters is hysterical. This show never fails to make me laugh out loud (much to the annoyance of my roommate). The addition of Amy as Sheldon's girlfriend just made it that much funnier. This show is beyond addicting. I can't wait for the next season!
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I wish I was as excited as almost everyone else here about this release. I've been a fan since 1993, I am more on the metal side than on the prog side. This album is bland, it sounds like Rush, Yes and even Yanni before sounding like DT.<br /><br />Things that bother me the most: all songs have a melodic / cheesy chorus, all songs jump in the chorus right after the first 2 verses and there are no real heavy songs, James' style is all melodic as opposed to some melodic some heavy like before, drum sections are so simple that almost I can play them (I'm a drummer and not a very skilled one), no long instrumental parts with guitar and keyboard solos that take you on a mental journey before bringing you back to the song. If you look back in their catalog, you almost can't find an album this linear. Almost every previous release has a lot of different moods through the album - they have more melodic songs, but also heavier stuff, like Black Clouds has A Nightmare To Remember or Rite of Passage (how heavy is that guitar that starts at 4:52??), Systematic Chaos has Dark Eternal Night and Constant Motion, Octavarium has Root of All Evil and Panic Attack, Train of Thought is heavy all around, etc ...this last release is the blandest they've put out, along with Six Degrees Pt 2 and Scenes from a Memory, except that Six Degrees has a much heavier Part 1 and Scenes is an unparalleled masterpiece. In A Dramatic Turn of Events any of the first 5 songs (except This is The Life) is heavier than anything on this last album. The instrumental parts and drumming on, for instance, Bridges In The Sky or Lost Not Forgotten are so much more elaborate and intricate than anything on the new album...<br /><br />The last album lacks the mix that almost all their previous albums had. There's nothing heavy to throw in the mix, James' vocals are all lyrical and nothing rough.<br /><br />The album has 8 tracks, not counting the intro, of which 3 are totally bland, one instrumental, 2 prog, one \\"heavy\\" and one ridiculously and unnecessarily long. When comparing to the previous release, ADToE has On the Back of Angels, Lost Not Forgotten, Outcry and Bridges In The Sky, this new release doesn't have a single song that can begin to compare with those. Even the ballads This Is The Life, Beneath The Surface and Far From Heaven are 100 times better than those on this album. Illumination Theory, the \\"epic long\\" song of the album, is just meh, can't compare it with The Count of Tuscany, A nightmare To Remember, In The Presence of Enemies, Octavarium...to make matters worse,  it has a 2 minute keyboard-only section at the 8:30 minutes that sounds like the soundtrack of Cinderella dancing with the Prince. Not kidding.<br /><br />I don't find the album intense enough. The Looking Glass is bland and that's OK, BUT it is followed by Enigma Machine which bores me quite a lot, followed by The Bigger Picture which is really good...but bland. Then we get to Behind The Vail, and even though it is not a ballad, the only thing that sticks is the cheesy chorus, then Surrender To Reason, and again, not a ballad but blandish overall, followed by Along For the Ride which ALSO bores me, so by the time we get to the last track I am already bored to death. The album lacks intensity. I don't want to say that it is not heavy enough because this is not a Heavy Metal band. But it seems too bland for my taste.<br /><br />The album is also very formulaic, it doesn't have those insanely intense musical parts with frantic drum tempo changes. It is a cookie cutter album (for Dream Theater standards, that is)... why do they slow down the tempo and get more melodic in every chorus even in the more metal songs? They do it 100 % of the times, how about let the song continue with its tempo and mood for a change?<br /><br />Very disappointed, probably their worst release to date.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written even though it is a tough story. I was sorry to finish it because I wanted to keep reading!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game . I play it every day. It's what I play every night before I go to sleep. It is a challenge to beat my last score. It takes some thought to complete the game.
0316074314|5.0|What a prodigy and a genius Eleanor Catton is!  To have achieved not only a Booker winner in her young years, but a book that is inventive and so readable as well, is a magnificent feat.  Her vocabulary is powerful, her research into the history of the times and of aspects like a trial held in the courts of law of the time are awe-inspiring.<br /><br />I have not enjoyed a book as much as this in a long time.  The book is a page-turner, the mysteries interweaving and overlapping to an exquisite degree.  I found the characters fascinating, the setting brought to life vividly and the plot wonderful.  I couldn't wait to reach the end and find out the reason for the mysteries even though this would end the fabulous reading experience.<br /><br />I admit to some regret that at the end I had to read over part of the last 100-150 pages to solve the mysteries.  I figured out some although their description wasn't clear.  I hope to be ambiguous so as not to give away spoilers, but the following remained a mystery.  Why did Mrs. Wells turn Anna's life around and pay her debts? This was not at all clear to me.  How did the Titania come to be?  If anyone knows the answers to these questions, please let me know.<br /><br />Should we use astrology to determine that Libran Catton has similarities with Harald Nilssen, the Libran?<br /><br />There are 12 characters whose star signs we know.  There are other major characters whose astrology signs we are not told such as: Walter Moody, Anna Wetherell, Lydia Wells, Francis Carver, Emery Staines, Alistair Lauderback, George Shepard and Crosbie Wells.  Can we guess at these?<br /><br />Although I have read about astrology for many years, I was baffled by the use of the astrology overview and the headings of the planets in the various signs.  Maybe Catton could have painted a description at the end of each relevant chapter?  E.g. for Jupiter in Sagittarius, we could learn that as Jupiter is in a sign it rules over and so is more powerfulhere and the qualities of Jupiter are strengthened e.g. people will look to for a higher meaning in their life.  However, how astrology manifests in the plot is a big question mark to me.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend \\"Luminaries\\" as an engaging and well-written book with a humorous and compassionate look at humankind.

B0031RS64G|5.0|This book opened my eyes, fantasy can be so much more than heroes and villains. Everything is grey and even the most likable characters have their darker sides.<br /><br />Be warned though, this book is certainly requires some diving into. There are many different characters with each their own motives and background. A book by Steven Eriksson  by Steven Erikson is not an easy read, but it is certainly is a rewarding one!
B0037HOWKW|5.0|This is a great gift for a young person who has outgrown LEGOs but still gets a kick out of assembling more intricate items with smaller blocks.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|Though an entertaining read, I was disappointed with where the story ended in comparison to where it began. The way the characters reacted to what was going on throughout this final part of the trilogy just wasn't consistent with who they were at the beginning. And not just in the way that these events have changed them. It was like reading about completely different characters altogether.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game. it is very fun! I recomend playing it if you like apps. the graphics. are good too. on this game...

B00GO95BUU|5.0|We paid $15 each to see this on the big screen and it was totally worth it - I actually had a moment of NOT hating Stephen Moffat!<br /><br />And I bought the episode on Amazon this morning so we can watch every last little detail again.<br />(and again.. and again.. - Whovian!)<br /><br />I think it's ridiculous that everyone's complaining that they missed the sale window and have to pay *oh noes* $7 or $8 bucks.<br />If you think it's so unfair, feel free to go back to subscribing to CABLE at $60 a month!<br />(And hope that BBC America is available...)
1480537381|4.0|Interesting story that told me about an era that I did not know enough about. I find it disturbing that Orpan Trains existed, but I suppose they did fill a need for that time period.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Connelly knows how to spin a story that keeps you engaged.  It's the fourth one I've read and I am going to read them all.  If you enjoy suspense/mystery/thrillers chances are good you'll enjoy the Harry Bosch novels.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Way easier than reading paper books and at a same time I have access to my other stuff such as internet.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|He puts all mainstream rap to shame with this album. His lyrics show his experience over the years, yet his verses feel just as hungry as his first two albums. He includes great storytelling, great stabs at current artists. He outdoes everyone at their own game and puts his own twist on it. He has great pure rap songs, some good \\"poppy\\" songs. This is definitely his best album since the first MMLP and maybe even the best of all time.<br /><br />I love every song but my favorites are Legacy, Rap God, Brainless, Love Game, Evil Twin, Desperation, Groundhog Day, Beautiful Pain, Wicked Ways.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|Horror films for the most part have been a disappointment in the last few decades. They either rely on jolt scares or excessive gore to compensate for atmosphere and a good creepy story. 'Mama' has a little of all those things I mentioned, but never using them to propel the story or to give you false goose bumps.<br /><br />I was impressed with 'Mama' as it delivers much more than I expected it to. It's got a pretty creepy ghost story and I can't remember that last time I watched a horror film and genuinely felt creeped out wondering what was behind that door or what they were going to see next. Besides the good creep factor, it also has some pathos, which is sorely missed from a lot of horror films today, I mean, who will ever forget Karloff's portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster? Or Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man? Those films just wouldn't be the same without them. Mama has a little of this going for it too as the ghost in the story which I found creepy as hell (even if a little bizarre looking) also makes you have some empathy for this unfortunate creature or spirit. Sure there are some contrivances, but what horror film doesn't have those?<br /><br />If you're looking for a somewhat old fashioned chiller then Mama may be something you want to check out. Turn the lights out and take a look at Mama!  The Blu Ray looks and sounds great and there are some interesting extras to check out after the film.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Fantastic movie, excellent acting and a very engaging story.  Could have been very dark and yet it turns quite inspiring and light hearted even with the depth of subject matter.  Puts a bit of humanity to mental issues and self awareness. Enjoy!
B008Y5T5ZE|4.0|The movie well done from beginning to end. Good acting, music and plot. You cannot expect more from a mystery.

B009NF54ZE|3.0|I enjoyed the game. I finished it in less than a day. There was too much dialog! For &#34;skull&#34; they misspelled it as &#34;scull&#34;. Wish it were a bit more challenging, fix the misspellings, and change the dialog please.<br /><br />Not a bad game for a bit of distraction if you like Hidden Object games and I got it free so it was a deal!
1416550534|5.0|The book was shiopped promptly and  arrived in excellent condition. although I haven;t finished reading it yet I am enjoying it immensely. I bought this book after reading the FORGOTTRN GARDEN, also by Kate Morton. That book was so good I decided to check out her other books, So far the  HOUSE AT RIVERTON is also excellent,
B00GH4R95C|4.0|The whole family enjoyed this film! I little confusing at the beginning for younger people that don't know the original storyline.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I really enjoy it. I suggest you try it. Just go download it and see for yourself. It's really fun.
0446310786|1.0|I would give this book no stars if possible. It's the most boring book I've read in my entire life and it's the reason I'm failing my English class. I fell asleep reading it and I can't focus at all on the words. By the time I'm done reading, I have no idea what I just read because it was that boring.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love how big the keys and display are. I've learned a lot from the help tutorials. It's so easy to use and is playing to the eye. Thanks for making calculator plus.
039916409X|5.0|This is the first book that addressed the REAL issues around the struggles we have and how we hold ourselves back from building wealth.  I had several ah ha moments even though I have looked at this part of my life before.  Margaret is very articulate on this subject.  I also enjoyed the bonus videos online and now see her as direct, honest, generous, and fun - someone I'd love to get to know!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Never fails. I've always loved his books. Great concept. I was intrigued to hear more about dan Torrance, and was impressed with the direction the story took. Bravo!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|The writing was good and plot interesting but it was too descriptive/wordy at times.  Much of it could have been cut out and I tended to skip over parts that weren't pertinent to plot.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Read it because it was recommended and I saw the movie. The movie follows the book for the most part but fails to develop the story quite as well as the book. Thoroughly enjoyed. On to the next one!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|simple to use in stand alone mode, just scan to a memory card and then upload to the computer.  The scans were good and it was pretty fast scanning.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I got a Chromecast for my birthday from someone who thought this would be perfect for me.  And it would be - in theory.  I am constantly stuck watching my computer screen (macbook) when i would prefer to be watching it on my big screen TV.  This claims to do just that.  However, that's about as far as Google's claims can honestly be met.<br /><br />It was somewhat easy to install for me, but i could completely understand someone having a very difficult time setting this up.<br /><br />Once installed i tried to use chromecast to catch up on a TV show i missed at the network's streaming site.  It didn't work at first, but i figured it out after about a half hour of troubleshooting.  In order to &#34;cast&#34; to your tv from your laptop, your streaming content must be in &#34;full screen&#34; mode.  This is a BIG issue because Chromecast claims several times that you can cast to your TV and open a new tab on your computer so that you can work and watch at the same time.  NOT TRUE.<br /><br />Also, i am shocked at how some of the reviews here basically state the opposite of the experience you and i will truly have once we set up and use the Chromecast.  There is most definitely a volume lag and picture degradation.  &#34;HD&#34; has truly become a phrase that means nothing.  Watching something &#34;cast&#34; to my television is NOT like watching it on the computer screen when it comes to picture quality.  It is like trying to watch satellite during a thunderstorm at its worst and like watching a digital feed on an old tube-television set at it's best.<br /><br />**Do not expect the Chromecast to turn your streamed content into a 1080p quality viewing experience.**<br />For that you will need a 'Smart' TV/Blu-ray player or something like a Roku or Apple TV device (which are very reasonably priced).<br /><br />Just ask yourself before purchasing if are expecting a $35 upgrade to your experience or a $75-$100 upgrade, because you are getting what you pay for - a cheap upgrade that doesn't live up to its own claims.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best video game ever made in the UNIVERSE! Can you soon make more?How about 1 with dinosaurs trying to eat you?

B00GWEPPE4|1.0|I am tiring of this show, and this episode was the last straw. The Governor again? It's obvious they've run out of ideas, because the Governator is back and it's totally predictable.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Loved it! After reading Gone Girl, I was hoping for another great book and great twist and this book delivered!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to  some out on the kindle HD! It's so addicting and fun. Can't stop playing it!

B0050PLT8W|5.0|I love the music and the sound quality is great. Theory of a deadman did a great job on this CD!
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Effects were realistic and story line acceptable. Movie was just right in length. I hesitate a perfect rating because the relationship between Lois & SM was not cultivated; and the end scene was vague in suggesting Lois knew SM is the recently-hired Clark Kent.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Amazing Album! I can't stop listening to it! A7X hit this one out of the park! I REALLY recommend this album!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I originally read this book when it first came out.  It is one of my all time favorites.  After seeing the movie I decided to reread it.  I enjoyed it just as much the second time!  The story of Ender is really wonderful and should be high on anyone's list, especially if they like Science Fiction, but I believe it is more than just a genre book.  It is a book for everyone that really likes a high energy story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was gripping and thrilling and confusing and eye opening all alone once. I hate how the ending just stops though. I cannot wait to read the next book!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very very nice product. Looks like Google has captured what consumers wanted and has delivered. Unlike Apple's costly and featureless devices, chromecast works fine with various apps and any WiFi hotspot.

B00F2HW20M|4.0|Amazing band, amazing show, problem with the product. As has been reported on almost all comments, there is a manufacturing error on the DVD. No one has any reasonable solution except to return this very limited 5 disk box and either get money back or a copy of the 3 CD music disk. I bought this for the CD and DVDs......

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I've been playing this game for months and its very fun hidden objects game but way better. It is free if you have patience to wait for your energy to build back up. You usually get a half hour to 45 minutes of play each day. If you want to spend money you can play more. You have to buy crystals to restore energy if you don't want to wait. Not a game you can purchase to play whenever just buying energy that's the only bad part. Try it it's free and you will enjoy it very much.

1476729085|4.0|This was a funny, sweet, touching romantic comedy and a really quick read. I read the review in the NY Times Book Review and knew I'd enjoy it - and I did! I won't rehash the plot which is well covered here, but I must say I found Professor Don Tillman, our hero and narrator, to be one of the most original, quirky and charming characters I've come across in awhile. I couldn't help but think of Sheldon from \\"Big Bang Theory\\", who is also a brilliant, hyper-organized scientist who knows he's wired differently and struggles to understand the illogical, emotional people (and their mystifying social cues) around him.<br /><br />Since he's never had a second date and has very specific requirements for a partner, Don decides to approach the problem scientifically with a detailed questionnaire in what he dubs \\"the Wife Project\\". Through a misunderstanding he meets Rosie, a smart, attractive smoker vegetarian (gasp! Violates two key criteria right off...) and thinks she's one of his candidates; the two spend time together and even though Don finds her clearly unsuitable he is drawn to her and begins to help her with a big personal problem in her life - finding her biological father.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book but I must say this was the part of the book that started to drag for me; I found it odd that we didn't meet Rosie's stepfather Phil, supposedly a key player in making her the messed up young woman (Rosie uses a more graphic term) she says she is, until almost the end. The time the couple spent in New York (no spoilers!) was the highlight for me, and foreshadowed what, for me, would be the ideal ending (and it was). A little too pat, perhaps, but as Don reflects in the end, we were in the realm of romantic comedy here, so it seemed fitting. I must say I was also relieved to see the loathsome Gene redeemed in the end; he clearly wasn't fit to lick Claudia's boots but was one of Don's very few friends and seemed to genuinely care about him, so phew! The romance was sweet and Rosie was wonderful but I don't feel like we really get to know what is going on inside her head much; it's Don's POV driving the story and I really enjoyed his reflections and internal monologues. It was a bit confusing, though, how he went from saying he was \\"wired differently\\" to his memories of mental problems and depression when he was a young man; which is it, is he quirky and different or is he genuinely suffering from mental illness?<br /><br />Despite those issues with the plot, I still enjoyed this debut novel and would recommend to those who enjoy romantic comedy with a quirky, non-traditional hero.et and Rosie was wonderful but I don't feel like we really get to know what is going on inside her head much; it's Don's POV driving the story and I really enjoyed his reflections and internal monologues.

B0087YPCYA|1.0|I didn't watch this, my buddies at work asked if they could use my roku to watch it. I heard the stories of it and decided that movies like this and Sharknado are the reason some people refuse to own a TV. This movie sounded so bad I am surprised Kevin Costner wasn't in it.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Comfortable fit and easily adjusted. Unfortunately there was a short in the headset and the sound kept fading in and out. There was also a lot of static which distorted the quality of sound when it was in. I have gaming friends that use this headset and it worked perfectly for them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the book and how you are able to see into the districts. It is much different than the first one, but just as good.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is a classic and one that our family must watch at least once each Christmas season, year after year. The clothing may be outdated but the rest of the movie stands the test of time. So funny and would highly recommend.

B000PY6BBI|1.0|not sure what I was expecting but it didn't live up to my expectations.  early in the careers of the lead actors, the presentation, while interesting, felt dated and possibly too SciFi form me.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is a lot better than I expected. I can't stop playing it. I got my two sons playing it as well. Loads of fun.
0316055433|3.0|Some of the writing in this book is sublime.  I found myself stopping and re-reading passages and paragraphs and smiling at the artistry of the author.  As the story moved along those lovely crafted words became hurried as the writer tried to get to the next phase of the too-long story.<br /><br />I don't rate a book by its length as long as the story is worth my time.  Since I read this on my Kindle, I really didn't pay attention to the length of this story, so I found myself muttering from time to time, &#34;Will this ever be over?&#34;  I stuck with it and finished it because I had invested so much time already.  I would rate it a 3.5, if I had the choice.<br /><br />It's a good thing the reader likes Theo at the beginning, because he does not remain a likeable person throughout the book.  The story is simply too long, and apparently would be several hundred pages longer, except that the author wisely decided to skip over several years from time to time.  At times we get almost minute-by-minute narration that just made me want them to hurry up -- because some of the things that happened during those m/by/m segments contributed NOTHING to the story and were boring.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would read another book by this author.  The bits of inspired prose were too few and far between.  I don't think that it is as good a book as it could have been.

B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Chris did what he was supposed to do for the first twenty-two years of his life. He respected his family, went to school and college, and then he decided that he didn't need the superficial, materialistic world that lay ahead of him. He took a cross-country journey to become Alexander Supertramp, a leather-tramp, out to find what can best be described as a journey to find who he really was and to challenge himself.

B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. He is such a versatile talent, and in this movie he delivers once again. He plays an air-force veteran and pilot who struggles with substance dependency and struggles to manage the loss of his father and the alienation of his wife and teenage son. Things get worse following an all-night bender. His plane suffers a critical mechanical failure, and despite skillfully saving most of the passengers and crew on what everyone agrees was a doomed aircraft, investigators learn of his intoxication prior to and during the flight. During his post-crash recovery, he meets a woman going through a very similar drug dependency who is struggling with the loss of her beloved mother. They strike up a relationship as they try to free themselves from their addictions. Despite her success, he fails to follow in her footsteps, and he falls heavily to drugs as it appears he may lose his career and go to prison. His friend, a pilot-union-rep who has known him since his military days, sets him up with a top attorney, and they just might be able to save him from himself..if he can lie well enough..but he trips and falls flat on his face when he can ill-afford it. In the end, he decides what is most important is his family, his friends, and coming clean, admitting the truth, and accepting responsibility. 4.5 out of 5 stars.
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|The movie was for lack of a better word - boring.  I have always enjoyed Will Smith but didn't really feel I got much of him in this movie and well, his son, is just not Will Smith.  Story was very predictable and a bit unrealistic.  I am over all disappointed that I bought the thing because I doubt I will ever be bored enough to watch it again.

It works initially and is really fun, but upon loading a saved game, the IAB code crashes on my Nexus tablets (I can see this in logcat).  Also, it's too small to play on my Nexus 7.  In addition the UI constantly messes up the touch events.  There seems to be a zoom mode which would probably make it playable, but I can't figure out how to activate it.<br /><br />It is playable on my Nexus 10, but I can't load a saved game due to the IAB crash.<br /><br />Update:  Crashes on load of saved game on my Fire HD 8.9 too.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|A clever movie, very well acted, and ingeniously structured.  It was based on an Israeli movie of the same name, which I haven't seen but which I assume was similarly structured in the way that the two time periods (1966, 1997) were handled.  One particular success is the way that the different generations of actors are convincing and credible as their younger and older selves.  We can believe that Jessica Chastain grows older to become Helen Mirren, Sam Worthington to become Ciaran Hinds, etc.  and that speaks to the care in the writing of the parts as well as the skills of the actors involved.  The reservation I have concerns the thirty years we don't see: we do see the anguish of the choice that the younger characters make (to tell a lie for the good of Israel is the way that Stefan Gold, the senior Mossad agent, frames the reasons for the lie), but when the three agents are feted as heroes, there is moral discomfort on the parts of the female agent Rachel (Mirren) and David Peretz, the other agent involved (Hinds).  That moral discomfort is heightened when Rachel and Stefan's daughter publishes a book about the 1966 operation that confirms the heroism of the agents and, unbeknownst to Rachel's daughter, cements the lie.  Revelation of the truth would of course discredit the agents and devastate the daughter, whom we see in the opening scenes at her big publication party.<br /><br />There comes a point where it seems that the truth will be revealed and the question is, what to do about it.  I won't give away the later part of the 1997 story except to say that Hinds and Mirren act their moral conflicts and scruples convincingly, but one does wonder how Rachel, Mirren's character, in particular managed the intervening years.  Especially one wonders how she handled the knowledge of her daughter's work on the book.  Divorced by this time from Stefan (who had impregnated her in the course of a one-night bedding in 1966), and as morally scrupulous as she seems to have become, is it credible that she would have let her daughter build her reputation as a writer on what she (Rachel) knows to be a lie?  David, the most morally scrupulous and most troubled of the three, left Mossad and Israel shortly after the events of 1966, and his guilt seems to have led him to have to seek psychiatric help, but we only hear about that on his return in 1997; it's not shown.  Things from Rachel's 1966-1997 life are likewise not shown.  Mirren is a good enough actor to convince us of her 1997 moral discomfort, but it's her success in communicating that that makes us wonder about the intervening years.  For all that, though, this is well worth seeing -- there are elements of suspense and action too that are well handled.become, is it credible that she would have let her daughter build her reputation as a writer on what she (Rachel) knows to be a lie?

B008JFUS5A|5.0|This movie is incredible. Two and a half hours fly by and keep you at the edge of you seat. I haven't read the books so I can't speak to how faithful it is or anything like that. I enjoyed the first movie and I thought I might as well see this one and I am so happy that I did. Catching Fire blows the first movie away. The acting is phenomenal headlined by Jennifer Lawrence - she captures a very conflicted, and strong heroine convincing performance. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a great games-master and played a convincing role so much so I didn't really anticipate the big twist. Catching Fire has a good mix of intrigue, action, and emotion. It is a rare sequel which eclipses the original, but with that cast and story up on the big screen it wasn't even really a contest. Anyone who like the Hunger Games series, or just wants to see a good fun movie should go and see this film.
0786955570|2.0|Not what I was expecting, It's kinda boring, predictable and monotonous. The stories are Ok but it's nothing like a real D&D game like I thought it would be...
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|It was both fascinating and terrifying ...Schlosser does it again in another great book. I learned so much more than I thought I would.
B001CZVVVY|2.0|At the risk of being labeled a retrograde, I would like to use this example of how not to stage opera.  The production had everything at its disposal - a host of talented singers, a first-rate orchestra, and this amazing new technology that allows the sound to be cleanly captured no matter where the singers turn or where they are on a stage.  Yet almost everything went wrong.  I imagine Claus Guth is a highly skilled director of... okay, maybe Broadway-type shows (I almost said \\"burlesque\\", that's probably where his true talents are), but he is clue-less in opera.  First of all, he moved the action to early 20th century, and all the flirtatious and easy-going romp of Beaumarchais, on whose 1778 play Mozart's opera is based, became unimaginable.  To correct for that he added some wildly sexual behaviors to the major characters without the slightest regard for the actual story.  E.g., Susanna apparently cheats on Figaro with the Count, making the whole point of her and Figaro's game unnecessary.  The Countess at one point together with Susanna forms a m&eacute;nage-a-trois with Cherubino...  A cupid-like mute character was written in to simply hang out, spread feathers, and pull at the singers' clothes.  At one time he actually rides on the Count's neck (!), making it a super-human feat for Bo Skovhus to sing his show-stopping aria.  While a minimalist modern staging (e.g. La Traviata or Eugene Onegin) can work, this foray into Regietheater isn't minimalist, but just weird and falls flat 99% of the time. And I don't mean from all those stairs.<br /><br />A renowned Austrian conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt leads his very capable orchestra on a path that (quite mysteriously) tries to contort comedy into tragedy.  If it was the slowness itself I could live with it.  But he clearly accentuated lower winds and strings in strategic places, so to speak, and the whole effect is rather menacing.  E.g. Figaro's Act 1 aria where he asks signor contino to dance, or Bartolo's entrance and aria (on a wheelchair!).  Had I not known they're from \\"Le Nozze\\", I could've easily assumed they're from a tragic opera like Idomeneo.<br /><br />The voices are marvelous, some more suited to this opera, some less.  I'm absolutely awed by Ildebrando D'Arcangelo's resonant bass, he recently recorded a splendid Don Giovanni, and his Figaro is predictably a commanding figure.  In fact, I would probably prefer a less dramatic sound for this fun character.  Same goes for Anna Netrebko.  She's a consummate actress, so she even manages to pull all the tricks Guth inserted into the play.  But her big dark sound doesn't have an iota of soubrette-ness, so necessary for Susanna.  Bo Skovhus is nearly an ideal Count.  He recorded the role years ago under Abbado and performed it many times, so it became a second skin.  He is, however, severely hampered by, again, the production.  He often has to sing one thing and act another, and so the music suffers.<br />Dorothea R&ouml;schmann has a beautiful voice, but it's much lighter than Netrebko's Susanna's, and when they sing together it's quite distracting.  Still, she manages her two big arias with a lot of musicality and dignity.  Christine Sch&auml;fer's Cherubino works exactly half the time.  She doesn't come across as a boyish mezzo (in fact, as I was just reminded she's actually a soprano), so her arias while beautifully sung seem a bit out of context.  She acts really well, which is quite an achievement given this overly sexualized production and the hideous clothes she's made to wear. Of the supporting characters I really enjoyed Basilio's \\"donkey's skin\\" aria, thankfully he was allowed to sing it without any painful distractions, unlike the poor Count.<br /><br />In the end, kudos to the singers who managed to pull it off despite Guth's and Harnoncourt's best efforts to mess with a perfectly fine opera. For that alone it's worth to get it.  But there are just so many wonderful productions blessedly devoid of extraneous \\"finds\\" by either the director or the conductor.<br />If Blu-ray is a must, go for the 2011 Teatro Real, Madrid, production, directed by Emilio Sagi, starring Ludovic T&eacute;zier, Barbara Frittoli, Luca Pisaroni, and Isabel Rey, under Jesus Lopez-Cobos's baton. [[ASIN:B005FWEQPS Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro]]. The singers are terrific and the traditional period production perfectly captures the humor and the wit of \\"Le Nozze\\" that Mozart himself and Da Ponte would've approved.  If Blu-Ray isn't a deciding factor, I would recommend the 1985 MET production with Ruggiero Raimondi, Carol Vaness, Kathleen Battle, Frederica Von Stade, and Thomas Allen, directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and conducted by the incomparable James Levine [[ASIN:B0064R8618 Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro]].  It  is satisfying visually and is wonderful vocally.either the director or the conductor.<br />If Blu-ray is a must, go for the 2011 Teatro Real, Madrid, production, directed by Emilio Sagi, starring Ludovic Tézier, Barbara Frittoli, Luca Pisaroni, and Isabel Rey, under Jesus Lopez-Cobos's baton.

B004ZJZQFG|5.0|Have seen this on DVD a few times and will probably see it several more over the years.  If you like a good movie from WWII then this is a must see.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Really good acting. Historical fiction. You won't be disappointed. Came quickly and packaged nicely.
B0067R0APK|4.0|A very useful, and detailed, weather App. There a period of about three month where it did not work properly, but it must have fixed. I have not had further problem for six months.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E.L. James doesn't disappoint in this second installment of the Fifty Shades.....the many facets of Christian are revealed leaving you wanting to know more. I can't wait to read the third!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great for Netfilx. Not as good as Roku but the price is right if you only watch Netflix! Easy install!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Love this movie and it has quickly become a holiday tradition.....I just bought a new 3D t.v. and getting Polar Express in 3D was a must!
0307719227|5.0|Excellent book, as well as nice researched and documented.  Extractive political regimes will fail despite possible \\"short-term\\" successes by the private sector or inclusive economic institutions.  I agree with readers' comments in relation to the implications that this book makes and being useful as a framework for other countries.<br /><br />However, I do wish for the authors to reconsider their views on countries' climate conditions.  Of course, there are exceptions like Singapore, but that is a very unique government that is essentially run by immigrated merchant Hoikken Chinese.<br /><br />Just today, we were reminded of the warmer/tropical climate vs government fiscal responsibility in the US.  Look at this map on US credit scores by State:<br />[...]<br /><br />Not surprisingly there are consistencies even in the US.  Warmer climates do worse.  There should be more research and studies on this matter.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan is a legendary country music star. His music gets better and better. I love his &#34;take&#34; on bluegrass. This cd displays Alan's many talents! Caution...once you hear a song, you might not be able to stop singing it yourself! :-)
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Another great book from Neil, if I had any criticism I think it would be that it left me wanting so much more.  I loved the farm the characters and the villains, he sure knows how to write stories that make you take ownership and not want to put it down to the very end.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|This movie is like I, Robot...it pisses all over the book.  If they'd have named it &#34;Brad Pitt Kills Zombies&#34; it may not have been so bad.  When you name your movie after one of the greatest books of the last 15 years, you better own it.  Not only did this NOT own it, it basically took every theme of the book and reversed it.<br /><br />The movie itself had interesting ideas...fast running and jumping zombies...not a bad idea.  Guess what?  That wasn't even in the book.  The whole point is that everything we were trained, equipped, and ready for was useless.  The book is almost a post-modern masterpiece of vinettes telling how the world had to start its thinking over.  It had to come together as never before, disregard old methods and tactics, let pride go by the wayside (after the battle of Yonkers almost annihilated the American army), and determine a totally new way to survive.  It was about the intense personal anquish caused by the South African plan, which saved most of the world.  It was about how the world had to come together in the face of an adversary for which it was totally unprepared and about how that affected people...it was an intensely personal story.<br /><br />The movie is about Brad Pitt with a machine gun.  Seriously.  That's it.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, probably because it supports a lot of my own opinions. (Yes, I realize the fault in this). I recommend it because he uses interesting, contemporary, situations to discuss how a lack of grit, determination, etc. can be more of an obstacle to success than the actual quality of education.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This is a great movie, and it's worth watching if you just didn't get the book.  It is close enough for combat, and you get most of the important plot-lines.  Even if you have never read the book, this is a great movie.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I have had this game for sometime and now I can't access it I have almost 380  pearls can anyone help
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|For all the hype this movie was just &#34;ok&#34; other than the plane upside down sequence it was predictable not sure why all the hype received
6305428042|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time especially for Halloween. The movie came in much sooner than I thought it would and the movie did not have any issues. Love it!
B00DWZHTOU|3.0|Not Too Shabby, This falls into my I wouldn't pay for it but it is not a bad flick.  The visuals are enough to for a recommendation. Best if you do not think about the plot too much.  Also wish that they had done more with Woody Harrelson.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|could not put it down! Makes one think about life's twists and turns. Crosses age barriers- from teens to retirees.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved Time to Kill.  I also loved Sycamore Row.  I would love to see Sycamore Row made into a movie like Time to Kill. It was well done which does not happen very often.
0307272702|5.0|This book saved my life. There is no diet plan in this book but it is a real eye opener. It is full of information and there is evidence to back up his findings. I read this book over a year ago and my life is forever changed. I followed a Low Carb diet and lost 25 lbs. Then my teenage kids got on my way of eating and each lost 20 lbs. Do yourself a favor and read this book. No more dragging thru the day and trying to stay awake after lunch. I feel and look great. After you read this book I recommend The Art and Science of Low Carb Living.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|There are some really beautifully rendered moments in this book, and I love the structure, the way it spins out from Benny and Sasha and explores people who operate often times at the fringes of their world, (much like certain sitcoms, its the little supporting characters, rather then the main ones with their cleanly expositioned lives and their bland problems that really make the book come alive).<br /><br />That being said, Egan's tendency to over explain her character's pasts and futures and to simply tell us what they have been and will be like instead of really developing them out and showing us makes me think the book was just written to become a screenplay option. And her little attempts at playing with the books form are pretty milquetoast. Maybe instead of using a third of the novel on a trite little chapter told in powerpoint format (oh, how experimental!), she could have used those pages to actually flesh out her main characters, who for all intents and purposes are pretty transparent examples of &#34;mid-life crisis guy&#34; and &#34;girl with a troubled past;&#34; or to add some more depth to the tangential characters who actually have some genuine humanity to them.<br /><br />It's also kind of a hopelessly new-yorkish book. The cheaply exotic scenes set in Africa and Naples feel sort of tacked on and kind of like attempts at a sort of cosmopolitan pseudo-worldliness rather than like a sincere engagement with any kind of space that simply isn't NYC.<br /><br />In spite of all that, it's not a terrible novel by any means, in fact I found myself kind of disappointed precisely because it seemed like Egan could have gone so much farther and deeper with this idea than what she shows here.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|A wonderful light-hearted tale with a serious message.  How would you make a living if your home was literally in a big city  trash dump?
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|These are some of my favorite novels. The characters are lovable and the writing is excellent. Perfect for when you want a completely enjoyable read and to get lost in a different reality. I am bad at writing reviews, but I am good at recommending books and these are for the reader who has been looking for a good book to read and is starting to lose faith in anything new or wonderful.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The third book in a trilogy always seems to disappoint. This is no exemption. However it was still an enjoyable book yet it lacked the same energy of the first two in the series. The 3 books together take an amazing journey with a few great characters.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|You know, I'm almost undecided about this one. On one hand, I really like all the explanation about Krypton, the story line there, and the action there. I also think Henry Cavill plays the best modern version of Superman we've seen yet. He has the look & build (I almost choked on the popcorn when he came out of the water that first time), the mannerisms, and that quirky quality that Christoper Reeves seemed to pull of so well. That being said, I wasn't super impressed with the overall plot of how they interacted with the main villain. Basically, the second half of the movie fell short for me. I think that is why it didn't do so well. I am however looking forward to the next one, and I hope the writers learn from their mistakes.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Simple and easy to use, with beautiful background graphics.  Integrates easily with My Alarm Clock.  Provides all of the information I need at a glance with a user friendly interface.  Great app for the KFHDX.
B00FY2UJAU|5.0|This is getting 5 stars because it is the 6th in a series and is still watchable. How many others (not based on books of course) can say that? This is just another chapter and its just as good as the rest. The best thing about these movies is that they haven't switched out any actors (which is the worse thing you can do to a sequel, yes?) and overall all the story lines blend into each other perfectly. Some of that action is a bit over the top, which is what you would expect in another Fast movie, also the &#34;family&#34; theme seems a little over done. All in all it was a good movie and let you spend more time with the characters we love. The opening credits is a good refresher too :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|One of the best media related purchases I've ever made and at a $35 price point, it's hard to beat. I'm considering getting more of them to give out for Christmas.<br /><br />It's really easy to set up and use. It currently supports Netflix, Hulu, Google Video, and recently HBOgo. I only wish it supported Amazon Prime.<br /><br />If you're like me and don't own an xbox or some other method of getting Netflix and HBOgo on your tv then get one.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Not what I expected. Russel Crowe is a great actor though....the Superman movies from my day were not so sci-fi intensive!! This movie is geared towards a newer generation! They should enjoy it.
B007EC6FIS|4.0|Meh..........His older stuff is better but this is hard to compare to his older and more heartfelt tunes.  Start with &#34;Hopes and Fears&#34; if you don't have it yet.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|An Interesting game that I can spend hours playing. I find myself getting completely caught up and sad when I run out of energy. I do get a little frustrated with the constant tutorial pop ups.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I thought this was just as good as Pillars of the Earth.  They both are a little hard to get into but become engrossing once you start caring about all the characters, both good guys and bad!  I've never been disappointed with anything written by Ken Follett  and this book is also a winner.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This was a wonderful purchase - well worth it.  My Mom is a Sound of Music fan and she really loved it!!
0891419063|5.0|The best and most thoughtful personal account of combat in the Pacific war ever published. Read this book at all costs.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Good type of dictionary but has many things that agree with evolution witch I disagree with but besides that good
0767919408|5.0|I believe that Bill Bryson could probably pick any year in America and find something entertaining to write about. He certainly succeeds here with a page turner filled, in typical Bryson fashion, with fascinating side details. I've enjoyed most of Bryson's books and this is as entertaining as any.
1936608898|5.0|Great book by great people. Sound advice for anyone wanting to get healthy or lose weight. I've lost weight by cleaning up my diet for sure!
B00F4BJ4M0|5.0|I didn't know this needed remastering, but, they did a great job. It does sound better than ever. Glad I picked it up.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|This was better than expected! It was highly entertaining and had a nice message. Great movie the whole family can enjoy.
B00E00GWBM|5.0|Glad I got this on vinyl + free CD in the package. John just gets better and better. May be his best yet.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Kind of like Men In Black with dead guys, RIPD was reasonably entertaining. It actually could have been a little longer if only to improve the world building.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Movie is great, great for fans of the Friendship is Magic series. Great music too! This is worth a fan's while.
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. Very little profanity. With so many reality programs on today, it is interesting to see what people were thinking before the genre became so prevalent.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great graphics and interesting game play. At times a bit heavy on the purchasing side but it isxmore than made up for by the puzzle aspect in crafting and gem merging.
0062255657|1.0|This is the dumbest book I read all year. Just hated it.  I wondered how all of the reviews could be so good for such a goofy book.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|It arrived on time and was as expected. Bond is always a pleasure to watch. This was a good value for the money
B00BWYX2MG|1.0|It doesn't work on LifeProof cases. Did work on I phone when I removed it from case. But like the label says, &#34;May not work on all screen protectors&#34;.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Felt it a little slow to begin compared with the pace at end. Lots of characters to keep track of. But still thoroughly readable.
B0015UKX7E|5.0|Prince IS in my opinion simply a Musical &#34;Genius&#34;, and the special guests including Lenny Kravitz, performing live onstage, trading off on guitar solos and vocals is absolutely worth getting this DVD, check out &#34;American Woman&#34;.  WOW!!!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|You tube is entertaining and fun.  The kindle version is an easy way to bring the fun with us where we go.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|This book has an interesting story, but it was hard for me to get past the writing style. It has a very amateur feel to it, like I'm reading a piece of fan-fiction. It's not necessarily bad, just didn't really grip me.
B00GINENG0|4.0|Lots of fun for my grandchildren and helps stop their boredom on our quick trips around town.  Makes the kids laugh.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|An entertaining game if you have a few minutes to kill.  I don't understand all the gift giving during the game.  I just like to play.
B001NA6096|5.0|I enjoyed this follow up of the original movie. It was interesting. Enjoyable. It kept the storyline going,although is was love unrequited!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Clever fantasy/sci-fi book with a fair flair for humor.  Mr. Scalzi's concept, that wars should only be fought by old men and women (albeit whose bodies are repaired and improved) makes for some fun philisophical fireworks and reflection.  If anything, I was disappointed only that the ride was so short, as the world he creates was a joy to explore.  I'm looking forward to reading more of his work.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|After hearing that it was a great movie, I was disappointed with this movie. It just didn't deliver for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so much better on a big screen. Totally addicted to this game &amp; 2 have it on a big screen is fantastic. would recommend 2 all.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Shadow follows little guys.  Too hard  to see  and it quits just as I get into it.  Dies out too soon.
0307341550|4.0|Wow this book is a little different!  Its a little bit like Stephen King you know rather unsettling but yet not gory!  Camille Preaker is a beautiful woman from Wind Gap, MO who is now a reporter living in Chicago and is sent by her 2nd rate newspaper to cover 2 possible serial murders, where you ask? Wind Gap of course where she use to call home.  Her mother is just nuts, the step dad is strange, the little sister is a sleeze and Camille herself reveals she has psychological issues!! But she reveals and figures out who doneit at the end and it was a very good short read! Kept you guessing and I loved it!  Great Job Ms Flynn 4.5 * * * *
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's addicting but I'm stuck at level 30 and can't seem to move past it.  I just try a couple times a day for a few minutes cuz I get frustrated.  I'm a senior citizen and now I see why kids get hooked on these games.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I've been buying Logitech headsets since I started gaming back in 2000.  This is, hands down, the worst one I've ever owned.  When I game I can go as long as 12+ hours nonstop and this headset can't keep up.  It inevitability runs out of battery and starts making terrible noises before it turns off.  This forces me to have it plugged in(defeating the purpose of wireless).  Even then it STILL RUNS OUT OF BATTERY!!!  I mean come on... if you're going to advertise a headset for gaming, design it as such.  Another annoying thing is learning the science behind turning the dang thing on.  Hit the power button you say? no no...I will literally be in my chair spending a minute or two trying to get it to work.  I've had it for about a year and the surround sound mode doesn't work anymore.  I owned a Logitech G35 before this headset and I REALLY wish I kept it.  It is so much better than this one in every way.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 because out of box the sound was fantastic.  Music was crisp with great bass.  I could hear everything I needed to hear in my video games.<br /><br />Sorry Logitech...you lost a loyal customer.  Time to get a pair of Astros or Razer :(
B00127RAJY|5.0|The best program I've tried if youre really trying to get started with toning and shedding the last 5-10 lbs.  Very challenging!  You HAVE to stick to it, at least 5 days a week.
B00D0OR5EC|5.0|This book is truly amazing. I cannot emphasize how beautifully this book is written, and how raw the feelings and emotions are.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I always know a Grisham novel is a very special treat.  Savoured every page!  The setting, a little history, some regional culture and always a fair outcome.  Looking forward to the next one.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Hilarious movie and a Very entertaining comedy! Awesome cast and roles! Picks fun at the US vs Mexico drug smuggling arena
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|It was an interesting plot with a lot of drama and action.  The ending was sad with a good twist.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Very intriguing Bond movie. Many people say&#34;don't look back,&#34; but for Bond, the past is often his salvation. Watch and see!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game don't get me wrong but I have a bunch if keys on there that I bought but almost all the outfits glitch out and have lines that show how there animated and its annoying me a lot.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|My dad loves the Beatles and really loves this CD! This is a must have for anyone who loves them!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|So I double dipped and picked up the Blu-Ray despite having the DVD version already (I love it that much!)  The sound quality is far superb on the Blu-Ray (hence why I bought it).  The clarity is very good for the most part, but it is a live performance which was recorded, so there are occasional little blurs.<br /><br />Hands down my favorite version of Phantom, and the Blu-Ray is well worth it - even if you already have the DVD!  Just gift the DVD to a friend and share the love!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a very fun game I will tell all my friends about it thank you for all the fun.
B006GECE9Y|2.0|May be a good browser for some people.  For me, I still go back to my basic ones.  I probably haven't explored this one enough to do a good review.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Fun game but instructions are hard to find. And, additional cost to get rid of game ending bombs? just ruins the experience.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Even with less than great coordination, this game is a lot of fun to play.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves their minions.

B00881VLCE|1.0|DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!! I  love this app but purchased puzzles before and one update deleted them and it never did restore all my purchases. And then I have purchased that $5.99 deal and ever since its been installed the pieces to every puzzle are super jacked up. It's frustrating because I paid for no ads and more puzzles BUT THEY DON'T WORK PROPERLY!  It'd be my favorite app if it worked right.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|It's pretty fun but I'm having some problems. The game won't let me create my character do I can't save, or create a world...please help!!!??? :(
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Kindle review-gotta be brief.  Unforgettable yarn woven around a unforgettable moment in history.  This copiously researched story takes the question &#34;what if?&#34; to new heights.  Do yourself a favor and indulge in this fascinatingly plausible fantasy!
B001EBWIUO|5.0|Probably in the all time top 5 movies in the category of those that nail down credible, plausible human faults and virtues with surgically precise perormances by all the major and minor characters and a musical score that will live forever. There are no words of praise that do justice to John & Walter Huston's artistry nor that of Humphrey Bogart. Rarely has such a good piece of literature...a great piece of literature...been translated into such an entertaining, riveting, engaging masterpiece of cinema!
0812982622|2.0|Dark and fragmented.  I have to believe that there are people living lives in North Korea that are content and filled with the laughter and love of family and friends.  This book makes it seem like the country is one big torture chamber, filled with generations of evil intentions.  The protagonist went from one phase of lies and deceit to another, learning to cope and mask his identity easily, almost chameleon-style.  It wasn't convincing.  I got the feeling that the author included as much graphic, violent imagery as possible to ensure future movie rights.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Great one liners and actually some very nice acting here and there from Downey, Johansson and Ruffalo (the man can communicate a lot without uttering a word) but otherwise this was tepid story.  We watched The Avengers to get background on the Agents of SHIELD TV show, which we are enjoying.
B00GSE92F6|5.0|The Day of the Doctor was wonderful, more like a movie than a TV episode, so the higher price seems reasonable to me.  If you'd rather save I'm sure it will go down if you wait a few weeks or months.  It's awful to see this extraordinary episode averaging a 3-star rating due to price issues that are likely temporary.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|This is an excellent point and click game with great graphics and NO annoying HIDDEN OBJECT games!  I would have rated it 4 due to the lack of hints, but when I got stuck, the developer was VERY helpful in getting me unstuck so it definitely deserves this 5 star rating.  There is also a hint guide on the way!  I will definitely buy from this developer in the future!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|At just over 300 pages, Malala Yousafzai’s memoir covers a lot more ground than I expected. I anticipated an account of the events leading up to the fateful day on October 9, 2012, when members of the Taliban accosted and shot Malala while she was riding the bus home from school. Yes, her memoir is an account of that terrible day and how Malala found herself a target of the Taliban, but it is so much more than that.<br /><br />For one thing, the book intertwines a primer of the history and culture of Pakistan with the events of Malala’s life. This memoir was co-written with Christina Lamb, a longtime foreign correspondent to Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Malala also credits a couple of her father’s friends with providing feedback and insight on the history of Swat, the region of Pakistan where Malala’s family comes from. Although at times a challenging read because of all the unfamiliar foreign names and terms, the background information helped me to understand the cultural and socio-political environment in which Malala grew up. Before reading this book I knew very little about Pakistan. I did not realize Pakistan is a very young country, having been founded in 1947. However, the fabric of Pakistan is woven from many different peoples and cultures that date much farther back than the mid-twentieth century. Malala and her family descend from a long line of Pashtuns, an ethnic group scattered throughout Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pashtuns have their own heritage and traditions. The tradition I found most interesting is that Pashtuns do not say thank you because they never forget a good deed and will return the kindness.<br /><br />&#34;I Am Malala&#34; also gives an account of how Malala’s father grew up. On the back of the hardcover book jacket is a tender photograph of Malala and her father, whose arm wraps around his daughter’s shoulder. Their smiles convey a special kinship with one another. After reading about her father Ziauddin’s perseverance in getting a college education and then founding his own school for boys and girls, both with very few resources and much opposition, I understand where Malala’s passion for the right to education comes from. The memoir also describes the quiet strength of Malala’s mother, Tor Pekai, whom Malala and her father credit for much of their courage. It’s clear that Malala would not be who she is without the positive influence and support of her amazing parents.<br /><br />Although I was aware on a surface level of the Taliban’s oppressive practices, hearing about it in the news just does not have the same impact as reading a personal, firsthand account of what it’s like to live with the Taliban in your neighborhood. This memoir throws stark light on how deeply evil has taken root in Pakistan.<br /><br />Yet despite all the corruption that has infiltrated Pakistan, Malala loves her country. She loves the beautiful Swat valley where she grew up, which is lush with fruit trees and surrounded by white-capped mountains. She loves her people, the Pashtuns. Malala, named after a young Pashtun woman who rallied the Afghan army when they were losing to Britain and inspired them to take victory in 1880 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, clearly shares much in common with this brave female leader. And she loves her faith, Islam. She talks about how Pakistan’s founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, wanted a place for Muslims to practice their faith freely, and yet this young country has already seen much turmoil and bloodshed from constant power struggles. Nevertheless, Malala and her people have a strong faith that cannot be shaken by the totalitarian, corrupted version of Islam that the Taliban uphold. “The Taliban think we are not Muslims but we are,” Malala insists. “We believe in God more than they do and we trust him to protect us.” This, she seems to be saying, is the real Pakistan—not the harshly judgmental and cruel practices of the Taliban.<br /><br />Malala says,“I don’t want to be thought of as ‘the girl who was shot by the Taliban,’ but ‘the girl who fought for education.’” I believe her memoir succeeds in demonstrating that she is so much more than “the girl who was shot by the Taliban.” Malala is a young woman of unwavering courage and strong faith, who is determined to overcome all obstacles to help girls and women everywhere claim the right to an education. Her story reminds me how blessed and fortunate I am to live in America, where education is much more accessible to females, and where citizens are free to practice their own faith in their own way. Many people in the world are not free to claim these basic rights, yet Malala’s hope for a better future is inspiring.
B0058YPILY|5.0|The show is great. Enjoy watching it everytime I get the chance. I would recommend this to any one who likes to watch crime programs.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|it's awful, seriously one of the most bipolar apps i have ever had the displeasure of using. has a mind of it's own.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great beginning to a wonderful series. I read them all three times. They get better each time, something new always catches my mind.
B00GO95BUU|4.0|Overall, I loved the series, but the Day of the Doctor ... I thought it could of been better.  There seemed to be a lot of 'lets undo and hit the rewind button' on stuff that had been canon, aka the Time War.  Also, where was River Song who was so much a part of both the 10th and 11th doctors, or for that matter, where was the 9th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston?  I mean the guy/actor is alive right, was there so much bad blood here that they couldn't include him somewhere in the episode?<br /><br />why did they switch in Liz the 1st to be the Doctor's wife, to take the place if his wife, River Song?  Why no mention AT all of River song?  Will we ever find out who the Doctor's Grandaughter, Susan Forman's parents were (I'm still rooting that she wasn't really the Doctor's grand daughter, but is/was really his daughter with River song)?<br /><br />Also, I'm seeing a lot of 'complaining is the polite word here' about the upping of the price by Amazon @ the last minute.<br /><br />People who got hit with this, were the ones who waited until the last minute to buy and then only wanted to buy the 50th, 1 episode @ a time.<br /><br />This is why I always get the season pass whenever I want to get a TV show I can't otherwise get (Like in this case, where I don't get BBC American). This way the price is guarenteed by Amazon @ 1.89 an episode for SD (which BTW the SD format WILL play on a HD TV, and is much cheaper), and if you MUST have it in HD, if you get the season pass, the you would get each episode for $2.89 an episode.<br /><br />For me personaly, I signed up a while back for the Season Pass for the 50th (including all the extras) as soon as it became available on Amazon, as this way I make sure I don't miss a thing, and also they can't jump the price on me either.<br /><br />Another way is to sign up for Amazon Prime for I think it's $79 a year ... where you would (from my understanding) be able to download anything instant for free after you pay for the membership.YOu also I think then get free shipping on purchases from Amazon as well if you have a yearly membership with Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Just a suggestion for future reference for everyone here.<br /><br />What I payed for the Day of the doctor because I pre-bought the entire 'season' ahead of time is shown below:<br /><br />Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection, Ep. 8 \\"The Day of the Doctor\\"<br /><br />Amazon Instant Video<br />Sold by Amazon Digital Services , Inc.<br />Review this item<br /><br />Original Air Date: November 23, 2013<br /><br />Item(s) Subtotal:<br /><br />$1.89<br /><br />Promotions:<br /><br />-$0.00<br /><br />Tax Collected:<br /><br />$0.00<br /><br />Grand Total:<br /><br />$1.89<br /><br />Again, I loved the 50th series, but IMO, the Day of the Doctor ... well I was a tad disappointed with it in the end.  I actually liked An Adventure in Space and Time much better, and the end of AAISAT... had me crying.  Too bad they didn't use that as the format for when they did the Day of the Doctor.
0195170776|5.0|Got this Second Edition at a great deal.  This edition still has the old CD for registration, which I don't believe works any longer.  The print and font are just the right size. The binding is sewn and sturdy.<br /><br />The derivation of words is easy to read and understand, complete with a 'how to use the dictionary' section at the front.<br /><br />The thumb index and finding words with the guide words atop each page makes for fast look-up.<br /><br />Recommended.
B006NXI58M|5.0|Could the hunger games get any better? That's what I asked myself after I finished the first book. Well, Suzanne Collins has wowed me yet again,
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun to play. I am a horse Sim veteran,  and this is much better than any I've ever played!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game to play and will not get bored with it. You can get hooked on this game. Have fun.
B00A655N8I|5.0|This is a unique recording, not at all like Levine's or Solti's entries, with crescendos blazing across the room where one listens. It is more along the lines of Haitink's EMI Ring of the early 90s. Every note played with such delicacy, such care, that it seems too prepared at first, but then the opera takes hold of Giergev, posseses him and his genius meets the Wagnerian challenges.<br /><br />The cast is superb, especially Stemme's Brunnhilde, Kaufmann's Siegmund, and Pape's Wotan. Great praise for Ekaterina Gubanova's Fricka, moving, plaintive, sorrow-ridden, exquisite.<br /><br />Nina Stemme's full bodied notes are a relief after the Voight voice which cuts and cuts the notes off with determination, to accomodate her own worn out instrument. Kaufmann's voice is immaculate in every way; he is one of the great Wagnerians of this age. Pape's Wotan takes getting used to, because he does not shout it out all over the world. His interpretation is the Italian influence Wagner tried for in all of his operas but never really achieved. Bellini was Wagner's favorite, even over Mozart. But Wagner is far away from the mysteries of Norma or Beatrice Di Tenda. Rene Pape,however,is not far from those Italian masterpieces; he understands with breathtaking musical wisdom the value of the smallest bar of music, like Bellini. Nothing is casual, and Pape lets his voice flow over the notes with millions of feelings and  vocal colors that place him as one of the best Wotans ever.<br /><br />Giergiev needs to stop humming along with the singers, a real distarction when listening with earphones. I thought the days of Coiln Davis' huming along recordings were over. They are not over.<br /><br />All has not been said, but buy this set and listen for the soft violins, cellos, and French horns. Feel the heat and yet glory in  the carefully phrased Walkure declamations of Nina Stemme, and her pleas with her father..so intimate, so right.<br /><br />One magnificent thrill after another here!
031623480X|5.0|This book is a must for everyone on this planet ... especially parents!<br />The great dumbing down of America is, in part, due to our diet.<br />Let's get smart as a nation and start eating a grain-free diet.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game i have no problem so far its fun to play i love shooting at the animals for food and there are lots of things to do
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My 5 yr old grandson purchased this game by mistake but it has been a great learning tool. Repetition and word recognition have helped him with spelling. And he loves it because it's fun. Money well spent!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I learned a few things I did not know,and the book is well written but most of what was in the book be a catholic I already new.He talks about St. Paul a lot .
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Cloud Atlas was one of the few novels in a long time that I did not want to put down.  It was made up of six small stories, enveloped by a larger story.  The small stories were very different, but they are well written and engaging.  Each one could stand by itself.  It was easy to care about the characters.  I liked to see the world from their many different perspectives.<br /><br />On top of that, the enveloping larger story was very clever. Watch closely, and you will see how they all fit together in the end.  The obvious metaphor for the larger story is peeling away the layers of an onion.  But, that is not quite right.  it is really more like starting at the center of an onion, digging your way out, looking around, then climbing back down into the onion.  In the end, you will understand the onion more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best ap for Bible reading or studying. I have told everyone I know about it. I like the new offline downloadable versions and the fact that many of them actually read to you.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|At first I wasn't to sure that I would love ARTPOP the single Applause did not really do it for me.  however the album in another jewel in Gaga's Tiara.  It is very different from all the other albums she has made so far.  I get the feeling from this album of Gaga as a good Borg Queen.  I love how robotic but at the same time how heartfelt her vocals are.  Gaga you have brought me so much happiness again and I am very pleased.<br /><br />with love to GAGA<br />xoxo<br />PERFUMEKEV
B004I744AS|5.0|Woks great. This is more than just a dictionary. There are some nice features as well to help you learn while you are looking.
B0086C5EKA|1.0|This DVD  is a piece of trash. First of all, it took too damn long to ship it, and by the time I received it, I wasn't able to play it on my  newDVD/Blue Ray device. I guess it's in a different format or region.I immediately took it and threw it in the trash. Will not buy from this seller again!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Good fun! Always enjoy all the angry bird games and this one is good fun, would recommend to anyone who enjoy bird games

B000002NAK|5.0|I have loved this soundtrack since it came out in the 90's. Say what you want about Madonna, but she did a good job with this role. This is my favorite rendition of &#34;Don't Cry for me Argentina&#34;.<br /><br />I am not one for musicals, but I can listen to this one all day long.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Awesome graphics easy to understand. First time to play this kind of game. The blood is a little too much for young kids I think.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Good action, but unattractive story and roles. Don't know why they want the hero 007 to get old and weak.
B005ES11YW|5.0|I love these more than any other pair I have ever owned! The fit great and they are really comfy!
1451627297|5.0|I just finished this book. It is absolutely incredible. It was complete coincidence I was reading it at the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination but it helped as a backdrop if you will. It was on the radio, tv ,etc and provided context for the book. This book is a love story about time travel and what might have been. I can't recommend it enough.
0788812408|4.0|One of the best Disney movies. Love Ariel's struggle for acceptance. Her brightness contrasting with Ursula's dark demeanor creates a powerful battle for the love of Prince Eric.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|It is better than swype, but still has areas to be improved upon. That being said, they have a 'forum' for adding and voting on suggestions, and actually have updates from the staff on popular items.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|The Bridges of Madison County is a timeless tale that is so cleverly crafted that you cannot accurately duplicate, yet so relatable anyone can identify.<br /><br />Streep plays middle-aged, Iowa housewife Francesca. This Italian native, who is bursting with ambitious hopes and dreams on the inside, is trapped in an obligatory marriage to a terribly ordinary man and their two children. Their lives are horribly mundane at best.<br /><br />Her husband takes their kids to Illinois for a state fair, and Francesca stays behind for three days.<br /><br />Suddenly a renowned photographer, Robert, arrives with all the charisma, passion, looks, and life experience that Francesca has craved. Their is an immediate attraction, eclipsing her judgement and causing her to battle with her morality.<br /><br />The heart wants what it can't have, and for Francesca, she has to make the right choice. This is a powerful story about love, betrayal, self sacrifice, and passion. You find yourself on the other side of the fence of morality, wanting her to choose the man who has everything she wants and needs. It will pull at your heart strings.<br /><br />Streep is unforgivably talented in this heartfelt tale...this emotional love story that will make you think and feel. I would give this movie 10 stars if I could.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works really well.  The video quality is really good.  The device is also very easy to set up.  It works with an Android phone, a PC, and an iPad.  This is definitely worth $35.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Artpop shows Gaga's versatility and creativity. Aura seems to be a statement about a veil Gaga hides behind, her vulnerable side that people don't know yet. Venus, G.U.Y., Sexxx Dreams, and Artpop have heavy electric dance beats, clever lyrics, and further explain Gaga's fusion of art and popular culture. Do What U Want with R Kelly and Jewels N' Drugs show her versatility, delving into rap and R&B. Gypsy seems to chronicle her journey through fame/her Born This Way ball, followed by Applause--missing the admiration and attention of fans. While there are some tracks that I don't particularly care for (Swine, Donatella, Fashion!) I still think this is a work of \\"art.\\"
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my grandson loves it and he is only 3.  it was nice to be able to adjust the game for his age level.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good one than the previous version  nice game and I guess it needs more updates to make it more interesting.<br />Please remove this number of words requirement
B002MFULQO|5.0|What Jim Garrison said in the 1960's, and what Stone echoed in 1991 via this motion picture, is highly relevant today in 2013. When government lies, freedom is lost. Today, more than ever, we have deceit and corruption in the place of liberty and justice. Anyone who can look at the overwhelming evidence in the case of JFK, RFK, MLK, and Malcolm X, and believe that there was no military industrial complex involvement is either woefully myopic or a pathological liar.<br /><br />The evidence takes the form of testimony from hundreds of eye witnesses, scientists, doctors and government employees. To view all the various facts of the case as coincidental is the height of self-delusion and simple-mindedness.<br /><br />This nation was born fighting the powers that be. It is no different in 2013 than in 1991, or 1963, or 1776!<br /><br />This is an excellent movie that brings into play hundreds of questionable bits of evidence and ties it all together in an exceptionally unbiased manner. Jim Garrison was a true patriot and a hero for truth, liberty and justice.<br /><br />Watch this....many times.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Worked perfectly ...after 7 days of digging on the internet and talking to dozens of people from Google Chromecast and Actiontec (my Modem/Wi-Fi home DSL network adapter) about the Google dongle and PK5000 (WI-Fi modem). None had a clue on how to make this combo work. It seems like many Chromecast dongles would be returned because of this reason. Also no where did I find a list of DSL modems this WOULD work with.<br /><br />If you have an older modem that the Chromecast refuses to work (and your software and hardware can support it).  I'd recommend this fix. Get a inexpensive Wi-Fi USB dongle like the Cisco AM10 Valet Connector USB Wireless Adapter. And install it. It's about 10 bucks with shipping. All the people I talked with, none had this soultion other than Actiontec wanting me to buy another Wi-Fi modem for 100 bucks.<br /><br />After installing this 10 dollar Wi-Fi dongle onto my system's (Windows 7 home, PC) USB port and then finding the dongle along with the network's name, put in the password and BINGO it worked and it works well for streaming video to my 65 inch Flat screen.<br /><br />I don't know how many people have returned this Chromecast dongle because they didn't know this simple fix or nor did the service departments but it must be many.<br /><br />I'm finally happy.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Short ant sweet bio on Tesla.....easy to read....not the most common knowledge....take the time and learn. Good info to share
B00CIAZ04G|5.0|I am a practitioner of Wing Chun and have known about Ip Man for years. I was excited to see a movie like this even though I don't believe it's 100% historically acurate.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|works GREAT! I love this app. I was surprised at how stable it is. It's great to help resolve computer issue when away from home or just use a program that I don't have an app for on my smart phone.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great  book by John Grisham with a wonderful and meaningful ending.  I am a white American - but this<br />book shows why racism is evil.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|It keep me interested and wanting to read more.  John is a very good writer and anyone who likes writing will enjoy it plus he keeps one in suspense.  Any one who likes his writing.  It is contemporary.  Gold is good!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its so fun<br />I just cant stop playing it<br />I cant put my tablet down<br />fun
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|Hey, Orpheus! This album sucks! When will it be over? Not soon enough. This album is an insult to the ears. Oh, and there's a hidden track!? Woo hoo.. if it were any good it wouldn't be hidden and the rest of the album is worthless so who cares.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Very entertaining game. Has a bit of everything. It's well worth it. I hope there will be a third one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was thinking that a book about nazi Germany would be depressing and a sad reminder of the evil of the world. This book is the exact opposite, it is the underlying life and wonder in the world at its darkest time.
068485743X|2.0|I purchased this book after reading several reviews as well as the excerpt which seemed to me to have plenty of good advice. The trouble is that after the first few chapters the ratio of good advice vs arrogant editor's opinion swings highly in favor of the author's opinion on what to write and how to write it.<br />This book will not teach you grammar, it will not teach you structure, or how to create a character. It assumes that you understand English well enough that you don't need to be taught these things, which is fine. There's no reason to waste time going over basic grammar in a book like this. The issue pops up in the examples used to highlight Lukeman's points. These examples are so filled with blatant mistakes that they become useless. In the chapter about reducing the use of adjectives and adverbs, every sentence of the example has at least three or four unnecessary words that he then painstakingly points out after the example. He follows this up several more examples, all equally extreme as the first. It becomes insulting to be shown examples like this, as if the the author assumes his readers cannot possibly understand his point unless he hangs a neon sign above it with an arrow pointing the mistakes. The examples are so overdone they becomes pointless. If your problem is anywhere near as extreme as what he shows in the examples then this probably isn't the book for you. One on grammar would be better. More useful would have been examples that show subtle issues, showing how they can quietly work their way into your writing and how to spot them. As it is, I eventually gave up on even reading the examples because they were all so obvious they didn't serve to make any point.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter he also gives exercises to practice the skills he has taught, saying you shouldn't move on in the book until you've done them. Were you to do as he said, it would probably take about a month to finish the book.<br /><br />Lastly is his arrogance.This was very frustrating. He prefaces every chapter with a quote, and they get more and more depressing with each chapter. Eventually I felt that he must not want me to be writing at all if this is how he feels. He is constantly saying what things a beginning writer shouldn't do (don't use multiple points of view for instance (what? you want me to write a story with only one POV? Why would I write in 3rd person then?) but never seems to point out what things a beginning writer should do.<br /><br />Simply put, I have never read a book that has made me feel so negatively about my own writing. It didn't give me the feeling of &#34;oh, I need to improve this&#34; or &#34;oh, that's my weakness&#34; It just made me feel that even trying to write was rather pointless and I would never succeed. That is a feeling I don't subscribe to, and so this book gets two stars. One of which is for the useful bits in the beginning.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Its a cool game I like how they have different places to hunt and in those places you hunt the animals that live in that area.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very easy way to waste time away though make sure you have in app purchasing off if your kids are going to play.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|I love doctor who so this was a no brainer!  I really only just watched day of the doctor, but it was very good.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|this is one of the best thing i have bought ever, the cover is amazing and looks sharp on my kindle, gives a feeling that one is reading and old book, and i am a sucker for old style books.
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|When I saw the movie I felt like a lot was missing.. Blurred by the cirque the soleil sex scenes that were implemented by the director. I felt the undertone in there and now I have read this I feel I know the whole story.. I recommend if the movie spoke to you but like me felt a lot was left out you also read this to get the details a little more. Its beautifully drawn and it actually made me cry...( the movie did not!) emotionally tense and I didnt feel it was stereotypical but a real personal story..
B008LXZEYU|1.0|Stupid movie. Spongebob grown up to crass and inappropriate.  The people who would like this movie probably grew up on Cartoon Network and all the inappropriate shows there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book! I didn't know what to expect because I never watched the movie or knew much about it, but it was good!
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Great app but the last update made the startup of any station really slow. Before the update the startup seem much quicker.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|One of my favorite bands and it highlighted their career so far very good buy. Highly recommended to Seether fans.
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|Barely held my interest, and only because of the intrigue. But the plot was predictable, and a lot of the acting was poor. Felt very much like a &#34;B&#34; move.
B00371XIJE|5.0|I haven't felt so touched by a movie as I was with Hachi: a dog's Tale in quite some time. Be sure to have a box of kleenex handy, that's for sure! A movie the whole family will love. The way I look at it, if this movie does not pull at your heart, something is truly missing in that area.
B008JFUNHI|4.0|&#34;In the moment when I truly understand my enemy. Understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.&#34; After an attack on Earth by an alien race the International Military Academy will do anything it take to keep it from happening again. Colonel Graff (Ford) is in charge of training and finding the future leaders. When he watches a young soldier named Ender Wiggin (Butterfield) he thinks he has found the future. I will do this review in two parts. First of all this is a fun and exciting movie that is geared toward teens but adults will like it as well. The effects are great and the violence isn't anything for parents to be worried about at all. For then entertainment factor alone I recommend this for all families. The second part is about a deeper meaning. I could be reading way too much into this and I don't mean to get political but the movie is kind of a metaphor for the Iraq war. I don't want to give anything away but if you go into it with that mindset you will see what I mean. I know the book it is based off of is older then the war but when you watch it you will see what I mean. Anyway what I'm trying to say is that this is a good family movie that I recommend. Overall, exciting and entertaining and me and my son both liked it. I give it a B+.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great running app, challenging then the others, very addictive though this app does have some glitches when you change locations or after a power-up and can cause you to lose.
B00BEIYL6G|4.0|&#34;The people who think they are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who usually do.&#34; This is the story of Steve Jobs (Kutcher). It begins with him making the decision to drop out of college then shows his rise from working at Atari to eventually creating the company of Apple computers. I don't really know too much about the life of Jobs but I could tell there was a bunch of stuff they cut out. For example in one scene he bargains with an investor for money for his garage computer shop, the next scene he has a huge office with tons of employees. I know they can't show everything but there are large jumps. They did really seem to skim over a whole story about his daughter that seemed important. I also didn't realize he started at Atari, but the main thing I didn't know was how big of a jerk he was. It is hard to not think of the Social Network when watching this one mainly because of the subject matter. There are a ton of similarities but the one constant between Jobs and Zuckerberg are the way they forgot about everyone that helped them out in the beginning and that is the most devastating part of their lives to me. With that comment out of the way and personal feelings aside this was a very good movie and I really liked it much more then I expected to. Overall, really good movie and I have to say Kutcher did a good job but if any Oscar nominations come out of this it should be for Josh Gad. He was fantastic in this. I give it an A-.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Awesome. This story will remain with us a lifetime! While a work of fiction it is an exemplary work of good versus evil.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Quite simply I have not heard any live album as good as this. It's the essential Neil Young recording. This is him at the peak of his careers. His voice was perfect here. Also unlike most live albums, the sound quality is spectacular. You can't go wrong with buying this album. I get goosebumps every time I hear it!
B00G21XNKU|1.0|Double charged and not what I expected. I was expecting another episode.  I did not finish watching. The music was great

B00CW665VI|3.0|We were so looking forward to reading Tangled, we had both read the awesome reviews it has been getting and our expectations were high. But we both agree this was not one of our favorite books. While it was quick witted and entertaining it was just missing something for us.<br /><br />We’ll start with the positives, Emma Chase did a great job of writing from Drew’s POV. It is not often that a female author can successfully write from the males POV and have it be believable but Emma did a great job! We found Drew to be funny and while his honesty may have offended some, we found it refreshing.<br /><br />But on the other hand, we just did not love the book. It took us both a while to get through it. Neither of us can pinpoint why we did not fall in love with it. The story was good, it was entertaining it just did not draw us in like we hoped it would.<br /><br />We really liked Kate’s character – a strong and successful business women building her reputation in a male dominated business.<br /><br />Drew’s efforts to win over Kate were sometimes childish and not believable. While we were rooting for him, we also were annoyed that he went to such lengths to win her over while disrupting the entire office, it was just not believable to us. Yes, Drew’s dad was the big boss, but we highly doubt any reputable investment firm would allow for Drew’s tactics. Yes, we realize this is fiction and we hate when reviews take the book to literal but this was a bit of a deal breaker for us.<br /><br />DRINK OF CHOICE: Beer
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Great CD.  I love the song choices, composition and lyrics.  Anyone can relate to one of these songs; especially if they have experienced love and heartache.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Not Grisham's best but a really different legal tale.. A good read. I Enjoyed the story and the type of town and people in it.
B005MVLI8A|5.0|I love nirvana, I had to have this in MP3 format. I love having it on my app all the time! Great CD and super convenient the fact that we can listen to it anywhere from the amazon player app.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love CCSaga. Unfortunately the game does not recognize when I purchase extras from the Amazon store. The store recognizes the purchase but the game does not receive the credited items. Very annoying to have to spend 3 days playing quests to move to the next area. Too bad no one can figure out the problem.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|I received this promptly.  I purchased this to read my Canon camera's micro card in my Nexus 7 tablet and it works fine.  I wanted something small and that's what I got, but it is difficult to handle -- a little fragile because of it's tiny size.  Once the micro card is inserted (it goes in completely), it is difficult to remove, because both the card and the reader are so tiny.  There is not much to grip and they are both the same color - black - so it's hard to be sure I'm pulling on the right places.  It might be easier if the reader was a contrasting color.  Also, the reader is only half the thickness of a regular USB plug, so I have to think about which way is up and look carefully at the USB port to align it correctly when inserting it in my laptop or my OTG cable.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Excellent music and dancing. Every guy I know wanted to be like Danny Zuko. Travolta and Newton-John had real chemistry. I watch it EVERYtime it's playing on cable as if it's the first time I'm seeing it. The music will never grow old.
3899554914|5.0|First off, its not all Harleys. Generally it's a book for people who understand the experience of motorcycling and have grown beyond the go as fast as humanly possible period of life. I keep it on my coffee table and pick it up daily. Most importantly, it makes me want to go for a ride.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|If you are a Sci-Fi buff, then you will love this movie! It will have you guessing until the end and and I promise.....you will love the ending!!
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I was skeptical on this series but after watching Season 1 for free on Prime, I jumped on it. Season 2 was not as good, although still enjoyable and worth the purchase. I purchased because I wanted to get caught up before Season 3 (which is lacking, but I will save that for another review).
B003O86FMW|5.0|it just fills you with anticipation you can't  put it down. It is super exciting and i wish i could read the whole series twenty four seven
B0098G7AWS|5.0|This film will be another &#34;gone with the wind&#34;.  I cannot imagine anybody not loving this as it has it all: drama, suspense, comedy, sex, romance.....I could go on... A great movie with excellent actors.
B00CIWOJUU|5.0|This 2012 recording is a gracious, intimate rendition of the Schumann Second, a work that Abbado is eager to reveal as a treasure trove of beauty and brilliant ideas. While many versions of the Second strain for power and scale (often overdoing it), Abbado goes the opposite way: it is not necessary to shout. The performance by the Orchester Mozart (Abbado's all-star ensemble from Italy) is purposely understated, subtle, and chamber music-like, inviting you to hear the details in a fresh and different way. While the bigger and harder driving aspects of the work  are certainly present in all the right places, they are less emphasized overall. The result is clean, clear, lighter, and impeccably phrased. There is a pleasant feeling of suspension that carries forward. The tempos are ideal and comfortable.<br /><br />With due respect to other reviewers who complain about any \\"lack of energy\\", they miss the point, which is that a different energy can be just as effective. Abbado is not showing fragility in old age (witness his recent titanic performances of Mahler), but sharing a unique distillation of a work that he has grown to love. The Manfred and Genoveva overtures are handled in the same compelling fashion.<br /><br />It is unlike any other recording of the Second, although the clarity, detail, high musicianship and understanding of Schumann probably would have impressed the late George Szell.<br /><br />This is a rewarding and moving performance that has a place in any Schumann collection.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I read both Divergent and Insurgent and I loved both. Though I do think Insurgent was a much better book than Divergent. I loved the characters and the plot. The idea of the society and the events that lead to the fall of that society are really something that makes you think. Since I loved the previous two books I really tried to love this one...It just wasn't doing it for me. The beginning of the book helps relieve the cliffhanger of Insurgent but then it is about 250 pages of very monotonous story description and information. The book never really moves even though events are happening. I agree with a previous review that the two points of view are hard to discern. I found myself returning to the first page of the chapter many times just to figure out who's POV I was reading from. The one thing I did love was the ending. Many people hated the ending and I can understand why. There are certainly holes within the plot but the ending was something that I think made the book. Usually YA books and most books in general give you a sugar coated, lovey dovey ending or they completely leave you without closure on relationships and plots. This book allowed for closure and it was a realistic ending for the characters within the book.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|This is a classic which one can watch over and over and see something previously missed.  The humor and irony of the plot is wonderful. While not suitable for young children it is the type of feel good movie one can enjoy when there is nothing on TV.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Controls are simple,  but stable.  Takes a while to get thru everything without paying for the extra stuff but can be done with a little patience and skill. Graphics are pretty good for a free game. If you like racing games,  you can't lose.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Quick down load and very easy to set. Worked the first time without a hitch. We needed to be up early and I just located this for my phone and used it immediately . Timer went off right on time.
B00FY2UJAU|4.0|Just a great, fun, well done movie!  I know...the jokes are endless with Fast & Furious 12, etc...  But I assure you, this latest enstallment was downright funny, entertaining and just a good all around action pack movie.  A little over the top on some scenes, but still very enjoyable.  I have been a fan since jump and this was one of the better ones.  The ending is phenomonal, FYI, there will be a 7.  And the way the have tied this all in with the others is masterful.
031623480X|5.0|This is lots of important information in this book about our body, health and nutrition as it relates to the brain and neurological function in general.
B0070DQYPU|2.0|Costner loses whatever accent he was trying to do in the beginning of the movie...............not well done in my opinion.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.<br /><br />There are a couple major changes in this second film of the Suzanne Collins novels.  First, thanks to the success of the original 2011 movie, the production budget doubled.  Second, Francis Lawrence (\\"I Am Legend\\") takes over from Gary Ross as director.  And while the money shows up on the screen in terms of special effects, costumes and sets, the film's brilliance remains centered with the actors, especially the remarkable Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />The film picks up where the first left off.  Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have returned victorious to District 12, believed to be in love.  At least by the population of Panem (a stand in for a future North America).  In reality, Katniss is conflicted.  While she has feelings for Peeta, she is also drawn to her lifelong friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).  In the novels, Katniss speaks in the first person so we get an inside look at her confusion and inexperience with romantic love.  In the film, it is up to Ms. Lawrence to convince audiences of her confusion.  She is pulled in both directions by actors Hutcherson and Hemsworth.  We get it.  And we believe it.<br /><br />Promised to be safe from further battlefield Games, we quickly learn it is not to be for Katniss, Peeta and their mentor, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson).  While on their victory tour throughout the districts, there is an unease in the population.  They see the survival of two instead of just one in the last Games as a sign of rebellion against the Capitol and their leader President Snow (Donald Sutherland).  Snow along with the new Games Director, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) design something special for the 75th Games known as the Quarter (as in century) Quell.  This time, the pool of previous district winners will be used for those chosen to fight to the death.<br /><br />Since Katniss is the only female winner from District 12, she's a lock to go again.  When Haymitch is chosen in the lottery, Peeta quickly volunteers, essentially to help the girl he loves.  The movie lingers artfully getting to the Games as Lawrence and his writers (Simon Beaufoy & Michael Arndt) take their time further developing the relationships, especially between Katniss and Peeta.  The middle section of the film is heartbreaking.<br /><br />For the Games themselves, the film creates a cadre of allies which includes another hunky fighter (Sam Claflin), the wise-ass Johanna (terrific Jena Malone) and others.  As most people know, this terrific film works as a place-setter for the concluding chapter which will be broken up into two films.  With that in mind, it ends somewhat abruptly and contains a plot thread that didn't make sense to me, either in the book or the movie.  Having said that, \\"Catching Fire\\" is a modest improvement over the excellent first film and a faithful adaptation of the book.  It looks better on screen and the relationships are deepened.  This is good stuff.ymitch is chosen in the lottery, Peeta quickly volunteers, essentially to help the girl he loves.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Until reading this book, I thought \\"A TIME TO KILL\\" was his best book.  He kept me guessing until the end.
B00ESW4TJ4|3.0|Pros:<br />- Easy to use, little to no setup required. Just push the shutter and it takes the photos.<br />- iPhone interface is responsive. App is very intuitive and easy to use.<br />- Very small and you can take everywhere. Fits in any pocket . Due to its size you can get it into some very tight spaces which result in very unique perspectives.<br />- Because it does have a tripod mount you can mount it under a quadcopter and take some amazing aerial shots.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Over priced for what it does.<br />- I had hope for larger resolution. At the moment if outputs images that are 3584 x 1792 pixels.<br />- Very grainy images in low light conditions<br />- Seem visible when one side requires an exposure that is very different from the other. For example sunrise or sun set.<br /><br />I'll be sticking to my panoramic head and DSLR for now. But once this technology matures it will surely replace conventional methods of capturing panoramic photos.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Amazing.  Listen to it three times.  That's all it takes.  If you want screaming, listen to kill caustic or today's lesson, or go to a hockey game.  If you dislike it because of the lack of screaming, I don't have enough pity left to waste on you.  You lose.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book...I loved the characters...I loved the words....I loved the relationships.  It was a sad story that did make me cry which does not happen often when I read.  I would recommend this book and I can't wait to see the movie.
B008W14ZD2|5.0|This album is amazing! I really love Ocean Eyes and the feel good vibe it has. This album still has that feel good vibe but with a more mature feeling. It's the perfect follow up album to Ocean Eyes.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I wish it would just give you the whole game. I just did the beginning and now its directing me to either play through FB or pay. 99.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is pure story telling that keeps you up all night long.<br />Every time I read one of Mr. Grishams  books I am amazed<br />at the skill with which he transforms me into the story.<br />I highly recommend this tale to anyone looking for a great<br />Adventure.
B00FSBW2L6|4.0|The third book of the trilogy. A good story, enjoyed this writer's style.Although not as interesting as the first two books the characters were well drawn and interesting and the plot kept you guessing.
B00FN3HRG4|2.0|I saw the “Back To Brooklyn” concert “Live” on 3 separate occasions:<br /><br />• Brooklyn – Oct. 11th, 2012<br />• San Jose – Nov. 5th, 2012<br />• Berlin, Germany – June 15th, 2013<br /><br />Each performance was truly incredible. Barbra was in amazing voice each time.<br /><br />I just bought the deluxe cd/dvd edition.<br /><br />In my opinion, the dvd does NO justice to the brilliance and spectacular quality of Barbra’s voice. All 3 “Live” performances were truly, “Happenings.’<br /><br />Please don’t misinterpret….this is Barbra at her best; from song choices, to timing, to phrasing…you name it.<br /><br />I only wish the DVD had come close.<br /><br />But, then again, maybe my expectations for a DVD need to be adjusted. I’m hoping this is the case, for how could a DVD ever truly re-capture Barbra’s “Live” magic.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I bought this at the last minute to use at a wedding.  It is versatile and didn't fail me.  Just get rid of the cheesy filters and the battery door could of stronger construction.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|definitely gets your attention and holds mystery cant wait to finish it<br />I look foreword to seeing how it ends and the game play is worth the download
B003SNKBXW|3.0|Parts of this novel are tremendously entertaining, but the overall effect is merely...ho-hum.  I wish this weren't so, because certain chapters literally sparkle.  I found Corso's pursuit of the various threads of the story - Milady, Rochefort, the Nine Doors - to be very compelling.  I enjoyed the character studies of the book collectors.  But the conclusion to the Nine Doors segment of the story was so unsatisfactory, it lowered my opinion of the whole novel.  I've concluded from this that an author can't have it both ways.  You can dabble in the supernatural in a story, but once a toe is dipped in, you're wet.  Any attempt to pretend you're not wet, to pull back to hard reality, and the entire enterprise will suffer.<br /><br />A note on the Kindle version of the book: don't get it.  Buy the book instead.  The publishers, in an attempt at saving money, did an OCR scan of the book and left it at that.  Huge mistake.  As someone who has a little familiarity with the technology, I tell you flat out, you have to edit OCR output for errors.  This is something the publisher didn't do.  Even the best OCR software will cough out all kinds of errors: missing punctuation, frequent misspellings, misplaced words, and even missing sentences.  What a shame, when a Kindle author like myself, working alone, can do a better job at proofreading than a major publisher.
B00EJXX17S|4.0|Different, immaginative, worth a listen for sure, but in need of some polishing and development. If you listen Lindsey, learn, work on what you have, because it is good, but do not get spiteful. Here is to hoping the next album will be as great as is possible!
B001NHNG64|1.0|No real-life experienced ex-cop would ever do anything that Lee Child has his protagonist Reacher do in this book.  Besides giving us a protagonist who is just plain stupid, author Child doesn't have a clue about weapons, self-defense or police work.
B00CRGZMUI|5.0|Hilarious book!!  Great story line. Love everything about this story,. Highly recommended.  Great way to finish off the series!  Good job !
B009LDD54K|5.0|Fantastic series, very well done. To me this is one of Steve Buscemis best roles. Wish the seasons were a little longer.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is it, this is the ultimate JRPG, and perhaps the best game I've played since Metal Gear Rising! I can't believe I never played a Persona game prior to this, the gameplay is just so entertaining, and the music is just so fitting for the title. The only other game with such nice music is Metal Gear, but I digress.<br /><br />For those familiar with the series you'll notice P4G is significantly more bright, colorful, and &#34;happy&#34; than P3/FES. I played very little of P3, so I instantly noticed how the characters in this game were different overall. i found the character diversity to be quite good in this game, they definitely had me laughing at times, I was more interested here than when I played FFVII. Although I found Disgaea 3 for Vita to be similarly funny and equally ridiculous too.<br /><br />Now onto gameplay mechanics. P4G seems to possess the same &#34;turn-based&#34; system of P4 for PS2, however I noticed you can select attacks for each party member(max of 4). I do like that you can control AI partners, I dislike games where you have these mindless things doing the fighting for you. I found each character to play differently, except some are definitely less useful compared to others for certain bosses. Just like Pokemon, Persona cards & enemies have elemental weaknesses. I find that this adds a layer of difficulty, especially since YOU also have to prepare the right personas for certain bosses.<br /><br />Bosses in this game are interesting, and there are secret bosses you can fight after meeting certain requirements. Keep in mind every boss doesn't fight the same, some can do special tricks that can screw your strategy up. You certainly cannot always repeat attacks or else you'll die often.<br /><br />Outside of actual battles(while in dungeon) you can open treasure chests for items. Please note after opening X amount of chests you may encounter a powerful Reaper thing. If you're under leveled you may lose to it, thankfully he makes a chain sound when he's near.<br /><br />While outside of dungeons you are able to do so many things(can't finish everything in one playthru) like build social links, work for money and to build skills, and shop for weapons/armors. The social link is a major, major part of this game. There is NOT enough time in 1 playthru to max ALL links, do not attempt this, you'll fail. Max only the ones you mainly want first, then do a new game+. At times the social building is kinda meh and drawn out like a bad movie, but the dialogue can keep you interested somewhat.<br /><br />Before I end I'll give my opinion of the story. I like stories with a lot of turns, drama, mysteries, etc so I naturally was pulled to this game near the start. I don't want to spoil much so I'll give a general overview. So you're a boy who moves to a small town with family, you eventually learn about the TV world and make friends along the way. People are attacked in odd ways that no one knows about, but the persona power allows you to investigate to a certain extent. I felt the story was emotional at one particular point, though you'll have to play it to know what I mean.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|It is working good. I am using it for splitting video to two TV's. Both outlets work great, does not seem to have any quality degradation.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so addictive. I play it several times a day. I can play on my phone and my kindle.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Those game is fun but kind of hard . But I keep on playing no matter what I think I am addicted
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|A great addition to anyone's collection of the history of this group.  The Eagles have been part of our lives for years, and learning about the dynamics of such a long-standing group only makes their music that much more appealing.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Godzilla on steroids!  This movie took Godzilla, which is notoriously cheesy, and decided to inject it with steroids.  \\"I know, let's put some kick-butt robots in it that drag an ocean liner, and use it as a baseball bat to spank monsters with!\\"<br /><br />On a serious note, if you like sci-fi, and are not super critical of completely non-realistic plots, then there is plenty of action and adventure in this movie for you.  A bonus would be the soundtrack for this movie.  Ramin Djawadi is phenomenal, and the music is great.  Parents, no cussing, no love scenes; actually not even a kiss between the main characters at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Reality: Much better in the movie theaters - action and sound.  You should have watched this in the movie theater.  If you have a really good sound system and big screen, still very enjoyable.  For a funny time, watch [...] which is everything wrong with Pacific Rim.  This will give those who are movie critiques and upset with all the unbelievable stuff a chance to vent, and some good laughs.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is nice app and would recommend this app to my friends and family.<br />  It is a nice app when I travel as thereis times I need one.
B00ET0PZDO|3.0|Easy to use, levels aren't all that challenging but it is entertaining. I would buy this app again. No major problems with skipping or freezing so far.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Oh my goodness, is this thing ever awesome!  Even though I'm on Linux, which can cause compatibility issues with just about everything, this works perfectly!  Only took us about 15 minutes to set it all up.  Love being able to stream Netflix with zero trouble.  Love saving money on my cable bill even more!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Hours of relaxing gameplay. Can't wait for the next region to open and weapons upgrades. Great game and great graphics.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved this book. I always enjoy books that John Grisham writes and this is no exception. Once I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down and getting anything else done. I loved the twists and unexpected turns in the book. A great story from a great author.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|absolutely engulfed by this story!! i loved how everything touched and got tightened tighter as things went on. I was hooked from the beginning.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The combination of star wars and angry birds makes one of the best games ever. I love the little characters and their abilities with the lightsabers and the blasters. May the force be with you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So excited to get this game on my Kindle Fire!! Fun and enjoy playing each new level as the game continues. Wish it was availible sooner.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|It's just ok. Graphics are poor and the app is very laggy on my 2012 Nexus 7 running Kit Kat.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The game is so awesome it's like I am reading a book about anti- gravity!!! I can't resist but to play all day!!!!
B00475AYJQ|2.0|What is the hand gesture for &#34;disappointed dismay&#34;?<br /><br />Nothing is accomplished in this book and I found myself caring less and less about Kvothe.  The side stories and plot tangents are overly long, boring, and empty. How many pages must we sit in a rainy forest tracking bandits? How many pages must we dwell with the Fairy being? How many pages must we endure repetitious martial arts training?<br /><br />There were many times during this read where I was very close to abandoning the book.<br /><br />I find myself caring less and less about Denna too. I cringe whenever she appears on the page. At this point I'm rooting for Cinder, Ambrose, and the Chandarian.

B004V6MWFU|5.0|Excellent singing and performance. Unique songs. Love the simple use of the ukulele to create such wonderful music, both haunting and stirring.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is a terrific book and the way all these characters and story lines are woven together is nothing less then genius. I just hope George R. R. Martin lives long enough to finish the entire story
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great, clear movie quality. I could only watch it once because the movie wasn't that exciting. Overall I would recommend this viewing
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very well written. Nice dynamic between different characters.  Good action descriptions.  Not as suspenseful as I tonight it would be. Good book to pick up and get through.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun and addictive it's very easy the first times but once you get to eight by eight it gets harder
B009LGO88E|5.0|I love this product! I recommend this item to anyone who plays monster hunter, because the game would be so much easier with this item.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|I dont know why so many people liked this movie. My husband and I couldn't even get half way thru it. We thought it was kind of dumb. My best friend loved this movie so I guess its to each their own. I just personally didn't like it.
B002RVCD46|5.0|Wonderful for the price - barely any buffering or wait time - if any at all, and extremely user friendly.

B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I got two of these hubs and they do not work with Logitech wireless mice (I specify Logitech because I haven't tried with any other brand).  I also ran into problems with a USB 3 NIC, however it might be an issue with the NIC.  I had no issues with USB 3 thumb/hard drives or even an external Blu-ray drive.<br /><br />I have used many USB hubs in the past with the same mice and USB NIC that I have and never had an issue.<br /><br />Great build quality.<br /><br />Update:  Upped the star rating.  Support contacted me via this review to let me know that some wireless devices like Mice and Keyboards might not work with this (which is noted on the product page, I just missed it). It's kind of an absurd problem, but it's not Anker's fault.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved this story, I think it's the way he describes the people in his books.  The story is great and it should make a great movie.
B0098VXMNE|2.0|Lousy acting and writing.  Nothing noteworthy about it.  I figured it would stand out a little bit given season 1 was so good, but it just fell flat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is wicked and extremely fun , the tour around the world is so fun and very fun for kids .this game is a all around hit.
B00FHB7398|5.0|This one is worth your money. It is well scripted, and is long enough to  be interesting.  I couldn't put my Kindle down. Congrats to the author, Big Fish deserves my 5 star rating for this one. I would like to see more like this one!!

B007SGM084|5.0|These books are sure to heat up the room. I love the characters and the journey they take as they grow together. I would say these books are must reads.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What is there left to say about a Stephen King book?  Dr. Sleep is a thrill a minute nail-biter of a novel. The good guys make you root for them every minute, and the bad guys make you want to double-bolt all your doors and board up all your windows.  I read this 500+ page book in 10 hours straight.  Now I'm afraid to go to sleep!  Oh, well, I should have known better.  It was worth it. :)
0802473156|5.0|I wish I had read this sooner, though I'm grateful I didn't or I never would've met my fiance... Previous relationships wouldn't have failed had we adopted these strategies.  This book is easy to read and it is written from a humble place.  Dr. Chapman gets right to the point and you don't have to stretch or search high and low to find applicable meaning.  It's very straight-forward and from everything I've experienced in life, he is spot-on.  He encourages trying these strategies in various case studies throughout the book where I would recommend that the person leaves the relationship.  However, with that said, I love that Dr. Chapman offers hope even in situations where only one partner cares about salvaging the relationship.<br /><br />My fiance and I have been in love for years, but shortly after beginning wedding planning and marriage preparation, we started to hit a rocky road.  In the past I've wondered if I just really love falling in love but maybe I don't like being in love.  This book explains that the euphoric &#34;in love&#34; period inevitably falls off at some point, generally within the first 2 years.  After that, to love each other comes from a choice and dedication action.  It sounded like a lot of work with no guaranteed payoff, but as I continued reading, I began to see the many ways that I can improve the ways I love and serve my fiance.  He and I agree that I'm a humble, sacrificial giver.  It seems like that's &#34;every man's dream wife.&#34;  Instead, acts of service are not the love language my partner speaks.  It ends up being a lot easier on both of us... We share more of the household responsibilities and I get to be more responsible for things like touching and praising him.  It meets his needs and it seems so much easier than keeping the house in tip-top shape and doing it joyfully all of the time!<br /><br />Bottom line: Great book.  Humble author.  Practical, sustainable tips.  An awesome read for relationships worth saving.  Betternot to read for relationships that you truly want out of, because I think it has the power to turn around even the worst of relationships.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This story is a theoretical paradox of sorts...a speculation that specific actions alter a multitude of events with far-reaching effects.  Although I enjoyed this book, it was an extremely slow start as all the characters within the 'six degrees of separation' had to be introduced and their connections developed. Liane Moriarty did a great job of developing all the characters and she was consistent within each storyline. I found it thought provoking and yes, engaging once you found your footing in the story. What Alice Forgot is still my favorite book by this author though!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Ok the sound glitch is with the obsidian and earth Dragon. In the end of their roar it sounds like someone's voice got put in with the roar so it's like roar and it sounds like a guy saying try it or Dragon or something like that. It bothers me for some reason and I keep it on full volume because of the rest of the sound and I go to feed them and when you feed them they make sounds and I hear the voice so please fix that. Other than that BEST GAME EVER CREATED!!!!!!!!! I have always loved dragons. The first word I ever said was Dragon,(I'm not lying) and always had a passion for them. This game is perfect for me. The graphics are cool,the Dragons sound great,(minous the voice) and it's fun,easy and addictive. I would highly recommend this game for every one of all ages.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Well written! Each chapter unfolds the history of personal computing while relating the biography of Steve Jobs. Everyone enjoyed his book.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|They almost lost me in the beginning of the 3rd season, but boy did they win me back!  I can't wait to see how it all goes down with the Gub'nah!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|For the first time in a while I actually was scared. Great plot, decent special effects, Ethan's performance was amazing.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Amazon won't let me give a 5 star rating without stating why, in 20 words or more. I'd love to meet the geek that decided that no product can escape the minimum verbiage requirement. I think George Freaking Harrison still speaks perfectly well for himself, far better than I ever could, and he's been dead for quite a while now!
B00846WWVM|5.0|I'm not huge fan of Android gaming in general, but Sprinkle is so well-made - so polished - that it deserves 5 stars.  The gameplay is unique, and the graphics are great.  Well worth a purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it!!!! Was very close to the movie, couldn't put it down!!! Looking forward to reading the next book now.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|I was traveling home from Australia and I saw this selection on Qantas' music availability.  I don't have any idea how<br />I &#34;zoned&#34; out in 2007 and didn't see this release!  As i laid in business class, I listened to this in it's entirety.  it was<br />awesome. I have every Eagles album ever released and was pleasantly surprised to hear such a great mix. My<br />favorite is Waiting in the Weeds. I know I am a little late to the game on this but thanks to Qantas for having such<br />a great cd to take up alot of the flying time. Very relaxing also.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I found this program online then later discovered the app for my kindle. It's great for review and strengthening word skills. It may not be as helpful for the absolute beginner but it would be a good tool to use alongside other programs. Also, it's fun.

B0083P1QUM|2.0|I'm starting to drift further away from Cornwell books, and this one was an example of why.  I've grown tired of these characters, tired of reading such gory things, and I think maybe Cornwell is getting tired of it all as well.  Too many other good books out there to read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books are so amazing! If you haven't read they are a must read. I was skeptical at first too, but am so glad I read them!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Gorgeous sounds come from this beautiful CD.  I put it on with a lot of anticipation and wasn't disappointed.  These young men really sing from their hearts.  Such absolutely magnificent voices.  A new part of Christmas tradition around here, this lovely CD.
1620402777|5.0|As an avid Simpsons fan, I have always been impressed by the many mathematical and scientific cameos in many of the Simpsons episodes. Now, having breathlessly read this wonderful book, I know why: many of the writers are mathematicians and scientists who have taken every opportunity to enrich episodes with appropriate tidbits to tickle the minds of the mathematically inclined.<br /><br />In this book, the author, a scientist and science populariser, has explored the various branches of mathematics that have made cameo appearances in Simpsons episodes. These include to varying degrees: calculus, number theory, probability and statistics, algebra, geometry, topology and more. Select Simpsons episodes are described, setting the scene for the mathematical inputs.  These are carefully and clearly explained along with much elaboration and further examples, thus making the book accessible to a wide readership. Roughly the last third of the book is devoted to Futurama, a Simpsons sister series. Here, the various characters are identified, story plots are also described and mathematical snippets are similarly elaborated upon. As a bonus, the author has included material describing how the Simpsons script writers, especially those with strong mathematical/scientific backgrounds, have come upon this interesting career choice.<br /><br />The author has a very friendly, lively and engaging writing style. This book should appeal to a broad population, especially if they are Simpsons fans. Mathematics enthusiasts who are also Simpsons fans should be in for a treat.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love the game. I spen a lot of time playing and really enoy BB quite a bit. Thanks for the fun!

B00ESZZOCM|3.0|Scream Factory brings 1980's sci-fi schlock-fest &#34;Saturn 3&#34; to Blu-ray for the first time. From its first shot of the underside of a space cruiser flying into the frame towards a planet, you feel the influences of &#34;Alien,&#34; &#34;Star Wars,&#34; and every other genre film of its type put out in the 1970s. The only difference is in the lower budget the studio had to spend on models, props, and other special effects.<br /><br />Scientist Adam (Kirk Douglas) and his colleague/lover Alex are stationed on an experimental hydroponics research station on one of the moons of Saturn. Their peaceful existence is interrupted by the arrival of Captain Benson (Harvey Keitel). He's been sent to assemble a robot named Hector who will likely replace Adam in the hopes of making the station run more efficiently. It slowly becomes obvious the robot has a mind of its own. It will stop at nothing to take over the station and liberate itself from the control of any humans.<br /><br />The high-definition audio and video transfers for &#34;Saturn 3&#34; help and hinder it in different ways. The picture is clean but doesn't lose its 1980's &#34;real film&#34; feel. However, the clarity doesn't necessarily help when it brings the budgetary limitations further into the light in regards to the outer space sequences and other visual effects. The audio is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. There are all sorts of bizarre sounds and gadgets to take in, not to mention Elmer Bernstein's eclectic musical score.<br /><br />&#34;Saturn 3&#34; is rated R for violence, language, adult situations, drug use, and brief nudity. The brief nudity is basically a flash of Farah Fawcett's breasts and the butt of Kirk Douglas. Both are unnecessary and add nothing to the story. Harvey Keitel and Hector both lust over the scantily-clad Fawcett. Keitel tells her that on Earth, everyone is promiscuous in the future. They've come to all just enjoy each other sexually with no inhibitions.<br /><br />Scream Factory puts together an impressive batch of special features for &#34;Saturn 3.&#34; Audio commentary is provided by Greg Moss of the &#34;Saturn 3&#34; Fan Page and film critic David Bradley. There are interviews and featurettes which include Special Effects Artist Colin Chilvers and actor Roy Dotrice, who overdubbed the voice for Harvey Keitel's character. Deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer round out the bonus material.<br /><br />&#34;Saturn 3&#34; is a must-have for sci-fi fans that collect any and every movie made within the genre. To common everyday movie audiences, it'll come across as just another misstep for any of the actors and filmmakers involved. Cult classic enthusiasts will understand it for what it is. It's an overlooked and slightly damaged gemstone worthy of its place in their home entertainment library next to &#34;Meteor,&#34; &#34;Outland,&#34; &#34;Lifeforce&#34; and other forgotten treasures of the era.eam Factory puts together an impressive batch of special features for &#34;Saturn 3.&#34; Audio commentary is provided by Greg Moss of the &#34;Saturn 3&#34; Fan Page and film critic David Bradley.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|It's no secret this is a fun and addictive game.  It's no secret this is a fun and addictive game. I put it on my Samsung smart phone and it worked correctly.
0765365278|1.0|This book is way too long, totally predictable and derivative of nearly every other fantasy series ever written.<br /><br />The characters are stereotypes, mythically heroic and unbelievable.  The battles scenes are monotonous.  The character's angst over their own behavior and the circumstances around them is unrelenting and overworked.  Descriptive detail is uninteresting and adds nothing to the atmosphere of the book (which is unnecessarily dark and depressing).<br /><br />Though I really wanted to just stop, I suffered all the way to the book's finish which was abrupt and unsatisfying.  I will not bother with anymore of Sanderson's books. It is clear to me that the end of Robert Jordan's series was mostly Jordans work/notes because Sanderson couldn't have finished them by himself in any way that would have satisfied fans. I truly don't see what the other reviewers see in this book, perhaps they are generous because of Sanderson's work in finishing the Wheel of Time series or maybe they have never read truly original fantasy.  It really makes me leary of trusting any more Amazon ratings in selecting future books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My girls love this. Lots of fun. And better yet, free! Easy for my 4 year old to figure out.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Of all the apps I have downloaded, I have enjoyed this one the most. Challenging, but not too hard.It also has a story line. I am going to look for more games from this developer.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I enjoy historical novels and this kept my interest and I learned about this period. looking forward to the next book in the series.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The most interesting thing about this book was psychological drama and how the main character's upbringing affected his actions. There was a lot of talk about it and some of it was brought to light but not all. It may in future books but if you only read one you are left hanging. Is that the point?
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|Great series for a good price. I bought it because I lost one of the dvds from the set I borrowed from the library and it would have cost me $54 to replace,
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Makes you delete all of your apps after a half hour download. If I your you I wouldn't get it. DON'T GET THE GAME!!!!!! Deletes all your games
B00E8B1358|5.0|For the quality of the sound effects editing and mix (I'm a film sound instructor), as well as the non stop action. The scene in the mountains with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow is insane!!! As a big fan of the original cartoons this was a nice way to remember those days, better than the first one in my opinion.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|The SB 400 is the perfect strobe for the Nikon series of digital SLRs. I have used it to produce all sorts of technical photography from detailing the inside of a cellular phone equipment building to the cockpit of a Lear 60 business jet. The tilting flash head makes indirect &#34;bounce flash a breeze and its rapid recharge time and compact size make it extremely easy to use. Great for pics of the kids too!

0385738765|4.0|After having this book sit on my shelf for a while, I finally got around to reading it.<br /><br />Plot: This plot pretty much follows the first book but instead they are on the outside. There are many plot twist or shall I say games being played among all the characters. They are tested to the brink, where even I began to think that there is no way that they can make it. This sequel brings much excitement to the reader with plenty of action.<br /><br />Love/Friendship: I’m a little sadden about this situation. Though I would say more, I’m hoping it can be all cleared up.<br /><br />Games: This games that are being played are not only deadly but they break people. I don’t think I could ever last in that situation. Just be prepared to read one hell of a roller-coaster ride!!<br /><br />The Scorch Trials is a unique story that fully em bodes action and plot. It is different with much events and entertainment to hold you to the end. The Scorch Trials is great.

B004UJAOLM|4.0|Very interesting story told from the point of view of one of the characters. I really enjoyed the writing and the only reason I did not give it five stars is that I would have preferred a slightly different ending. I would definitely recommend this book to other readers. It is a classic with a very different story line and some unusual characters.

0375842209|1.0|The author of \\"The Book Thief\\" apparently couldn't decide whether to write this book for adults, young adults, or children, so he made the error of trying to combine all three intellectual levels into one poorly written offering.<br /><br />Actually, I bought this book without realizing it is being marketed for the YA crowd. I did some checking along about page 14, at which time I could no longer contain my annoyance regarding the cutesy bullet-pointed asides, the bold print, the drawings, and the idiotic narration.<br /><br />I cannot for the life of me understand all the glowing reviews, although there have been instances of a segment of the population glomming onto an essentially lousy book or movie for inexplicable reasons. I suspect this is one of those cases. Neither can I imagine any self-respecting young adult liking the disjointed picturebook format any better than I did. Although this book is definitely enriching the author's bank account, it will NEVER be mistaken for great literature.<br /><br />If one wants to weep over the horrors of the Third Reich, there are hundreds of far better books with which to do it. I donated my unfinished copy to the library, glad I bought it used, cheap.<br /><br />Update: I saw the movie today, mainly because the trailers and cast looked promising. Much more enjoyable than the book, albeit in an airbrushed, Disneyish sort of way--sugarcoated reality that lacks the stark, visceral emotion that should have been present. Still, I've seen worse. Death narrated, of course, but less obnoxiously since the silly literary gimmicks were missing.
B0026SFEW8|5.0|This timeless movie/musical never gets old. Ive seen this movie hundreds of times since I was a kid and never get tired of Danny Zucko and Sandra Dee and the crew and the wonderful music, that just plays within your head even after the movie ends. Absolute joy to watch. Every time.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It does work, outside the distribution countries as well. Integration with YouTube is excellent, however casting from the Chrome browser itself seems very dependant on your device specs.<br /><br />For example, from YouTube you have a dedicated casting icon in the video controls. This disables the video on your device, and streams it full screen to your tv. Works well.<br /><br />In the Chrome browser you also have a casting icon, however this effectively casts a mirror of your browsing window (you can still full screen the video). In my case, running an early Acer Chromebook, trying to cast an avi movie from Chrome to my tv is unwatchable.<br /><br />That said, the Chromecast is open for development. Hope to see some solutions soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A must read for young and old. This is a wonderful and unexpected ending to a riveting series. Everyone needs to read this
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|\\"The Conjuring\\" is based on a true story, specifically a case investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga), parapsychologists who made a career of examining and finding reasons for otherwise unexplainable occurrences. They have also participated in exorcisms.<br /><br />Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston) have just moved into a new house with their five daughters. Initially thrilled with their large home, they gradually discover that all is not right with it. Creepy noises abound, a series of bruises appear on Carolyn with no apparent cause, one of the daughters has conversations with a new, unseen \\"friend,\\" and birds dive, kamikaze-like, into the windows and walls. Concerned for the safety of their family, the Perrons seek out the Warrens, pleading with them to visit the house and see for themselves what is happening.<br /><br />The Warrens sense an evil presence and agree to help Carolyn and Roger clean house. With their assistant, Drew (Shannon Kook), and loads of cameras, microphones, tape recorders, and movement-sensors, they stake out the numerous rooms of the house. It doesn't take long for ever more dramatic incidents to transpire.<br /><br />If the plot so far sounds suspiciously like \\"Poltergeist,\\" you're right. The film is essentially a haunted house tale given an interesting spin by its basis in fact.<br /><br />The tendency of a viewer -- even a fan of horror -- is to be skeptical until a movie establishes suspension of disbelief. This never quite happens in \\"The Conjuring,\\" but director James Wan definitely knows how to build suspense and take his time developing tension. The Perrons are a normal family -- no wife beaters, ax murderers, or telekinetic kids among them -- so we identify fairly quickly as Wan unfolds the beginning of what turns out to be an unforeseeable living nightmare. The fact that there are so many children in the household amps the stakes. Is the house possessed or are dark forces targeting this family in particular?<br /><br />Often, a haunted house film is greeted with the apt criticism, \\"Why don't they just leave?\\"  This question is addressed in one exchange of dialogue. Roger tells the Warrens that the family doesn't have the financial resources to go to a hotel and, when asked if they could stay with friends, asks, \\"Who's going to take in a family of seven indefinitely?\\"<br /><br />The two female leads provide standout performances. Ms. Taylor's Carolyn is a caring mother with a great relationship with her kids and husband. As incidents and danger within the home escalate, she seems to be especially singled out by whatever is tormenting the house and family.  She morphs from protector to victim and vividly projects the abject terror she feels.<br /><br />Ms. Farmiga, so excellent as the crazed mother on TV's \\"Bates Motel,\\" turns in the kind of nuanced performance seldom seen in horror movies. Her Lorraine is intelligent, devout, and dedicated to helping others.  Her clairvoyant ability makes her a valuable colleague for Ed, but the work has taken its toll in the past and the current case promises to be one of the most dangerous of their careers.<br /><br />As horror films go, \\"The Conjuring\\" depends more on psychological terror and growing tension than monsters, gore, and gross-out images. It commands your full attention and envelops you in its carefully woven web of eeriness, the other worldly, and human vulnerability as it builds to a climax, at which point director Wan pulls out the stops to shock us with startling images and the characters' reactions. Despite a climactic scene that contradicts rules established earlier, the movie is a powerful exploration of the supernatural.<br /><br />Rated R for some violent scenes, \\"The Conjuring\\"  is the latest in the creepy old house sub-genre of horror films. Only many of the cliches are absent -- no ominous stranger warning the family away, nothing trapping the family within the house, no monsters, no last-minute natural explanation of seemingly supernatural events. Instead, we have a thoughtful picture with solid characters who act intelligently despite encroaching terror.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|really good family movie.  adventure, fun for parents, grandparents and the kids.  we watch it when there are no kids visiting!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great game fun and addictive but sometimes the game freezes and you cant move on and you also would need to spend a lot money to get the gems...
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is a great buy because of the price and quality.  This is one knife that take on whatever challenge you throw at it.  I for one was not disappointed with the knife and I would suggest others to do research/watch videos in regard to this knife.
B004VFN72S|4.0|Great script, excellent directing, compelling camera-work, not a good choice of actors. And not because Weaver and Hunter can't act, but because they are such familiar faces and voices that it was, for me, difficult to get lost in the story. I am not smart enough about film to understand how Hitchcock could use iconic actors and get us to forget we were watching Jimmy Stewart or Anthony Perkins, but he did. And it still works. But this film seems to be about Sigourney Weaver showing us that she can play a serial-killer expert and professor with her own special brand of PTSD. I'd like to have seen a more unfamiliar face in that role. Still, I could not stop watching. Hence the title of this review.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much.  It was easy to obsess right along with Bridget about the high, low and in between points in her life after Mark.  Definitely a good read for anyone.
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|Good movie.  Fun to watch.  Would recommend this to any Halo fan or anyone that enjoys a good bit of sci-fi.
0316067598|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest books ever written.  My daughter read the book and then convinced my wife to read it.  My wife bought this one as a gift for me, but it took me months to get to read it because she reread it several times and then my son borrowed it to read and then finally I was able to read it.  It is a book that is hard to put down and I will never part with my copy.  I recommend this book to everyone I know and have had many people tell me that you can not read this book just once.
B00304VVII|5.0|Good movie.  Fun to watch.  Would recommend this to any Halo fan or anyone that enjoys a good bit of sci-fi.
B00005AFVR|5.0|Heard the song &#34;If I Should Fall Behind&#34; on CSI New York and purchased the song and then decided to purchase this album which I am still enjoying very much.
1439153663|5.0|Quite simply one of the best books I have ever read.  If there was a rating higher than 5 stars, I would gladly give it.  Ms. Grissom's prose is simple yet compelling.  She grabs hold of you on the first page and does not loosen her grip until the very end.<br /><br />I fell instantly in love with Lavinia and her new family.  I laughed with them, worried about them, and feared for their safety.  It's a rare thing for a story to get inside my head to that extent.<br /><br />I'll be on pins and needles until Ms. Grissom writes another book.
B00FLDG52I|5.0|The Vince Gill,Keith Urban and Albert Lee rendition of the Stones Tumbling Dice is quite hot; impressive guitar runs by all three.<br />Andy Fairweather Lowes version of Gin House is  exceptional with Eric playing blistering licks; great pergormances by Gary Clark Jr...and a host of others...the show stoppers are a blistering white heat version of Sunshine Of Your Love with Eric playing with fire...letting the power released and High Time We Went with all the guitarists taking turns as Eric cannot quit grinning.<br />A show for the ages... the Klipsch were cranking this one out...play it LOUD.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good read. I would most definitely recommend it to anyone. ust when you think yo have it figured out King throws in the old curve ball.
030759565X|5.0|I absolutely love this cookbook. The recipes are wonderful - have tried several and they are virtually fool-proof. I really enjoy the author's introduction to each recipe and the photography jumps off the page. This was a great addition to my cookbook collection
0062213423|1.0|I do not like one direction... Got this for my retarded 20yr old cousin because she is so special. They sing good just not a fan
B00B5NXC1K|4.0|Cd is good, Ghost Lights is by far the best song.. book is fairly pointless so I would save your money.
B006ZZANDI|1.0|I do not like one direction... Got this for my retarded 20yr old cousin because she's so special. They sing good just not a fan
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|It's a wonderful adaptation of the PC game, the controls take a little bit to get used to, but they make total sense on a phone.  I think this game makes more sense for action and fun on a phone than Minecraft does.  Hopefully they will update this with some sensitivity settings on the mining thing since it's a little touchy sometimes and difficult to be precise.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|This movie is very bad. Characters are trivial. The screenplay is full of cliche and predictable and too much violent for no reasons. The special effects are good off course.<br />There will be always something I will never understand in those hollywood movies: you spend so much money, you have such good artists and workforce and yet, everything is wasted in such poor dialogs and screenplays.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I had never seen this so the movie was definitely a pleasant surprise!  Denzel Washington is a wonderful actor but really shows his skill in his craft in this movie!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an amazing book. I loved it as much as the others.!! Keep up the good work.! I would want you all to read this
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Oh everyone loves Facebook.!!!!  I'm so glad it's on my Kindle.  I've located friends from my youth and old co-workers,  I keep in touch with my long distance family.  I find new recipes and offer up my favorites.  But then everyone already knows all about Facebook.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I just finished the book and I am crying so hard! It was great- the series and everything. Thanks Veronica! SPOILER TRIS dies and that's WAS so hard for me lol···
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|The Author's stye was an easy read.  However her research and logic leave something to be desired.<br />There were also many editing errors.  I often wonder who edits?  The author or the publisher??  Seems someone forgot this one.<br /><br />I found gaps in the storyline that made you guess what was happening.  I thought many occurrences completely implausible.  The ending leaves you hanging but i think it's because there will be more books to follow.  However, she could have at least wrapped up this part of the story.  And since Maggie seems to be such a &#34;nice&#34; girl I find it astounding she would take in a complete stranger who admits to being a con man (who helped con HER ) and not only co-habit with him but &#34;keep&#34; him.  Just left me puzzled.???
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Really does not have a tone of functionality yet. It is a glorified NETFLIX adapter which works great for that, but really nothing else. I was disappointed at how I really couldn't stream anything from Chrome via Chromecast
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|My grand kids love these.  Minecraft is one of the latest crazes  Can't go wrong with these as a gift.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am doing this backwards and watching the movies first, then reading the books.  I am so glad I decided to do it this way.  This way I wouldn't be disappointed in the changes they made in the movie.  Great book.  Now that I have seen Catching Fire I can start on that book too.  Thanks Amazon for the free book lender.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My grand kids love these.  Minecraft is one of the latest crazes  Can't go wrong with these as a gift.
B001EN71HC|3.0|I loved the movies but I give it 3 stars for the damaged corners, making the box set look used.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite classics.  I bought the DVD to replace an old VHS tape.  We watch it at least once a year.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Perfect fit for my Kindle.  Nice and light, very soft and protective.  The Kindle fits like a glove and is well secured.  I like the brown handle to grab and carry the case.  The zipper is nice and sturdy and the entire case feels well constructed.  I would highly recommend for someone that just wants a great, no-frills case.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I wish I had a easier. Version. For older people I just started playing with no instructions . I dont understand. What I need to do. at times
B003MAS9S0|5.0|We love X-Men movies!! We had not seen this one in a while so rented it in Blu Ray from Amazon... loved it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I liked it a lot..........very nice and CLEAR graphics.  I only played part of the free version, so I'm hoping it isn't an extremely short game like I've experienced after I've paid for other mystery games.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hilarious and funny so play it with your kids even my two year old like the game blah blah blah
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so much fun.  I do multiplayer and create my own<br />Adventure maps by using seeds. And I don't know about you guys<br />bit I'm in 0.7.3
B002TMQL8W|1.0|I received wrong version... Can't play on my PSP 3K!!!  I cannot play the version sent as I get Region Code Error...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its challenging, its fun, its addictive, it leaves you wanting more. Wish we had more lives tho. I just love this game!!!!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I chose this book because I loved the movie and heard the book was even better. Pat seems more damaged in the book; his voice is younger and more naive. His mom is even more lovable. I couldn't put it down.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game is great but it would be a million times better if I didn't get cut off after the first level to pay a stupid fee to get the full version!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|With this update you can earn cool stuff by collecting apples! The more the better! Like I said it's the best!
0316044695|5.0|I cannot put the book down. Very detailed descriptions of what SEAL's go through in training and on their missions.<br />These guys are the real heroes.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|the quality is terrible for kindle fire. There are way too many ads and it's just bad. I played for five seconds, and then deleted it because of all of the ads I had to close.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Just as I expected- the pace of the book is perfect, the characters well-defined & couldn't put it down -  a favorite author-but I read it far too quickly :(
B00006RAKP|5.0|This Cd is full of Elton John's best music  This is a must for Elton John fans.  It spans from the 70's to 2000
B00BAXFECK|5.0|So exacting, so tonal, such plot twists!  Read it to find out how the narrator is part of The Goldfinch, or maybe how he IS The Goldfinch!  I had to wait til the end to learn how he remembered each excruciating detail of orphans' tales. Fabulous characters, places and suspense.  I tired 2/3 way thru of substance driven escapades. So did the narrator.
B00005O3VD|5.0|I enjoy musicals.  I like Barbara Streisand and Omar Sharief--excuse the spelling.  She has a wonderful voice.  I  like listening to the music again and again.
006202406X|2.0|Hard to get behind the plot line. Wouldn't mind if the movie adaptation was nothing like the book! I know Tris is supposed to be finding her way - but Roth should've rethought this ending. The whole book - nothing really went on.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This series is wonderful.  I enjoy the characters.  I like the story.  The people, the places are beautiful.  Their clothes are wonderful.  I look forward to the next season.  I found out it is on TV.  I would like to arrange to watch it.  The stories around all 16 main characters are interesting.
B000G1T072|5.0|Well, I can't claim to have heard it- but it was for my grandsons, and they loved it.  (they are very young)
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I enjoyed Flow Free on Windows, but this version has a number of weird spammy links to websites and 'free' products. Not cool and uninstalled it. Rather go the in app purchase route if you are trying to find revenue opportunities.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I played this game and it was great. I told my cousin and now she is addicted to it.  she has it on her phone ipad and also I was addicted . I reccomend it for 5 and up. I hope you install it.
B0035LMTZA|2.0|Interesting plot and good actors.  But, poorly written dialogue, some bad acting and ending was just as you would expect.  Glad I was able to play games on my phone while watching it.
