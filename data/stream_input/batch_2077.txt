B007NESBK2|5.0|From Sade who is flawless, beautiful and sexy, to her excellent band as well as top notch production and sound. Can't say enough about how enjoyable this performance is. Highest recommendation!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the Dowager that Maggie Smith so elegantly portrays.  Her wit adds so much to this series.  The characters of Bates and Anna are another favorite of mine.  I love their love story.  This season is so full of many twists and turns, I'm sure one and all will enjoy!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm a huge fan of fantasy and lately it's gotten harder to find a great book, especially an epic one.<br />This one was a wonderful find, loved it from the get go.<br />The plot was full of twists that came together beautifully, the character development and the politic intrigue was nothing short of brilliant.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B005LAII8K|5.0|This is a great movie with superb actors! I love the action and the storyline. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes Bruce Willis, JGL, time-travel movies, and suspenseful action dramas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it wont update so so so mad my brothers updated on his nexus tablet such hummed but although still great game.
B0085YNML2|4.0|My 4 year old graddaughter likes this game quite a bit. It is challenging enough for her, and when she gets too stuck, she can skip levels (which she likes). She will even go back to some of the harder levels after some time to try them again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is almost like temple run, but a lot more interesting. One of the best free apps out here in my opinion
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very easy to read and very factual. Enjoyed the account of the mission from the people who actually executed the killing of Bin Laden.
B00ARIPTPQ|5.0|This classic became available for free on my Kindle.  I had read the book twice years ago and was excited to be able to add it to my Kindle library.  There's something amazing about this love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth that I could read again and again.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie was visually captivating but the plot and dialogue should have been less predictable.  I was a fan of the original TV production - the movie's story and characterizations don't capture the spirit of the original TV version.  But it's okay,
1439153663|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. Read it for a book club. Lively discussion. Interesting account of the life of an indentured servant in the south.
0684824906|5.0|Exceptional look at the character-personalities,etc. of each of these---LARGER THAN LIFE MEN. Wonderful history! I highly recommend this book to all history buffs.
B000OSC3GM|5.0|This film is one I can watch once a year.  It is somewhat a narrowly constrained film, but it just watching so many great actors work is enjoyable.  The plot is not really believable but still a well structured story, more of a fantasy scenario than anything based on truth.  But it gets its point across in a story where there are distinct sides and each side is  somewhat hamstrung in playing for all the marbles, but one has to win.  There is no middle ground, the lines are distinct but only visible to the players and the viewer.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Easy to play, large cards, easy to see and it is also challenging. Biggest complaint is that they do not have a paid version that will get rid of all the ads and commercial that plays after dealing of each game. That drives me nuts!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome that I'm literally addicted. I tell my family to download it and they really think it's cool
B006SAR6P8|5.0|Love it! Kill Bill is Tarantino's finest films in my opinion. Great cast, superb score by RZA, and top notch script.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I check this every morning to plan and start my day.  works great,  accurate,  and good for other locations too.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Great singing, great acting, great instrumental music, great costumes, great storyline.  Sad and romantic.<br /><br />For people who like romances and musicals.
B0015F1VY8|4.0|A different story than the first film, but it still has complexity and delightful talent.  I think it might be good to take a refresher view of the first film before watching this one.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Fascinating account of this man's life who died way too soon! Very interesting to read about his early ears and what led up to his success with Apple
0756665949|4.0|I had been wanting this for a long time. I am very glad I went ahead and ordered it. From what I've read so far, there isn't anything I didn't already know hidden in the pages, but it doesn't claim to give answers to any remaining mysteries. But it is nice to have as a keepsake. It's something every die hard fan will enjoy.
B005FZ12CK|5.0|The first review is correct about the ebook problems but he still should have given five stars as Orwell's prose shines through.<br />It is moving and tragic.  What a shame Orwell didn't appreciate Trotsky's insight.<br />Get a better version so you can really appreciate it.
B00AYQNOU8|1.0|It's like a slide show of pictures without narration or titles. Photography is good but can't make out half of where its taken.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I was a great coming of age story and I can't wait to see the movie and read other things from Stephen Chbosky!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Charlize Theron can both act even in a fantasy farce and be so stunningly  beautiful, what a combo!!!  The presentation of the dwarves totally defeat the appearance of the unconvincing dwarves in Lord of the Rings.  Charlize and the Dwarves alone are worth watching, actually they are the only things worth watching in this film and make it okay rather than bad.
0062238868|5.0|Wayfarer<br />When you in your 20's you are the smartest<br />Person in the world...<br />I understand ... I've been there...<br />Then u grow up a bit and realize just maybe<br />You got w couple of things to learn about<br />He served his country as a sniper<br />For you.....<br />Smh
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|Love the rules to living in zombie land. Super fun film and bound to be a classic.  I'm craving a Twinkie about now.
B003T0G9XU|4.0|Not a bad read! I LOVE Terry Pratchett .  I really like to read the Discworld novels. This however is not his best one. The heroine is an interesting character and I like the Feegles.I thought the story a bit complicated and motives a little hard  ( for me at least) to fully understand but enjoyed it nonetheless. I think I prefer the less complicated Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg.<br />Worth the read though definitely , so recommended to all Discworld fans.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|safe Haven is a really good story, I am excited to see the movie when it comes out! I would recommend this book to everyone.
B008RYN44U|5.0|Best Album EVER! I love No Doubt. Gwen Stefani on her own is good, but No Doubt is amazing. This album is their best yet.
B000VMIILU|5.0|wonderul colors, clarity, and soundtrack. Im very glad I bought the DVD. Opening the package at first was a humerous surprise though.  The front cover is in spanish, the specifications on the back are in glingon but the soundtrack is english and wonderfully remastered.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferriss is a stud. I have all his books and I per-ordered this book. It is beautiful! I usually buy things on Kindle...but, this book is so beautiful you need to have the hardcover to fully appreciate it. I bought it on kindle as well to reference when I'm away from home. Probably one of the best bang for your buck books I've ever purchased. It is huge and I haven't even read it all the way through yet. What I have read I've enjoyed and already feel like I've received my moneys worth! No buyers remorse here.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks writes such beautiful stories. Loved this one. I am not great a writing reviews. However, I will just state I read this book in two sittings. It's been a long time since a book captivated my attention so singularly.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 5 yr old daughter have been playing this game all day and we love it! The only numerous that she can't read yet and needs a lot of help with the game.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|This was what my child asked Santa for so he was extremely excited to see it under the tree Christmas morning. It was described and shown as SMALL so just remember it is no taller than a pop can. We are Lego fanatics but this was one of their lamest sets. So simple and small and seriously probably cost them $.50 to make. SMALL SMALL pieces. Hard to actually &#34;play&#34; with it with the character etc.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I didn't see this movie, but I can see how this would be a visual great! Really loved this book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing amazing fabulous I love it it's so good  keep making good updates for us<br />I love the Rio one the best
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Plot was a little rushed and weak, I wish they would have gone more into their lives later on- it seemed just like an afterthought.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|I'm not generally one to watch movies about a horse, but this one was really good. I would recommend this move to others, horse lovers or not.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A fun game with lots of options. A great way to pass the time. And a deal for the price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Slammed and Point of Retreat, so it was with some trepidation that I purchased this book. I shouldn't have worried this was a fantastic book covering an extremely sensitive topic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps me up all night! I'm on my kindle playing trying to beat my high score-this game is addictive!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is exactly like temple run but better! It is great with kids and for adults as well. The only problem with it is that it is really addicting. I'm no try so good at it but it is still really fun. It has really good sensors and is extremely easy on my kindle fire he.
B005H29GSI|5.0|This was the hit of the christmas gifts. According to their mother, even after opening their christmas morning gifts, they went back to play with this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A wonderful, intelligently written show. The smart writing and beautiful scenery set in a 1920's England mansion draws you in on every level. I especially enjoy seeing the staff and the family as individuals all different in their thoughts, political views and desires and how they get involved in each others lives while maintaining the strict code of being of service to this amazing family. The first two seasons are available on prime and can be enjoyed at no cost to prime members but if you get sucked in like I did, you'll be happy to pay for season three before its available on prime!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|this game has great graphics and I enjoyed the voice overs..adds to play experience.  Almost seems for the $2.99 price it was not as long of playtime as some other games provide...but still enjoyed it.  one complaint for G5 is they seem to offer the games for FREE but then require you to pay to unlock.  I prefer a full offer option upfront as I am looking for games to play.
B009GESJH2|4.0|Kid Rock, album &#34;Rebel Soul&#34; shows that he will be around for a long time. He is so musically diverse, that he can go with the flow!!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It does it's jobs and makes my cutlery sharper, but the edge is not as sharp as many of my less expensive sharpeners.<br />Also, the two different slots aren't well tailored to all types of blades.<br />Good value, but there are better options.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVED this book!!!!!!!there is soooooooooooooooooooooo much romance between peeta and Katniss!it's a book that you read and you can't set down!
B004U52VPS|5.0|Big hit with my 5 year old nephew. It was played with for hours on christmas eve & christmas day.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I would only recomend it to people who like puzzles. Its hard with many levels but it has great quality graphics.
B000B5OD4I|3.0|I was in the market for an inexpensive watch that had a 200m water resistant rating and was solid built.  This watch fits those requirments, however, it has some shortcomings. The good part is it is a very nice looking watch.  It also seems to be keeping accurate time so far.  Some reviewers have complained about the band being flimsy, I think it is solid and goes very well with the watch.  One of the bad aspects of the watch is that it has very little reserve time.  If you don't wear it all day, and you take it off when you go to sleep, as I do, chances are you may have to reset the time in the morning.  Another annoying thing is the bezel rotates way too easily.  Anyone who is serious about scuba diving and is considereing this watch should reconsider.  The band does not expand to allow for room if wearing a diving suit.  Most serious diving watches have this feature.  The most annoying thing about the watch is you can't wind it, so you either have to wear it every day, or reset the time when you want to wear it.  Other reviewers complained that the watch does not have a hacking feature (freeze the second hand to set the time).  If you set the watch a minute ahead of the correct time and allow the second to reach the 12 o'clock position, you can apply some back preasure on the crown and hold the second hand in place. Just release the pressure when the correct time occurs.  I like the watch for what is is, a masculine looking watch that looks more expensive than it is, and one I'm not afraid if it gets beat up because the price is right.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|The first rtime I saw Kid Rock with Hank Wlliams Jr on CMT's &#34;Crossroads&#34; show, I knew the Kid would crossover  to country music somday.... &#34;Born Free&#34;  is an excellent piece of musical art, as well as is &#34;Rebel SoulL. I am asking that the tilte song &#34;Born Free&#34; be played at my funeral..It is a must have album!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you play this game you will be amazed and feel like you are the charters and i hope you love it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This Game is quite fun but the Pace of everything could go a little faster. And it would be better if there  was more options on the horses.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because I like all the running and jumping over trains. It is very fun to play. Olivia 7 years old
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this is a greasy game. I mean, if angry birds wasn't so griffin epic, star wars. awestruck.  super. great. love it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is one of the best apps ive ever gotten!!!!!!!!!!! my friends all love it too!!!!! Wish they had a sequel!!!
B00AESN8XY|2.0|Didnt run right on my Driod and a lot of functions didnt work.  There are free versions of this game online that are way superior.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I love this movie when i seen it in the theaters so of course I had to buy it when it came out!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not get my head out of these books. Loved everything about the books and I can't to have the time to go back and reread them again. I hope she writes a 4th book and I hope there is a movie to follow soon!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Never thought I would like &#34;Walking Dead&#34;. Watched the first season and was so wraped up in it I couldn't quit watching. The characters all fit the part and are great actors. You get attatched to them. It's full of emotion and suspence. Can hardly wait for season 3 to come out.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have to say that it was harder to get into than season one BUT this is a great show with a great cast and I can not wait for season 3!!
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|This movie contains all the elements needed for a great story: humor, pathos, great acting, good plotline, and eternal dilemmas which need to be resolved.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun date night with hubby for 2.99!  Money well spent.  Great storyline, super graphics.  Couldn't stop playing until completed.  Looking forward to sequel!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Love this cd and I would recommend this CD to all of the Avenged Sevenfold fans and all rockers in the world!!
B003NFM3JK|3.0|I enjoyed most of this movie. On DVD I can skip the parts I don't enjoy. The animation is spectacular - and what can I say about Jim Carey who voices most of the parts. The problem, as I see it, are a few overly extended sequences that don't really help the story along. It's a good rendition, it just isn't the best. As I see it.
B004WR125O|5.0|I purchased the Onkyo TX-NR616 and added this item tot the order . This is a great product. The receiver works great as well.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Kindle download, this is the way to read books. This is another win for Baldacci, a great read, would recommend this book
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Glad to know that replacement cables can be ordered and sent so quickly.  Could not use my Kindle Fire without a new one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Not an easy read, but worth it. Great character development and the issues were poignant. Dealt with survival and life while facing death.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|Love the cd and of course the dvd!!! I couldn't wait to watch the concert dvd on a saturday night!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have been watching this series on Public TV and love the storyline.<br />I wanted to be able to view whenever I wanted and bought the download.<br />I don't do the recording stuff so this works great.<br />Thanks for offering this collection.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVE Minecraft! Anyone who wants an app that's worth paying seven bucks should get Minecraft. I rate it 4 stars because it takes almost a week for Minecraft on my Kindle Fire...
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Just introduced to this author, now hooked and reading the serise, just download #4, highly recommended reading. WE all need an hero
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This was a book club selection and we all enjoyed it very much.  Must be ready to concentrate on many plots.
B007WMI1X2|5.0|This is a very witty, stylish, cheeky and educational series of documentaries all rolled into one.  I bought it for my kids (ages 8 and 13) and they thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  In fact, even the adults were seriously entertained!
0525952926|5.0|After I finished reading &#34; Fall of the Giants&#34; I was looking forward to reading this book, I was not disappointed.<br />This book is about World War II and the rise of the Third Reich, and how it effects the lives of  American, German, Russian, and the Welsh.<br />I am not going to tell you anything about this book other then I recommend it. I always loved history.<br />I am looking forward to the third book of the trilogy.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved this series, I can't wait until next season! Last years is good too, but loved this one the most!  Rent it you won't be disappointed!
B000002WUD|5.0|For me as for most of people, Elvis is out of this world. This collection is incredible. I just need one more box (the one with red cover) to complete it. The king is IN the building!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book is a great read. Definitely worth it. I appreciate reading something of real quality finally after all the crap I see on the shelves.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I could not put it down. Stieg Larsson wrote an amazing story that keeps you interested in the unusual heroes.
B00004XQ83|5.0|my husband loves the sound track to this movie and loves the movies so I just wanted to make this purchase for him
B003UESJJC|5.0|A truly astonishing blu-ray epic that shows the horrors of war in a way never seen before. Coppola has done it again.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Fantastic game. I used to play this and Arkham Horror at night, by myself, before my son was born. To be able to play Elder Sign on my Kindle so conveniently is fantastic: and the game is stylish, beautiful, butter-smooth, and nicely challenging. (So far, I've lost twice, won twice.) While I wish the game kept track of wins (not just scores), I otherwise find it first rate. Here's hoping Fantasy Flight keeps releasing expansions (I've already bought the two expansions offered) as well as app versions of their other games.<br /><br />Here are some additional comments: each game seems to take about an hour to play. The save-game feature, for me, has worked fine. The included video tutorials are succinct & helpful, and the included text guidebook is exceptionally detailed. Victory can be thwarted by chance, by bad luck, but the strategy the player can apply is nonetheless deep. Finally, the first time I downloaded the game, it crashed repeatedly, and the enabled videos consistently crashed the Kindle home; however, I uninstalled it, re-downloaded it, and it's worked perfectly ever since. Now, if only I could figure out how to defeat one of the game's \\"Hard\\" levels w/o going insane ...
B00B2V66VS|2.0|this game is ok if it would stop skipping!!! and it started me over so I lost my whole high score!it wont stop teaching me how to play!!! don't bother!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game, I find it fun. It is definitely for patient players, a some of the items seem to take forever to get. the energy doesn't generate as fast as I would like, but that break gives me the opportunity to play other games or to do whatever.<br /><br />If you are patient you will not spend any real cash. Other players can be your friends without bugging on Facebook. Overall, I recommend to players who are patient.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Be careful! This might be the most addictive app ever. No ads. Just people sharing what they have found. My favorite is the Home Decor page.
B00003CXRM|5.0|anything that makes my husband happy I am will to try at least one time and he really enjoys this dvd
B00005QB42|5.0|Love Deva and all her music. This CD has a great sound quality. Very clear and simple. Wonderful to relax to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|when I first downloaded, it took forever and you couldn't repine, but now I think all the kinks are out and its almost as good as pinning from my laptop. I am obsessed!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazon takes for ever to get the latest update the game still says 0.4.0 there up to 5.1. Rating the game would be a 5 it's addicting placing blocks next thing you know it your making mansion or something.
0765325950|4.0|was very pleased with this purchased although I had to pay almost half the amound I paid for the book to have it shipped to me here at the middle east. Aramex was playing mind games and didnt have accurate updates as to where the item is and was telling me to pick it up at their facility which is almost an hour away from my place (what did I pay all that shipping money for?) but turns out it's already in the mail room at our building (they have a desk at our building)
0470450266|5.0|Love it all the way from cover to cover, even the cd is easy to follow. Great reference for any artist taking anatomy courses.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|love these videos and my husband loves them all the time and so its apart of making my husband happy
B006LSZECO|1.0|I wish I would have known that Gillian Flynn is known for leaving open ended books.  If you like a lot of closure at the end of a book, this one is not for you.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I personally think that the game is a great arcade game to spend your time on.but is isn't very fun in a loud area. When played in a generally.loud area, you easily loose control and cannot concentrate.other than that, amazing game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's highly addictive. I enjoyed playing my friends and beating there scores I will agree and say it is highly recommended, five stars :)
0525953728|4.0|don't nit-pik . . . just read it for what it is . . . a book about taking out the bad guys<br /><br />WE NEED THESE PEOPLE!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This group is AWESOME!!!! Saw them on TV and had to buy their album!!!! Heart and soul to each song...I love it!
6304711905|5.0|love these videos and my husband loves them all the time and so its apart of making my husband happy
B0073LWEXK|1.0|This game is very confusing.  I wish there was an instruction book that tells you how to play this game.  The help functions tell you nothing.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Arrived on time. I can connect my iPad 2 to my tv. Great product. I'm also able to charge my iPad while its connected to the TV.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I for some reason found the books to be much funnier, and had seen the photo of the author on the back cover. I always pictured sookie as her it made it funnier for me back then. I plan on watching the whole series.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I thought it would be fun to watch good-looking men dance, but the movie plot was boring.  If you like Channing Tatum, don't waste your time or money.
1401324649|5.0|This is a very readable funny story. Lots of chuckles all the way through. I will probably read it again.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Solid, unspectacular, i hope author donates much of this profit to vets. Not feeling this book lived up to the hype.
B009RH973I|4.0|This is a very sturdy and light cover for my Kindal Fire HD.  The only thing that I would have liked is for it to stand on it's own in the vertical possition.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The content of this book was excellent. The characters are relatable. The tempo of the story gets the reader involved and they stay involved all the way through. It's not a handbook for implementing any of the ideas presented (I would recommend starting with [[ASIN:0975568612 The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps]] for that), but it does a great job of laying out a general plan of action. I think it provides a realistic view of what types of reactions to expect when trying to implement any of these ideas, and what types of results to expect. The authors do an excellent job of highlighting the sources used (such as [[ASIN:0566086654 Goal]]) which allows the reader to begin investigating these ideas outside of this novel. I have already recommended this to several IT leaders within our organization, as well as some working with other companies. In addition to leadership, I have recommended this to people that you would think have nothing to do with the development or operations processes - I don't think matters too much. This is for anyone who loves IT and is interested in improving the processes they are responsible for.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was my first diary of  a wimpy kid book and it is really funny i recommend this book to everyone !!!!!!
B0032FPVKE|3.0|I needed a camera bag for a new camcorder.  I bought a big just like this from BestBuy and it was 3x the cost of this one.  It is just as advertised, just a camera bag.  You really cant beat the cost.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Funny Seth Macfarlane stuff. Okay. Lulled at times. I like'd some Flash Gordon stuff in it. Are you bored? Hangin' with friends? 30 something? You'll have a few laughs. Not 40 Year Old Virgin Laughs though.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so cool its basically about a group of gangsters who are running away from the police for doing graffiti on a train. so good I really like this game there is also a New York version and I recommend that game too. I like the fact that you can get loads of people too my favourite is Lucy. She has wicked hair that's red and blue and she has a nose pierce and a really pretty dress. The only thing that I would change is the ads its really annoying.
B0086700CM|1.0|Very difficult to know how to get started and what to do with this game.  I wish there was an instruction book somewhere.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this app but I think to get double coins you shouldn't have to pay. The other disappointment was that the game wasn't responding quite a few times. AFTER a while it can get a tiny bit boring and dull but apart from that this app is great.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it. The author did an amazing job. Will probably be re-reading for a long time. Defiantly recommending to everyone.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I did not finish the movie. I tried but I couldn't.<br /><br />It spends so much time to picture a bad boy, a boy that curses all the time, smokes all the time, irresponsible both at work and at relationship. It seems a drastic transition awaits but by the time it happens, ( not to mention whether it is believable), bad influence has implanted to any viewers, bad boys are convinced to think what they have done is cool, is admirable, etc.<br /><br />Bad bad bad movies! I want my half an hour back.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a super fun game. me and my sister love it. play it all the time. try it some time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a great author! This is the best series since twilight. I hope they make all three books into movies!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Love this game.  Unfortunately I have spent way to many mindless hours playing it but I do love it. Go for it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|if you don't like this app.this app is awesome my stupid bro trys to get on my of (kindle fire) just to play this game(and temple run 2) but you get my point.the app rocks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best !!!!! At first I thought it was going to be boring but don't let that fool you play it NOW !!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it from the start....was also happy to see this would be a long read as I really hate getting into a good book just to realize it's almost over... the one gripe I have is that towards the middle of the book it seemed to me the author must have taken a bathroom break and let someone else write for awhile; some of the violence got a little crazy and seemed too out of character for an already hyped up Travis. But other than that thought it was a great book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best!!  Can't wait to play everyday.  Can't keep my daughter off of my Kindle<br />So realistic and like being at the ranch.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|I loved it. It was very well written and I love it the way she moves from one era to the next. I have  read the Forgotten Garden which I thoroughly enjoyed also  I will definately be reading more of her books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game has very nice graphics and plays well. I would recommend it to anyone that likes to play classic Solitaire.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|classic and fun it was a gift for  my father-in-law and he love it. QUICK DELIVER AND AS DESCRIBED .
B00992CF6W|1.0|This sucks for 4 reasons, 1: you can't play with your friends if they have a Apple product. 2: you can barely do anything in creative. 3: barely any updates. 4: CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH REDSTONE! why would you waste your time on this! SPORE IS BETTER! WE NEED A SPORE APP NOW, SO THAT MINECRAFT'S BAD TASTE IS GONE!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its addicting and so much fun its like u never want to stop that's how much fun it is.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|Enjoyed the storytelling approach taken, but it seemed as if historical facts were stretched to fit into the selected &#34;club model&#34; theme.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fantastic game.You can do all sorts of missions.Also you can unlock these speedy characters.There are all sorts of hover boards,you will have a extra life with them!If you want  boost then why waste time go to the store and buy a boost.Or if you want a prize then you can buy a mystery box from the  store,but wait there's more you can get a super mystery box by just doing the  daily challenges.If perhaps you wanted more many then you can also get it by doing the daily challenge or go a whole  set of missions.By  if you want a creative  character then there is a upgrade now for the subway surfers world tour.So you should get it today.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy playing this occasionally but really bought it for my grandchildren to play on my Kindal.  I find it hard to control the objects at times.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|King fans will love it of course. There are great characters, the story is exciting and engaging, and it is thought provoking so it sticks with you after you're done. First time King readers, this is the perfect book to try.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Cute and an unique story about growing up, I am a wall flower so having a whole book and movie made about how great being a wall flower is amazing!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I love this show because it is different, twisted, horrorfying (but not scary), and because I can't imagine how the writers come up with the plots for each continuing episode. I look forward to season 3.
B008220BP2|5.0|This Romeo & Juliette approach to the zombedy breathes new life and a well-placed sense of hope into the genre.  While Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Zombieland (2009) succeeded in lighter-hearted, smiley approaches, neither conveyed the sense of romance-driven hope above desperation in their apocalyptic settings.  So see Warm Bodies!  You'll leave feeling hopeful.<br /><br />As \\"R\\", Nicholas Hoult's narration adds an inflexive zombie-perspective and comedic charm regarding the idiosyncratic behavior of animated corpses and, given the unique opportunity, their romantic proclivities.  The narration feels natural and unscripted as if you were watching a home video of yourself and Mystery Science Theater-ing it.  This nearly impromptu style reveals that he goes by \\"R\\" because he can't remember his name--only that it started with a zombie-grunting \\"rrrrrrhu?\\"<br /><br />After introducing us to his daily lumbering grind, he rescues Julie (Teresa Palmer) from his \\"friends\\" and keeps her safe.  As he struggles to remember how to enunciate we learn that he has also clearly forgotten how to talk to a girl...since he has no memories of his life at all!  The mix of his awkwardly nigh-mute zombiism, his self-deprecating narrations (which are humanly articulate) and his high schoolish nervousness present an excellent platform to develop these characters and their relationship.<br /><br />Unlike Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, the gore was quite minimal.  There were no slow throat-tearing bites, flesh-rending or disembowelments by super strong zombie hands, which makes this ZomCom more watchable by those who don't care for shocking displays of gore of suffering.  This was a tasteful choice and, even as a gorehound, in this case I very much approve.<br /><br />I was really pleased with the music.  Songs like Bruce Springsteen's \\"Hungry Heart\\" and Jimmy Cliff's \\"Sitting in Limbo\\" mesh tongue in cheek irony with generally spectacular scoring decisions.  Not to mention playing \\"Pretty Woman\\" when R is receiving a \\"human\\" makeover, a great scene in which the stellar supporting character Nora (Analeigh Tipton) turns Hoult from zombie to hottie.<br /><br />The Shakespearian elements were not limited to the main characters' names:  R[omeo, perhaps] and Julie[tte].  Their relationship seems little less than \\"star-crossed\\" from the start, she learns not to fear or hate R as he becomes \\"more human,\\" her ex-cause-he's-dead boyfriend Perry is essentially Paris, Julie's father (John Malkovich) plays the lord of House Capulet role and he hates zombies as if they were Montagues, Nora plays Shakespeare's helpful \\"nurse\\" of House Capulet, and Marcus (Rob Corddry) does a heartfelt and transformative job filling the shoes of Mercutio.  There's even a balcony scene, which was the only unsubtle reference--but didn't feel forced.<br /><br />I generally enjoyed every aspect of this movie.  I have few small complaints and I'd rather not draw any attention to them.  This film is too good to chance scaring you off over minor quibbles.<br /><br />So go see this.  You'll leave feeling satisfied and hopeful.y Woman\\" when R is receiving a \\"human\\" makeover, a great scene in which the stellar supporting character Nora (Analeigh Tipton) turns Hoult from zombie to hottie.<br /><br />The Shakespearian elements were not limited to the main characters' names:  R[omeo, perhaps] and Julie[tte].

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Like I said this app is amazing my kids love and its a great thing to help them learn how to take care of animals
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing graphics fun obstacles new ways to play, although there were as many buyable characters as in Temple Run, still very fun!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Loved getting both a DVD and a Blue Ray dics.  Movie is great but already knew that which is why I bought it.  Don't do digital yet but who knows, maybe some day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game more better than temple run its so much fun if you did not like this game you must be crazyy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my word I love this game so much especially the missions you have to complete the bad side to it is the pop up adds but you get over that!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this calculator because I use it on my Kindle and you can see the numbers and it keeps record on the screen of what you have just added, subtracted or any calculation you are working with. Slide the calculation bar over and you will discover the &#34;square root and many other calculations&#34;!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and easy. If you love horses, you will love this game. I can't figure out how to Chang  my profile pic, though!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Having finished ten episodes so far, I find the portrayal of Holmes and Watson to be very well done and the writing to be great.  Fans of Monk will enjoy this series.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I must admit I am very glad this book was chosen as our book club pick for the last month. I have seen this book in stores for years now but I admit I had difficulty picking it up because I just had no idea what the story was about! Even after reading it is very hard to describe.<br /><br />Mostly this story centers around the famous author Vida Winters who while well known for her books there is very little known about her true past. She reaches out to Margaret Lea our main character, a bookish recluse, to finally tell her the very strange true story of her life.<br /><br />From the first chapter I was hooked and the first 2/3s of this book seemed to fly by for me. It is very well written and it is very obvious that Setterfield is very much a book lover. The story is full of rich detail and written in a very timeless fashion that you won't be able to tell just when it was set in. What I loved most was the atmosphere of a subtle ghost story that I was not expecting but absolutely loved. I'm only giving this four stars for the ending of the book feels very rushed for me and certain parts could have been fleshed out better. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone and I am looking forward to reading again soon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it its hard and stuff but its fun to do when you really bored and I like to challenge my mom to see who gets a higher score
B000MRAAJM|4.0|The pictures are great.  It is good to watch when you want to just relax.  I wonder if there is some computer effects.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Ease of use, have used for years. Never had any problems or viruses! Would recommend it for anyone on their computer, Kindle, Nook or cell phone.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It was a pretty awesome movie to watch just felt like that they rushed it but other than that is was worth it. =D
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so beautiful. All of the characters are great and Chbosky did a great job at development. There were definitely a blog of lines that I ended up highlighting. I will read this book again, for sure. This book is literally so underrated. All in all, it was great.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I used to play it all the time and I loved it, but then right after it loads it just goes back to the main screen and I cant play it anymore.  :(
B0095R76EW|4.0|It was great except amazon needs to stream better consistently it will freeze at the beginning several times and at the end. have rented other movies and same problem 12 mb internet speed
B003TNM2K6|3.0|This movie was pretty good. It was suspenseful, full of gore. It was actually a little too bloody. The ending ruined it for me though.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the best site for anything you want to get ideas for. And the best part is saving them on your individual boards. I've found wonderful ideas for recipes and for decorating. There's something for everyone on Pinterest. Would recommend it for anyone from adult to young teens!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|temple run is fun because is funing for us and for erynoby like bos gilrs and men's woman's  is fun
B00APJLFEG|2.0|I don't know how DOVE could have given this one a four out of five when it talks about the undead and things of that nature. NOTHING like Monster's Inc (which is what DOVE compares it to)! Overall, not a movie worth watching (not even for the one funny joke in the entire movie...)
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this game is highly addictive. i love all of the versions of this game. i wish that there were more elements to combine and more episodes to plat<br />play.
0425263916|5.0|I loved this book so much!!! I was into the book the WHOLE time 8^) I'm patiently waiting for the 3rd book which can't come fast enough!
B003008RWA|5.0|A Must to see! The movie did have to buffer occasionally, but it was eventually alright. Great movie and very informative..
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Is intensely entertaining, and disturbingly delightful!  I find it to be a unique spin on an old story of a good person gone bad.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app and I think other people will like it to. If your kid cannot have a real horse than this is the app for you. It is really good app
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book was recommended by my 20 year old grandson. The book was well written for a first book by a writer. It was deep and made me think and question some things. I really enjoyed this book and will probably reread it at sometime.
B005HSL626|3.0|This game is good practice for hand to eye coordination.  I'm sure kids would blast through all the levels faster than me.  But it's a distraction sometimes.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I liked it but after I got in the mine the game just totally shut down. overall it was good .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game.  It looks more interesting and the mine is a neat touch.  It really is better than the first one. Can't put it down.
0316228532|3.0|The character development is great and keeps you reading, but there are a LOT of characters and it's a long book.  While the main conflict was resolved in the book, it seems that many of the subplots were left unfinished.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A lot of fun and a great way to spend some time. I like that it makes you have to be patient to get the activities done, and how great the graphics are :)
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It was fun to start but did not keep my interest.  I would come back and play in the future
B009CCBCU4|4.0|This book is the first in the rise of the Aztecs series. In this book two young boys become friends even though are from two different tribes. As they get older we follow them on the path to war and coming of age. The book is very well written. Some of the names and words can be a little difficult to pronounce.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The story line was well written and easy to read.  I do admit I started reading because of the sex but I quickly became used to it and skipped quickly through that just to get to the story line.
0316223239|5.0|This was a very interesting and heartwarming story.  I gave it to my daughter to read and she loved it also.
0812974611|5.0|Harris loves the late Roman period, and knows a lot about it as well. &#34;Pompeii&#34; is a delightful work of fiction that creates a host of characters who might have really existed throughout the time of Vesuvius' explosion that created the heartbreaking images of ancient lives frozen in time. You'll love/hate the characters he brings to life and the concept is an excellent one. Great fun.
1451627297|5.0|I don't have anything new to say about this book, but I'm here to vote along with the other 5-star reviewers. As someone else said, I felt like I had lost a friend when this book ended. As for my Book Club group, the other gals were a little hesitant when I chose it for \\"my month\\" (3/2013) because of its heft, but I think they'll be very happy that they've read it - or maybe I should say *experienced* it. If I remember, I'll update my review after we meet.<br /><br />UPDATE: Of the nine others in my book club, six attended my meeting for 11/22/63 and five read the book. Everyone loved it! For the meeting I created a playlist of 1958-63 tunes (plus Honky Tonk Women for obvious reasons), I had my trusty [[ASIN:B003PNP770 Flickback 1963 Trivia Playing Cards]], and we had a great discussion of both the book and what times were like in 1963. (The older gals in my group were in \\"junior high\\" in 1963.) We also ate a few foods that were mentioned in the book, including, ahem, poundcake.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Another great novel from Kate Morton. A real page turner and very entertaining. I always enjoy the work of this author and this book does not disappoint.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It's not about the sex, it's a love story with a nasty villain.  Who can't get into that?  Loved it.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Don't get me wrong but I would have enjoyed this much more if the feed was better. I was told by several people that this was a good movie so I rented it for the weekend. The streaming was poor so the sound quality was disturbing after a while. I had thought it may have been the computers fault so I went to the main computer in the house and tried it there with the same result. I watched it anyway so what could have been a pleasant distraction became something much less. The last 10 minutes the sound and picture were perfect so i know it was something that could have been done to prevent the aggravation I went through. It could have been 4 stars but Lost a lot due to streaming.
B003R0MF1W|4.0|I started using Amazon instant video alot even though I have netflix for $8 per month.I loved it!! But now they raised the prices on complete seasons by at least $14 + per season I wont use instant video as soon as I finish whats in my library.Back to netflix for me and its cheaper for me to buy dvd of seasons than to use instant video.Why change something if not broken,sure amazon will lose business on instant video tv seasons.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Great actors. Good story. The wide ranging impact of a man with polio. Frozen in body, free in his mind. Great job by even the secondary actors. Really enjoyed this adult, no, not \\"dirty\\", drama.
B004T340QY|5.0|One of George Clooney's better performances and with an outstanding supporting cast.  Mr. Clooney has you believing in his character's zany attempt to get out of prision and make it back to his family before his wife marries a &#34;bon-e-fied&#34; (as one of his six daughters says her moma calls him) suitor.  The 'homerific' challeges of his journey are extremely entertaining, the hillarious dialog along with the music make this a must see.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Originally bought for the sex but grew weary of it after this book.  (Maybe I'm getting old?)  The storyline was interesting and very easy to read.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|If you love horror comedies like Cabin in the Woods and Evil Dead Trilogy you'll love this.  BUY IT NOW!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app I highly recommend it especially if you need a long range forecast or will be traveling up to a couple of weeks.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|The voices of Gary Burr, Kenny Loggins, and Georgia Middleman blend so amazingly and adapt from country-rock to bluesy to AC on their debut CD. My favorite songs are the sassy \\"You're Not the Boss of Me\\", the hopeful \\"Little Victories\\", \\"Feelin' Brave\\" with it's Celtic vibe, \\"Another Spring\\", \\"Dream\\"...okay, there is not a bad song on the disc! When I got it, I listened to it front to back about seven times in a row. It is solidly written, sung, and played by the three veterans. I like how they trade off vocal duties, no one is the 'lead' on everything. This disc will be \\"Home\\" on lots of \\"Best of\\" lists this year!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Ordered this for my daughters and they loved it.  Will provide many hours of entertainment.  It is definitely worth the money.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is such a great video, just wish I was motivated to do it more often! Jillian's antics with the other girls get a little old, so I usually mute it and play my own music. Great workout though, this works if you use it!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is one of the few films I'd call perfect.  It gets everything right. Buy it.  Right now.  You will not regret it.
0316224588|5.0|He's back.  Same Rebus, same suspense, same fun.  If you craved the return of our old, severely flawed hero,<br />no disappointment here.  It's a shame it takes so long to write good books and reading them zips by so quickly.  Rankin<br />can't be beat - oh, please write some more.  Right away... Rebus is no doubt keeping busy and we need to know what he's<br />up to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is so awesome I like the graphics I like the dog who follows the cop all the different characters you that need to see it for yourself
0525953728|4.0|wasn't what all the media hype made it out to be but it was a great book. Will recommend to others
B004SIP6BI|5.0|This is a fantastic movie: beautiful scenery, people making chocolates, and romance with Johnny Depp - what more could you want?!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. You should really get this game. There are plenty of other games like this , but this is better than all of them.
B00AGKH45I|5.0|Different Strokes for Different folks, Probably one of my favorite albums of all time, Rumours is an English word look it up, Stevie Nicks is a girl and thank god MTV didn't exist in 1977 and if Lindsey Buckingham cannot play guitar then I don't breathe in oxygen, If 40 million people brought something in this world then honestly it cannot be all that bad, Some very angry people in this world, do yourself a favour, yes favour does have a u in it just like Rumour, buy it listen to it and if you don't like it give it to someone else it;s that simple, love to you all and be safe
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I have several email accounts and Hotmail is one of them. This app does everything that my Hotmail account on my desktop does.
8866130923|5.0|For me this is the perfect planner. The lined page opposite the days of the week was what I didn't even realize I wanted.  Plenty of room to write To-Dos, notes to self including quotes I want to keep... even room for my shopping list!  I ordered on New Years Day  and since all calenders were half off I was able to upgrade to the hardcover.  It arrived by the 3rd which I found amazing.  Half price and I hadn't really needed it for the 1st and 2nd!
B002RVCD0U|3.0|The plot of this movie is weak. It is OK if you want mindless action though, just don't expect a satisfying story.
B0047GNCSU|5.0|Amazing book amazing Lauren Conrad, I love her books so much, she is a great writer I ant the another books
0312427999|5.0|The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein is a book you won't be able to put it down but might have to anyway. I was second in line at my house to read this book, and I had to wait quite a while for my wife to finish it. Normally she's a fast reader, but she found the book so disturbing that she couldn't get to sleep if she read it before bed. Yes, this book will make you think!<br /><br />The Shock Doctrine is meticulously documented, and it's a great antidote for those who worship at the altar of Milton Friedman and his \\"economic shock treatment.\\" Few books of this type remain relevant for long, but The Shock Doctrine is just as relevant today as it was when it was published in 2007. Naomi Klein's masterpiece is a must read for any voter, and it should be a required read for the entire U.S. House of Representatives!<br /><br />Marty Essen, author of [[ASIN:B00AGLS1BI Cool Creatures, Hot Planet: Exploring the Seven Continents]]
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is a very helpful  and It makes it a hole lot easier to tell my batteries  juice and percentage
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I could hardly put this book down!  Clancy continues to write very realistic (if frightening) fiction.  I like the continuing characters, especially Jack, Jr.
B008B92U32|1.0|I choose a picture to swap faces with and it just goes back to the main screen. If it wasn't a good picture it should give you an error message. I've only gotten it to work once and it came out horrible
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had heard and heard and heard of angry birds so when I got my tablet I just had to go to try it out
0765325950|2.0|A few times in the last two books I've wondered if Sanderson really understood Jordan's characters or his style on more than a casual level and after reading this book I have the answer....no. I started reading WoT in the mid- 90's and waited breathlessly for the new book every other year usually re- reading the series just to refresh and because the characters became like good friends. Sanderson has the main characters saying and doing things they would never say or do, ignores MAJOR characters altogether, spends a major portion of the book on minor characters or new ones, didn't write what would have been critical moments for the characters and focuses almost exclusively on battle scenes. The ending is rushed and as a result confusing and trite leaving the reader wondering what? And How? For those of you like myself who were looking for an opportunity to say goodbye to WoT with grace and feeling...sorry. This book makes it clear WoT died with Jordan.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This has a good combination of puzzles and hidden object scenes. I had a hard time putting it down and even paid for the full version.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great fun! The more I do it, the better I get at it, although it does not always work out. Love it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This is his second book and it is much better than the first.  In the<br />first he had poor editing and used the word &#34;shrugged&#34; about 500 times.<br />He killed the same bad guy twice, the first time in a car ambush and the<br />second time in a money fire. Inspite of that I liked the first book and went<br />straight to the second.  This second book is very different. I can't put it<br />down.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Gives me a quick easy alternative to printing off pdfs sent for work or email no prob so far with it
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|It is A heart-warming story, with the quirks and spooks you expect from Tim, as will as masterful artistry! I love his work, but have been disappointed in the past. This is not one of those times. An all-time favorite for my family!!
B008AX1HD8|5.0|Having now read 4 of these great books by Jo Nesbo Harry escapades down under only confirms that we need to see more of these novels being published. As a detective Harry's reckless attitude toward avoiding all stable relationships underpinned by his tenacious need to catch the criminal makes for a great reading.
B003UYUP58|5.0|As you read this gripping history you come face to face with the terrible choices that clinicians must make to balance the dictum to &#34;do no harm&#34; against the requirement to completely &#34;scorch the earth&#34; to eliminate any traces of a disease which if unremoved will resurge to kill your patient.  This is highly recommended to patients and their families who are facing cancer therapy so that they will have some compassion for their clinician partners who is being faced with the decisions that may determine whether they live or die.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow what a great game once you start you can't stop definitely five star!I recommend it to younger players! It has fart graphics and is easy to interact with it is a child friendly environment but there are face book links so log in with your parents account so you are safer if you are under 13 because you have to be over 13 to use Facebook
B0085YNML2|4.0|I was hoping my 3 year old would be able to play this game.  Nothing was wrong with the game it just wasn't as kid friendly as I hoped.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|Then these songs will take you right back. I love many of the artists chosen for all 5 movies, and this is no exception. A few songs I skip, but that is just personal taste in music.
0955153077|4.0|Love this book. It is a big go to guide for me and gave me the steppings stones to better myself as an digital painter. I'm a immediate digital artist and this book is great!
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Great movie, great actors, great message ~ I will watch this movie again and again along with lending it out to others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game it is so fun. I pplay it all day I cant put it down u should play it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app, perfect for specifically knowing what your battery health is, and many other things. I highly recommend this app for anyone.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|The songs will take you right back to your favorite scenes! Most of the songs I just love, with a few I can skip. That is just personal musical taste talking. But I am a super fan.
0811879631|4.0|The Art of Pixar is a high quality book that will leave you amazed at the artists hired by Pixar. The styles and colours contributed and the artworks will make you want to grab out your own colour pencils and do something.. Pixar-like. ..
B000P407K4|5.0|It doesn't get any better when a great director, great actors, & a very real fear of nuclear annihilation  collide. What should you do when you may awake each morning as burnt toast or to a world of radiation ashes? Why you let Stanley Kubrick & Peter Sellers make missile madness livable and laugh all the way to hell. It don't get no better!

B006RXSBS2|5.0|This is NY at an important time in history when the city was so corrupted by politics&gangland power that only one course would decide the fate of metropolis standards. Fortunately integrity&honest love for a better city prevailed.<br />Day Lewis&deCaprio capsulated the events of the time. A great movie made possible by great directing(Scorcese)& great acting(Day Lewis, deCaprio,, Diaz, & many more).
B0091REZMW|4.0|I played this for long time on Facebook and am excited to try it on my Kindle Fire.  I always found the scenes very realistic and better than what I have seen in other hidden object apps.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I enjoy the game but when I got on I had no characters unlocked and a x1 multiplier. I still have my high score though?
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Temple Run 2 is all in all a great game. It truly is. But, for the past 48 hours, I will try to play it, but it just exits back out and onto the screen I was on before. Maybe there is just something wrong with my kindle, but it won't let me play the game.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was an amazing game by all means. Also the choice of people you get its wonderful. That is one of my favorite parts of the game other than the fact every month you go some where different.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't stop reading! I can't wait to watch the movie! It made me cry, and laugh. Great ending, I loved it!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I have read this book several times. This time wanted to read about Jimmy Seals after the most hated chef on Top Chef said that he was Jimmy. Laughed every time I read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game, awesome way to pass time and have a great time doing so. My family compete to see who can get the hhighest score.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really cool because it's like temple run but better also when your play in  temple run you have to sit a certain way and this one you can sit anyway you want and the view changes like its regular then New York then Rio so cool.

B002PNER9U|5.0|I love musicals, and this one had great songs, and fantastic actors. Rent took me through a range of emotions, and it was fun.It was fun to have some popcorn and park on the couch and be thoroughly entertained for a couple of bucks, than bother with the fuss and high price of going out. This movie is a fun night out, without going anywhere.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|we like and thank you and the price is good and is really nice and they like to play with it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fantastic!!! The only downside is that if you want to get certain horses or a zebra or a unicorn, you have to pay over $10 to get the gems to buy it. Otherwise, it's absolutely addicting!!!!!
B005LAJ1H2|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that  it was too dark even when we made basic adjustments to our TV. The setting, story, and acting were all excellent. Avoid it if nudity and graphic sex offend you.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I rated this game very low i did not play it at all i needed more understanding Did not like will not recommend nobody....
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is an unusual story, which I found very interesting. I especially liked the treatment of the ending--which one of PI's stories was &#34;true&#34;--or--I suppose it IS a work of fiction, after all. I don't know why I haven't read it before. Everyone I know has read it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|we like and thank you and the price is good and is really nice and they like to play with it.

B0012NVGHU|5.0|Heartwarming with a real feel supported by the low budget production values, the music and sincere performances of the leads makes this unlikely movie work so well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game its very relaxing to me and  you will love it too. I will recommend this game....

B00B19F3PG|2.0|The movie did not make any sense just pasted it together had no direction even though is based on a \\"Real Story\\". I give this movie a 2 star. My real complaint is with AMAZON VOD service. What normally is a no hassle movie night - the experience turned out to be a nightmare. I kept getting error message that \\"only 3 devices are allow to simultaneously stream from the VOD server. I called technical support and they advised that the server only allows 3 streams of VOD per account and their conclusion was that 1 of my laptops had 3 active sessions - which made no sense; so I went around the house turn off all my devices but did not help. I also was able to stream another VOD from AMAZON without any problems - which puncture holes in their theory.  I got my money refunded and finally got to watch the movie 24 hours later.  I am giving AMAZON VOD service a 2 star rating for all the troubles that I had to go through to watch this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It gets very competitive trying to get better with your friends on Facebook! It's better than temple run!! I've recommends it to a lot of my friends and they love it too..it gets very addicting!!
1781164150|5.0|A great art references book exceptional color reproduction from the movie and excellent artist a must for all movie buff.
B00860YICC|2.0|I emailed the following to the seller and never received a response:<br /><br />I saw 1900 (not in its entirely) on TV and loved the movie.  I kept checking to see when it would be shown again so I could record it.  Finally I ordered it and was anxious to watch it and then have some friends over to watch it.<br /><br />After watching it, I can't invite my friends.  I had to keep turning the volume up and down.  It was often so difficult to hear the dialogue and I would turn it up, then the background music/sounds would overpower the voices and be very loud and I'd turn it back down.  I missed some things because I couldn't understand what they were saying.  The mixing was terrible.  I agree with my husband, who has a music studio and knows all about mixing.<br /><br />Is this a quirk in a few DVDs or all they all like this?  Also, is there an edited version without so much cussing?  I don't remember all of that in the TV version.
B000W1W9D8|5.0|Amazing Album!  I Bought this as I was trying to complete my R S 500 Albums collection and I was blown away!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is terrific!! Love the show. Humorous. And interesting. They never seem to be lacking for new plot twists.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is very wonderfully thought out and very fun to play. I really like the world tour thing when you travel around the world.overall,i highly recommend this game for fun.
B002RI97IY|5.0|Easy to read and it makes sense! I love this book. Explained in such a way that it all really makes sense.

B0076DEJMO|3.0|If this book was by another author I probably would have given it four stars but I was expecting a bit more from Joe Abercrombie.  For me the story dragged at times and I thought the resolution wasn't sufficiently set up.<br /><br />The translation of elements typical to a story of the American West to his fantasy landscape was interesting:  there were analogs to weary gunfighters, Indians, old Indian guides etc.  I think that perhaps Abercrombie was influenced by the true life story of Cynthia Ann Parker who came to consider herself a Comanche after being being abducted by them when she was a child.
1455502758|5.0|This slim volume collects together the last of Hitchens' writing, much of which appeared in his Vanity Fair column.  Of course, as the title implies, it covers his thoughts on his last illness, the cancer that ultimately took his life.  As such, it's a bit odd, since Hitchens' strongest work has always been in politics and literature, but it still has its moments of brilliance and it still resounds with Hitchens' unique voice.<br /><br />What is wonderful about this book is Hitchens' ability to discuss his illness with honesty while keeping the morbidity pretty much at bay.  His desire to stay himself and keep working even as he struggles with his condition is amazing.  This is reflected very powerfully in the fragments that are printed as the final chapter, showing how his mind was still working up until the very end.  It is fascinating to see what directions his thoughts were taking.  If only we could know how he would have developed them.<br /><br />For someone who seemed to glory in being difficult and controversial, it can be difficult perhaps for some to be appropriately sympathetic to him (which is reflected in some of the messages he receives from people that are related in this book).  On the other hand, it is also difficult not to respect his intellect and passion, his writing skill.  Hitchens seemed to mourn the loss of his voice most of all.  It's easy to understand why.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|Very well written<br />I'm quite excited to read the next one,<br />Maybe even better than twilight? Woo hooooo super pumped to start a new series
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I was told about this show from a co-worker and I am so glad she shared.  I love it and am totally hooked.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOve this show, and I Will keep watching until the end. It makes me laugh a lot and cry some a perfect blend
B00003XACV|5.0|Awesome Musical track. One of the best tracks of music for a movie ever. If you like this movie, which was a masterpiece of bringing up emotion, and showing the truth about suburbia, this will bring magic to your ears. Brings up wonderful emotions.
0761171703|5.0|If you love dancing, whether you dance or love watching dancers, this is a book that is filled with dancers in every position<br />possible! I found it joyous, lovely, and heart lifting. Treat yourself to beauty & the best!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Have had to watch this film twice in order to get the full effect and meaning. Other than having a group of very well built men shedding clothes at different times, there is a story line or many story lines.  One can see why Channing Tatum was selected as one of the major characters.  Not only did he have the personal experience as a male striper but has put a considerable amount of time as an actor.  Each film he makes, further defines his abilities.  Enough said.  This film portrays the inner workings of the so-called Male Reviews.  All the drugs, the booze, and the wild life in general, gives audience a rare glimpse of this life.  Mike(Channing Tatum) tries to balance three jobs at one time and a personal romance. This is the main story line.  In this theme the audience can either feel sorry for him, resent him or identfy with him.  This is the choice.  TRYING TO MAINTAIN A LIFE IS THE CONSUMATE STRUGGLE FOR MANKIND!  NJMJr.
B002JTZ6UO|1.0|Why in the world would I spend $49.79 per movie when I can buy them separately for less than half that? Ever notice how anything Trek is more expensive? Been a Trekkie all my life and have never seen a good deal yet.
0486274268|5.0|This book is very detailed as to how to draw various animals. Very good illustration. Pleased with purchase. I bought it for my granddaughter as she likes to draw. She will get alot of use out of this book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is a great app mostly.<br /> I like how in TR2 you can save yourself by using the gems you collect during the game. The caves are AWESOME even though I usually die in them!! The only flaws are that it takes a long time to download (a minor problem) and sometimes while you are playing it will shut off randomly, and then all your progress is lost! Even though this doesn't happen often, it did cost the game one star.<br />Overall it rocks and you should totally get it!!! Great app!!!
B0000AI45P|5.0|Television came from the same New York music scene/womb that gave birth to the New York Dolls, the Ramones, Blondie, Johnny Thunders, the Dead Boys, etc., except they were also very influenced by the same poet revival that Patty Smith and Jim Carroll came from. They are unique, and un-categorical. This re-release including some excellent bonus tracks is sharp and clear, and &#34;Marquee Moon&#34; was always an album that you never tire of listening to. Verlaine and Lloyd, despite their differences (or maybe because of), are great foils for each other and each are magnificent guitar players, and backed by the rhythm section of Ficca (drums) and Smith (bass) have the ability to let loose their creativity. Check out the books &#34;Sonic Transmission&#34; and &#34;Marquee Moon (from the 33 1/3 series), both available here on Amazon, for more details of the wonderful musical collaboration.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is brilliant. It's like temple run but with more creativity. It has changing settings and locations for special events. For example in December it was Christmas themed and it had Santa and an evil Rudolph dog chasing you. Now it has a world tour setting with different cities. First it was NY and now it's Rio. It has helpful items like hoverboards and headstarts. It has many customization options from characters to boards.I recommend it to anyone who likes temple run and surfing or dodging trains and running away from cops and their police dogs. You'll be lost in the game for hours.
B00009RDGA|4.0|Good show. Good acting.  My husband and I  first saw this show many years ago.  It was well worth buying again.
B00A4FOWYQ|1.0|If it were possible to give this album a lower rating, I would have.  I've been a fan of Tegan and Sara's since the beginning and was always impressed with their solid  indie rock vibe with strong guitar licks and intelligent lyrics, however, this album has had all the rock elements drained out of it.  I had to force myself to listen to it all the way through hoping there would be one rocker or even a ballad, but no.  I do appreciate artists experimenting and trying new paths, but at this stage in their careers, I would have thought Tegan and Sara would have tried more sonic ventures with different instrumentation and arrangements while employing new lyrical themes as PJ Harvey and Jeff Tweedy have done throughout their runs.  The only reason an artist turns to pop is to soak up more cash, and if this is the direction they are going to continue on, they not be receiving any more money from me.
1402210795|5.0|Of course, most of Georgette Heyer's Regencies are favorites of mine, or close to it.  I love the stories she tells, the British humor; I love the way she uses &#34;types&#34; in different roles...for instance, while the dark,  dashing, handsome hero is to be expected, Ms. Heyer would offer one with a secondary, less appealing, character as hero and then proceed to make him one of your all-time favorites too, when you were sure you'd be bored out of your mind.  Friday's Child is not of that type, tho, here she's got an appealing, if a tad selfish (that changes), hero.<br /><br />Friday's Child is a sprightly story, as well crafted as her others.  The thing I absolutely cherish about her books is the accuracy of her detail.  From the expressions used in speech of various classes, to the clothing, the carriages, every historical detail in her books is correct, and that alone makes her books stand out as excellent,  Friday's Child is a keeper.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|It did not resolve the problem. My computer still will not recognize the Kindle as a valid device. I therefore can not download anything from my computer to the Kindle.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This calculator works great. It's easy to see and use, however, the free version has these annoying ads that show up across a banner while you are using it. annoying.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Well hey you got to look at this album different. If you truly like the band, you'll look at this and say \\"may not be their best, but they're finally happy\\"<br /><br />Yes I agree, the darker side of My Chem is the musically better side /but/ throughout Bullets and Cheers, they hated the world and themselves. TBP was I think just a dark story and a brilliant one at that(nothing to do with how they were feeling.) and now you've got this. They're happy. So even if you don't like it sound wise, you know that this is them showing color and saying they're comfortable with themselves now and knowing theyre happy makes this album better. At least for me
B00005Q4CS|1.0|Dont get me wrong this is a great movie, but you want the Director`s Cut not the Edited Version-thats what i got,,, so look real carefully and even contact the seller if its not Amazon because you might not get what you pay for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun I think people who like temple run should play Subway surfers it's very addicting and it takes eye contact and not having distractions
0307960471|4.0|There may have been a time, not too long ago, when Scandanavia must have seemed almost utopian, with its low crime, high standard of living and generally pleasant atmosphere.  Of course, utopias rarely are as wonderful as they seem, and Norway, Sweden and company are no exceptions to that rule.  With the rise of the Scandanavian thriller - led by Stieg Larsson's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - the seamier side of Northern Europe has become more evident to outsiders.<br /><br />Though Larsson may be the biggest name, Jo Nesbo has been successful too, particularly with his books about the hard-luck detective Harry Hole.  The latest book to feature Harry is The Phantom, which brings him back from self-imposed exile in Hong Kong.<br /><br />Harry was tormented by lots of demons - particularly alcoholism - during his time in Oslo, so Hong Kong offered him a chance to recover and start anew.  The only thing that could drag him back would be his former lover Rakel or her son Oleg.  When Oleg is arrested for murder, Harry tries to exonerate him.<br /><br />Oleg is no longer the sweet, sad kid Harry once knew; now he is a drug addict, hooked on a synthetic version of heroin called violin.  To get to the bottom of the crime will entangle Harry in the world of organized drug dealing and the corruption that goes along with it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent thriller/whodunit.  I don't know if I'd call it a classic, but it has no real flaws and should entertain mystery fans.  I would recommend, however, that you start with the earlier Harry Hole books; while this stands alone reasonably well, it is enriched by reading others in the series.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|So typically Swedish, this rollicking borderline crazy story had me laughing at every turn of events. A great fun quick read.
B008N1V11U|1.0|This game would be amazing, unfortunately, it lags the entire time on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;. It looks amazing, but this Kindle fire SUCKS
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Too long and meandering.  Lots of noise and action and yet somehow still lifeless in a lot of spots. Mayhem by the numbers.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Fun majong game for free,  lots of different games. Music is kind of annoying. I turn the sound down. One negative: the tiles are kind if small.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The evolution of British aristocracy at the turn of the century. Tragedy and sentiment mixed with humor depicting the societal changes of British society.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is amazing!  there are so many cool things to find on this. I have my work cut out now to actually complete these. haha
B009RH973I|4.0|I like it because it is slim and pink! I don't care for the &#34;stand&#34;, it kinda doesn't work all that great. Lets put it this way: if you use the stand and don't budge your kindle you're good to go, if you use the stand and need to use your kindle plan on it toppling over. But I kinda expected that so I am over all pleased with my purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun I think it's better than temple run its fun to play and its a world tour so you get  bunch of different places
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Dark Arcana the Carnival is well worth the cost.  A good story, cool graphics, and  a Monkey sidekick.  I enjoyed this one....I ready for the sequel.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I liked this movie because it was &#34;outside the box&#34;. I didn't have a clue what was going to happen next. (I didn't read the books) I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! Such a good game! I love using boards and collecting coins! I think everybody should get this game! I rate 5 stars!
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|I bought this item from the UK as the release for this country omitted various extras, what the site fails to tell you is that since January 1st all purchases outside the EU (European Union) attract customs duty.<br />Had Disney studios released the same version for the UK I'd have bought the disc here thereby avoiding nearly US$ 20 custom duty.<br />Amazon have the power to withdraw the UK batch and replace it with the Amwrican version but have not done so as far as I am aware nor have they placed a warning on their US website. This affects not only UK but purchases from all EU member countries.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|His characters are always captivating.  His men are honestly loving, his women spiritualy loving people you wish you had in your life, or lmaybe you do and are reminded of their value.  His books are teachers and healers and this one is no exception.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I was hesitant to play this game because of my mediocre artistic skills. No worries. It's super fun and easy enough for anyone.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone! My family watched it multiple times in theaters and we enjoyed it even more at home! Five stars!!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|to me this has to be his best album so far. i've been a fan since the early 70's and i think Morrison just keeps getting better. if you've never listened to Van Morrison this one is a must to hear.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I tell myself I'm only going to play this game for 10-20 minutes, and an hour later I'm still at it.  SO challenging and so fun.  I find myself laughing and groaning out loud.  Can't get enough of Subway Surfers.  Always so fresh and new, it really keeps me coming back for \\"one more time\\".
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie about the realities of prohibition. I was glad I rented it, but kind of wished I bought it!

B004J4WNL2|5.0|The insight in this book has been helpful. I'm still coming to grips with the new found knowledge, and will need to read it again. I only wish I had this information many years ago. I would have saved me so much grief.
B001QFYCZM|3.0|I have often wondered what this film might have been, rather than what it is now, if John Garfield had originally played Stanley?  For me there is too much melodramatic Brando, and not enough subtle Kowalski, for  the expression of poignancy necessary to make this a realistic drama. A pity as this is a great play that needs a much more sympathetic touch in line with the extraordinary performance of Vivien Leigh, on stage and screen.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this anthology for my husband because he had the 8 disk dvd set, and he wanted it on blu ray, and now he has it!! The pic quality is awesome!!

B007OAAK0O|5.0|I saw this on channel pbs for a lot of money.  I was there that rainy day and was so happy to have this.  quality very good.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|I heard about this action flick on twitter, from a few film critics that said \\"it was a must see\\" and \\"is the best action movie in years\\", and you know what? it is.<br />Is hard nowadays to find really really good action movie, but not this time. It has a very basic story, that's actually very interesting, it's simple and very easy to follow. In fact, is so easy to follow, that you never miss a moment of action because of the plot, nor the other way around. The construction of the narrative is very entertaining and the fights are just incredible.<br />It all happens in one building, and we follow the extreme action from the first to the last floor.<br />The music shapes the pace of the fights and also has a second soundtrack made by Mike Shinoda that is quite the treat.<br />In the Extra Material Area the \\"Making of\\" is pretty awesome, you can check how it was choreographed and what kind of Martial arts and modification of it they used.<br />There's a second part  in production, so don't lose the chance the see this one first, you won't regret it.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, so wehn I ordered it I was happy to see that it was still as cute and funny as I remember!!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for this family movie but the reviews were spot on.  This is a well put together fun movie for the whole family.  Great story, music, plot, and overall theme.  It was also fun to pick out the stars who did the voices of the characters.  I thought I recognized the star of &#34;Boardwalk Empire&#34; on there and I was right.  We watched it to the very end.  Even the credits were entertaining.
0307744434|3.0|The book jumps around a lot between time and between different characters, but if you won't get frustrated by that, then it's pretty good. Also, It takes a while for the book to get started and some of the characters seemed wholly unnecessary. But I enjoyed reading it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome,cool,sweet,the bomb,5 star rated,and did I minchen awesome awesome awesome awesome cool so cool and you will love this game its almost like the original MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005KA188S|3.0|If you are a huge fan of the original, like I am I would not buy this movie!! The story line is completely changed and not for the better! Horrible horrible remake!!
0061992860|5.0|It's a lot smaller than I though, which is great, easy to pack, certainly won't notice it. It doesn't go into much detail on any given topic, you might want a specific book for a specific topic. However, that being said, it covers so much more than I thought it would. Fishing strategies, shelter set up, wild animals to avoid, animal hunting and snares, emergency medical treatment, edible plants, fire starting, improvised weapons... so much more. Great addition to any BOB in my beginning prepper opinion.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Great baseball movie as well as typical Eastwood movie. Shows emotions. Justin Timberlake surprisingly good!<br />Good come uppance theme! Great supporting cast.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|This gave me a whole new meaning to the phrase, Island Retreat. If you like engaging in mental gymnastics, you will enjoy this film.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very easy to control and have only started playing but am sure I will be on this until it is completed.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app. I always wanted to be able to make pictures in my own way. Now that I have this app I can create pictures unique to me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a very good book I could not put any one of these books down. I have recommended this series to many of my friends.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is my favorite show. I love how complex the plot gets. I can't wait to see what happens next!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|- i like this game but yall need to work on if we die give us a chance to run again and not START OVER !!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What's there not to say about this free game? Superb graphics? Already been said. Addicting gameplay? Taken. Engaging and challenging in game challenges? Guilty. Subway surfers has proven and demonstrated capability of leeching onto the minds of tablet users. I know no one who has played this game and honestly did not like it. This game dominates the app store in replay value and worth. There is not one game that comes close to the entertainment quality this game delivers. It's amazing when you think about it, a game with simple gameplay mechanics that has flourished and become such a digital media sensation. Long live subway surfers.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great HD streaming experience!<br />No lagging and easy purchise.<br />I will deffianatelly do it again!<br /><br />Why I need to write so many words to submit?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! It has an amazing rebellion twist, and I would have to recommend it always. Get this book!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great game which is really hard to put down. I found some of the ''easy'' sections sections challenging so the ''normal'' and ''advanced'' sections should be interesting. Recommended.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Eminently quotable with fun characters and great music. Don't watch if seeing vomit makes you throw up, however. You'll want to re-watch this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are  really no words. If you are looking for a book that will touch your soul, this book is for you. I'm not going to bother with a summary, I don't think this is a book that can be abbreviated. It's a wonderful book, with a heartbreaking, breathtaking story. Sorry, no cheap thrills here. Colleen Hoover wrote a great book that I'm going to read again, and again!
0316228532|1.0|This book was chosen for my book club so i thought i should finish.  i found the book to be extremely hard to read and  figure out the point of the story.  The ending got a little more interesting but i would not recommend this book.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I haven't been able to stop playing.  Great game.  The game play is as addictive as mario bro. ,  and I would recommend it to my friends.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|A key to installation is to read and follow the directions. I against my masculine instincts I did that and everything went smoothly.  The product works well, but you might find the reduced screen size annoying.
030746363X|1.0|1. He takes you in his \\"insider\\" circle, with loopholes etc.<br />2. Just enough of a non-conformist to thrill you<br />3. He takes you through a plethora of fun information<br /><br />But Martin Berkhan is the one with the true secret: and the smartest guy look him up at Leangains.com you can download his guide for FREE! The research is astounding.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I have used the free verion of TuneIn for over a year.  When I heard about the opportunity to get the full version from the Amazon store, I jumped at the opportunity.  Unfortunately, when using this version, I get periodic request to log in to my Amazon account before the application will start.  I finally uninstalled.  I will probably purchase through Google Play.
B00978V35C|4.0|Young Bob puts out another great chunk of blues. Very consistent, but not much new here. If you have enjoyed him in the past, try this one on.
B007G5K066|3.0|It was a bit slow for me. I thought there would be more action and some killer turns in the movie, but it wasn't what I expected. The movie is ok, but you have to follow it closely.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome that you have creative and survival. Lava is so rare in this game but I found it with no glitches.So you should get this game. Its is a lot of money but they work so hard on minecraft like the Pc version;xbox360edition and nintendo 3ds version coming soon.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have been using Documents To Go for years.  This seems to exceed the features of Documents To Go.  Also seems more reliable.  running on a Drioid 3 without any problems.
B002ZG974W|5.0|One of the best documentaries.  Watched several times and love it every time. We are one family. Babies and parents are the same all over the world.

B00633W614|5.0|This is the second book in the Clifton Cronicles. Wonderful book. I can't wait until spring when the final book comes out. I am on the waiting list.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Overall very cute and playable. Lots of options and some skill required to make  it a bit interesting.<br />Being someone who would love a horse but cannot have one this was the best alternative. Better than a ds game
B0057567P0|2.0|I have to agree with the majority of views that the Sonnet USB 3.0 Expresscard34 is a disappointing product.<br /><br />As previously noted the build is far cheaper than their other expresscards (which have served me exceedingly well in the past) and feels pretty flimsy in comparison.<br /><br />Ignore the power socket; it is unusable. (Check Sonnet's website for more information but they quote \\"External power is not supported\\"). Who knows why they placed it on there...<br /><br />The connection is extremely unstable when used in my MacBook Pro's internal card slot. Hard drives continually unmount and I've found it practically unusable. But, I have had success when plugged into the Sonnet Qio E3 reader. It's not a perfect solution and but it has worked solidly enough when undertaking intensive tasks. The Qio reader also generates enough power for the card to stably(ish) power a single bus-powered usb 3.0 drive too.<br /><br />As mentioned in some of the other posts the drivers aren't so great either. The expresscard does give my system a bit of a hissy fit.<br /><br />Sonnet make a lot of wicked products but unfortunately this isn't one of them.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a definate chic book......sweet and with a good ending.  It's just an easy reading book.  Now that I've read the book, I'm looking forward to seeing the movie when it comes out in 2 weeks.  Nicholas always does a nice job with his books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it's like you get to take care of a real horse and you get to visit other people, create a nickname and name your horse. These are all the activities you can do to take care of your horse: Groom, Muck out, and feed. You can also go in the USA championship!!! You should totally get it!!! :-)
030758836X|1.0|This book starts off extremely promising. Did Nick do it? Didn't he do it? Someone framing him? Very intriguing, and then...I will not offer spoilers here, but I feel the author had too many grand ideas regarding of how this book should play out and instead of carefully choosing she put them all together and tried to explain them away. I believe Gillian Flynn's background as a television writer for Entertainment Weekly was her downfall here. Perhaps too many episodes of Law & Order, Lifetime movies, and CSI. I know two other women who have read this book (one has already requested money back from her vendor) and thought it was one of the most overhyped books that's come out in a really long time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liked the game so I think that all of you people that want to play 101 games +13 should really try it.
B000005TRO|5.0|We really enjoy playing her music even though we only speak english. So we don't understand the words but we still love it.
0330449931|5.0|Smith continues the saga of Taita in a memorable way.  A big Smith fan and can't say enough about him.  He is certainly proliic and I have read some of his other series (Ballantines, Courtneys, etc) and have been thrilled by them all.  There are just so darned many of them.  At least his Egyptian series has only 4.  That I can handle.
0061733199|5.0|This is a must have for your emergency needs.  It covers all areas.  I did my research it is really the survival and emergency bible of all books.  A serious must have.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun time killer. Great grafics and runs smoothly with no lag time. Would recommend to any horse lover out there.
B007I1QUHG|1.0|Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address. Amazon refunded my money with no issue.

B009VB7QQA|5.0|My husband ordered this movie because there was nothing else to watch, but to our the movie was really good!  We really enjoyed it.  I would recommend watching it.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it was a surprise that it was so good.
B003Y5H5B0|2.0|Don't waste your time on this movie! Stupid plot. Channing Tatum as a high school student?  Really? The &#34;over-acting&#34; by Ice Cube is so embarrassing! Jonah Hill should be ashamed of himself for being in this movie. No one in this movie is believable!
B009CGYO0K|5.0|A funny view on all of the things the cat owners project onto their pets and the potential for pets to project in return.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Great &#34;story telling!&#34;  Brad is totally believable in the lead role. But, Jonah Hill is the real star in this movie. Jonah should have won an Oscar for his performance. I'm not a fan of his but, he is awesome in this movie! If you like a movie to be entertaining from start to finish, this movie belongs in your collection. Get it now!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Been a fan of Pendergast for decades, and this last installment didn't fail to please.  Lots of surprises, some fine &#34;ah HA&#34; moments<br />and lots of new directions Mr. Preston can take future novels, and me right along with him.<br /><br />Pendergast rules.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This movie for me started out and ran like the ones before, and I enjoyed the viewing.  I thought all of the situations leading into the body of the plot were funny, fit right into the theme of MIB until they dropped the plot bomb at the end. The entire series is explained and I went wild, wonderful concept.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but when will it update to 0.6.1 hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I thought it was awesome when I first got it but then when I would click on it it wouldn't open

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Product is exactly as described. Fast delivery.<br /><br />Carry with me backpacking, hunting and fishing out in the field for those sharpening needs that may arise with skinning and boning. Only addition I would to this device would be a flatstone that can be pulled out of the body and used for honing and deburring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is kind of like temple run and because I get the world tour which is really fun. I'm a lucky duck.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|First off, period dramas are definitely my favorite genre of movie.<br />Up until I viewed this series, \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" '95 easily took top honors as my all-time favorite!  Now I'd say, it's pretty much a tie between N&S and P&P!<br /><br />After all these years, I've finally decided to write a little review...<br /><br />I found this at my local library back in 2006, and promptly took it home to watch.  (At the time, the authors name didn't jog my memory.  I hadn't realized that she wrote \\"Wives & Daughters\\"-- which had previously been turned into a miniseries, that I enjoyed when (PBS) Masterpiece Classic aired a few years before.)<br /><br />Being as I hadn't read the book prior to viewing, I had nothing to compare it to.<br />I can't remember exactly if I watched the whole series in one sitting or not, but I distinctly recall my reaction to the ending-- I was in utter tears!  Never had an ending (a happy one at least) moved me so much as this one had!!  Of course, the classical score (\\"Northbound Train\\") softly playing in the background packs quite the emotional punch as well!<br /><br />As far as initial impressions go-- I don't think anyone in the cast disappointed me with their performance.  The whole thing was expertly acted; in particular by the leads Daniela Denby-Ashe (Miss Hale), and Richard Armitage (Mr. Thornton)- both of whom were entirely unknown to me at the time.<br />The locations, scenery, script, and musical score are all top notch!<br /><br />Last year I was able to finally read the book, which brought fresh understanding to its characters (especially Mr. Thornton).<br />..For anyone inclined, I strongly urge you to read the book; you'll get so much more out of the story if you do! (Or perhaps the audio-book if you don't want to read all 400 some pages.)<br /><br />Beyond just a tale of romance, and social etiquette-- the book and movie really gives you a glimpse of the great change that the industrialized age was bringing to not just England, but the rest of the world. Which in turn had an impact on society in general.<br />It really goes without saying that life back then was extremely hard; death came at a much earlier age than nowadays!<br />The conditions the industrialized working class had to endure obviously led many to an early grave. Workers unions were created to ensure proper working conditions, and fair wages.<br />Also, instead of being born into privilege, one could insure their own financial independence, and social status.<br /><br />Just like her contemporary (and friend) Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell wrote strong female characters.  Like \\"Jane Eyre\\" I would imagine that \\"Margaret Hale\\" was not typical of the average woman of that period (or how they were expected to behave).  These characters were ahead of their times, and obviously so where the real women that wrote them--or at least aspired to be (much like Jane Austen)!<br /><br />**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**<br />If I had to have one little quibble about the film verses the book, it would be the way in which the leads met.  Mr. Thornton although a \\"bulldog\\" never did that to a worker (in fact, as both later portrayed, he actually struck up a friendship with Nicholas Higgins)!<br />One hit would have gotten the point across- instead he ended up beating him! While it's entirely possible that an owner/overseer could have done that back then for the reason stated in the movie, it just wasn't in line with his character. But I guess the writers/producer/director felt that the novel's reasons Margaret took a dislike to him maybe wouldn't translate to film well; especially since societal views have changed so much since then, and they had to get the point across right away by having the character do that.<br /><br />Although the film ending is different than the book, I have no qualms with it.  Perhaps it's not the way things would have been done back then (at least in public), but in my opinion, it does convey more emotional depth thanthe actual book ending (which has an abrupt, almost unfinished feel to it).<br />___________<br /><br />If you desire further understanding of the Victorian era/life, here are a few things I can recommend to view: \\"Who the Dickens is Mrs. Gaskell?\\" (found on disc 3 of \\"Wives & Daughters\\" in \\"The Elizabeth Gaskell Collection\\" dvd collection).  Historical (reality) documentary shows: \\"Victorian Farm\\", \\"Victorian Pharmacy\\", \\"The Supersizers Go...Victorian\\", and \\"Turn Back Time: The High Street (1st Episode: Victorian Era)\\".<br /><br />**P.S.** There is a new (mini) series called \\"The Mill\\"; based on factual accounts/documents of the Quarry Bank Mill in Cheshire, England.  Set in the year 1833, during the height of the industrial revolution.  There are 4 episodes total; and a second series/season has been commissioned.  All I can say is, if you desire to know how  mill workers of the time lived, you will find it in this series.  It's very much in the vein of \\"North & South\\": very realistic, no glossing over (also comparable to recent Dickens adaptations such as \\"Little Dorrit\\", and \\"Bleak House\\").  It air's on Channel 4 in the UK, but Acorn Media UK will release it on dvd in August (2013).  FYI, it's also been picked up for a second series (season).<br />Another mini (2 episodes) documentary series recommendation is \\"How The North Was Built (with Robson Green)\\"-- about the 18th/19th century industrial revolution!<br /><br />In conclusion, I feel this series definitely did the book justice, despite the 2 discrepancies.  And highly recommend this miniseries to those that enjoy period dramas (particularly those by Charles Dickens, the Brontës, Thomas Hardy, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, Catherine Cookson, etc.)!<br /><br />**EDIT**: The 1975 BBC miniseries adaptation of \\"North & South\\" (starring Patrick Stewart and Rosalie Shanks), has been released from Acorn Media.

B0042ESTQW|5.0|I got clotheslined by a chain to the head tube at 20+ MPH - immediate stop, and the Garmin (protected by this case) went sailing.  It bounced and rolled to a stop on concrete pavement.  The Garmin and case were undamaged.  Definitely glad I had the case - definitely worth the money!<br />All the controls as well as the USB and flash memory ports are readily accessible with the case on; case does not interfere with the Garmin quarter turn mount.  The case is not sealed - not intended to be water resistant - but it does a great job protecting the Garmin from impacts.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is a novel about a serial murderer in late twentieth century Sweden. It is part of a three novel series that was made into films.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|After reading the other reviews, I have to say I wasnt one who was &#34;moved&#34;. Yes, the story line was okay, and the characters were okay but nothing that really knocked my socks off. Ofcourse, being a mother myself, I related to the feelings and emotions of the mothers in the book, but other than that.....I dont know it was really just okay for me. I also feel the ending was alittle abrupt after going back and forth between the Then and Now, I expected more from the ending. Never been a huge Jodi Picoult fan, but wanted to give her another shot. For some reason, she just doesnt do it for me. Maybe its just me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Might be too complicated for kids. Fun game though - I don't. mind keeping it on my kindle. It does have a lot of things that require gems, which cost money so I am not too sure how far you can really get for free.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Great short animated film. Our kids had just learned about &#34;trickster&#34; stories in school and this is probably the best one!
B0034G4P80|5.0|This is a great movie DVD and the actors are perfectly cast for their roles. I have watched it several times already.
B0082Z447U|4.0|What can I say!  It's a classic. Beautifully written. It's vivid portrayal of Victorian England takes you to a journey you never experienced before.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was just OK. Predictable. Wouldn't care to read it again. The only reason I finally got through it was because I couldn't fall asleep one night. It definitely wasn't a book I couldn't put down (and I'm an avid reader).
B008220BLG|2.0|\\"Warm Bodies\\" is only lukewarm. A zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) eats the brains of Perry (Dave Franco) and thereby falls in love with Perry's girlfriend, Julie (Teresa Palmer). The movie is meant to be a bit scary, a bit funny, and a bit romantic, but I wasn't much scared, I didn't laugh, and the romance was stale and flatfooted.<br /><br />Julie and R jump into a sports car to escape from menacing zombies and skeletons. The top is down; it begins to rain. They drive into an abandoned, post-Apocalyptic suburban neighborhood. Julie is cold; she has to take off her clothes. She does so in front of R. Teresa Palmer is a very beautiful young woman. R is a frustrated teen zombie madly in love with Julie. The director does absolutely nothing with this scene. There's no special lighting; the camera doesn't show us Julie's beauty as desperate, lovestruck R would see it.<br /><br />There are multiple chase scenes, none of which make much sense. Julie sees her well-armed father in a convoy and does nothing to join him, but later escapes on her own to join him, a much riskier trip. Why didn't she go earlier? No explanation.<br /><br />If you're looking for a funny zombie movie, check out \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" and \\"Zombieland.\\" If you're looking for a fully realized romance between a living woman and a dead man, watch \\"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\\" and \\"Truly Madly Deeply.\\" If you like romances between women and monsters, see Jean Cocteau's \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" or \\"King Kong.\\"<br /><br />\\"Warm Bodies\\" isn't a bad movie. It has its moments. R whines to his fellow zombie, Rob Corddry, about Julie, and Corddry's one word responses is the funniest line in the movie. The movie's conclusion is heartwarming if a bit half-baked.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I'm not here to review the movie as such, I'll just say I found it 2 hours of downright rip roaring fun. I was an original fan of the original series, which I'm going to rewatch now, and enjoy even more, I hope. Even with all its excesses and melodrama and silliness ... it was a harbinger of things to come, and a cultural icon. Maybe the original space meme.<br /><br />BUT the main thing I want to mention is that even though the description of this 2-disc edition says it includes \\"Digital Copy (Expires November 17, 2011)\\" I downloaded that through my iTunes at the end of January this year, 2013. And the 2-disc edition was actually cheaper than the  1-disc. Go figure.<br /><br />Okay, one more thing (or two): so good to see Karl Urban have such a good time playing McCoy! He's been playing too many heavies. Lots of foreshadowing in the cast interplay, great to hear the first utterance of future (not real time, you know what I mean) iconic lines. \\"I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!\\" Looking forward to the next one (or two ... if JJ doesn't get too distracted by Star Wars)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is so much fun! its great for all ages and runs well on the kindle fire. its a must have game! i wish we didnt have to pay for gems but its still a blast to play!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|\\"Argo,\\" among the nominees for the 2012 Best Picture Academy Awards, may very well be the best film of 2012, and Ben Affleck may very well be the best director. Unlike other frontrunners, \\"Lincoln\\" and \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" \\"Argo\\" is a movie-movie. Like those other two films, it tells a true story, but unlike those other two, disappointing films, \\"Argo\\" is not a starchy and lumpy docudrama. \\"Argo\\" is a smoothly running machine.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" tells a gripping story in a gripping way, never preaching (\\"Lincoln\\"), never getting too caught up in one aspect of the story to distort the narrative line (\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" and \\"Lincoln.\\") \\"Argo\\" wants to entertain you, and it does. It's a thriller. My palms were sweating as much while watching this movie as while watching an old-fashioned suspense flick by Alfred Hitchcock, even though, like most viewers, I know how the story ends. I found the opening scene of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran so frightening I could hardly watch it. This is all the  more remarkable given that I'd heard a radio interview in which Affleck joked about finding only older actors to perform the part of the \\"students\\" storming the embassy.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\"'s cast is full of actors I know well, have seen in many other films, and whom I like a lot: Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Victor Garber, Bryan Cranston. It's testimony to the film's power that I stopped thinking about these actors and got lost in the characters they were playing.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" tells the true story of a CIA plot to release six Americans from Iran during the hostage crisis. The plot: pretend that the six Americans are Canadians there to scout locations for an upcoming Sci-Fi flick.<br /><br />John Goodman and Alan Arkin are utterly believable, funny, and moving as the Hollywood part of the team. There's a brilliant, throwaway scene in which Alan Arkin and Richard Kind bargain over the price of a movie script. The scene doesn't advance the plot, but the dialogue is perfect and fast. It's just a witty respite in a tense movie about a life-and-death situation. Ben Affleck is perfect as a CIA operative. He keeps his cards very close to his chest.<br /><br />Farshad Farahat plays an amazingly hairy airport guard. He screams in Farsi. Most audience members, not speaking Farsi, will have no idea what this man is saying - there are no subtitles. Even so, we are terrified. Farahat deserves an award for his brief but pivotal performance as the face and voice of the enemy the entire world now confronts, an enemy driven by incoherent, focused, murderous rage.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" has a little bit of heartwarming family drama, a little bit of arcane CIA in-shop detail, a little bit of Hollywood behind-the-scenes banter, a very little bit of nightmarish torture. It never lingers in one type of scene too long; it just glides along, telling its story as economically and movingly as possible.s perfect and fast.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|This is what I would call a must see movie. It is a unique story line and the directing and acting was great!
B007EECSFA|5.0|The reader can visualize the pathways the story might take, and can't help but guess it will be a predictable ending, but is the bad guy really a bad guy.  Why would Dolly feel such passion to kill him?  Questions start to build up?<br />Could not put this book down until I knew the answer.  Since it is a long book I regrettably had to do so on several occasions and counted the minutes until I could continue reading.  Several twists in the story kept me guessing all the way to the end.  Lovely writing, well researched and an interesting story line.<br />Have already recommended this book to my book club and to several friends.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Interesting look back 80 years ago into a time period in American history that most of us don't know much about.  This is a ruthless period when the US government was trying to stop a wild fire that was unstoppable and certain parts of the United States were &#34;lawless&#34;.  Fairly good cast and acting was decent-no Academy awards here but still decent acting and a fairly good script and directing etc was good.  Worth a couple of hours of time as a history lesson!

This is a wonderful walk down memory lane and that is just the start. The storyline and acting is terrifice also!  Can't wait for season six.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I chose a five star rating simply because it was the highest rating I could use...if it were possible to give this a 100 star rating, then I'd go there, for sure. These people feel like family to me, and now that I have gone through the entire series twice, I intend to go through them all again as soon as I can. To me, it is stunning in every way. Superb casting, superb scripting, great costumes, incredible scenery, wonderful directing--to me, a great gift from the entertainment industry. I feel sad when I realize that there will have to be an end to the series, somewhere along the line--as one this fine hasn't come along for a long, long time.

0547848412|3.0|This was a good story, however, I admit I skipped a bunch of the first section of the book, because I found it a little tedious.  Once I got into the second part of the story, it is a great story, believable and I sympathized with Pi.  Very interesting overall, I only gave it 3 stars because of the overkill on the first part of the book.

B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Not bad action packed film. The movie had some imagination, wether borrowed or not. Special effects and real shoot-em-up, enjoyed every minute. Seems they spent some money on the film rather than it being a B movie....Watch It

1451695195|5.0|Excellently written. A shame that so many (neuro) surgeons and other medical professionals don't know about it and prolong the  myth of &#34;phantasy&#34;. It's a great book, well written and the content is, without being teary, touching and inspiring.

It gets better and better especially with the world tour an  the country's continuously changing. It keep me very busy and entertained. The graphics are amazing and crystal clear and I like the fact  that no ads pop up when playing the  game unlike other games and the instructions r easy. For something so simple it is so addictive.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wow! Can you even imagine a world where there is no government, electricity, or communications and you do pretty much anything and everything you can to survive? Granted the number of people isn't that many since most of them are walkers or actually dead and i only count people as the living ones. They are constantly in danger but they are strong and the group does a pretty good job looking out for one another. It is really cool to see all the different things they come up against and the interesting and creative ways that they get out of situations. If you like fantasy and sci-fi shows and movies this is definately the show for you.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Went into this book not knowing what it was about. I fell in love instantly with holder and sky. Amazing!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a weekend reader but it has the potential to change your life for ever.  The e-book material is presented well enough and the book flows in a logical fashion.  The author appears credible and the information he shares concurs with nearly all that I have read on fitness.  Some of his suggestions will take you by surprise such as \\"no stretching before lifting\\" and \\"no cardio directly after lifting\\" as they do not fall in line with the mantra put out to the public via fitness magazines.  I have started to incorporate some of his recommendations and will work in more as I get the results back from my first couple of experiments.  That is, I already have a fitness/workout approach that has taken a year to put together and has resulted in 50-plus pounds of weight loss and good muscle growth so I'm not quite ready to chuck everything just yet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book takes the golden cake.  The characters are superbly written, the plot is intricate and unique,  and the combination of romance,  action, and plot twists keep you reading beginning to end.  If you haven't read this book yet then you are missing out on a great adventure!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is much cheaper than a desk clock and works better. I selected my loudest song and use it to wake up every morning. That plus the nightstand feature make this app perfect for what I needed.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a great movie DVD and the actors are perfectly cast for their roles. I have watched it several times already.
1451695195|5.0|I have had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Eben Alexander speak at The Professional Division of The Monroe Institute last March.<br />I was astounded then by his journey to the Other Side and back. The clarity of the improbability that his experience could be<br />explained by our normal brain functioning was compelling. He was a wonderful speaker and I found his book equally well presented. I am still in awe that with the destruction of his cortex he is able to recover and share his JOurney Out of Bodyso clearly in such a short time. It defies the boundaries of brain functioning as we now know it. The book is a great read, and his<br />ebook is very well articulated as well. Kudos!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This Series is like a well written novel; once I started watching, I could not tear myself away! The characters have amazing substance, and the storyline is fascinating. So nice to watch something eloquent, yet easy to follow, without a lot of gratuitous violence.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My children wanted to watch it over and over again. It was cute and I was able to watch it with them.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|This was a great movie and I like movies that star Matt Damon anyway. It is a terrific story and a good movie to watch
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I didn't expect too much with this book, as many books about musicians are too fluffy, in my opinion. I have begun to focus on autobiographies and have found them so much better than those written by journalists or &#34;friends&#34;. This one is at the top of the list. Townshend is informative, interesting, and intellectual. Spoken from the heart without being self-aggrandizing or too self-effacing. He is a genuinely artistic and highly talented person with many interests and abilities other than music. The writing is excellent, moving along smoothly without too much detailed discussion of the complexity of song writing or explanation of song lyrics. This book is about Townshend's life, not just rock-star culture. Townshend is forthcoming about his struggles with drugs and alcohol, and also the spiritual needs that drive us all below the surface, affecting our work, our families, and our relationship with the world. Overall, a very valuable contribution to the autobiographical genre, as well as frantic world of being a rock and roll icon. A great read!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great app!! I like how it updates itself and stuff (on kindle fire.)<br />I think everyone should try it,its kinda like temple run but a lot more fun and lots more characters and boost and yeah so get this app!! (:
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this version of Temple Run. I can't put it down. It has turned into a family game my boys ages 4 & 7 love to play. My husband & myself are competitive as well. This is a game for all ages. My 4 year old out lived everyone in the house a few times before I got the hang of it. Time flies while playing.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a great love story! I read it first a couple of years ago when it was a featured Doubleday Book Club selection. I live in Southport, and my son-in-law is a volunteer fireman with the Southport Fire Department, they were on sight for the fire scenes. My daughter, grandaughters, and I were standing with the firemen. We would have to stand behind the fire truck when they would be filming. Knowing how much I enjoyed the book the first time,  I wanted to read it again with the updates. I have, and do recomend this book to anyone wanting to read a great book. Can't wait to see the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!

0062014102|4.0|I'd been meaning to read this book for years. Really, since it first came out in 1992. Now, two decades later, I'm getting to it.<br /><br />The first sections on the physics were completely captivating. I had a really hard time putting the book down from the first page to the early portions of Part 2 (The Brain as Hologram and The Cosmos as Hologram). The author very adroitly explains the holographic theory, how a physicist and a psychologist (Bohm and Pribram, respectively) coming at it from their fields were stumbling upon data/findings in experiments/patients that were leading them to the ideas of reality and how it may be thought of as \\"imaginary\\". The author does a very nice job of laying out the particulars, too, for 20th century thought on the subject.<br /><br />Then, unfortunately (for me), the author veers off into psychics and mind-body healing and chakras and chis and auras and ... you get the idea. This portion of the book follows a very typical formula that you'll see in similar books. Some kind of person or event is noted; then there is a paragraph or two or three devoted to its details; then there is some text explaining how this fits into the main idea being covered. This goes on for, literally, dozens of pages in the middle of the book. I found myself scanning, not reading, this material. Some of it I'd read elsewhere, anyway. It got to be too much when the author shares his own psychic abilities; how he \\"saw\\" himself as a werewolf when he was writing a book about werewolves; how another psychic castigated him for trying to heal himself, for \\"yelling at his spleen\\" (You cannot make this stuff up: \\"...she immediately described what was wrong with my spleen and then paused, scowling as if she was confused. 'Your spleen's very upset about something,' she murmured. And then suddenly it hit her. 'Have you been *yelling* at your spleen?' I sheepishly admitted that I had.\\" p. 186)<br /><br />My advice? Stop yelling at your spleen.<br /><br />Then there's a section on clairvoyants such as Stefan Ossowiecki, George McMullen, and Gerard Croiset. Look them up to see what they're about, if you like. Then we go into hauntings and fairy sightings and remote viewing and precognition. And reincarnation and out of body experiences and near death experiences. In each case the author provides some examples as proof of the phenomenon; and then usually provides a \\"But that's not all!\\" hook. And proceeds to give yet another example from yet some other 'researcher' that is even more incredible than what came before. (Reminded me of the Ronco infomercials: \\"But wait! There's more!\\")<br /><br />When the author gets to Swedenborg, I took note. I'd never heard of the man, so I went to his Wikipedia page and found all I needed, and more. Interestingly, the author does *not* state that Swedenborg was a Christian. More interesting is that the author leaves out the fact that Swedenborg himself said that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings. And that a 'new church' was founded based on his theology. These are pretty big details to leave out.<br /><br />We continue with the author into shamanistic traditions. Much is discussed; similar experiences abound across cultures and across time. The author quotes a (yes!) psychoneuroimmunologist: \\"Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, and perhaps biological information flow cannot just disappear at death and must be transformed into another realm.\\" (This is simply conservation of mass.) Then he touches on the UFO phenomenon, and what that may or may not *really* be. (I have my own solid thoughts based on much study over the years.)<br /><br />So, I confess, I read this book through my Christian mind that's been soaked in a foundation of readings, teachings, and experiences from a variety of ancient, modern, and current Christian philosophers, theologians, and teachers. I've learned many simple truths over the decades; one being: \\"even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.\\" In other words: Be careful what you let into your mind.<br /><br />The book was not entirely what I expected it to be. As I say, it started extremely strong for me, sagged terribly in the middle, but then came back around with nice closure on the topic, including the \\"Evolutionary Thrust toward Higher Consciousness\\". (Something is happening, but not what the author thinks.)<br /><br />Recommend reading with an open (and guarded) mind. 4/5 stars ('liked it'). This book provided a nice introduction to the subject for me. It is dated now, so I'll be looking for more recent material.ht.\\" In other words: Be careful what you let into your mind.<br /><br />The book was not entirely what I expected it to be.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|I loved the movie. Typical Tim Burton picture and Johnny Depp's performance was phenomenal. The plot, I thought, was quite original. Bringing a vampire that was imprisoned in his coffin for 200 years into the hippie era of seventies was not only hilarious but very entertaining.

B006VC3LES|3.0|My husband got me into film noir, exposing me to classics such as Double Indemnity, Laura, The Blue Dahlia, Pickup on South Street, and many others. But neither of us had ever seen 1974's CHINATOWN. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Roman Polanski. We expected a lot. We were disappointed.<br /><br />The first problem is the soundtrack. It's all wrong for this type of movie. It's too saccharine and \\"period.\\" It would be perfect for an old elevator, but not for an old-style detective drama. The story is fine, but Jake, Nicholson's character, figures it out about halfway into the show. His performance is acceptable but he seems to lose steam midway through. Dunaway is pretty bad. It's clear that she and Nicholson are supposed to remind us of Mary Astor and Humphrey Bogart in the Maltese Falcon. Epic Fail. And because it's a Roman Polanski film, there's a dash of incestuous rape thrown in for shock value. I wasn't shocked. I was bored. Then it ended (badly) and I was happy again!<br /><br />Overall, CHINATOWN dragged and the performances were very subdued. Despite Nicholson's gravitas, I can't recommend this \\"classic.\\" I fully recommend those I mentioned above, though. And if you want a new take on film noir that is truly worthy of the genre, take a look at L.A. Confidential. Note the MPAA Rating for EVERYTHING but it is one of our favorites of the category.<br /><br />NOTE:  They only go to CHINATOWN once in this film, and the audience wouldn't even know that it WAS CHINATOWN if the actors had not kept saying it.  It could have been any city anywhere.  So what was the point?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun. Earn coins...better than temple run....like the new rio update...limited items are fun upgrades....buy people...buy boards...I recommend it to anyone from kid  to adults..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wasn't expecting to enjoy this game as much as I do. I play it on my Kindle Fire and it is rather addicting. Great graphics, minimal advertising and no bugs that I've noticed. I particularly enjoy the daily challenges that keep the game fun and not repetitive. There are tons of choices of characters and bonuses that you can earn and/or buy with real money or coins you earn in the game. Awesome game, especially since it was free. Now that I played it, though I would be willing to pay for it.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This is pretty good, but the fact that you can only use one font and make the text certain sizes kinda sucks.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Excellent work by King, as always. I enjoy reading works by him.  At times there were underlined passages in the text-  not sure why.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I hadn't heard of this book but was bored enough to buy. What a buy! I'm inspired enough to want to get off the couch go for a run and eat grass! What an amazing story and loved all the food advice and recipes. I love his pragmatic scientific explanation for a lot of things, he's a modern hippie. Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really really really really fun and I'm really really really really addicted to this app cause its really really fun and stuff
B00AREIAI8|5.0|An amazing game with amazing graphics. Wonderful game. I absolutely recommend it for anyone of all ages. Especially for kids who have always wanted a horse.
B00009RAJH|4.0|...of a new lineup for an old group.  As it stands, it is an excellent debut for the new lineup.  The only dud IMO os the last track.  They could have left it off and offered it only as a B-side to one of the better songs on the album.  Which is anything from tracks 1-10.  Those songs are very good.  Landslide is clearly my favorite on the entire record.  Needless to say, Rumors was an all around better record.  For that matter, so was TUSK.  But for what it is, this record is worth picking up.  It was their first number one album in the States with three songs that hit the charts.  For the group, it was a landmark album.  They could only go up from here.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I love this movie the singing was wonderful mixed chorus upbeat and up to date songs they sound great from beginning to end everyone should see this movie.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|She is just an amazing artist, another hit album for Taylor swift. It is a more mellow sounding musically album this time but she is getting older and it is for a more mature audience too.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This version of Jane Austin's book is my husbands favorite and I like it, too.  It was in great condition and arrived quickly.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I wife has been listening to het for over 10 years. Have seen her many times in NY and already have tockets for her in MSG in April. The songs were great and this may be on of her best albums.
1451648537|5.0|I haven't read a book this big in a long time. Went on vacation and couldn't put it down. Very interesting read.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I really didn't like this game. Majongg and Solitare are more to my liking.  this was sort of boring. Wouldn't recommend
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This dvd was in great shape and arrived quickly.  My husband and I have both enjoyed it and watched it several times.
B008N1V11U|1.0|Sad to say I paid for THIS! Go to open it then it says I don't own this app! Horrible!!!!
B008ASGP3U|4.0|It' s great to have Rebus back. I missed the Scotland that Rankin portrays in this series. Hopefully, Rebus will return again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is great. Fun, challenging and extremely addicting. There is a major bug though. The &quot;save me&quot; button often makes the app force close. I have lost several gems, points, and coins because of this. The bug is the only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|I loved this show on TV. I also watch season 2. I am going to purchase that DVD too. As always Amazon was quick to deliver and the product was in perfect condition.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Temperature, immediate forecast, and right now radar - what else could you ask for on a little 6\\" cell phone?
B00389XV42|4.0|Chuck is funny, clever, and plain good entertainment.  Sometimes I wonder why he and Sarah don't just tell the truth to each other, but of course that would spoil the drama of it all.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Every once in a while an experience will come to your life that makes you ask, \\"What have I been doing with my life?\\" While it is very unlikely very many of us would gladly sacrifice our personal lives to the extent Ono-sensei has in order to make his vocation his life, he truly embodies the Japanese ethic to always strive to do what you do better every day. I felt ashamed that I've allowed myself to slack off and find myself more committed to mastering my skills.<br />Maybe someday I'll be able to eat at the counter of the sushi master. :)
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This DVD completes our set. We love the action comedy of the movie and I love the way Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are together. Movie was quickly delivered and in perfect condition. I hope they make at least one more of these.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|Bought this for our 7 year old daughter who loves the movie. Recommend it for all children. Teaches them about the environment.
B0090EJ99A|4.0|This is the most politicaly incorrect movie I've seen in ages, I loved it, wish he would do more Ali G movies. I paid for HD and got a very poor SD version.
B004GYY714|5.0|love listening to this on my kindle..comes in clear and better than my home entertainment center and the other radios in the house
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|I don't like Zombie's, but my son-in-law does so this was a present for him. He has season 1 and plans to get season 3. As always the product was in perfect condition and delivered in plenty of time.
B00A0HQ7H8|2.0|Playing the bad girl card.  Hanging out with Axl Rose (she asked if they could party later on and he said yes, yes, yes...) and aspiring to verbal contests with Howard Stern.  Gone are the sharp lyrics and vivid, SPAZZY cadence of \\"Born to Die\\", replaced with mock shock jock chalk talk.  The dearth of heart or soul implies even she will want something better next time.  I will wait and see how she gets there, passing over this album for \\"Born to Die\\" in the meantime.
B002KH4DBI|4.0|This movie is way better than the synopsis described. I would definitely recommend it! Enough funny and serious parts that it can appeal to a crowd.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is loved by everyone in the family.  We enjoy watching it over and over again.  Lots of laughs.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It is very hard to find this DVD. I knew Amazon would be able to help me. I did choose to get a used product, but it is just like new. It was delivered quickly and in perfect shape. I can't wait to watch this one with my grandchildren.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I received all of the DVD's in a timely manner. I love this show and was really happy to be able view all four seasons when it was convenient for me. Thank you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My favorite game is Subway Surfers. I play this game all the time. My favorite part of the game is the bouncing boots. Recommend you download it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie has everything.  It's a musical, a comedy and thoroughly entertaining.  Not necessarily a chick flick, loved by the whole family!
B00006FDCD|5.0|I am a big horror movie fan and passed the love down to my son. When I seen this movie here on Amazon I had to have it and bought one for him too. As always I received wonderful service. Fast delivery, perfect condition. Now both of us have enjoyed having nightmares about killer clowns at least one or two nights.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|excellent production, I would recommend to to anyone.  I study history, so, with only a few alterations it was masterfully done.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|either you love big bang or you dont. . we love it. great having it wo commercials. would order again
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Each character reflects something wise and wistful. The kind of things we may imagine, but would never put into words.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|I don't understand how it works.  It's very pretty and soothing but what does it do?  Please include more of a description.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Not only do the kids love the movie, I think it's one of the best animated movie I've ever seen.  It's nice to be able to rent a video and stream it right away, especially when you need something new to watch and everyone is sick.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didnt think I would ever be interested in this type of series, but I am! The characters and storyline are wriiten exceptionally well. For me, the forst season was a little slow but as it went on I found mysell wanting to watch more and more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super addicting. I'm trying to get the lady from Rio. KEEP PLAYING SUBWAY SURFER FANS! Love it!
B009K6DKTS|5.0|I love this book. A refreshingly different view of the world. I finished it and immediately started reading key chapters again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a free book & I didn't have high hopes but it turned out to be a cute story. Fairly predictable but the characters had good chemistry and were funny. I never did catch how Connor made his fortune but wasn't really all that important. Writer could have expanded on their pasts but again what was there worked. It was a cute short read.
B0043WHRWA|5.0|I was looking for a new series to watch and I stared with the first episode of Season One. I've now caught up to the current episode of Season 5...... in about 2 weeks.<br />While I am doing financial busywork, it is wonderful to have this very interesting series to keep me entertained.
0374275637|3.0|The premise was very attractive to me, and in the beginning I found it interesting.  Then the author began to tell me what he had just told me ... and then again ... and then again.  I began speed reading pages just looking for something new.  I have now set it aside at the halfway point.  Will probably go back, but find Susan Cain's book: QUIET to be much more interesting at this point.<br /><br />Not bad ... just a bit tedious ... or pedantic ... to hold my attention for long periods at a time.
1612680011|5.0|Me abrió los ojos y me hizo ver los errores que cometí en relación con mis finanzas. Es muy importante enseñarle a nuestros hijos la realidad y que sean emprendedores para que tengan libertad financiera.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game because there is more obstacles i like the one huge monkey chasing u<br />i especially like the rope that u can grab all in all its an awesome game u should get it
0446573027|4.0|John Puller, US Army Investigator, turns a West Virginia small coal-mining town upside down to find a killer and discovers a terrorist threat that could overshadow 9/11.  Zero Day is sure to entertain any reader; however, the ending is a bit of a letdown and some of the action leaves some loose ends. Overall, Zero Day succeeds as a suspenseful action-packed novel.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have been having so much fun playing this game with my Daughter-in-Law on my Kindle with this game.  The concept is simple but really makes you think.
0670020745|2.0|Wanted tpo learn more in general about stroke becuase my frined had one. Just this one lady's experience--nothing but her experience.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book never failed with the twists, I could not put  it down!! Slow at first but it was  so worth it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|There are not enough stars to tell you how much I'm loving this book. I am half way through and can't wait to get to the end so I can start reading book #3
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There hasn't been a must watch show come along for me in a long time.  The cast is superb, visuals are amazing, well written, engaging and enjoyable.  Can't wait for season four!
B002VE5472|4.0|I would watch this again surprise ending.  That's place in Hawilli what's not to like.  I recommend this for adults.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's flipping awesome and the world of games revolve around it it's the best ever it's so crazy man sick
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|I enjoyed reading Killer Cupcakes. It was a quick read & I couldn't wait to see if my prediction of the murderer was right. I love reading cookbook mysteries.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|Purchased this as a Christmas present for my wife. Blu-ray was delivered quickly and the item was as described. The version that I purchased included an alternate ending.<br /><br />No cons to list.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is great and all but we need the demo on here for people who can't afford it! Need the demo on here! Need it!_
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game, especially if you like horses, which I do. Great to play with my kids too! We will see how long it continues to entertain us...
B005LAIHPE|5.0|THIS MOVIE HAD GREAT ACTION, A GREAT STORY AND I LOVE TO SEE US DEFEAT ALIENS, FRON ANOTHER PLANET. BILL
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very entertaining, you get emotionally involved with the characters.  My wife and I really look forward to each episode.  It was a period of change for these people and was fascinating to see how they reacted to it.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|My daughters school has a new policy to bring your own device to school each day so the kindle was a logical choice for our family! Easy to use and take care of for a preteen! Case keeps it safe and fits in her backpack easily!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This a really good game I have loved this so much not pooooooooooo pooooooooooo pooooooooooo pooooooooooo pooooooooooo Pandora poem peppermint

0545265355|5.0|I really enjoyed this piece would i would by this again in a heart beat you can not argue with the price
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Whenever other family members are not hogging the bandwidth, I can listen to radio from all over the globe.<br /><br />Radio stations and programs are easy to find in this app.  The streams are very steady and not choppy at all.<br /><br />The perfect app for anyone interested in listening to music, news, or anything else, whether on local or distant radio stations.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Well written, not overly preachy on anything, just an overall great story.  Really came together nicely at the end as well.
1439102813|5.0|This book was excellent reading.  It was in very good condition and the subject matter was very helpful.  Thanks so much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my all time favorite app on any device!!!! It  is so fun!!!!!!!!/ everyone any age needs this app right now
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|There are so many free books available, via this app.<br /><br />If you run out of memory on your Kindle, at least Amazon is storing your entire library on their servers.  So, you can delete books from your Kindle and download them, again, when it is time to read them.<br /><br />Any voracious reader, on a tight budget, should have this app.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My husband and daughter are obsessed with this game. Easy to understand and fun!  Descant graphics and fun upgrades to win.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good book(s) - highly recomended.<br /><br />The writting style is excelent and the story is great.<br /><br />Look forward to the sequal
B007THA4FI|2.0|Just could not keep my interest up.  There was not much adventure or suspense until the very end, which is where the story should have started.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best mine craft game ever I garentee you will get addicted just like I am.It is just a must by game if you like minecraft.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Action, adventure, what more could you ask for?! A family favorite, one we've watched more than four or five times.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|The album is short and fast (the way a good punk album should be)  I think one of the best Bad Religion Albums.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Always writes of life experiences although they were not her own experiences.  She has a way of putting you in the story and making you feel like you are there.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this is a great game it sometimes works and is great for all ages. if u luv horses here is a great option.
B00417HV14|5.0|I've been a big fan of Joe's for a long time. This DVD just shows how great he is. I believe he is the greatest guitarist ever. If you don't know who Joe Bonamassa is buy this DVD and you'll be hooked on his music!
B00846REIS|3.0|Interesting, hard to put down, and quick read. If you enjoyed 50 Shades you will like this book. Try it!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good story line, held the suspense from chapter 4 to the end.  The first few chapters were filled with military setup - I didn't think we all needed to be educated that much.  After getting into the real story It flowed with suspense and never gave up the true &#34;who done it&#34; until the end.
0446554995|5.0|Keep the good stuff coming guys! Great read, i couldn't put it down once i started reading. Preston/Childs nailed it again!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I use this CD to provide a mood setting for the beginning of my ESL classes. My students love it and have even looked for it on YouTube. One of my students went so far as to buy one of their albums. They are great musicians using current and classical music.
B0057VDGNK|3.0|The first 4 songs are really great<br />The others are essentially the same type of rythm, under marginally different musical arrangements, hence not very good value for the money
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It rocks never really played the 1st one but I been playing non stop since I downloaded it :):):) :)
B00177YA1K|5.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a great pair.  The play well off each other.  The aliens are well done. Love this movie!!  It's funny as hell!!
B008476HBM|5.0|In the Pride and prejudice era, a woman's means of survival and finances was determined by the men in her life-first her father and then Her husband.  This is the story of the five Bennett sisters and their quest for suitable husbands.  Their felicity in life depends on overcoming pride and prejudice to follow their heart in matters of matrimony.  This was a fun story that left me longing for social norms of yesteryear.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|The book chapters are very uneven in terms of content and the writing is not that of a litterary scholar.<br />Yeat, each chapter offers an experiement with a situatino of the lofe of Feynman and the author describes his search for new feelings and the ability to learn from them in a very eloquent manner.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I did like the style of the story but the subject was not what I expected.<br />The story was very graphic about the abuse that has occurred by members of the Catholic Church on orphaned children in Ireland. Heartbreaking and disturbing. The ending was a relief for the main character and for me.<br />The book as well written and if the authors intention was to bring mankind's inhumanity to man to the fore, she did an excellent job.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|NOT kid appropriate! Way to much death in this movie for the little ones. Bad story line and voice acting as well!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the most addicting and greatest game that I have played. I've had a lot of fun trying to run as far as I can while collecting coins.
B008PCVGKI|2.0|The book is a dangerously misleading collection of anecdotal cases presented with the looks of a scientific analysis.<br />The author accuses the entire world of hllathcare of cheating, from the pharma companies to the authorities, and also to the payers and health insurers as well as to the physicians!<br />And at the same time, the author portrays himself as the white knight who has understood the whole plot and offers the only viable solutions...<br />In short, Goldacre needs help from a team of psychiatrists...
0920668372|5.0|I remember reading this book when I was little. I can't remember exactly how it went. But I remember it made me want a cry and that I liked this book.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I loved the movie as well, and one thing good about this CD, is that it actually has music taken from the movie.  Sometimes I buy a soundtrack CD and am disappointed because the music I'm looking for is not included.  However, this is not the case with this CD - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|The story is fantastic but I didn't feel like I ever got to really learn who the main characters were.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game. I love the fast pace and animation. Great variety of screens and obstacles.  I like that you earn boosters instead of having to buy them.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Spartacus: Vengeance picks up after the escape of the Gladiators of Batiatus, led by Spartacus himself. The band of outlaws now hides underground and strikes fear into the hearts of Capua's citizens. Gaius Glaber and his troops are sent to quell the rebellion. With such a powerful enemy, Spartacus and his men will need some luck, cunning, and the help of some unlikely allies. The epic story continues. The blood flows, and the passion burns hotter than ever in the 3rd season of Spartacus.<br /><br />This series is nothing less than incredible. As most of us know, Andy Whitfield passed away not so long ago. It was his unforgettable performance that launched this series. his absence is why this season deserves 4 stars. It lacks a powerful lead character, but boasts a superb supporting cast. Even without his unparallelled performance, Spartacus still remains a spectacle. The reasons for this are a strong supporting cast, and an engrossing story. The new Spartacus is a shadow of Andy Whitfield, he lacks the passion and charisma that his predecessor displayed. This show remains as powerful as a freight train with no brakes. Propelled by the fire that Andy Whitfield started not so many years ago. If you enjoyed the other 2 season, you will probably find Vengeance to be exciting as well. Don't miss Spartacus season 3.
1592402690|5.0|Feel like I know how the lads really were. Like being there in the studio with the Beatles.  Geoff was a big part of the BEatles sound that's for sure.
B009MO5960|5.0|Wow, just when you think it might be over - another &#34;Off the Hook&#34; release is set into play!!  I hope they keep going.  This series is a definite buy for your library, especially if if like scify and the undead.  Very impressive.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|The game had great reviews, but boy where we disappointed.  It doesn't work.  It's frozen on the main page and no matter how many times we reinstall it just doesn't want to work.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I rely on this daily. It is a reliable way to keep up with the status of your device. I highly recommend it.  JRWilliams
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|My teens and I enjoyed the movie.  It's got a lot of strange things in it that can lead to some good family conversations.
B009B8YZKS|2.0|Not quite a &#34;zero&#34;, but pretty close.  I had read many reviews and media press about the Halo 4 movie and the trailer was awesome.  But this short film by Microsoft was lacking.  Perhaps if they release another episode they will do better as far as content goes.  The graphics were cool, but again lacking and there is so much potential with making this great.  I was just disappointed.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|Everything too small to see and if you touch screen to make bigger you get penalized.Horrible. Will be uninstalling it soon. Can't see anything at the size items address
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best I played minecraft in the pc and its cool to get minecraft pocket edition you still play minecraft when traveling I give this 5 stars
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Lose the notebook now!!  Write it down in Evernote and it will always be there.  This little app has influenced my personal goals, to-do list, family menu, book notes, blog, podcast, business, and more.  Get your brain organized here!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I have watched it now a good 5-8 times and am still finding something I missed before.  I know the movie did not do as well as Disney had expected for the amount of time and money they invested, but I sure hope they make another one!!  I believe this was supposed to be 1 of 3 movies about JCM.  This is a must have for your movie library.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Love the daily bible verse. You can choose a reading plan to your liking. A great way to get my bible reading done.<br />Recommend tp evryone.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|Slow at first but then turns mind blowing. It keeps you guessing all the way to the end! A must have thriller
B003O86FMW|5.0|A riveting continuation of the first book.  Couldn't be more happy with this series.  Can't wait to read the next book.  Well written and a great quick read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|i am not a prude, but could have done without all the foul language throughout the book. main character pretends to be dead at the hands of her husband . they are reunited and resume their relationship at some level. did not like the ending.  will probably not read any additional books by this author.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|If you have spare time, go ahead and watch this movie. The characters are cool! I liked Selma Hayek very much.
B0098460O4|5.0|I never tire of listening to their preformances on Britain's Got Talent.  I have shared their music and story with as many people as possible.  I am so happy to be albe to support their music by purchasing their CD.  Can't wait for the next.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Insightful and eye opening - this is the work of a razor sharp intellect that makes his point through clear reasoning and a little bit of humor.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|Best Helloween Album since the Kiske era.I have never been a huge fan of Andi Deris's voice but have finally been won over with this effort.I would rate this CD up there with Keeper 1 & 2.Highly recommend you buy this if ever you were a fan of the band.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Not good. It is not funny anymore and there is not much point watching these series-movies!!!<br />They need to stop.
B000002UZ1|5.0|The most complete Beatles collection - at a very reasonable price!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I needed two of these for use with my Kindle Fire 8.9 HD's.  The price was right and my experience with Amazon basics has been good.  This is another example of a good quality amazon basics item.<br /><br />I think the price is a little high.  The so called Amazon basics minimal packaging was frankly a joke.  The cardboard box each came in could hold four of these little stylus.<br /><br />Are they any better than others?  Not really.  They seem to function just as well as the stylus that amazon pushes when you buy a Fire.<br /><br />The reason I give this 5 stars is due to the fact that the tip on the bottom is actually smaller in diameter than my other stylus.  I am finding this works better for me when using an app or in the app store etc.......<br /><br />A good choice.  A cut above the competitors.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it all!! Espiacially how when you play some of it there is a mine place where you ride in a mine cart. it is so much fun
B009FZFONO|5.0|It's a great show, the down loading was a little slow and I had to learn delete them after watching but that's just learning to use the kindle.
030758836X|1.0|I thought for a moment I was enjoying this book and I read it to the end.  The ending makes me regret that I wasted time reading it.  Don't waste your time reading this; you will be upset w/your lost time.  She should have done a better job w/the ending and the book was getting a bit ridiculous, although, sadly I kept reading, hoping it would improve, which it never did.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|While watching this movie, the first thought that came to mind was, \\"Do we even value the human life?\\"<br /><br />The movie is about an extreme entertainment called Hunger Games for the rich people at the \\"Capitol\\". The Hunger Games is about each individual survival by brutally killing 23 other opponents.<br /><br />I found no value on this killing game other than just to satisfy people's ego or desires. In many way our society has became the Hunger Games itself without us realizing that we too participate in it. People in our society become very selfish and willing to do anything good and bad to others as ling as that would help us to win, moving up on the rank.<br /><br />It is never OK to kill people and this movie certainly do not live this value.<br /><br />Good lessons that is important in life such as selfless attitude from Katniss by volunteering herself in exchange of her sister, teamwork between Katniss and Peeta were minimally shown in the movie. Good values and lessons of life were definetely not the center story of this movie.<br /><br />I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially to young people. There are many better choice of film out there that can inspire your life, lifted up your spirit, and giving life lessons that can be used in real life.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Some writers just lose their groove, this effort is proof.  Two chapters into this tedious work, especially Corey's wisecracking, had me ready to wave the white flag on this one. How can this be the same guy that wrote The Goldcoast?  May be time for Nelson to move that chair onto the porch and just chill.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|its all about sharing what's you're favorite animals and shows you how to take care of a pet I think they are cute I have a lot of littlest pet shops I love animals thank you for reading my review
B00873GRU4|3.0|Engaging enough, if a tad slow...<br />Unsure why it was called a trillogy, perhaps the author released this originally as three separate books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't normally like theologies. I'm usually bored by the time the third book comes around. I didn't want it to end. I really like this set. Very entertaining  with every emotion and made feel like I was there.
B0015AARJI|4.0|These are just as advertised.  So if you need another one, go for it.  Not much else to say, it is what it is.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun app but beware of how much things can cost if you choose to buy. OTHER THEN THAT ITS GOOD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO EPICLY SWAG MY FACE EXLODED INTO CHEESE CUBES WHICH EXPLODE INTO BACON WHICH EXPLODES INTO MANATEES
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Enjoyed this novel very much and highly recommend it.  If you like Rankin you will like this one particularly, involving plot and well written.  Characters well drawn and real.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you want an authentic box set, Amazon is the place to go.<br /><br />There are plenty of fake, unauthorized versions of this product.<br /><br />But if you want the real deal, this is it. Amazon stands by their buyers,<br />and that (and this) is as good as it gets. Forgot what I paid for it,<br />but my daughter's boyfriend (now ex boyfriend) enjoyed the product.<br /><br />On second thought, maybe I should've opted for the boot-legged version.<br /><br />Haha
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty sweet. Way better than temple run. It keeps me busy for hours I have it on galaxy s3 and kindle fir [...]
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My Bruce loves this game. A lot of fun and I can play with her without getting bored myself. You don't have to pay in order to make the game more fun either.
B000SW4DH6|5.0|Have seen this move multiple times and it still is great. Love story in a way like never before.  Must see!
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Fantastic quality movie. Syrupy, sure. However, in the world of love stories, there has to be standards. This is it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Awesome game! So much fun! Play it all the time, love that the scenery changes skip the time, very addicting!!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|The writer has a gift for sensory detail, and the setting was engaging and three dimensional. The level of detail at times made me skim ahead to get to the action, but it was still a pleasant read, even at its slowest. Most of the time, I felt I was in the hands of an experienced story-teller.<br /><br />Lena can't wait for her procedure--scheduled on her upcoming 18th birthday--so she will no longer fear contracting the dreaded deliria nervosa disease, known by its common name, Love. In a dystopian future, the disease has been outlawed because it's the source of too many deadly emotions. Lena is desperate for the procedure because she believes the disease is responsible for the deaths of her father, mother and cousin. The high concept is fresh and well done.<br /><br />The pace though slow, is saved by a 'clicking timebomb' authorial device: the MC is counting the days until her procedure, and this builds a sense of anticipation which gradually changes to dread as she realizes she has contracted deliria nervosa from Alex, a boy who has not had the procedure.<br /><br />He is a likeable fellow, but not enough info is woven into the story to flesh out his personality and history, which renders him more of a prop than a living person. Hana, the MC's best friend, is well done and her struggle against authority is balanced and believable.<br /><br />SPOILER: Predictably, Alex informs Lena that her mother is not dead, but being held in the Crypts with other political prisoners who don't want to give up love. A daring rescue attempt brings Alex and Lena into a dangerous confrontation with the authorities, ending with a dramatic chase scene that leaves the story threads pleasantly hanging for a sequel.<br /><br />TEEN GUIDE:<br />some kissing<br />no sex<br />no profanity<br />mild atheism (religion has been eradicated, along with war, as an adjunct of love)<br />Themes: caring for friends; family loyalty; question authority
B0053O8AQE|5.0|This is wonderfully funny. Great writing and great acting. Max and Caroline have such a chemistry together. Two different life experiences and two different outlooks. Roll on the floor laughing funny when these two worlds collide.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't get enough of this show!! I can't wait for more I feel lost without watching this  :) A person can really relate to all the people in this show!!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|All your favorite action stars in one flick! Even Chuck Norris makes a cameo. If you liked the 1st Expendables you will like this movie. Explosions, fight scenes...just a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I found it quite entertaining, the plot was good, plenty of action and Anne Hathaway... well she looked really hot,. In the beginning I did not understand the need for Bane to have the face mask; however it is explained later in the movie.
B004H4XI5O|3.0|1. This book is about two things: anecdotes of the author while learning to improve his memory, and a general introduction about the kind of people who use these methods to participate in memory contests, and other small details.<br /><br />2. This book is not: a detailed description or an user's guide of how to use the memory tricks mentioned in the book.<br /><br />3. It is well written, he is a very good journalist. It resembles more a novel than a text book. I devoured the book (if he writes a novel, I will be the first one to read it). But it did not fulfilled my expectations. I should have read before the negative reviews here, because they are true.<br /><br />4. The Kindle version (as with other books) is poor. I would like to have more active links to footnotes while I am reading.<br /><br />5. Conclusion:<br />  a) If you want to read five books about this kind of techniques (or if you just want to read it as a light novel), this can be the first one and you will be delighted.<br />  b) If you really want to memorize an entire encyclopedia and learn how to do it just by reading one book, don't read this one. In another review there is a list of other books, which I haven't read.<br />  c) Before I read Kevin Vost's book, which is good and more practical, but not very deep (I know he is preparing a second one).<br /><br />----<br />{once you read the book, you will find the title interesting, otherwise it doesn't make sense}
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Wow...how misleading...I did not know the target audience was for teens. I read the book all the way through to finish, because I didn't want to waste the money I had spent. I wish I could have my money back... Lot's of repetitive texts and poor choices of words. It was overly dramatic and unrealistic. Everything written in this novel was just unintelligible and dumbed down... Although there was a huge surprise twist, I felt like the story was more concerned with sexual behaviors...and the repetitive use of the phrase: \\"...want to lick his dimples\\". I agree with the other one star reviewers...this was just another teen angst book about boys, sex and redundantly overwhelmed with unrealistic dramas.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read all of Grisham's books and liked this one very much.  He will go down as one of America's great story tellers.  He does his homework and you can quickly get intyo this book.  Loved it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it because of the themes it really is awesome I'll tell you that its just like temple run!:)-Ethan
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I picked this up at my local library on a whim seeing it was a PBS Masterpiece Theater presentation, not being familiar with the story at all. I loved it! I had a melancholy hangover for a month afterwards craving more and re watching this over and over again! The chemistry between Ruth Wilson (Jane) and Toby Stephens (Rochester) is charming. Now Jane Eyre is one of my favorite stories. Now having read the book, the new retelling and watched all the movies, however this telling still remains my favorite.
B005LAII80|5.0|Best movie i've seen since Predator. No nonsense, high intensity action. I loved the original Judge Dredd comics and there are many stories which would make a great movie sequel. I hope they follow through with it because Karl Urban really captured the character of Dredd and can only improve on it.
B000FC13MM|5.0|This book is well thought out, creative, and kept me wanting to read more. I had to force myself to put it down. The author reveals small amounts of information to keep the reader reading.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Excellent suspense & storyline.  Looking forward to reading the next book in the series.  Slow at first but quickly picked up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|es mug interesante formar familiar de animales que son de ls epoca prehistorica. el problemat es que a veces se pone un poco aburrido porque hay que esperar mucho.

B000FC10IO|5.0|This continuation further builds your attachment to the heroes and continues drawing you in as Sabriel did.  The book  keep your desire to want to read more.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Well written, touching, exciting! The characters are wonderful and August gives life lessons without being boring. Everyone should read it! Great for who wants to improve inglish skills too!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Was a good read.  However, seemed a little simplified after the first two books.  If you have read the first two then it is nice to read the last book to have the closure.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This game stinks. It is VERY  boring. I am deleting this game as soon as possible. And as my rating says, I HATE IT.
B000FC12L4|4.0|Lirael kept your attention to the very end just as Sabriel and Abhorsen did. It would have been rated 5 stars but I felt the end was weak and kind of ending abruptly.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Awesome read.  Its' real but delivered with a laugh out loud sense of humor.  Good insight to how amazing our military guys really are.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Would have given it five stars except for  I had to deleate from my kindal after reaching level four times and re buy and start over at level one loosing all my achievements to that point.....so fat I'm at level five and seems to be working fine this time...like I said a great ride almost like a fast car chase....addictive to race against yourself.

B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The storyline was a bit confusing but very creative. Joseph Gordon Levitt's makeup intended to have him look like a young Bruce Willis but was a bit odd to watch!
B00000I0XW|5.0|I absolutely love Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.  It truly speaks to the heart.  I never tire of listening to 'Phantom of the Opera.'

0786955570|5.0|My family and friends have had a blast playing this game and I would highly recommend it. The first time takes some figuring out but after that the game is pretty easy to setup and play. We particularly liked the cooperative nature of the game since everyone works together to complete the story and wins or losses together.<br /><br />Coming from a DnD background, it's clear where they took elements from the rules and where they simplified things such as attack and damage for a board game.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I find it totally amazing that a talent such as Susan's was not discovered sooner.  I will watch for the release of more of her albums.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Absolutely loved the approach to this topic. Original, enchanting, surprising and overall a great depiction of how lives were led in other times.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found the author's experience enlightening.  Now, I truly feel that when my life ends here on earth, I will have a life as spirit and will be with those who have passed who I love.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's an amazing book about romance and struggles, but in the end, it was wonderful and very enjoying to read.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Brought back memories of going out with my late husband for an evening of listening to some really good blues.  Enjoyed it!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Me and my brother love this game.The last time we were playing we were trying to get Tony but it was so hard to get him.But we have a great time playing.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Fun for a game here or there or for an extended session. Only problem is the game repeats itself too often.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Wow. I just clicked on the movie as I wanted something different. I got it. I got it. i got it.<br /><br />This movie is just a breath of fresh air. It really is.<br /><br />Pictures, the cameraman - amazing. Very smooth.<br /><br />Tention: is constant, also building up,  not in a usual action-movie kind of way.<br /><br />There are surreal episodes that just do not cross the unbelievable/incredible line, but take you to a nice ride of reality/action/comics.<br /><br />The 'lessons\\"  of the move are obvious, but the presentation is very balanced.<br /><br />I loooooved the length. Not too long, not too short. I am really fed up with 2,5-3 hours long movies. If you wanna say something, you can say it 1,5 hours.<br /><br />This was one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. Very very very entertaining.
B004EPZ070|5.0|great item  why should I be required to say more than I feel is needed to say what I said?
B00992CF6W|5.0|The new update for minecraft pocket edition is great! There are new items you can use and the animals can now breed and be made in different colors. It is much better than the old version. But this was on my iPod. I also have the kindle fire but there was no update for that but still AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For both!!!! They should have an update for Kindle Fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great app to spend time on. I had a great experience with it it was very exciting to make a new score, get prizes and coins. I would recommend this app to anyone with spare time from at a party to on the toilet.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|But great, this move had everything in it to make you laugh, cry, give at a boy's. I hope they make a follow up on this movie.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved  this book  very  much  because it is very funny and fun.  I love all  the movies so much
B000QCS8TW|4.0|To be honest I was never a big reader of fantasy/science fiction books. Game of Thrones grabs your attention and has the right balance between the scenario description and the evolution of the story by itself.<br /><br />Very entertaining but I would recommend to start reading in a moment that you can quickly go through the first 150-200 pages so that you can have a very good start, after that you have the full picture of the book and its characters and for sure will enjoy!!!!!!
0765325950|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. The heroes were never given an easy pass. Shai'tan's forces working fervoursly to debilatate the Dragon's army. The Final Battle chapter, which went on forever it seemed, was my favourite part of the novel. So much action and moments where I wondered if something unexpected would happen. The ending did leave me a bit puzzled in one regard, but overall it fit the world that Robert Jordan had created. Excellent work by Brandon Sanderson bringing Jordan's work to an end, including the other two entries.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|the girl in this story did a stupid thing by going to a remote location by herself<br />but still did not deserve the treatment she got especially from a sheriff! Her<br />acts of vengeance were satisfying and well executed and called for.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This suspenseful book keeps your eyes glued to every page! The triangle betwen peeta, katniss, & gale continues to make readers heart ache for a happy ending...but u will have to read it to find out!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Could be a little more responsive to player moves, but it is fun. Would also be better if customer's didn't have to play as hard to collect coins.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This works great!!!  I like that it charges fast and I can plug it into a wall outlet or a USB port.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Wonderful story with fascinating characters.  Stephen King is expert at keeping the story compelling.  I could picture the early 60's with his expert descriptions.
1600595871|4.0|I have other book making texts that I enjoy for inspiration, but this is the most useful book I've purchased. It is full of historical perspective, has good illustrations of the construction process and shows useful photos of example projects. All of the projects are appropriate for varying levels of skills and few specialty tools are necessary. I would recommend this book for everyone from rank beginner to proficient bookbinder. I do not have the previous titles by this author but I would point out that another reviewer has noted that this is a compilation of previous projects. If so, and you don't have the other titles, save your money and buy this one. You won't be disappointed.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|This album, its box and its contents are simply amazing.. a must have for any kamelot fan. Roy Khan is a god... but Tommy is a jesus!

0061784788|5.0|This book was such a good book...I totally enjoy James Rollins and his Sigma Force gang of characters.  I would highly recommend this novel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A great game to play when you are bored. Gave it four stars as it does have a lot of in-game buying but that is to be expected these days.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|When u play multiplayer ur money goes away when u leave the match. I love this game but that is SOOOO annoying that I rated this game 3 stars.

0345525558|5.0|Victoria Jones knows that she is unloved because she is unlovable, and she believes that she deserves to have been bounced from foster home to foster home, never wanted, never kept. Hurt them before they hurt you, hate them because they are going to hate you. She knows better than to let anyone get close.<br /><br />Elizabeth, someone too much like Victoria, gives Victoria her last chance to have a real home because at age ten, Victoria will be officially \\"unadoptable\\" and will spend her days in a group home until her emancipation at eighteen. Flowers and their meanings are her only comfort. At least there is stability there. A yellow rose always means the same thing. A rose is a rose is a rose.<br /><br />Beautifully written, this story is full of symbolism other than the obvious symbolism of the Victorian language of flowers. The characters became real and I wanted so much for prickly Victoria to find some happiness somewhere. Alternating between Victoria as a child and Victoria as a newly emancipated and completely unprepared adult, the story slowly reveals its secrets and the grievances that cause so much heartbreak. It will not be rushed.<br /><br />\\"I began to imagine a sphere surrounding my heart, as hard and polished as the surface of a hazelnut, impenetrable.\\"<br /><br />\\"I almost laughed, the idea was so absurd. But I knew if I laughed I would start to cry and if I started to cry, I might never stop. Instead, I piled the red carnations on the bench.\\"<br /><br />The author, a mom and a foster mom, knows the shortcomings of our foster care system and how unprepared are the children who are expected to automatically become full-functioning adults on their eighteenth birthdays. She wants to change that, develop some safety nets for these children who drew the short stick. Her compassion and love shows through in her writing. I love this book.<br /><br />Thank you to Random House and LT for giving me an advance reader's edition of this book. The quotes may have changed in the finished edition.changed in the finished edition.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive but gets quite boring after a while. I would Yuri of really recommend it though<br />Love from some poo
B008MF3OEY|5.0|This cover is really cute and looks just like a book!  It fits the Kindle very well and my daughter loves it!
B001CDWFPC|1.0|I bought this with high expectations that it would be easy to use and read anywhere, I was very disappointed that was not the case.<br />I could not navigate around it very well, you could not look up certain passages very easy, I deleted from my device within a week.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br />The songs and magic and pirates and crocodiles are as vivid and lush as you remembered. . .  But Tinkerbell is a sociopathic ex-girlfriend, the &#34;red man&#34; scenes are gut-cringingly racist and dated, and did I mention Tink is f*&^(&% crazy?!?<br /><br />The kids don't seem to see those parts so much - but it's weird to watch as an adult. . .  Enjoy!
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|A good tower defense game.  Wish it had been continuous instead of stopping between each round.  Lots of towers but the bad guys are only balloons which is kind of weak
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire, downloads fast and saves me time in the morning. Everyone should have this app!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have very much enjoyed Hopeless.  It kept me<br />wanting more after each chapter. I had bought my Kindle<br />as I really wasn't a reader and the kindle made a reader<br />really fast.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wonderful book.  REALLY enjoyed this one.  One of King's best as far as I'm concerned.  It actually makes you think.  Loved the characters in this book.  Very good.

B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Awesome book ever I loved it it was cool no won will freeze to Rowley had to eat wrotton cheese
0440241413|4.0|I just finished this book. I hadn't picked a book to read in a looong time. I came across this book in a \\"mom swapping\\" event. I thought I could give it a try. I finished it in a few hours. It's very easy to read.<br /><br />I could relate to Becky because I have a shopping addiction too, although not to the point of debt. The first third of the book felt a bit redundant and expected but it picked up better towards the middle and end.<br /><br />It's very enjoyable. And, I agree with a previous reviewer: Luke is pretty likeable. :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 was momentous and just plain fantastic.  It is too bad the actors don't realize how good they've got it and decide to quit at the height of the show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome but 0.6.0 is still not out for the Kindle Fire  Dose anyone now when it comes out
B006AZZPCM|2.0|At first I loved this app, but after about a week it started clutching almost every other time I'd open it up. Videos wouldn't play, pages wouldn't load, and half the time it would just stop responding. This is the sixth our seventh time I've released it onto my kindle and an about ready to give up..
B0085RQLXK|5.0|In this review I want you to have some fun & play producer....you are with the band, and you have to tell them which songs are gonna be on the record and how long they should be etc. After listening to it for 3 months....not just once, I have made my own version of MFAD with some edits, and rearranged track order. You can't judge a song or an album by listening too it once. Parts of it grow on you, parts you liked become boring. I feel one should listen to each song at least 5 times before making a judgement.<br /><br />This is how I review any album of any artist 1.) Drums & bass, 2.) Guitars, 3.) Vocals and Lyrics 4.) Keyboards, Harmonica, other misc parts 5.) the song as a whole<br /><br />3 out of 5 have to be good for me to call it a good song, and at least 4 out of 5 for a hit.......some songs have cool parts like Something's intro, but then fall apart after the first minute. It is the job of the producer to make those hard calls, and the have the band not like them, to help create the best product.<br /><br />When you watch the making of pump movie the guys are talking about the agonizing the process of \\"picking which babies are gonna grow up...and which ones aren't.\\" Bruce Fairburn who produced the trilogy of comeback albums was a master of picking which songs would be universally liked.<br /><br />If you are too close to something it is tough to let it go. Jack Dogulas is a great producer, however I wonder if he is too close to the band...and unable to say no. Some songs need to be shorter, or some songs should have been left of the US release and reserved for Bonus tracks etc. 3 of the 5 bonus tracks should have been on the main album....and at least 3 of the songs on the album should have been Extras.<br /><br />In a day where the album no longer matters, it is easy for a band to put everyhting out there because the fans are gonna buy the songs they want anyway.<br /><br />Another factor is media length.... the 70's were vinyl a little more than 20 minutes each side. 80's were about Cassettes, around 30 minutes a side. And the 90's were CD's about 40 minutes per side (I know there isn't sides, but in keeping with the previous two mediums)....there is no restriction in today's digital world....but the art of boiling something into a certain time frame is tough, but fun.<br /><br />So to me an album should be about 1 hour long...one can listen to the whold thing on their lunch break. It is about 20 minutes longer than what an artist could use in the 60/70's. 80 minutes allows things to get too bloated.<br /><br />A good surgeon knows when to say yes this is a good idea, or no this isn't.....a producer is like a surgeon...carefully cutting and fixing the album to be it's best. Here is my version of MFAD, which to me is actually a great album.....I hope it can be turned around in the public/fans eyes....there is so much hatred towards this album, and most of it is unwarrented.<br /><br />01.) Street Jesus (6:43) - great opener, I can see the curtain on the stage dropping right when the song takes off. With this song as opener the boys have me listening, where in the original tracks listing the first 4 songs were okay but ther is nothing that gets you going like this song.<br />02.) Some Of Your Love (Oh Yeah) (3:41) - I had no idea what Oh Yeah was about by looking at title, but add a few words to title and you know right away<br />03.) Tell Me (3:45) - Good mid paced song, kind of filler, but I like that the boys are trying a different vibe, chorus is haunting, stays with you.<br />04.) Lover A lot (3:35)- balls out rocker<br />05.) Freedom Fighter (3:19)- Decent Joe Perry song<br />06.) What could have love (3:44)- Typical power ballad, but a good one<br />07.) Shakey Ground (4:35)- Best song out of the sessions, in the middle of the album, forces you to listen to the other songs to get to it. if you listen from start to finish that is....most people can't seem to do this anymore.<br />That would be side one on a cassette 29:20 Long<br /><br />08.) Legendary child (4:13)- Good song, a little too over produced, but good start to side two<br />09.) Luv XXX (Intro cut out) (4:20) big drums, good deep track, not a hit<br />10.) Can't stop lovin you (4:04)- i don't love this song, but with it being released as a single it has to be on the album. I would put we all fall down instead and left this as a true single for the country charts.<br />11.) Out go the lights (4:13) - last 2 mintues cut, great song but drags on at end.<br />12.) Oasis in the night - Joe perry's best Johnny cash \\"Hurt\\" Moment, i can see this in a movie scene, a guy in a room smoking a cigarette, all alone, missing his woman....i've been there when i have traveled for work, and my wife and kid are at home.<br />13.) I'm Not Talkin' - Some would say you can't have two covers on an album, but this kicks too much a** to only be available in Japan<br />14.) Another last goodbye (5:23) outro cut - Seems the boys like to end albums with a slow piano number......two of Aerosmith best albums Toys and Rocks end with piano ballads<br />Side Two 29:33<br /><br />There is a well balanced album, fits on a cassette, can listen to it on lunch, or your drive to work. and the songs flow together well. Having time constraints forces you to make tough calls, but tough calls can be great decisions.<br /><br />What is you version?<br /><br />The extra tracks would be - released on special editions, or internationally<br />Beautiful<br />we all fall down<br />closer<br />sunny side of love<br />something<br />up on the mountain

B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game Subway Surfers is an amazing game. My whole family plays it. It is a game that any one can play.
B0063GORYU|3.0|This is an intriguing game but I need better instructions to play it comfortably.  It definitely caught my attention though.
B004J73WZ0|2.0|First, let me say that I love the Mahler symphonies, and I thought initially that this set might be an inexpensive means to completing my recorded collection of the Mahler symphony, including &#34;Das Lied von der Erde.&#34;  As I had recordings of Symphonies 1 - 4 and 6, I started listening with Symphony No. 5.  It would a gross understatement to say that I was sorely disappointed. This one was so bad, it was painful.  Most or perhaps all the others are better, but not one of them is good.  Given the quality of the recordings, or lack of it, it is difficuilt to fairly evaluate the performances.  Nevertyhelessw, I felt that the performance of &#34;Das Lied von der Erde&#34; seemed particularly disappointing, but again the problem may well have been the recording.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I remember reading this book when it first made it into paperback.  I was completely hooked and forgot to eat, drink, or sleep for the entire time it took to read--and it's a long read.  On re-reading this time, it was almost as good, although I don't think it can ever get the juices flowing the way it did the first time.  This book may not ever make it into the pantheon of the greats, but it is possibly the best no-kidding read I've ever had.  Only &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34; equalled it in un-put-downableness.  I always recommend it to people who don't read (really, I meet these strange creatures all the time), as an intro to how wonderful reading can be.  One day, I shall make a convert.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Yo  this game is fresh by the way play all day yo running a way that's classic by keep playing
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love this soundtrack!! Its exactly like the movie! This soundtrack has lived up to my expectations BY FAR! One of my best investments BY FAR!!
B003B02O14|5.0|I have never been disappointed by John Grisham. The Partner is no exception. If you like well thought out plots and interesting characters, you will enjoy any John Grisham book.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This book was my introduction to a new character and author.  John Corey is a funny irreverent and smart character.  Good plot and interesting siting.  Interesting that I would find this book in a week where the same area is in the news for al queda attacks and botched rescues.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|I read the the 'Watchmen' graphic novel years ago and enjoyed it tremendously. This movie (all 3+ hours of it) brought me right back. Lots of violence, lots of disturbing behavior, and lots of full-frontal cgi male nudity. I've plenty of long movies and they usually have a scene or two that seem to drag on. This movie, however, never left me checking my watch through the whole thing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was the first time I have used the Prime. It was a free trial and now I am a lifer. This show is amazing. Watched both seasons back to back. Love...love....love it.
034580404X|5.0|I have heard so much good reviews about these books so wanted to read them at first it was really good
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Robert Lanza does a tremendous job of blending biographical background with a presentation of a revolutionary view of the universe that is about to stand traditional science on its head.  Dr. Lanza is a scientist of the first order and a very engaging writer.  Don't miss this book!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|We are big fans of the original 'Frankenweenie' short film Tim Burton made years ago and this if faithful to its source material while expanding significantly upon it. It's funny and touching with lots of winks and nods to horror classics like 'The Wolf Man' and 'Frankenstein' and more. We had recently lost one of our beloved pets to illness and after the movie ended, my 7 year old was inconsolable. Just so you know, you might want to prepare to at least answer a few questions from your kids - and have a few tissues handy.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|It was very neatly packaged and it came just as it was described. There were no scratches and no flaws. I'm very happy with my order.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This movie is a reminder of how great rock n roll is...Watch it and you wont be disappointed.. I loved this movie,,,
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I remember dancing my first son to sleep to this album when he was going through colic.  It is a tragedy that Michael, as talented as he was, became a victim of his own success and idolation.

1451695195|5.0|One of the better books I have read on OBE. The book is well written, holds your interest and beliveable.
B00APACSJG|5.0|This is THE best book I have read all year.  It was fast and hard hitting.  I was, however, completely blind-sided by the ending; did not see that coming.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|I am only about half way through the book, but Naomi Klein's explanations as &#34;Disaster Capitalism&#34; and what happen to many countries around the world and its effects on the middle class of those countries I'm afraid is coming to roost now in our country. The parallels are very painful to imagine.  I am still a firm believer in democracy but Milton Friedman's &#34;Chicago Schools&#34; definition of the &#34;free market, unbridled capitalism&#34; is primarily beneficial for a very few &#34;winners&#34; in the system and causes even further pain and suffering, deterioration in financial well-being for the masses.  This is not my idea of what democracy should bring or what America should be.  We, the electorate, need this explained to us in &#34;sound bytes&#34; that the far right has utilized so well to manipulate the minds of the masses.  I strongly recommend that you read this book if you care about the future of our nation and our world.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|Fantastic full length redo of The Tim Burton short film from years back. Ironic that Disney intitally passed on it but years later agreed to make it. WARNING - there are some intense scenes in this movie not for the younger crowds. I'd say PG-13 is much better/
B009E9QOEO|4.0|Not  the best recordings. We are aging fast. May be able to still play but the voice is going. My grandkids loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hard to stop. I play every day. Too much fun. Every update is unique and better each time. Everyone should play this game.
B004ZQBOXC|5.0|Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it.  He plays it quite often while driving to and from work/school.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This product alows you to synch all of your google calendars. Too bad I had to pay for it and it was not part of the native Kindle app list.
B009GJCFL8|5.0|The musicianship is superb. Fond memories. We are aging fast. The DVD was impressive to watch. This CD is still in my car.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|An excellent tool for new kindle writers!<br /><br />Specifies how to make index, properly create html folders, and everything else!  Get it while it's free.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great soothing sounds. Love listening to the kitty puuuuurrrrrrring.  Easy interface. Simple to use with tips/instructions.  I also like White Noise Lite. Using the Doorbell as a ringtone.  Tic Tac Toe Glow by TMSoft is fun and mindless for killing time. :-)  I'm a girl if you could't tell. Thought that might help explain the review. Peace out.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Krauss does a fine job when of describing the science of cosmology. He falls down in two categories however: 1) he ought to expunge all his anti theological rants. He obviously is too busy with worldly activities to have developed spiritual sensitivities; 2) the author speculates about how something can issue from nothing. My take of this is that he, Hawking and others of their ilk are piqued by their need to find a rationale to justify their atheism, more so than the need for development of good science.<br /><br />Krauss ought to stick to science at which he does a good job. I personally believe also that the fundamental truth of the universe is that the sum of all realities is identically zero. This does not equate with freedom to obviate Deity. Krauss too espouses this belief. He explains that something may derive from nothing where the definition of nothing is 'oblivion', nothing not even nothing. The mechanism of this 'creation' is emergence by virtual pair appearance and destruction dictated by quantum fluctuation. This is all well and good when applied to the nothing of space; however, it fails when applied to the nothing of oblivion,  nothing, not even nothing. 'Oblivion' is, after all, where we must look for the explanation of the beginning of existence. We must recede beyond space and time to when there was none; we must recede beyond that void into the totality of void whose complement is 'Oblivion' and then ultimately we must recognize that when one speaks of creation and first existence, we must start with the nothing of nothing. That is the mystery of 'creation'. I've written a little book, 'Reflection on Reality, Existence, and Consciousness' which is available at Amazon Kindle store. There I develop the 'essential set', one of whose elements is 'Oblivion'. The book probes the ontology of 'existence' and of 'space-time'. All of existence, all of the reality we perceive, is foundationalized by the 'essential set' and three relational perceptions. Theimplication of this is that there does exist an else-where that is a-temporal and a-spacial. But, again, to understand is not to be made equivalent with Godliness. We are finite creatures and existence is in fact couched in infinity. We have been given intellect and life. We have not been given deistic powers wherein our understanding of existence will abet an ability to create universes.<br /><br />One last point- philosophers and scientists such as Krauss love to invoke 'anthropic principles'  to explain what is. The only anthropic principle to which I subscribe is the layman's anthropic principle 'Crap happens'; you'll find it written in bumper stickers on the rear of some cars. That a finely tuned universe just full of consistencies should arise from a garbage dump physicality is absurd. To invoke an infinity of universes wherein anything may emerge is absurd. There simply is no observational data to confirm this point of view. As I said, Krauss does well when he adheres to good science- and he ought to do just that.
B008ULM7HU|4.0|I just finished the read on John Taylor's new book. This series complemented my read. Fun dance tunes with movable beats.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it so far and can't wait to see what else I can do with it. Horse looks very real and a little additive.
B00005JLK1|5.0|this movie is great because the cast is amazing and the concept of a haunted ship is genius.  Its good horror and make up is  nice...if youre into that kind of thing
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 rocks! Although it doesn't respond to your fingers as well and there are less landscapes/obstacles, it is addicting, more exciting, and better than ever!!!!! You need this game!!!!! I literally play it 24/7!!!A must have!!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Would have been a five but I still lag at times, and that kind of kills it for me.  Its much tougher than the first one and doesn't lag as much, but still lags.  Its free.  Don't do like I did with the first one and buy the extra things, or it cheapens the experience.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Its great but its not i need when i thought that its what i need after reading the details about it so thats my fault but yeah, it sharpens knives well.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent writing, clever dialog, amazing plot twists, intriguing characters, fascinating dilemnas, believable settings and swordplay. Does it get any better?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I highly recommend season 2 of Downton Abbey.  Although a soap opera, it is very entertaining and beautifully acted with outstanding costumes and furniture.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Fantasy stories are hard to do it seems. So many go wrong. This is not one of those. If you are a fan of the Fantasy genre, then this should be on your list! Great story! Great characters! Great costuming! MUST WATCH!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a very big horse person and this game stimulates the reality of taking care of a horse in real life.<br />It is very easy and very fun when it comes to keeping yourself busy on road trips and in the doctor's office.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I love Christopher Nolan and the plot was very thick just the way I like my motion pictures. I enjoyed the ride and how everything culminated towards the end. My one gripe with the first one he did was there really wasn't a villain to speak of. Heath Ledger was immaculate in the dark knight but the role Tom Hardy plays in this is definitely a tour de force!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Simple & easy to play..needs to have harder levels other than that it's kind of boring. Better to play other card games.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Such a great idea for an app, but in practice it's pretty useless, as the Kindle must be on for this to be of any use. That said, I think it's a limitation of the API and device, so I wouldn't blame the programmers for this at all. Worth a look, I'd say, but I found I couldn't deal with the always having to be on thing. Morning alarms are quite literally my life's blood. If I don't wake, I'm in trouble, and I just couldn't trust it... Too bad. :(
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's books like this that I keep me reading as an adult. You heart keeps beating faster and faster wondering what will happen next.
B0035YDM9E|5.0|Insightful, incisive, and comprehensive are the top descriptors of a book that is extensive in detail and yet understandable to the layman. Stiglitz's Keynesian views provide a call to congress for stimulative action that would help the average American. And, as detailed in the book, we can know undoubtedly that such measures are would be not just good for the troubled homeowner or the layed off factory work, but for the macroeconomy as a whole. Very scholarly!
B002PEP4SC|2.0|The book was so so.... But after watching the TV show castle based on this book I found the book to be lacking in interest.  It was well written but it just did not hold my interest.  I could not wait to get to the end.  Usually I read a book in a day.  This was a relatively short book and it took me 4 days.  Just kept putting it down.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|An entertaining movie with lots of special effects. Capitalizes on the popularity of the previous Iron Man and Captain America movies. I don't think it needed to be over two hours in length, as I found myself ready for the ending sooner. Still, I would recommend the movie to anybody who finds the comic book characters entertaining. I would offer the Batman trilogy's popularity as proof that this genre has a big following. It's fun and, as expected, the &#34;good guys&#34; triumph.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I love this app.  It is very clear and to the point super easy to use.  I use it for getting the colors, brightness, and cropping and rotating, and go in and adjust color levels when I take picutres of my personal paintings, I am not a good photographer, so this photo editor is great for getting my bad photos to make my paintings look how they actually look in real life.  I love this app and would recommend it for any reason be it art, or just silly pictures of my kitty cat.
1451662432|5.0|I was very impressed with this book and impressed with the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is an extremely  inspiring story and life. Here was a man who looked ahead to what he wanted to do and did it from the time he was a youth. I don't believe he was ever tired? He dreamed high and was not too proud to look to others for help. He made mistakes, mostly in his personal life, but took ownership of those mistakes.<br />The book is long but I found it so interesting that I didn't mind.  I am eighty three and have never been interested in his movies, except True Lies, Years ago I had been impressed that he had run for govenor of California. Really, I don't know why I bought the book except that the sample was interesting and I like autobiographies. This one was beyound my expectations.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|love the game but it wont let me get friends and tthe two games you play to level the ponies up get boring after a while. howeverthe game is enjoyable and it is very similar to cityville love it and rd is the coolest pony!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Could have developed the characters better. Didn't understand the role of the attorney general. Could have made the Chicago cop more active in his role of a bad guy
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the action in this trilogy. The humor mixed in was very well done. Will definately read it again and tell others to also
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Just when you think Tom Hanks has peaked and couldn't possibly eclipse his last performance, he once more raises the bar.  This movie leaves you emotionally played out at it's conclusion.  Sandra Bullock, another journeyman of her trade also gives an amazing performance opposite Tom as a spouse and also as a daughter-in-law.  Young Thomas Horn as an eleven year old New Yorker, delivers an incredible performance with the Hanks &#34;touch of excellence&#34; obvious at every turn.  This is an Academy Award nominated must see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've had this game for over 3 months and I'm still super hooked. One reason I love this game is because you don't have to pay for coins or anything, you earn them. It's also great for children
0765325950|4.0|After so long it was good to have the series come to an end.  Robert Jordan's voice as well as himself will be missed.  With that said, the ending seemed trite, in a package with a bow.  I know the length of the volume might have been intimidating to some, but I was left wanting more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this story, didn't want it to end but when it did, I felt very good about the way it ended
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great sequel to the first book.  Like the second book better than the first.  Now on to the final book...
B007P7UF0G|5.0|How do you NOT like this wonderful movie?? You can get lost in the blue eyes of the characters, and the story of King Arthur is like a quest for the Impossible Dream.. I loved it ! I watch it over and over again...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Pretty nice game! its a nice game. Has a variety of more things than temple run. Pretty happy about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's my favorite game so far it's really fun and I love the way the theme changes every month !
B005C7MVC6|5.0|I really enjoyed their album: For Emma, Forever Ago and decided to check this cd out. Although it is different I have thorougly enjoyed this album and have essentially had this cd on repeat all week!
B0051ANPZQ|1.0|This book kinda sucked:( it was really really boring I wouldn't recommend this book sorry if I disappointed you but this book is kinda all over the place it just doesn't have a message. It just talks about random stuff.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game! When I first got this game I thought it was a lot like temple run! But then I realzied it was way better then temple run because there is more things to do like hop on subways and do fun missions. I really like this game and I suggest it too... well everyone!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I recommend all his books. They never end the way you think they would. I am a romantic at heart and love his books.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Not necessarily unenjoyable, but I was not as utterly bowled over as I had been with all the previous Pendergast novels.  I think what I didn't really like was the disjointed feel due to the 4 separate story lines.<br /><br />Obviously, the main focus is Pendergast and his tragically doomed relationship with his wife, Helen Esterhazy.  The last Pendergast book revealed his allegedly long-dead wife was actually alive.  This book opens with their being reunited....albeit far too briefly.  It immediately proceeds into a furious chase as Pendergast attempts to rescue his wife.  All too soon, this becomes a tragic failure, which of course, such dramatic failure, has the predictable results on Pendergast.  What was NOT predictable, nor enjoyable, was seeing the near ultimate breakdown of our hero.  Pendergast has been an almost super-human, extraordinary character from the very beginning, but this tragic scene seems to insert a horrible, gaping flaw into our much vaunted and admired hero.  This is just an unacceptable paradox for me.  It is one thing to be so emotionally devastated, but it is another thing altogether to act as Pendergast does here, especially Pendergast's treatment of his long-time friends.  This whole scene just really took the lustre and shine off of Pendergast for me.  Perhaps others will think it shows a more 'human' side of him, but for me, I felt that it just didn't fit with the well-developed persona of Pendergast.  It was completely incongruous.<br /><br />The other three story lines involved Vinnie, Corrie and Constance.  While I found the story development surrounding Constance to be quite interesting and enjoyable, the story line surrounding Vinnie was seemingly pointless and almost seemed like an afterthought and the story line involving Corrie was just completely disjointed.  Preston and Child didn't even have to use Vinnie at all, other than the fact that they needed a police presence for the investigations into the killings in New York, which we then discover were being perpetrated by Pendergast's own son.  There are a couple of weak attempts to develop Vinnie's personal involvement with the story, but they fail pretty miserably and I felt as though even at the end, Vinnie's role in the whole thing was left hanging and unresolved.  It was wrapped up in such a hasty manner, again, it almost seemed like an after thought.<br /><br />As for Constance's story line, I truly enjoyed learning what this woman was all about.  While she had played substantial roles in previous Pendergast novels, she was always an enigma.  There were far more questions about her than answers and one was always left wondering whether or not she was truly some sort of supernatural being.  Of course, Pendergast novels always have bits and parts that lead the reader to consider supernatural possibilities, but always end up giving sound, scientific resolutions of those questions.  I have always loved this about the Pendergast series.  Just when you're about to think that Preston and Child have made the leap into the truly mystical, they bring you right back to reality with a plausible, science-based resolution.  In this regard, they do not disappoint here.  What was a bit disjointed was how we learn about Constance - through her psychiatrist-turned-sleuth, who has developed a quite unprofessional attachment to her.  His going on a quite out of character adventure, complete with almost unbelievable encounters with physical violence with brand new characters, which themselves are thrown in with absolutely minimal development seemed just too unbelievable.  It might have been better to have them go off to find evidence of Constance's past together.<br /><br />Corrie's story line seemed to be something for which an entire separate novella could have been written.  We learn about her family and she goes off on an adventure of her own after she is reunited with her estranged father.  I've enjoyed Corrie's interactions with Pendergast in thepast, but this just seemed entirely disjointed and had little to nothing to do with the underlying plot other than the reason Corrie is launched on her adventure was because she was running from the same people who had been responsible for the kidnapping and subsequent death of Helen.  Yet, there is little mention of this tie-in throughout Corrie's story and her little adventure has absolutely nothing to do with the 'bad guys' which precipitated her leaving to seek out safety from them.  The story here is little more than a separate crime mystery, which is relatively quickly resolved while having absolutely zero impact on the novel's main focus, the resolution of Helen's back story.<br /><br />Of course, there are plenty of typical Pendergast-isms - amazing physical prowess, extreme deductive reasoning and almost supernatural intelligence and cunning.  There is plenty of physical action and gripping suspense....but overall, I feel like this much-awaited book just did not live up to the established high standards set in previous Pendergast novels.past, but this just seemed entirely disjointed and had little to nothing to do with the underlying plot other than the reason Corrie is launched on her adventure was because she was running from the same people who had been responsible for the kidnapping and subsequent death of Helen.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved Safe Haven to bits. The ending is so good!  Imagine having Alex's wife otherwise Jo being with you spiritually like she does with Katie and to find out that she still lives on in people's hearts Katie especially. Thoroughly enjoyed this book and will pick it up again.
B001ECPJZO|4.0|The product was very fun for my daughter.  We are still working with her on the last loop of tying her shoes and hopes she gets it soon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All I have to say is that when you first play this game you think oh it's a fun game but believe me...it gets even better. Subway suffers is a fun game that is always changing. For example not to give anything away but they go on world tours to different places that you would never expect. I rate subway suffers a full 5 star rating, you or you kids will love this game.
B007SGM084|5.0|A bit explicit at times, but what a way with words, I have found a few new words (kinky f***ery) comes to mind; Yikes! Couldn't put this book down 3 days that's all it took for me to read, I found myself staying up late ignoring the dishes (and husband) just to finish this very intoxicating read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|ok well its a really fun game and all, but....... it does take a pretty LONG time to download to ur device. it also shuts off a lot especially on the kindle fire and kindle fire HD. please keep this in mind before your purchase.<br />have a blessed day. :D
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I enjoyed this....as well as my daughter. She plays with it all the time. I had it on my phone and we dowloaded it for the Kindle.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very well written  covers  many issues of the day,  very enjoyable. You get caught up in the lives of the family and help
B00536OCYG|5.0|I had this on 8 track when I was in the sixth grade.  The vinyl is awesome with great space.  It sounds like the helicopter is landing on your head.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Everything a great book should include!  Suspense, love, drama, fear, religion, friendships and courage all rolled into one. I couldn't put it down and hope the movie is just as good.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've ordered several of these CDs as gifts.  The piano guys are great - go watch them on YouTube!  It's a talented mix/adaptation of classical and pop.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This is a very long series - 12 books I think,  But I can't put them down.  I'm on the 4th one now and still going - Each one builds on the last but some things are finish and some carry over. Be prepared for the long haul - each book is 600-800 pages - but absolutely worth the effort .
B004SEUJUU|5.0|Personally, I do not like Hugh Jackman at all.  But no question regardless of my personal feelings, he embodies the essence of Wolverine from the comics. Marvel movies have (mostly) been done very well, and this one is no exception.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|This is a good movie with a great cast.  The DVD was of good quality.  It shipped quickly.  No complaints.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Too many ads. Did not work as stated. I did not like it and uninstalled it. Don't waste your time or space.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|One of my all time favorite flicks!<br /><br />Besides the 80s opening montage taking me back, this movie is wonderfully done. Mickey Rourke is incredible in this role as a loveable has been Pro wrestler. I don't want to rehash the plot, but the whole feel of the movie is so surreal and melancholy. However, you just want things to improve for the character so desperately, which they really never do except for glimpses of hope that truly never materialize into much except more setbacks and heartache.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|This was a great, fun to watch movie.  Don't remember too much swearing which is great, in my opinion.  Highly recommend if you like scary.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|A gift for my son, he absolutely loves the ghost rider! It's a good movie and I got it at an excellent price:)
B001UAX56A|5.0|This is one of the greatest never aging albums I've ever heard... Her songs still ring true to life life as much today as they did when I was in my 20's
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch.  Did not think I would like it was much as I did.  Do recommend.
B007N31XTY|5.0|Peter Jackson did not disappoint with his interpretation of King Kong! Special effects fantastic along with a really good story line!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Another great book in this series. There was a lot more violence in this one. The battle with Valentine was enough to unite old foes. Many were lost and much in Clary's life would change forever. This was really exciting reading. Recommend this one and now on to City of Fallen Angles!!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|We loved this movie.  The acting, the story line, everything--it was great.  Highly recommend.  Fun to see the time of prohibition.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This book had me wondering and guessing what was going to happen. Getting the book is a no-brainer, definitely recommend it
1594200106|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. I truly enjoyed the clever stories inside a story.  Keeping track of the characters made the reading easier. The mistery and drama keeps your imagination going and the outcome is always brilliant. This is a book hard to put down!
1400067820|5.0|I've read all three of his books and this one was the most interesting and applicable to formulating an investing strategy.  Interesting incite, easy to read and useful for those who make their own investing decisions.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this series..............I have to admit and am a bit upset with the main charactors being &#34;killed off&#34; this season!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. Get it, because it may seem like a temple run ripoff but it is not. The only problem is the lag, but it doesn't matter.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|Kindle Fire Lightweight Micro Shell Case is a great buy. It is easy to handle and keep clean. This case protects the Kindle Fire better than most cases that you find. The case can be put in different positions which is easy for reading.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case. It was the best purchase.

B009NPA3MS|5.0|Absolutely love this guy!  I've listened to this CD so many times!  You really get to see a side of him through this CD that you may not have thought of otherwise.  Can't wait for more of his music!
0316381357|5.0|I am not through reading it yet but I have watched the movie MANY times and the book is very reminiscent of it.  I was pleased with the quickness of getting it mailed to me - and knowing it was an old book I was pleased that it was so well kept even if it's cover was a little torn.
B0043RSJ8G|3.0|This was not my favorite picoult novel. Everything seemed a bit forced. The ending was rushed. Still a fan but this wasnt her greatest book.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|This is music to enjoy when you want quiet time with some background music or just sit back and attentively listen to.  Leonard Cohen is such a different type of musician and I like his voice.  His music draws you in.
0887306101|5.0|All I can say is I don't write book reviews for a living and that I liked the book enough. What more can I say?

B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it so much!! my favorite part of temple run 2 is the tunnle that you can go in!!! :) YOU SHOULD SO GET IT!! its free and fun!!!
B003B02O14|5.0|One of Grisham's best. As alwasmThe Partner is a cant put it down page turner. The story is intricate and the plot has several twists all the way to the end.
B004W10S9G|5.0|Hard to believe Hollywood ever produced such a Christian movie. Seems to be historically accurate too. There's a church built where Jesus appeared to St. Peter.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I had pretty much given sf up since Asimov and Heinlein were both gone. This was in the same vein as Starship Troopers.Reminded me of Starship Troopers,I,Robot.

0756655307|5.0|I bought them this and the DC Comics Encyclopedia for my husband and kids for Christmas and it's inspired tons of Superhero and Villain fun! Each book was selling for twice the price in the book store so I'm thrilled. I highly recommend. Anyone who finds fault with these books are nit-picky over-obsessed freaks! Love them all the way.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|tempel run 2 is so cool! it lets you go beyond opsticals that you would never have thought of to caves to ropes. I would recommend buying Tempel Run 2.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I really wanted to like it, but it was so slow. I liked the look of it, and think it had a lot of potential, but not enough story there.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|nice graphics! the story pretty interesting! I must say that I was challenged! keep up the good work!!now for # 2
0785139168|5.0|This was a very good purchase.  I will consider purchasing again and encourage others to do the same. Great way to build a personal library!  Thanks!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game. Pretty addictive and your energy does not run out super quickly like it does in similar games.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I have played it several times since downloading it on Friday.  It is great.  My husband enjoyed it too. A really good addition to our Bocelli collection.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|It works in terms of amplifying sound (duh) but more importantly, enhancing sound quality by letting you hear more (incl. flaws though) and with tighter bass; from 256kpbs MP3 to low quality YouTube music.<br /><br />But when being used with my smartphone, Fiio E6 generates a constant pulsing noise whenever I pause music.  When music is playing, this hissing noise is gone.  This cannot be recreated while using it with my laptop.<br /><br />The E6 main seam is not very flushed, making it look cheap.  Its main power LED illuminates the triangle - smart and beautiful.  Yet its EQ LED is hidden in its back in the form of a small dot - silly and hard to see.<br /><br />It would be nice if its LED can lit a 3rd color in addition to red and blue.  There's no purple btw, it's actually an alternating red+blue.<br /><br />Plugging & unplugging the E6 from an audio source will generate a very ear-piercing loud noise, beware!  You may want to unplug the earphones from the E6 first, then unplug the E6 from your playing device.<br /><br />I honestly need to use more to give it a fair rating.  I need to know if it's best to keep the device volume low and utilize the E6 volume control as high as possible, or keep everything mid-volume.  Does any one know?
B00A2LFXVI|1.0|The movie was great, but the one-star rating is for the Digital Copy.  I'm angry at Warner Home Video for giving an UltraViolet digital copy with part 2 (instead of an iTunes digital copy like part 1)!!!  When will they learn that nobody likes UV?
B008745B32|2.0|I average two books a week, and have given up on approximately a dozen books in my lifetime. This book started off with an interesting concept, and got progressively more boring and more self indulgent, I deleted the book about a quarter of the way through. Who knows if it got better? The process wasn't worth the suffering.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very interesting story.<br /> Christian and Anastasia have a very rich lifestyle. Security is very important. The rich live fun lives!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was such a great book. I haven't read too many fantasy books lately that were so engaging and interesting. Can't wait to finish the series
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A great game, awesome graphics and a simple concept, very addictive especially with the daily missions, earning the coins to buy boosts is also fun.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the large buttons and display. So much better than the standard calculator I have on my phone. I use it for basic calculations and it is easy and strait forward to operate.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Non stop humor and attention to detail, the author delivers when the carefully laid out plan goes awry for her characters in this charming story. Steamy enough to leave me breathless and dreaming of wonderful possibilities throughout, and that's really what it's all about isn't it?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game was for my wife, as she is a real horse owner. I never thought I'd be playing it right along side her. It very fun with multiple activities and it keeps on going. Great fun!

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Old photographs are often beautiful and almost always creepy. I think they fall in the uncanny valley: convincingly human, but something in the color and unsmiling faces strikes us as alien. Ransom Riggs has taken the eerie, lonely feeling of looking at these images and made a book out of it: Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. It's good but sadly, like most good detective novel, it solves all its mysteries and shows all its monsters.<br /><br />The beginning of a mystery is always the best. An unopened letter, a masked man, a crime seemingly impossible except by something supernatural, this is the stuff of the first half of good stories. In perhaps the greatest detective story, The Hound of the Baskervilles, Arthur Conan Doyle masterfully sets up a threat that is so convincingly supernatural that we begin to suspect Sherlock Holmes might really have to contend with a ghost.<br /><br />The atmosphere of that possibility is so pleasurable, and Holmes' solution so clever, we almost forget how sad it is for a mystery to be solved. Almost. The truth is no solution can be as fun as the mystery. The answer will almost always disappoint, and writers have to bolster their final narrative with something beside simple revelation. J.K. Rowling did this beautifully, book after book.<br /><br />In Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Ransom Riggs contends with that problem. As the protagonist's grandfather tells him fantastic stories and shows him strange, old photographs, the combination of the photograph's creepiness and sense of mystery is almost overwhelming. I read the first chapters of this book as hungrily as I always read the first chapter of Great Expectations and The Half-Blood Prince. Then, halfway through the book, suddenly, the mystery disappears, and the story shifts into supernatural adventure.<br /><br />I can't fault Riggs for providing answers to the questions I asked by turning the page but unlike Doyle, who suggests the supernatural and thengrounds it in the real world with the solution, Riggs takes the whispers of possibility, the whiff of magic, and confirms every suspicion. Any shadow that might hide a little black-and-white monster indeed does. I was further disappointed by an open ending, clearly setting up for sequels (which I will buy and read).<br /><br />I'm glad someone made a story around this photographs, I just wish the ending had kept some of the first half's closet-shadow light touch. I get the sense Riggs started this book with darkness in mind, and then rethought the ending a bit for the sake of that lucrative young adult market. Would I recommend the book? I'll likely read it again sometime, if only to look at the pictures again.<br /><br />Virginia Wolff wrote that \\"it is pleasant to be afraid when we are conscious that we are in no danger.\\" Therein lies the chief pleasure of Riggs' little novel. The old photographs are all authentic, it turns out, with only minor adjustments. The book is worth reading and owning for its value as, if nothing else, a sketch of the foggy pleasure of looking at ancient pictures. It's hard to imagine these people in color, hard to imagine them laughing, hard to realize they were here and will never be again.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I hate spending $20-$30 for a blu ray when dvds are so much cheaper. But this movie was one of the exceptions. The movie was epic and the price was unbeatable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves this game! She plays it all the time. It is simple to play and has good graphics.<br />,
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Easily one of my favorite albums ever.  The virtuosity displayed by band members is amazing, but what might be my favorite thing is how tastefully mastered this album is.  This is not smashed to hell at all, sounding more like the rock albums of yesteryear.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I bought this for a christmas present. The dvd was in great shape and they were happy to get it. No problems whatsoever.
1451638450|5.0|The oftimes hapless &#34;that idiot Ivan&#34; cousin of Miles Vorosigan finally gets his own story. Even in rescuing a damsel in distress Ivan manages to bollix it up in a way initially alarming but eventually serendipitous involving rengade and refugee Jacksonians, Cetagandan caches, and Ivan Vorpatril's normal coterie of irksome relations and co-workers all hampering his efforts to live a nice uneventful life as Navy staff officer.<br />It is good to see him get some face time of his own, and hopefully this means others such as Aral and Cordelia, Quinn, and perhaps this enigmatic Jole, will get some more too.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Not sure what to say in this review, except its Mary Poppin's.  Who doesn't love this movie?  My kids watch this movie all the time.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading these books since I was a little boy and now it's sad to say there will be no more coming out. I've lived and shared so much with Rand, Matt and Perrin that it will be hard to find another series to fill the void left by Jordan. Great series for all of you who like a plot like no other and a fantasy world with endless wonders.
B00466HM28|1.0|looks and works like a 5 year old's keyboard not to mention no instructions it is weightless do not recommend at all
B00AVIGUEG|5.0|This movie was great, Will Smith's performance was very believable, and excellent. Very good movie, I was surprised. A must see.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I was unsure when I first started watching because a show about zombies seemed a little silly... But I can't get enough!! Somehow the zombies part is not as ridiculous as it sounds and you just get so wrapped up in their survival. It is amazing, if you're questionable about the storyline don't be, it is a great series that you immediately become engaged with.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|This series is a very easy and quick read. Has me laughing outloud whilst I read it. If you have seen the movie [which was based on the first book] you actually can see the characters in each of the subsequent books.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|Must have for music lovers.  Absolutely the best music.  We have watched this CD many times.  Friends have come over to watch it more than once.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie is entertaining the whole way through with an adorable love story of two children and one of a kind characters. If you like Wes Anderson's movies (The Life Aquatic, The Royal Tenenbaums) this will be right up your alley, and if you don't you should still see it because its a movie everyone can enjoy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is actually my first Nicholas Sparks book, believe it or not! I LOVED it to pieces! Such an amazing story. Amazing is NOT a strong enough word.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|This is a must have CD if you love blues or rock.  It has many of the greats.  Two CDs of some of the best music.  I keep one CD in the car and one in the house.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Wow! This is a wonderful series full of drama and intrigue. You're constantly left thinking and become almost as obsessed as the main character with finding out the truth. Can't wait for more!
B009GEON22|5.0|Great story and design. Playback was great through Xbox. played Better than Netflix on Xbox. Quality was high throughout movie.
B0019IB26I|5.0|My granddaughter is transitioning from acoustic guitar to electric.  I got this CD for a song she wanted to learn to play.  She learned 3 songs off it.  Must be a good CD.
B000005YZM|5.0|Odessey and Oracle is one of the best rock albums ever written. Plain and simple. This is a must-buy for any rock fans of the '60s and I definitely encourage others to buy it as well. One of my all-time favorites.
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|Follows right after part one without skipping a beat. Love rooting for all the great characters. Love the scene when Batman goes toe to toe with Superman.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I've read most of Baldicci's books and this one is just kind of in the middle.  I'm still looking for one that measures up to earlier books.  When it comes to military subjects, Baldacci tends to overdo the actual capabilities of individuals and their personal equipment.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|For a first book, a nice start. Good central characters. Interesting world. Starts off better than it finishes. Liked it well enough to buy next book in series, which was a disappointment.
B004S9AK3G|3.0|I think that's a reaonable judge of this book. Drawn out a bit like the previous book  by Ken Follett and repeats itself several times. But it is still attractive enough to read right thru to the end.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|&#34;The Racketeer&#34; is as good as &#34;Rainmaker&#34; and certainly movie material.  Typical of John Grisham, it carries the suspense to the very end but is very riveting every page.  My kind of book--short chapters, easy to read, limited number of characters.  Can't wait to turn the next page.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game.This is one of my favorite games and love that it has so many different games you can play and you never get bored with this game.This game has something for everyone to enjoy.I love all the different birds.:)
B0091THDOM|5.0|I would give this item five stars for quality and appearance---the fit is one star. It is nearly impossible to insert or remove the phone. I returned the case---couldn't use it.<br /><br />I received a replacement case (issue has been corrected} and this case is everything I had hoped for. I sometimes carry my phone in my pocket, and this case provides excellent protection. As I said earlier, the appearance and quality are outstanding.<br /><br />I also purchased a Snugg case for my ipad 4, which is just as nice!

B004SIP7US|4.0|I won't get into a summary of the plot, my opinions on the acting or its significance to the real world. That has been covered many times by other reviewers. I just focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I have never owned the Standard Def version but have watched the movie in the past at least 3 or 4 times.  With this new watching on Blu Ray, I enjoyed the film more than before.<br /><br />The video transfer was done by someone who cared about the quality.  The colors were clean and there was great details in both the dark and shadow areas.  I saw no distracting or present grain, nor did I notice any aliasing or stair stepping in the wide shots of the city itself which is where one might see stair stepping.  There was no artificiality to the color grading which tended to be on the warm side but certainly not excessively.  The video transfer, to me, was one of the better ones I have seen. 5 stars for the film and the video transfer to Blu Ray<br /><br />The audio defaults to DTS HD 5.1 lossless and the film's audio levels were nicely set.  There was no roller coasting of the volume nor need to adjust it once you picked the volume you preferred. The majority of the film's action and score is typically on the front stage and this film's audio was full sounding and nicely spread across the front three channels.  The rear channels were used intermittently with some discreet panning and foley fx but there wasn't a whole lot of rear use.  Most panning was across the front stage.  Your sub is used primarily for the deeper ambiance but really comes into play towards the film's end during the city's riots and the cannon shots. 4 stars for the audio for clarity and fullness though I would not use the audio to show off a surround system.<br /><br />There are some movie previews, which I hate to have on my discs( I resent having to pay for advertisements) but there are also 2 excellent documentary extras on the history of the gangs in N.Y.  One is a 35 minute copy of a documentary originally shown on the Discover channel.  Both are worth watching. The inexpensive price of this movie certainly makes it worth watching or upgrading to.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksa documentary originally shown on the Discover channel.

B009UNGYHG|5.0|I travel frequently and it's so easy to charge the bluetooth vs trying to find an outlet to plug in to.
B0026O475M|5.0|Loved it  was an amazing movie thought that the first half was very exhilarating and suspense packed loved the movie all in all !!!!!!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|After the debacle that was MIB II, I was understandably skeptical about this one. Will Smith brings his A game as agent J, Brolin does an uncanny Tommy Lee Jones impersonation, and the movie even finds some heart at the end. This was just the action-adventure/comedy I was looking for.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|I loved the first season of AHS so I was excited to see a second season.<br />I'm not exactly sure what they were smoking or  shooting up when they wrote this but it is a complete mess.<br />So many story lines that you can't keep up with them. It's like they took 4 or 5 different ideas for this season and crammed them all into one big (and sorry to say this again) MESS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive and super fun. I would suggest this game to all of my friends and family. If you don't have this game yet you really should get it
B00AEFXE9U|2.0|Very disappointed. The product I received was not the special edition as advertised.  It only contains the one disk of the movie, but according to the ad, there should have been another special edition disk, as well as a music cd.  Since I have already opened the product, it cannot be returned.  If you're only wanting the movie, this package is fine. But don't expect to get any more than that.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|This movie is based on a truly interesting and moving story.  Unfortunately, the makers of this movie chose to Hollywood it up by forcing an unbelievable love story, copious nudity, and last-minute half-assed character development on the viewer.  It seems like a Disney version of a real story with more sex.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game.  However without patience it will cost you.  $150.00 in 2 weeks for me, but i am enjoying myself.  Don't rush to buy gems tho as they are iften in 'the sale'
B002ZB26AO|5.0|The author provides an unparalled view of a secret society that is a significant player on the world stage. A very worthwhile read.
1608871088|5.0|A very very good book!! I loved the film, and then I love the book too!! Illustrations are beautiful, so colourful and so magical!
0688062334|5.0|Our house is full of Studio Ghibli fans. We had seen the movie so many times without even realizing it was based on a book. When the book came in, there was a fight over who would get to read it first. It was as wonderful as we knew it would be. Sophie's motivations are so well explained, and there is a greater depth to her family life than we had known. A beautiful story.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|As good a film as the first ROCKY,but also enough difference that it isn't a copy of rocky.<br />You will root for both brothers all the way to the end and will be pleased with how things turn<br />out for them.
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|I first encountered Chris Potter in the summer of 2001 at a makeshift gig-space in Calgary (it was Jazz Fest).  He was touring Gratitude with Kevin Hays, Scott Colley, and Clarence Penn.  While it was probably just another stop on the road for Potter (he certainly wasn't at the Vanguard), he and his band mates played an absolutely smoking (and very long) set.  I was hooked, and immediately went out and picked up a copy of Gratitude (still one of my favourites of his).  I have seen him twice since then, although I will confess that as the years passed I became something of a casual listener.  I wanted to like Travelling Mercies, but the compositions simply weren't strong enough.  I like Underground, but I have to be in the mood for it.  (His work with Dave Holland strikes me as brilliant, but I haven't spent enough time with it to speak confidently about it.)<br /><br />With The Sirens, however, I believe Potter has found a perfect (literary) vessel for his restless creativity.  The band is especially well-balanced (and I challenge anyone to come up with a more suitable drummer for this music; Eric Harland plays with the strength and unpredictability of Poseidon, tempered with the wisdom of Pallas Athena).  It seems characteristic that Potter should have wanted two pianists for the occasion; however, he deploys them with extreme care.  Nobody gets in anybody's way.  Potter moves between tenor and soprano saxophones, and includes a little bass clarinet along the way.  The emphasis is on the tenor, however (or at least that's how I hear it), which suggests dedication and focus.<br /><br />I will single out two tracks.  \\"Kalypso\\" is what you would expect it to be--a calypso (and if you ask me, Potter was born to play calypsos), only it sounds a little off-kilter (like Kalypso by way of Circe, perhaps).  Conversely, \\"Nausikaa\\" is ethereal, almost childlike--but of course we remember that Nausikaa is a beautiful young princess.  (The Celeste is perfect for this performance.  I close my eyes and I can imagine Odysseus waking up to the sounds of Nausikaa and her maids playing ball.  \\"What am I hearing?\\" Odysseus asks, and of course because he is Odysseus he feels compelled to investigate....)<br /><br />Chris Potter has re-established his power and (endless) promise with this recording.  He has come home to Ithaca, and it was well worth the wait.
B001NLL0RW|4.0|THE DOOMS DAY KEY: A SIGMA FORCE NOVEL.<br /> KIND OF A MIX BETWEEN JAMES BOND AND RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC .
0670024813|5.0|The big idea in this book is that modernity has cut humanity off from important evolutionary traits that are present in primitive society. Over the last two million years, humans evolved living in small bands, until the rise of agriculture in the Holocene less than ten thousand years ago. The unprecedented emergence of the state enabled specialisation, social peace, surplus value, and alienation from nature. Traits in child rearing and social interaction were changed by the larger communities allowed by urbanisation.<br /><br />Diamond sees much in pre-modern existing traditional societies such as in New Guinea that is useful to learn from. For example, non-state dispute resolution through mediation and apology can resolve conflict, especially for people who have to interact again in future.<br /><br />The alienation from nature seen in modern culture is an evolutionary negative for humans, in that we need to reconcile our life to the natural environment that supports it. So Diamond has immense respect for traditional societies, especially those that live outside of contact with modernity. There are in fact still isolated people who have no wish to interact with the broader world and who maintain traditional lifestyles in many respects. Diamond respects the sense of autonomy and self reliance of traditional people, whose methods were universal among humanity for more than 99% of our hominid evolution. In terms of time, hunter gatherer methods occupy more than 99% of the period since humans diverged from australopithecines two million years ago.

034580404X|5.0|Yes, there are some great romance in the book, but when you look past the stuff that is on the surface, there is truely a great story between two people who cannot believe that they can love someone so much. One person struggling to deal with aspects of their life that they could never exist and one person struggling to believe in themself. Love, love, love the love story and the two characters in the book.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|A fun read, with a very different and endearing take on romance and life in general from the point of view of a person inhabiting the high functioning end of the autism scale. The result is a witty and enjoyable read. Looking forward to the next novel from this writer.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I've always loved Mahjong, being the puzzlehead I am.  This was purchased after finishing the standard version. Would definitely buy again.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Muse fans, brace for impact.  They are about to alter your paradigm.  Again.<br /><br />With every album they release, Muse almost completely reinvents their sound.  This time they go further than ever before, with more orchestra, more electronica, more etcetera.<br /><br />The first track - &#34;Supremacy&#34; - sounds like it should be in the opening credits of a James Bond movie.  From there they launch straight into the very dubstep-y &#34;Madness,&#34; and then things get weird.  &#34;Panic Station&#34; sounds a bit like Muse of old, from their Origin of Symmetry days.  But next we have &#34;Survival&#34; which sounds like something Queen would have come up with in their heyday.  Having established four different directions along which they could proceed, Muse then blends the elements for the next six tracks, which all sound unique and are largely excellent; standing out are &#34;Follow Me&#34; and &#34;Save Me.&#34;  And now we arrive at the title tracks: &#34;The 2nd Law: Unsustainable&#34; and &#34;The 2nd Law: Isolated System&#34; which I can't even begin to describe.<br /><br />Whatever you've come to expect from Muse, forget it.  When they release a new album, just expect to have your mind blown.  Because that's what they do.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This is an admirable adventure film and it probably reflect a deep change in American culture concerning the Blacks, African Americans. So far the great authors and playwrights dealing with the Blacks only or practically only showed the villainous hardships of slavery. This film surely shows a lot of that, but with a different eye than in Toni Morrison's Beloved or many other novels. It shows slavery as the most cruel and absurd social system ever invented but once again from a new point of view, that of a black man who gets out of slavery by accident and gets in business with a German immigrant and shares with him the profession of bounty hunter. That means he can ride a horse and kill white people, provided it is under the authority of his white associate and under the sanctimonious authority of a court-ordered mission, that of catching some fugitive criminals dead or alive.<br /><br />This black man has a vengeance to fulfill since his wife has been sold away to another planter, one of the worst in Mississippi. I will not deflower the film and tell you the details. This black man, Django, wants to find his wife and free her and in the end, of course, he will succeed, but what an adventure.<br /><br />The new element in this film is that beyond slavery, and we are just before the Civil War, some Blacks are recapturing their desire to be free beyond their fate of obedience. That fate is explained by the planter as being the result of some kind of a \\"malformation\\" of the skull. It is of course the result of nothing but the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSS) they have been through in the daily suffering imposed onto them mostly for the pure and simple pleasure of the white planters and their white associates who are all shown over and over again as nothing but sadist dullards.<br /><br />We are here in a postcolonial approach that is only possible because the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, also called Post Traumatic Slavery Syndrome is finding some kind of a solution, some healing procedure, some way of stepping over it and moving on. This has been a slow and long procedure and the Civil Rights movement, Martin Luther King, and now Barack Obama, and many others before and in-between, have been instrumental in that evolution. Blacks or African Americans are finally finding their self-respect, their self-freedom, their self-pride back and they can finally decolonialize their own souls, their own minds, as the CNN wrote so rightly on November 22, 2012. And when one's mind is free of any colonial heritage the sky is the limit and the White House is the first step to that sky.<br /><br />Of course the film is unrealistic, the weapons are as effective as missile throwers if not even rockets launched by some drone from the sky. Of course there is too much blood. But it is the first time some of the cruelty of these slave-owners is finally shown, alluded to and defused into absolute punishment. To be free in your soul you must be convinced your torturers have been punished, even those who were silent if not consenting witnesses. That means you have to finally remember and reconcile with and recommit yourself to the future and no longer remain enslaved to the past. That means forgiving the descendants of your torturers and that means the descendants of your torturers have to finally step over their belief you are inferior, which makes them superior without having to prove it.<br /><br />That's why this film is great. It is really the beginning of the end, maybe even the beginning of the day after the end.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUtion, some healing procedure, some way of stepping over it and moving on.

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|i thought this movie would be a waste of time and cheesey but surprisingly it was comical and had a pretty good story line.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it to friends who like comedy
B009439HEY|5.0|Este disco es muy especial. Tiene canciones de Genesis de distintas épocas por las que pasó Steve por la banda y varias de The Lamb. Las canciones están tocadas respetando estrictamente sus originales y suenan muy bien, haciéndonos volver a aquella música maravillosa de esta banda que quedó grabada en nuestras almas para siempre.
B0040IEVOE|5.0|Still the funniest SN ever made, IMO. I can never get past the part where Dean has a mouth full of sweets without falling on the floor laughing.
0345522478|5.0|One of the things that irks me about magic series (Dresden, Jane Yellowrock, Riftwar, etc.) is that the authors tend to set up the hero for challenges that are beyond what makes sense for the hero--or anyone--to be able to handle. So they have to twist the story or the underlying logic of the way magic works in that world or even the basic reality of that world--or all of the above--to make everything work out. If you know how to tell a good tale, you really don't have to do all that. It is sort of silly to set up these uber-powerful heroes and then have to figure out ways to make it so they can't or won't use all that power in various situations. Again, not necessary...if they have an information deficit, you can make the story work even if they have oodles of power. Now, notwithstanding all that, I still like all those books, to varying degrees.<br /><br />Hounded is not like those books...at least, the first book isn't. Hearne knows how to spin a tale, and he can create some truly funny moments. Although it may also be that I have the same sort of immature sense of humor that Atticus shows from time to time. So, yes, as we move through the subsequent books, we start heading into familiar territory, where the challenges seem a bit much. Nevertheless, the books remain really well written and the stories are well-crafted. The characters show some deep thought, and the plots can make you think about some things, but nothing overwhelming or a slap in the face. Truly interesting world creation, or perhaps more accurately, adaptation of Irish, Norse, and other folklore.<br /><br />I don't bother reviewing plots and such. Read the book for that. The upshot here is, why 5 stars? Because I couldn't put these books down--any of them. Read the first one, and within a week had purchased and read the next four or five, whatever we're up to as of Feb 2013. Set aside the other stuff I was reading to read these. Haven't done that in awhile.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is great just like real minecraft but there are no updates! With updates the game is better and more fun but NO UPDATES WTF
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read this book in 3 days. Its that good. For 99 cents i was a bit skeptical, but this book is easily just as good as many others out there if not better. The storyline is well paced and thought out, with the main character really being a unique individual. I was on the edge of my seat for 3 days solid while reading this. If your on the edge for this book, just get it already.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good story with fun games. Smooth playing with hints if needed maps are also easy to use and helpful. Worth it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site! So many wonderful ideas, great pictures, and a great way to share your ideas. I love seeing what different people are doing and thinking. I've seen so many things that have inspired me to try something different!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing. I love how you start out a the 1x multiplier and as you complete missions you can make it up to the 30x multiplier so you can get more points in a single game. Once you make it there after you complete missions you win the super jackpot!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive game! Easy to grasp the controls, easy to play and understand. Appropriate for the kids and fun for the adults!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game just think prices too high for that little bit of money we get lower the prices or give us more money
B004GUSG4M|4.0|A bit predictable but nevertheless captivating.  I don't have any thing else to add but the system will not accept my review without 14 additional words.... lame
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so addicting I stopped playing all my favorite games because it's so fun. I have so many people on Facebook and Twitter that love this games as well they play it 24/7 so if u want to buy a game I'd choose subway surfers and that's what I would have other customers get.
0767812166|5.0|This is not your usual sci-fi story. It has kindness and some believability to it.<br />It is a little sad and meloncholy and has an ending different from what I expected.<br />I find it  interesting to view occasionally as I always seem to find something that I missed on a previous viewing.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It's definitely what you expect in a harlequin book but actually a little different. It keeps you guessing and reading for more! I fell in love with the characters and the plot and you will too. I would recommend for every woman to read this book!
031250926X|4.0|We love Brown Bear in this house so we have the original copy and this slide and find version. My son has been into this book since he was about 9 months old and is now 18 months old. The last page in the original book has pictures of all the animals again. Every time we read this slide and find version, my son is trying to flip to the &#34;last&#34; page and gets frustrated or confused when it's a different ending. He still likes flipping through this version, but he doesn't grab this one nearly as often as the original.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I really enjoy the series.  It is fresh, provocative, and totally believeable.  Also horrifying at times.  I was really disappointed to see that Dale was killed off, but that's show business.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is real fun to play and is very realistic. the only problem that I have with it is that sometimes the game will not open so I have to reinstall it. however it remembers my profile and is able to restore my account
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I enjoy its simple and easy way of telling a inspiring story, which reminding me I'm capable to live out life in my own way. \\"Life will never be the same\\" as it said.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|If you have to look for a review, then you don't get it. It's Led Zeppelin, buy it. Enough said
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game starts out easy and then keeps getting harder, make sure that you save you special skills for later.
B00002DEBW|5.0|Had this on vinyl &#34;back in the day.&#34; Awsome to hear it again. I like to have the physical product to see the artwork etc. with the sound quality of a CD.  A fine example of a great era of music. Superb musicianship.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This.game was more innovative than the last game adding better graphics, more tricks, rollercoaster rides and more. The only disappointment was the lack of people you can play as but who cares about that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's fun and I love how y'all switch up the scenes it's just a very fun game to play when yu have nothin else to do or when your board!! So to all the people who didn't play yet y'all should start playin now like rite this second cause it really is so much fun !!! I really enjoy it
B009ICQ6KO|4.0|Charlie Musselwhite has been playing blues harp since the 60s and in that time has developed his own unique style based firmly in the blues but with some really individual quirks and twists that make it really easy to pick out his playing. I must admit I prefer him as an accompanist rather than as a bandleader - as with his playing on records by Bonnie Raitt, the Blind Boys of Alabama and Tom Waits.<br /><br />Here the songs and singing are provided by Ben Harper with Charlie adding his distinctive melodic flourishes, as on the opening number \\"Don't look twice\\" which starts off as a typical Ben Harper slide-based ballad but then Charlie's harmonica playing takes it to a different place, giving it an almost Tom Waits-like feel. Elsewhere \\"I'm in I'm out I'm gone\\", \\"I don't believe a word you say\\" and \\"Blood side out\\" are all tough bluesy songs with Ben's full band and driven by the harp and guitar, while \\"She got kick\\" is also very bluesy but has lead guitar up front and very subdued harp. \\"We can't end this way\\" is a nice gospel song complete with backup vocals. Two of my favourite tracks are the two slow acoustic ballads \\"You found another lover\\" and the closing \\"All that matters now\\", both very moving. This is a very loose, relaxed record - it's not the best thing that either artist has done but it is a rewarding listen with both men really gelling and complementing each other.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is so much fun. But takes awhile to download the graphics. I haven't stopped playing it since I got it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have loved this game since I was a child, and the sound and graphics on the Kindle Fire are great!!
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|This album never gets old. It always sounds fresh and exciting as it did the day it was released 30 years ago. I purchased this cd for the Disc 2 live Philly show (incomplete show from what I've read, but still very good). The disc 1 material can be found on the previously released remaster. When I put this cd into the cd player, I was happy I made the purchase. All I can say is that the cd sounds great (both discs)! I spent the afternoon listening to this cd and revisiting some other SRV cds. What a great afternoon it was! Like a previous reviewer said, don't get rid of the other remastered Texas Flood. The interview with SRV is on it which is not on the Legacy Edition. Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely fantastic!  Can't wait to continue on with the next book!  It was everything I was told it would be.
0785163174|3.0|Having seen so many great stories & some left field characters featured in the fear itself & dark reign series, it was always going to be a massive challenge to pit two of the most loved teams of all time against each other.<br />Having read both Avengers (including West Coast) & X-Men when I grew up, I was a fan of both but, X-Men was always the big winner. The sense of arrogance in the Avengers may have had something to do with it & was something that seemed to permeate through Avengers vs X-Men.<br />It frustrates me when huge collections like this provide a full story and then have cut back to intersecting stories through the main stories later.......once again this happens in this book.<br />The overall story is one that is generally quite enjoyable, with some welcome twists on what you come to expect from the coming of the Phoenix but, with resolutions revolving around past stories, it left me a little hollow in the end.<br />I'll always be pulling for the X-Men & I can't help but feel that they are once again the black sheep of the family.<br />Worth the buy but, hopefully Marvel decide to push the boundaries a bit more in future!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was always a fan of Zep, but this DVD really introduced me to many of these tunes for the first time.  Each tune, is an amazing performance by this band.  Jason and the boys simply tear this up.  The tunes, performance, sound, band are all top notch and the best of any other DVD in my collection.  I am a big fan of Beatles, Floyd, Stones, Who, Yes, etc..... these guys clearly Rule.  Hammer of the Gods indeed.  You Gotta get this DVD, I haven't tried the Blue Ray Yet, been on the Road.  The DVD is amazing quality.  Some on the board critiqued the editing on the video.  I like it, I see that is done with extreme care and thought and perfectly compliments the tunes, similar to the light show, and vids going on live, all very complimentary to eye, ear for me.  The Sound is awesome, Pages guitar is a buzz saw on fire...., Jason's kit is right where it should be, the bass on pedals can drop in certain circumstances, the Bass Guitar is always in the pocket.  Robert sounds amazing and the band is playing so tight it is actually an amazing performance. I did not see, or hear an overdub.....  and Jason does his dad proud, and is just a fantastic drummer.  Bottom Line, The Best Classic Rock DVD I have experienced to date.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This is a movie about kind hearted people with the happy ending I love. The humor is the British kind with irony and dry wit.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|A search for a good Christmas gift coupled with a personal pledge to not give video games led me to the Perplexus Maze Games.  They were a huge hit.  I purchased Perplexus Rookie, Perplexus Maze Game, and Perplexus Epic (the kids ranged in age from 5 years - 9 years old).  They traded off trying to solve the mazes, it kept them occupied for long periods of time.  Adults picked them up to give it a try as well.  Even a tween-aged 12 year old boy who will typically not play anything besides violent video games picked up one of these Perplexus mazes and tried to figure it out for nearly an hour!  Highly recommend this product and I could not be more pleased.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|It is a fun light movie that is really easy to enjoy!! The story line was easy to follow and fun.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|Happy, BUT ...<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Can use phone as Kindle-reader, enlargingas needed.<br />- Don't need Internet connection to read<br />- Can go directly to Kindle Store (See Con section)<br />- Other \\"pros\\" - but those are main ones. Most pros are advantages of any Kindle, with smaller form-factor.<br /><br />Con:<br />- Most cons are about poor UI.<br />- Too difficult to take desired actions after reading a sample<br />- Kindle Store and Amazon.com are SO unrelated, one wonders:<br />(1) Was there ANY Systems Integration in programming process?<br />(2) Does ANYONE in Marketing or Sales want to make it easy (maybe user-friendly) for us to purchase content (that we have decided we want)? Or to let our WishLists know what we WANT?<br />- should integrate WELL with both Amazon mobile apps & with full web-site.<br />- \\"Don't judge book by it's cover?\\" Bad enough that e-readers lose the sensory aspects of reading - but the lag-time (till next download or more) to SEE the cover? If we can't have \\"feel\\" of a book, would be nice to have more of the \\"look\\"<br />- Many features not available. Example: During past year, Many Kindle-benefits are advantages of Amazon Prime Membership. BUT, these features are not compatible w this app.<br /><br />With all these cons, and I could list more, why am I giving 3 stars, instead of 1-2? I don't own a Kindle - nor, would I always carry it. So, this app lets me read content anywhere, from phone.

B004G25V9S|4.0|But most of the better things in life aren't easy to digest on the first try.<br /><br />Opeth has never been an \\"easy\\" band.  Even by the often-intimidating standards of progressive and heavy music, Opeth require an extraordinary amount of effort.  You have to be willing, and you have to be patient.  They usually don't care much for choruses.  They utilize silence as much as they do volume.  They refuse to associate themselves clearly with any one particular genre.  And they've always been this way.<br /><br />And all of these qualities are present on Heritage.  And yet, Heritage is a strange departure, even for Opeth.<br /><br />This album has been, and will continue to be, compared to Damnation, just because of Mikael's exclusive use of clean vocals.  But that's all this album has in common with Damnation.  Despite its clean and acoustic outer facing, Damnation was in line with what Opeth was doing at the time.  It was like a (very fine) collection of clean interludes that they'd trimmed out of Deliverance or Blackwater Park.<br /><br />Heritage, though, is prog... it's jazz... it's folk.. it's classical.  Sometimes, it's all of this in one song.  These tracks don't flow together like the tracks on past Opeth efforts, and in the heart of the album-- \\"Nepenthe\\" through \\"Famine\\"-- there is little or no flow at all, even in the individual songs; on first listen, I thought the heart of this album contained as much silence as it did music.  It's almost like the band wasn't patient; as if, while recording, they had dozens of good ideas but didn't bother to tie them together in any logical fashion...  And while playing, when in doubt of how to proceed... they just faded into empty space and picked up again a few seconds later with something TOTALLY different!<br /><br />And then I realized...  This is Opeth.  For twenty years, these guys have been writing and performing some of the most complex, beautiful, challenging music on the heavy metal end of the rock spectrum.They know what they're doing.  If some of these songs seem chopped-up and random, it's because they're SUPPOSED to sound that way.<br /><br />So I let the CD cool on the shelf, ignored it on my iPod, and returned to it later.  This time, I knew what I was getting into, but I still had the benefit of coming to it with fresh ears. (Because, believe me: you won't digest this album on your first listen.  Or your second.  Or your third.  Probably not your fifteenth.)<br /><br />And still, after months of ignoring it (and thus, in a way, preparing myself for it), I didn't get it.<br /><br />Yes, I enjoyed \\"The Devil's Orchard\\" and \\"Folklore.\\"  They're easily the most traditional-sounding songs on the record, if you're looking for anything resembling the Opeth of past days... or at least the Opeth of the Watershed era.  The rest of it I found to be very strange.  Not bad-- these guys are talented, and this is quality music-- but strange.<br /><br />This is, for the most part, where I'm at still.  The beginning of the album has begun to make sense to me.  \\"Heritage\\" is a nice little intro.  \\"The Devil's Orchard\\" and \\"I Feel the Dark\\" are decent Opeth songs, although not among their classics (to me, anyway).  \\"Slither\\" is something else entirely.  It's almost simple and straightforward-- and enjoyable enough, as it provides a bit of balance-- because there is nothing straightforward about the rest of the collection.<br /><br />\\"Nepenthe\\", \\"Haxprocess\\", and \\"Famine\\" are growing on me one two-minute section at a time, and \\"Folklore\\" really lifts up the album's latter section.  The outro to this song is among the best two minutes of music this band has ever recorded.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I don't love this CD as much as I love every one of this band's other releases, I am giving it four stars because it IS good music, and Opeth, I feel, have earned the right to experiment and receive the benefit of the doubt.  Mikael may not be growling like a spawn of Satan on thisalbum, and the overall tone of the music may be softer, but this collection is by no means an appeal to the pop charts.  It's an ode to progressive rock, and it's definitely among the most challenging music they've ever released.  I do not understand, at all, those giving it one star.  To constitute one star, I'd think the music you're listening to would have to be bad, as in: generic, repetitive, void of substance, bland, laughable...  This is NOT bad music-- I simply don't see how anyone can call it that.  Not your cup of tea?  Okay.  From the dark side of the moon, even for Opeth...  I agree.  But bad?  As in, garbage, which is what one star theoretically means?  I have to disagree.<br /><br />If you're willing, and you've been with this band for years, I think you should give it time.  Lots of time.  At least a few of the tracks will begin to grab you after just a few listens.  And the rest of the album will probably start to make a bit of sense, too-- it has for me, anyway.<br /><br />I've also discovered that Heritage makes for excellent \\"thinking music.\\"  It's as good as the most abstract moments from Radiohead if you're needing something to play in the background while you're writing your masterpiece or just needing an hour or so to let your mind wander.
030758836X|5.0|I liked the other two books by this author so I purchased this one with high expectations. It was great! I bought one for my girl friend as well and we read it together and she loved it too. Very creative mind this Gillian Flynn has.
0425263916|5.0|This book is a great read!  It's full of suspense, desire, passion, great sex, sadness.  I also read the 2nd book in the CrossFire series and I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Looking forward to reading final book!
0307341550|5.0|This was the first one that I ready by Gillian Flynn. It was excellent. I purchased her other two as well and they too were equally enjoyable.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I love this movie.  I've been disappointed as of late with Amazon's streaming quality. The movie glitched a couple of times and I even had to restart Amazon to get it out of deep freeze.
0307341577|5.0|I very much enjoyed it and purchased two others by Gillian Flynn (both just as good). Would recommend to anyone.
0679805273|5.0|The advantage of this book is that you end up giving the gift of BELIEF and WONDER between the pages. I suggest you place 3 checks in the pages for the same amount but dated 3 years apart. The person receiving the gift will not only think about you and starting their next journey but it's always later when they'll need the money.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I just want to make it clear that I am NOT a horror movie fan. At all. They don't do anything for me. Probably, it's the lack of any real story in them, because, really, what kind of story do you need for a guy to go around killing people in the most gruesome ways possible? And, then, there's the gore, which is not something I need in my life. I mean, I went to see Punisher: Warzone (at the theater!), and that may have scarred me for life. Of course, that may as well have been a horror movie considering the lack of story and the excessive gore. I can count on one hand the number of horror movies that I've seen and thought they were pretty good: Halloween (the very first one, which I saw when I was a kid (I'm pretty sure it was an edited for TV version) over at a friend's house) and April Fool's Day (which I didn't want to watch, but I was kind of stuck at a party, so it was either watch the movie or go sit in a room by myself), which is worth it  for the ending. Okay, so that didn't even take a hand.<br /><br />That being said, I love Alan Tudyk. Even before Firefly, I thought he was awesome as Steve the Pirate in Dodgeball, and that's where I recognized him from when we finally watched Firefly. Besides, how can you not love a guy that was in Spamalot? As Lancelot, no less, the Cleese character in Holy Grail (or one of them, anyway). So I was really torn when I saw he was in Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, but what a great title, right?<br /><br />I'm glad I finally broke down and watched it. Yeah, yeah, it has plenty of gore, but it's not exactly the mindless gore of your typical horror/gorefest movie. I mean, in Tucker and Dale, you're busy being shocked or trying not to laugh while it's going on. Like when [spoiler] the \\"stupid college kid\\" throws himself into the wood chipper. Trying to laugh, or not to laugh, while being horrified is maybe not as easy as it sounds.<br /><br />Alan Tudyk is, of course, awesome, but so is Tyler Labine as Dale. They have a great buddy chemistry going, but, really, the success of the film is rooted Labine's performance as the best friend and the romantic lead as he chases after Katrina Bowden (from 30 Rock) as Allison, who is also quite good. Jesse Moss pulls off the preppy jerk and could have walked right out of any number of 80's flicks.<br /><br />The true genius of the film is that it takes the idea of a \\"comedy of errors\\" and mixes it up flawlessly with the horror genre. It makes me wonder why no one else has ever done this. Or maybe they have, and I just never heard of it, but I'm more inclined to think this kind of thing hasn't been done before. All of the classic horror movie pieces are there: group of college kids going off into the woods, spooky warning from a creepy cop about how \\"you shouldn't go there,\\" and a \\"ghost\\" story as a backdrop. Really, I was all set up for the typical horror movie and wasn't actually sure I'd watch the whole thing, even with Tudyk in it.<br /><br />But you can tell there's something else going on from the beginning, you're just not quite sure what it is.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|There is something satisfying about slowly building and managing a town by a little bit each day.  There are enough disasters and illnesses to present challenges while in the meantime you get to design and redesign your own Dr. Quinn experience.
B007REV4YI|4.0|On the surface, Skyfall is a really excellent movie.That's because it's a really excellent movie. If you take it as an individual movie and forget that James Bond already exists. That includes forgetting the previous two Daniel Craig Bond films. As an individual movie, it really only has one flaw: its title. The title is a lie and has nothing to do with the movie at all.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I hear those of you out there that have already seen it saying, \\"But...\\" (and I'm not finishing that sentence, because I'm avoiding the spoiler). It seems pretty obvious to me that the title was arrived at completely separately from the movie. Something like:<br />\\"Wouldn't Skyfall be a cool title?\\"<br />\\"Sure, but it has nothing to do with the movie.\\"<br />\\"Well, can't we work it in somehow?\\"<br />So, yeah, the \\"word\\" was just thrown into the movie so that it could be used as a title and has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. I felt a little bit cheated by that. But not really enough for it to take away from the movie experience overall. It's sort of like the pricker you get in your finger while picking blackberries; it's annoying, but it's not gonna keep you from enjoying the cobbler.<br /><br />So for the movie itself:<br />The action was great. There was only one bit that I thought really strained plausibility (it had to do with a subway train), so that was pretty good. But, then, these new Bond films have been better at \\"keeping it real\\" than some of the older ones.<br /><br />The acting was great. Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and, of course, Judi Dench is just great. Ralph Fiennes is also in this one, and he was surprisingly good. I say \\"surprisingly\\" because, while he can be great, he is not always great, and this seemed like the kind of role where he was more expected to look good rather than be good, but he was quite good, and I'm glad that his character is one that will (should) be returning.<br /><br />The tech... well... there's a lot of computer stuff in this, hacking and all sorts of things like that, and, mostly, that was okay, but...<br />So I was there with my IT/techie friend, and there's this scene where Q is explaining some computer something-or-other with a lot of technobabble, and my friend just starts laughing. Not LOLing or anything, just a sustained chuckle. So I know whatever he was going on about was gibberish, because my friend does the whole computer thing. I'm fairly technologically challenged (just ask my wife), so I probably wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been laughing; I mean, I don't know what they're going on about either way. Well, except for the part where I just sort of assume that it's all meaningless technobabble anyway.<br /><br />However, as much as I enjoyed it as an individual movie, I was more than a little let down with the movie in terms of its relationship to the other Bond films. There are two main reasons for this:<br /><br />1. With Casino Royale and the re-boot of the Bond franchise, they created an ongoing story line. Quantum of Solace, while not the greatest Bond film as an individual movie, was an excellent continuation of that story. It felt like they were putting things in place for something really cool, and I was intrigued by where they were going. With Skyfall, though, they just drop that whole story line and, at the moment, have no plans to go back to it. This is incredibly disappointing, and, for that reason, despite how good Skyfall is on its own, it is, itself, also disappointing.<br /><br />2. Skyfall feels like even more of a re-boot than Casino. There is a grasp in this one to make this Bond the definitive Bond. The Bond. An attempt to sweep away all earlier versions, while still giving a nod to them, and actually make this 007 James Bond. I can't be more explicit than that without giving spoilers, but I just want to say that I wasn't entirely happy with this aspect of the movie in relation to the other Bond movies. Casino did a fine job of updating the franchise andsetting up a new sequence of movies. There was no need to go even further back and attempt to shove all the other movies aside.<br /><br />But, still, all by itself, Skyfall is well worth seeing.<br />Just ignore that the time frame of the opening events doesn't quite match up, and all should be well. Maybe, I shouldn't have pointed that out, though.
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|I felt this movie had a very good story line and the voice actors were excellent, however the style of animation is not my cup of tea. Unfortunately the cover art doesn't represent the animation style. For younger viewers and fans of this genre of animation, this movie is for you.<br /><br />There is one really interesting thing in the plot and that is Batman ends up basically forming his own League of Shadows if you will. He is fulfilling Ra's Al Ghul's expectations for him.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|Greetings, Programs...<br /><br />It doesn't always take great writing to make a great film. Of course, I'm sure there are many out there that would argue that Tron is not a great film. I don't feel like debating the definition of greatness, at the moment, though, so I'm just going to say that based upon it's cultural impact and cult status, it's a great film. After all, how many movies get an actual sequel after almost 30 years. Not a re-boot. Not a re-make. An honest to goodness sequel. It's almost a singular achievement (it may be a singular achievement, for all I know).<br /><br />Tron is the movie that opened the door to computer generated special effects. In fact, John Lasseter has said that without Tron there would have been no Toy Story as it was Tron that opened his eyes to the potential of computer animation. Despite that, Tron contains far less computer generated material than most people might suspect, but what was there was completely new, much of which was never used again due to the costs involved. Interestingly enough, Tron was not even nominated for a special effects Oscar possibly because of the use of computers, which was considered \\"cheating\\" by many in the Academy, at the time.<br /><br />The story of Tron is fairly straightforward and ironically appropriate for Disney. The conflict revolves around a corporation (Encom) taking advantage of the little guy (Kevin Flynn) by stealing his work and the little guy trying to prove the work is actually his. Even at 12, when the movie came out, I knew that the story was just the vehicle to get Flynn into the \\"digital\\" world of the computer so they could show off their stuff. Still, it's a solid plot even if it's not original. We still seem to be having issues with that aspect of corporate greed in America, so I can't say it's not a story that needs to be told anymore. They may have done better to have centered Tron: Legacy on that same type of story since it opens with those same overtones, but Disney isn't brave enough to do that story again, or, perhaps, realizes it's a message that strikes at the heart of their business model, so they abandon it as soon as the younger Flynn enters The Grid.<br /><br />There is, however, one bit of story genius that I was struck with at the time, and it has always stayed with me. This one thing made the movie for me, made it great in my mind, as it completely fascinated me at 12. I thought it was SO cool, and, yet, most people miss it entirely (along with the significance of it within the confines of the story), and some have even argued that it didn't happen that way at all. The key to the weight of the story of Tron is getting Flynn into the digital world himself. Flynn is our connection, the eyes that allow us to see this digital world as real. But they have to get him inside the computer. Utilizing another emerging technology (lasers), they have him zapped by a laser that is being developed as a quantum teleportation device. Early in the movie, we get to witness this laser being tested on an orange. The process only takes a few seconds. Zap target with laser. Digitize target. Reintegrate target. The implication, then, is that Flynn's sojourn in the digital world happens within this span of a few seconds.  [They support this idea in the sequel by quantifying the time discrepancy, although I'm not remembering the ratio, right off the top of my head.] It was a fabulous notion.<br /><br />Still, it took time for Tron to really grow on me. And repeated exposure to the video games. There was, of course, the Tron arcade game, which made more money than the movie. We owned it for our Atari. Although I liked the game, it was never one of my favorites. However, Discs of Tron... that one, I loved. It was more than just a joystick game. None of my friends liked it because it was \\"too hard,\\" and, indeed, it was one of the most complex games around. For years. But I loved it. Except for one thing, it wasn't just a quarter to play it. I don't remember what the actual cost was, but I remember being constantly put off by the fact that it cost so much. However, when I was in college, they put a Discs of Tron in the student center (at the one quarter/play cost) during my freshman year, and I ruled that game. Literally. Not only did I have the high score, but no one could beat me at head-to-head play, either. I was extremely sad when they removed the game at the beginning of my sophomore year. For that game alone, Tron holds a special place of nostalgia in my heart.<br /><br />And, then, there's Jeff Bridges. Between Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, Bridges had a lot of competition back when I was 12, but I noticed him, which is saying a lot. I noticed him more with Starman in 1984, but it was Tucker: The Man and His Dream that really convinced me of how great an actor he is. I spent my 20s telling people that he was the most underrated actor in Hollywood, and I wasn't wrong. It's great that he's now getting the recognition that he's deserved for so long. The fact that he has been so instrumental in the return of Tron says a lot both for whom he is and the film. The legacy of Tron.<br /><br />My boys were immediately excited when they heard there was going to be a sequel (to the original), and the initial trailers for it sent them both into a frenzy of excitement over it. It's hard to fault them for that. The trailers were nearly as visually stunning as the movie. And it was. Visually stunning. The film is worth seeing just as a visual masterpiece, and it was... well, it was spectacular in 3D. It's true that the plot is a bit more contrived and, therefore, weaker than the plot for the original, but, again, the story is really only there as a vehicle to display the digital landscape they've created. I will say, though, that it's only upon reflection that the holes in the story become apparent. Bridges' talent is enough to make everything believable, and Garrett Hedlund, who plays Flynn's son, is more than adequate in supporting him. Truthfully, the film is dazzling enough just on its own that it's hard to contemplate any weaknesses while watching it. At least on  the big screen.<br /><br />end of line

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This one of the best books I have read. I can't wait to read the second book. Suzanne Collins did an amazing job capturing the struggles of Katnis and Peeta, throughout the fight and love moments. I recommend this book to more mature readers thought because of the violence. I love this book and hope many people enjoy reading it as much as I did.<br />(Warning this is a book that you can't put down. I read it in one day!)

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Sorry, there's no way I can add anything insightful to the already many excellent reviews.  This is 5 star work and essential sci-fi, up there with the great works of the genre.<br /><br />Also appreciated greatly is the author's commitment to his readers, evident on his whole approach to putting out omnibus editions for lower cost immediately on completion of the last volume, and making his e-books available so cheaply.  Kindle + Amazon + authors like this circumvent the excessive charges that you might otherwise pay here in Australia...
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This movie is great.  It has a fantastic plot line and a great cast as well.  I would recommend this movie to any of my friends.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this place even tho I tried to avoid it. Finally went on Pinterest because my sister-in-law was pinning things and I needed a gift idea for her. Since then I have gotten so many good receipes and pattern ideas. Also, some of the photography is just scrumptious.

0307730697|5.0|If you're interested in American heroes and Navy SEALs then read this book.  It ranks among my favorites - along with Lone Survivor, American Sniper, and No Easy Day.
111846446X|5.0|I had already bought the Kindle version of this book, but decided that I needed it in paper form.  It is a really good basic user guide for the raspberry pi.  There are some things that I wish it had, such as more detailed and basic information on python, but that is why I also purchased a python programming book.  Not to mention any supplemental information can be found in just a few seconds by searching the internet.  Good book for beginners.

B0086HGW42|5.0|Just when you get bored listening to that one or few favorite artist(s) comes along a new one who blows you away with an eclectic blend all their own...I'd consider Ed an Urban Folk style artist who is very talented and knows how to mix things up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great game that is worth your time it may be hard at first but you will catch on fast.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|this movie was pretty good.it had the wild west theme spot on.but the aliens were not so good .looked like the aliens in men in black. i would grade this a b+.plot was good.the acting was really great.this is deffently a different twist to alien movies.which makes it interesting on how people of the 1800s would deal with aliens.
B00A992NDO|4.0|I read that this album was 70s inspired, which I don't get at all. It's similar to her last album - lots of upbeat, fun tempos. It loses a star only because I loved Cannibal more, but it does not disappoint. &#34;Thinking of You&#34; and &#34;Dirty Love&#34; are definitely highlights.
0545265355|4.0|I really love the book it kept me interested in what was going to happen next.I will keep this book and read it again. It was very exciting.
B00A12Z264|3.0|A lot of good songs on this album and a huge improvement from Bionic, which except for about three songs, was crap. I'm so over her I-look-so-good-and-I-hate-men-and-they-should-bow-to-me lyrics and this album has a lot less of that and much catchier beats.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy this game! Some of the levels really make you think. This game appears to be childish, but don't let it fool you. It can be quite challenging.
B005LAII0I|5.0|This movie had an interesting twist on Snow White. The acting was excellent, and I really enjoyed it. The DVD was in good shape.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the game. Its very good though it can be a little confusing. Its graphics could use an improvement on its graphics though.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|After at least 15 years without reading a complete book, this was the first book I picked up.  I simply loved it too!  It was recommended to me by my son-in-law so I thought I'd give it a shot.  He's a good egg and a very bright and successful young man that I have a lot in common with.  He was right, this book has everything a good read should have.  It's full of suspense, mystery, unpredictablity and a little bit of love too.  Loved the beginning and learning about the main character and the ending of this story wasn't what I was expecting.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Picked this game up for free. Not a farmville clone or anything like that. It is pretty fun though, a nice little time sink. I would recomend it to my friends.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I just finished reading this beautiful novel and must say that it was a great read! The story has such wonderful ties to family & discovering ones-self & the true meaning of home. This is my third Kate Morton book & I have not been disappointed by her ability to bring her characters to life. She is a very talented writer, in my opinion. If you enjoy historical fiction with ties to the present, you will enjoy Morton's work. I've already purchased The Secret Keeper and am looking forward to what I'm sure will be another great story!
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I've always wanted to buy this movie and watch it on Groundhog Day every year. So clich&eacute;. Upon seeing the anniversary edition with the documentary and Ramis interview, I thought it would be a good one to get. I was not disappointed.  I learned a lot about marmots and the making of the film.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun to check on once or twice a day. Lots of animations with animals. Easy to earn acorns without spending real money. Boring after a bit so it's best to only play for a few minutes like a fish tank game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game and is a great time waster! I would definetly recomend this app. Beware though it is VERYY addicting
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the next to best thing if you don't have a Kindle.  I love being able to have books on my phone!
