B0032JTV74|4.0|The first season of Glee is one of those wonderful discoveries: a show that cleverly written and produced, that showcases some really great talent.<br /><br />My rating loses a star not for the show, but for Fox's Blu-ray mastering. The Blu-ray discs take an unreasonable amount of time to load -- about 2 minutes on my player -- and selecting each show or bonus feature brings an additional wait time of about 30 seconds before the presentation begins. I have some slow-loading Blu-rays in my collection, but this one is excruciatingly painful to wait for.<br /><br />The bonus features are interesting, but somewhat anemic. Many of them have been available on the Internet previous to the video release, and the ones that are new are fairly short and don't provide much detail. Strangely, Matthew Morrison, who plays the lead character of Will Schuester, doesn't appear in any of the bonus material. More information about the show's origins and the actors' CVs would have been nice, considering the size and scope of the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />Get Glee on video, but my recommendation is that you save yourself the money and aggravation and buy the DVD set.

0307454541|5.0|What an exciting heroine is found in Lizbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvish.  The story is amazing and incorporates more than just a ficticious plot.  The social and moral areas addressed in this book can be seen vicariously in the country where I live!  It's so unfortunate that we will not be hearing from this author any more.
B002ZG981E|5.0|A sort of blend of the Matrix with Dark City combined with a heist flick and a third act with a big nod to James Bond.    People make too much of \\"What was the ending?!!!\\"  Or trying to decode everything like it's \\"Lost.\\"    Not only is the cast first-rate and the score amazing, the visuals are truly stunning (even if you saw the ads on TV already) and the elevator scene, when she walks into the dead silent hotel room, makes the hairs on your arms stand up.    A movie like this is MADE for viewing on blu-ray and HD TV.  The best combination action/thoughtful film since, well... The Dark Knight.  Upon viewing multiple times, you catch something new with each spin.    That said, the blu-ray version of this is just ridiculous to look at.  Almost every seen drops you with its cinematography and the crystal-clear video/audio.  The aerial shots in particular are stunning, and the sound quality is perfect (important in that the score is like a character in itself to this film).    The extras are quite satisfying, particularly the \\"making of\\" segments, which unlock your \\"how did they do that?\\" questions but briefly enough so that it doesn't take all the mystery out of the movie.    Just like everybody bought The Matrix when they got their first DVD player because you just had to see it at that quality, this is a must-own for blu-ray enthusiasts.  Having seen it about 10 times now, it certainly has held up since I last saw it in the theatre.
0525951652|1.0|After Pillars of the Earth, I was waiting for this book with bated breath. What a disappointment! I thought the character development was poor, and too much of the book involved historical fact rather than incorporating fiction with the history. I can read non-fiction history books but I find them dry and lifeless. That's what this was. It was painful for me to finish it, but I'm not one to quit easily. In retrospect, I should have given up earlier and moved onto something more enjoyable and captivating.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This priceless documentary presents a devastating expose of the staggering Wall Street swindle that caused the economic meltdown of 2008. The interview with Martin Feldstein brought back to mind the hoopla of his appointment as chief economic adviser to President Reagan. The movie points out that Feldstein initiated the financial deregulation follies that led to the looting of the Savings and Loans and culminated with the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, the lead sponsor of which was Senator Phil Gramm. It was truly depressing to see how this massive swindle was pulled off through the collusion of the economic advisers, politicians, high-flown professors of economics with scandalous and highly unethical conflicts-of-interest, investment banks, and ratings agencies. At the end of \\"Inside Job,\\" Robert Gnaizda lists various groups that should be prosecuted. When asked why this has not been done, he answered: \\"It's a Wall Street government!\\"<br /><br />Some of the topics in the movie were covered in the FRONTLINE broadcast \\"Inside the Meltdown\\" and in the FRONTLINE broadcast \\"The Warning.\\" The latter exposed how Brookley Born was sabotaged by Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers--the Troika that is directly responsible for the massive fraud perpetrated by the Wall Street crowd.<br /><br />It is reassuring to see that some members of Congress were competent. Senator Byron Dorgan (D. North Dakota) voted against his own party, predicting that the repeal of Glass-Steagall would lead to massive taxpayer bailouts. On 19 September 2009, Senator Dorgan was interviewed by Scott Simon on \\"Weekend Edition Saturday.\\" The following is from the transcript at:<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Sen. DORGAN: Well, I mean, it does precious little to say I told you so, but this was 10 years ago on the floor of the U.S. Senate. At the time, I said I thought it was a huge mistake and, you know, I was critical of the Clinton administration and critical of the Republicans in Congress who were pushing it.<br /><br />But what I said is I think within a decade we're going to see massive taxpayer bailouts. I didn't necessarily know that for sure but it turns out my prognostication was a pretty expensive lesson. Because it made no sense that we should repeal Glass-Steagall and the protections that were put in place after the Great Depression.<br /><br />And the result of that, in my judgment, was to steer this economy into the ditch and cause a significant economic wreck that's going to take us some time to get out of.<br /><br />SIMON: The timing is something that intrigues me, 'cause you said this in 1999, whereas you note your party was in party.<br /><br />Sen. DORGAN: Uh-huh. Well, but let me just say to you that the legislation that was passed by the Congress was called Gramm-Leach-Bliley--all three Republicans. Phil Gramm--those three Republicans led the approach. It was Republican legislation but warmly embraced by President Clinton, Secretary of Treasury Rubin and so on.<br /><br />But I was one of eight U.S. senators that went to the floor of the Senate repeatedly in opposition to what they were doing. And, you know, as I said, I made some prognostications and say if we do this we're going to see massive taxpayer bailouts in the future.<br /><br />And unfortunately, that has been the case.>><br /><br />\\"Inside Job\\" goes much deeper in exposing the extensive unethical conduct and shameless conflicts-of-interest of so many professors of economics, especially Frederic Mishkin, a governor at the Federal Reserve until August 2008 and now at Columbia University. According to the movie, he co-authored a fraudulent paper \\"The Stability of Icelandic Banks,\\" without divulging that he had been paid $124,000 by the Iceland Chamber of Commerce to write it. In his current list of publications, he has changed the title to \\"The Instability ...\\" John Campbell, the chairman of Harvard's department of economics is left speechless--with a bewildered facial expression--when he is asked about the conflicts-of-interest of his department members.<br /><br />How can anyone believe anything that is published by economists?red facial expression--when he is asked about the conflicts-of-interest of his department members.<br /><br />How can anyone believe anything that is published by economists?

B0007Y08QA|2.0|I had never heard of this film until i was browsing on IMDB about Christian Bale and what movies he has starred in. Mainly because i had never really seen him in a lot until the whole Batman Begins deal. I really enjoyed him in that and a few other films, but this just for one, doesnt seem like him, and two, doesnt feel like a movie he should or would play in. Losing an alarming 63lbs for a role in a film is just plain crazy, and for a long time you really forget who you are watching, sometimes he looks more like an mal-nutrition(ed) Ethan Hawke than himself. So i really just couldnt get into it, that being one of the reasons. It just didn't feel right. Also the story is very mixed up, and doesnt mesh together well. First off he never really says why he hasn't slept in a year, or the cause of his weight loss, only towards the end of the film do you (sort of) get a taste of a possible reason. A lot of the set up scenarios, notes, accidents, hallucinations of a man not there, and several other details really leave you wondering through most of the film, scratching your head saying ok, what in the world is going on? I love good twist's and also movies that go in a weird direction, but this film just veers off from side to side to much and has no real consistency.     As much as i wanted to like the film i got about an hour or so into and just started to become uninterested, and at some points down right bored. As i scanned through the last half hour or so, i just wanted to see what this all added up to. Well i was seriously disappointed that it really just didn't come together for me, like a lot of lose ends throughout. Christian Bale is a fine actor, and he really did a good job for what this movie was(is). I just prefer him in other films, not so, well(twisted) would be a good word. So if you watch the film, i guess you had to be more objective than myself, i for one really like these kinds of movies, but this one was an exception. Mainly because of a really convoluted plot, and mixed pot storyline. So sorry i have to give this such a low rating, i had high hopes, sad to say the movie is as thin as the character himself.
B0040QYROA|5.0|The film Metropolis has been a major obsession of mine since viewing a documentary on the old 1960's series The Twentieth Century hosted by Walter Cronkite that if memory serves me correctly was entitled \\"Science Fact or Fiction\\".  Only a clip of Metropolis was shown at the time but that clip of the hero Freder going below the city and seeing the machines and the humans tied to them that actually ran the city haunted me for years.  To me those machine had to lay at the bottom of the poles that \\"The Jetsons\\" twenty first century homes rested on.  In those pre video or dvd days there was no way for an elementary school kid to view a silent German film.  So instead I read everything I could on the film including the novelization.  It was not until the late 70's that I was able to view a print of Metropolis and that was through a PBS airing.  This was the standard abridged print that was in circulation at the time.  It was not until the release of the Giorgio Moroder reconstruction in the 1980's  did I feel I had actually seen the real Metropolis.  I purchased that version on VSH tape as soon as it became availible.  I later even bought a copy of the inferior earlier release on DVD so that I could compare the two.  In 2002 I dragged a friend to the theater to watch that latest reconstruction and was just below away by it.  Never had Metropolis made more sense (outside of the novelization).  As soon as that version became availible on DVD I purchased it.  My friend warned me that I had better wait before buying this release because he felt more missing footage might be found.  Knowing the history of the film as well as I did I couldn't believe a more complete cut of the film could ever be presented.  Now about eight years later I learned that a complete print of the film had been found.  I knew that as soon as this print became availible for home use I would be purchasing it for my collection.  No other film has ever had this effect on me and once my Amazon copy arrivesit will be the f4th release of the film that I own.  Only 2001 and Forbidden Planet (1 pan and scan version of both film plus 2 DVD version - the second DVD versions of both films were only bought for the extras) come close to the number of homes releases of a single film that I own.  Let others waste their money on the latest release of Avator.  For my money Metropolis is the only film deserving of these multiple releases.  NOTE:  No I have not talked about the plot of the film - you wouldn't be reading this if you didn't already have some knowledge of it.

B00418NXBK|5.0|Have been anticipating this CD since KOL began playing tracks on their 2010 tour beginninig in Atlantic City ealier this year, I was not at all let down with this 5th CD. what I was most suprised was on the Bonus CD the track Celebration. starting out with a George Harrison \\"guru\\" rift Calebs vocals scorch in the sexiest tonees, there is a Led Zepplin feel that plays throughout the song. Unlike anything Kings of Leon has ever put out. But to get back to the Main Cd itself. I head them perform live Radioactive, Mary, \\"Southbound\\" er... Back Down South and The Immortals this past summer and was expecting to be let down by the studio version... in no  measure did that happen. Even YouTubing Pick Up Truck and loving that live version did not compare to hearing the slower tempo studio track. this album has everything their past Cds have, great lyrics, heartbreaking melodies , original and tasty guitar work and Calebs unique and sensual vocals. I wish there would have been an   \\"Arizona\\" or \\"On Call\\" super anthemic cut on CAS the closest would be \\"the Immortals\\" in that respect. My favorites at the moment are \\"Mi Amigo\\"  and \\"The Face\\" the latter so hauntingly beautiful and poetic, it stands up against anything they have previously recorded. The only let down on this CD for me is \\"No Money\\".  I know when I make my own personal  mix, this will be one track I will not use.  otherwise all in all...Five Stars for me!

Brilliantly done.<br />Think \\"Scary Movie\\", but not utterly idiotic and stupid.<br />There's some suspense which I guess classifies this as a mild horror movie (keep in mind, I wasn't scared at all during this movie, I don't think it's a real horror, it's more of a comedy). But more than anything is the humor which is just excellent.<br />Characters are all quite awesome.

Only bad thing I can say after reading this book is that it is just awful that we have to wait almost a full year for the next installment.    Great read and definitely worth the $18 for those considering purchasing!

0385523386|1.0|My bookclub selected this book to read and all 10 of us were extremely disappointed.  The book was filled with nonsensical stories of Piper Kerman's prison time.  We tried to like her, but she made it very difficult by constantly letting us know that she was better than anyone in prison. \\"I had a fantastic private attorney and a country club suit to go with my blond bob.\\" There were countless references to Smith College and her obvious intellectual superiority.  If her family and friends were so perfect as she portrays them in the book, then how did she ever end up in the drug world to begin with? It would have been interesting to learn about her life after prison.  Was it difficult to get a job with a prison record and did Larry ever resent her for turning his life upside down?  Sadly, I paid full price for this book.  It would have been nice if Piper donated a portion of the proceeds from this book to an education program at the Danbury Prison or books for the prisoners to read.  I was hoping she would have learned how fortunate she is in life and wanted to give back to those less fortunate, but that is not the case.

B00005R24K|4.0|\\"The ultimate experience in horror and gore\\" is what Evil Dead claims to be. I would have to agree. While it might have less plot, story, or interesting characters as other horror movies have, it achieves what it claims to be, and does horror and gore better than most movies to date, pulling it off with humor and style.           The movie is a remarkable achievement for its budget and filmmakers' level of experience. A few college students with an investor-given budget of $375,000 filmed it. They traveled to a cabin in the woods and made a funny, gory, and certainly scary monster movie.          During the movie, four teens spend the night at a cabin, without a clue of the horrors that await them. When they open the lavishly designed Book of the Dead, the terror is unleashed and evil spirits consume the youths one by one. They become monsters, and taunt the ones who haven't by making themselves human at times.          The special effects are quite an eye-filler, especially given the cheap animation they used it with. Performances are decent, but the monsters are the real show-stealer. It's easy to see why this was a cult classic from its 1982 to this day.

As Far As Voice & Music,  Convicting Content. However, Id agree there is a little truth to every lie. The Writer Uses Nonfactual Catch Phrases Like, The oceans are being depleted of all resources, and makes meat consumption out to be criminal as a result of the oil driven production. For those who have seen it.. Men did eat and enjoy meat long before oil driven production. So i wouldn't rush out of conviction to become a vegetarian over it. How Is it possible that this writer can tell us how much reserve & resources are in the earth when it is radically impossible to say. Definitely Not Denial.. Just common sense. Other quotes tell a horror story of fish that are out of existence because they never had time to reproduce.And The Most Ridiculous is the quote \\"All fish stocks are threatened with exhaustion & 3/4 of all fishing grounds on the planet are in use. What about the ocean? The massive spending on global warming ideas in one year alone could give every village in Africa Electricity & Running water.I'm sure the writer believes in her message, however most humans & mainstream scientists who don't apply for \\"Green Funding\\" for their research would agree that this is another film in attempt to justify carbon taxation by driving fiction fear into the viewers.One cow turd puts out as much carbon as multiple suv's running constant for 24 hours.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|When Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) thought Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was making them a web site called Harvard Connection, he was busy making Face Book. They gave him the idea to make a site different than MySpace where students can connect, find other students and blog. Instead of admitting that he stole their idea, he just says he improved upon it.<br /><br />  The Winklevoss' get tired of seeing how popular Facebook has become and that they haven't seen one cent and decide to sue Zuckerberg. In the beginning of the film, we learn that Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) is also suing Zuckerberg. Through-out the film the movie goes back and forth from the lawsuit to what led to the lawsuit. So the viewer, witnesses how Zuckerberg and Saverin go from bestfriends and business partners to bitter enermies.<br /><br />  The trouble starts between them when Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the creator of Napster, comes on board. He feeds Zuckerberg's already enormous ego and makes it even bigger. He makes Zuckerberg think there is an \\"I\\" in team and that he doesn't need any partners. Which isn't fair to Saverin, since Zuckerberg already took his money to get the site running and also promised him that he'll be CEO.<br /><br />  I never thought that a film about the creation of Facebook could actually be engaging and interesting, but Social Network proved me wrong. It's fun to see everything we use every day on Face Book, planned out and discussed. I couldn't help but smile, when I heard Zuckerberg or Parker brainstorming on ideas like tagging \\"where you can label your friends or family members in pictures\\" or when Zuckerberg comes up with the idea to add relationship status to profiles. The film is surprisingly solid due to the fine work by the entire cast, the smart screenplay and the fine direction by David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac).<br /><br />  Other than that, the film is over-rated, it's a good film about Facebook but I wouldn't call it a classic or the best film of 2010. While, even the music is over-rated. The score works for the movie but other than that it's nothing too special. I think my 7 year old niece could play it on a piano lol.

B003YNFYCO|5.0|Anyway you look at it there are people who don't want all of the Beatles recordings. That's why this collection is so necessary. It's really not a greatest hits. It's more of a sampler. The songs cover the years beautifully.<br />The chronological tracklist order the sets utilize is smart and ultimately logical, illuminating the group's snowballing artistic development throughout its career as well as accounting for the various advents made in recording technology throughout the 1960s (many pioneered by the Beatles themselves) that make songs captured to tape in 1969 sound markedly different from those laid down in 1963. It all starts inauspiciously enough with the band's debut single \\"Love Me Do\\", a pleasant yet slight ditty. Things really start to get cooking with the second track \\"Please Please Me\\"--where primary songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney deftly ratchet up the excitement level in a standard verse-chorus-bridge song structure--and hit the first real high-water mark with the irresistible \\"She Loves You\\", which features a chorus for the ages. After that, it's clear sailing through hit after hit, songs get longer, the lyrics expand beyond love-based topics, the drums become more prominent, Indian influences begin to seep in, those career-making harmonies become deployed less often, lead guitarist George Harrison emerges as a masterful songwriter in his own right, and so on. Although the sets were originally compiled with the vinyl format in mind--which explains why songs from the same studio album do not always follow their original sequential order and why the consummate album opening number \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" shows up in the middle of the first CD--both compilations flow beautifully in compact disc form without the benefit of having for flip a disc over to create a break in the listening experience.
B002ZG9846|5.0|You are either going to love this movie or hate it. I loved it. Violent, bloody, funny --- all about homegrown wannabe superheroes who have no powers except for an 11-year-old killer and her father who have trained to destroy the bad guys. And they do. From its opening scene to its wild conclusion, this is escape entertainment of the first order.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|To make it short this album is  pure pop bliss.   The talented vocals are like if Michael Jackson met Jason Mraz.  It has 10 solid tracks, and very catchy melodies.  The styles vary from reggae to some R&B elements all done in a pop format.  It also guest stars Damian Marley, and Cee Lo Green to add more spice.  Matter a fact it might be the in top 5 most enjoyable album I've heard in 2010.
B000GRUS22|5.0|It's awesome. It is different from some of the previous Enigma albums, in a new and refreshing way. It is still flavored with the touches that make Enigma so awesome. You will definately know it's Enigma, new and today! I now have all their albums in one huge playlist on my iPhone, Nano and shuffle and it's awesome to listen without interuption to all the songs of Enigma and upon getting to this last album it really is a great finish!
B002ZG98XW|5.0|From the very beginning, this movie is very realistic and meticulous attention is given to every little detail,even down to the foal standing up with Red's markings! This movie will have you laughing, cheering( for Penny)and sitting on your edge of the seat for the racing scenes! It's like you're at the track watching Secretariat make history. The actors are all just perfect for this movie, and I love John Malkovich in his role as the trainer. If you love horses, this is your movie. If you think women rock, this is your movie. If you root for the underdog, this is your movie. If you love history, this is your movie.  \\"Secretariat\\" has so many dynamics at play and you catch little historical tidbits, such as the coin toss,which make it even more interesting! This is a great family movie, even for non-horsey people, as it chronicles the rise of a national celebrity who saved his farm and captured a nation by doing what he did best-running. He made believers out of non-believers and became a household name by doing what few horses can achieve,winning the Triple Crown. None of his offspring were running champions like he was, but many were stellar show horses.  The racing scenes are incredible, and I felt like I was there watching him run- that was a real treat.  And when you watch it, watch the credits. They tell you where what happened to all the key players afterwards, and show Penny Tweedy in the movie as a spectator sitting behind Diane Lane!
B00006CXSS|3.0|i wanted to see this very bad when i got it in the mail there was no disk one the seller told me they had put this on the buying info but i did not see this i buy alot of stuff from amazon i dont want this to happen again
B003ZJJHWK|2.0|This may be a good place to start when exploring Antony's challenging body of work, but as someone very familiar with the complexities of The Crying Light and I Am a Bird Now, this was a real let-down. The song's seem uninspired, and carelessly minimalistic. While their are a few highlights on the album (\\"Swanlights\\" and \\"Ghost\\" come to mind), they are not strong enough to carry the dead weight that is the rest of the album. If this is a new direction for Antony, I hope he either takes some ques from his earlier work or gives us a stronger album justifying this change.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love Big Bang. I am a 30 minute comedy series avid watcher. This is a very good show. Lots of new things to laugh about. Not the same old jokes. Its a very \\"smart\\" show though. They use a lot of science jargon. I have got to have them all.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Lets just knock out the few bad items first. The bluray menu is annoying and close to frustrating to operate. Text is half cut off and you may hit the \\"left\\" arrow on your remote and instead of going to the next item on the current pop-up, it takes you back to another option you never wanted. It's hard to explain unless you do it. sorry.<br />Another bad thing is, today, when you buy bluray, you usually get the bluray, a DVD and digital copy. You only get the bluray and digital copy for your $$. If you want a regular DVD, you have to buy it seperately.<br />That's about it for the bad. Really.<br />The new installment is well acted, well directed, well done in many ways! I actually watched it twice, I enjoyed it so much.<br />Adrien Brody, putting on some pounds and looking pretty intimidating in his hand to hand combat was pretty unexpected. His character as well, was well written and acted by Brody. He was a no guts, no glory, take no prisoners, in your face kinda guy and it was a good character for this kind of movie.<br />Supporting roles all had their own character traits tha tmade them interesting and you want to know more about them before the end of the movie. One instance is Topher Grace (Doc) who, as you learn, has his own secrets and if you watch, they hint at this through the movie. A Japanese man has very little dialogue but is still one of the coolest predators/prey in the movie. Lawrence Fishburne plays a guy who \\"is the one that got away\\" and has been on the planet long enough to be a little off his rocker. He plays this well.<br />You will learn more about the different types of predators in this movie as well.<br />I recommend this movie to fans of the Predator series.

B0025KW29U|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when this was recommended to me on Netflix. I should have known that the clever factor was way up there since it was written by Joss Whedon and his brothers. We really have enjoyed the quick wit and unique spin on things with the Buffy, Angel and Firefly series and Dr. Horrible does not disappoint. It is very cooky, a little dark but very entertaining. The Commentary the Musical is actually better in my opinion than the movie itself. You'll catch yourself singing along with the quirky, and not politically correct choruses, but that's the point, to subvert the dominant paradigm. Enjoy!
0316069485|2.0|Being a long time Connelly fan I went into this book expecting what I normally expect.  A great read with twists and turns to keep me coming back for more but this book failed, big time.    It started out somewhat slow and when it picked up I expected things to take off.  You would think with Bosch and Haller part of this book it would be a home run but it never went anywhere.  A long trial that was dry with nothing to spark my interests I kept thinking...  No way Connelly wrote this.  Has to be a mistake.  As much as it pains me to give a two star review for this book it was more painful to read it.  I was bored and that is a first for Connelly.  The ending was terrible and left me shaking my head.  Its almost as if he just came home one day and banged the keyboard and roughed out and ending without even thinking about it.  I can only hope his next offering will be more MC like, this was a fail and the only book I have ever read of his that I will simply give away.....
B003UYUQZW|4.0|I loved this movie; the story line is good, the whole family can watch together with out being caught off guard with embarrassing moment while watching it with your son in law or your Grand kids.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton are great together!!! LOVE THEM :-)
030726999X|5.0|I thought that the first two books in the series were good, but this one is great!  Highly suspenseful.  A real page turner.  By the time you reach the last third of the book, I don't think that you will be able to put it down.  Loved it!
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|Picture and sound quality is second to none and the theatrics are spectacular... Blu-ray is amazing. You actually feel as if you are there with the crytal clear video and sound quality of DVD.  Highly recommend this DVD.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is the best love story ever told, we fell in love with it 20 years ago, and you'll do it again this time around, don't let it pass you by. Buy it, it's really worth every penny. Great addition to our Collection!!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I absolutely love this show! The DVD came quickly and was in fantastic condition! Thanks!
B001PB3RU8|4.0|Florence + The Machine is so inventive and unique with the music and the lyrics, which is what drew me in. It took a few listens to each song before I loved them because it's different. It's great background music and also great to jam to. Not too easy to sing-along to, you'd definitely have to look up the words a lot of times. Overall, GREAT CD!
0393327345|4.0|Fight Club is nothing smaller than a worldwide cult phenomenon. Even if you've never read the book or seen the movie and have no clue who Tyler Durden is, you know that the first rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club.<br /><br />The movie was actually a little less raw than the novel, even though it followed the story line closely. By reading the book after having seen the movie, you lose a a lot of the shocks knowing what you know. The book is better, in my opinion, but it losses its impact without the surprises.<br /><br />Fight Club is disgusting. I would never use soap or eat in a restaurant again if I could help it. The fact that I have to do those things now makes my skin crawl. The book is almost horror based in reality. The horror of human nature.<br /><br />Fight Club is shocking without feeling as though anything is written for pure shock-value. It messes with your mind, which seems to be Palahniuk's very effective signature. It's guaranteed to make you feel at least a little crazy. Fight Club is a very impressive book greatly deserving its cult following.
0345505387|1.0|I am very sorry I bought this book.  Everyone that read the series has their own version of what Jamie and Claire look like.  I treasure the version I see in my mind.  I opened book and was very sorry I did.  Sorry, but my version is so much better. This is cartoon version, and it's sad. The artist maybe very good at somethings else but not Jamie and Claire.[[ASIN:0345505387 The Exile: An Outlander Graphic Novel]]
0425129608|4.0|Evil Under the Sun threw me through a loop. I wasn't even close when it came to figuring out what was going on. So many tiny details mixed with an abundance of obvious possibilities made this book a wonderful mystery from beginning to end.<br /><br />Poirot wasn't the least bit annoying in Evil Under the Sun. You know how he can get with his \\"little gray cells.\\" This was one of the times when he's on vacation and actually seems to mean it for the majority of the trip.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with the way the victim was blamed for her own death due to the way she lived her life. I was equally unhappy with the defense that she was not the brightest girl in the world, so she shouldn't be held responsible for her actions. I'll admit to strongly disliking the victim, but the concept of \\"she was asking for it\\" was insulting. It was also stereotypical of the time and must be viewed as such.<br /><br />Evil Under the Sun was a great mystery with an ending you'll never see coming. This was definitely one of the better Poirot novels.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Excellent recorder.  I have both the older H4 and this H4n.  The only difference I've seen is that my older H4 seems to work better as the sound interface to my computer.  Apparently there are issues with AMD processors on laptops with the newer H4n.  Also, registering and unlocking CUbaseLE which comes with the recorder was as royal pain.  I did get it unlocked though on it works great on my computer.  If you're a musician you can't go wrong with this recorder and the included sound processing software that comes with it.  I use this every week.  I think the newer H4n on auto rec level records better then the older H4, although both of them are great.
0865479186|5.0|Media today can send your head spinning with over-information.  Vaccinations are bad! Homeopathy is NATURAL and therefore GOOD!  In Bad Science, you can learn the truth behind all of these claims, and learn for yourself what is real and what is hype.  The power should be in your own hands to choose what is good for you.  Educating yourself about exactly what homeopathy is, and facts about acupuncture, and knowing what chiropractic medicine actually involves is the best way to gaining control over your making your own decisions.
142311339X|5.0|Thank you, thank you and thank you for this amazing book. We got it the day it came out and it exceeded our expectations. My son wanted to keep reading even after the lights went out in his room. Take your time and keep it up Rick.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Like many of you, I just received my copy of GLADIATOR BD! My copy is without the Yellow UPC, and without the 2-DISC label above the PARAMOUNT logo on the back of the slip cover. But it also came with the expired $10 Discount Offer on the front of the slip cover. I was contemplating whether to return it, but decided to give it a spin!<br /><br />Turn out that IT IS the Remastered copy! Skin tone appear natural with good detail, especially Cassius robe and all the armors! None of the airbrush/plastic face as mentioned for the previous disc. The theatrical and extended scenes look identical in detail and color, can't really tell the different.<br /><br />So don't get despair when you receive one without the Yellow UPC (and the expired $10 Discount label)! If it didn't have the 2-DISC label above the PARAMOUNT loge ON THE BACK OF THE SLIP COVER, give it a spin for a physical check! It just might turn out to be the Remastered copy!<br /><br />Anyway, there are already report that AMAZON is shipping those with Yellow UPC! One should be fine to order now. I just set through the Extended 171 minutes version, and it was fantastic! Gladiator is one Master Piece of movie making!
B002ZG98LO|3.0|I've been reading the mostly positive reviews that this film has gotten, quite a bit of them WAY TOO extreme! It seems a lot of them NEVER really saw or experienced the original/classic (!!)PREDATOR.  First off, the movie is not bad at all but it fails to improve on the original in several instances:  1st) Despite the new designs, new looks, & new effects of the creatures, there is NO REAL villainy or menace demonstrated by them in contrast to P1 & P2. I recall how it practically taunted & toyed with its victims B4 killing them (i.e.- Mac & Dillon in P1, the Jamaican \\"hit\\"team in P2).....NONE of that creativity here. And where was the agility & athleticism that was demonstrated in the 1st 2 films, which left a LOT 2 the imagination, them being so huge (swinging & running along the jungle/treetops in P1 & climbing buildings/leaping along rooftops in P2)???? Several opportunities wasted!  2nd) How does a team of professional killers (each his own right?) suddenly \\"rally around\\" one man (Royce) without hesitation??? Couldn't they at least show SOME challenge 2 his sense of authority. It seems too cliched these days in a lot of movies 2 throw a bunch of \\"strangers\\" together & have them working together or following each other as a group almost immediately (BORING!). Still, the cast is mostly believable as individuals & made up of some pretty decent actors (Adrien Brody, Lawrence Fishburne, etc). At least the filmakers didn't try 2 sink the franchise by using an ALL pretty-looking TWILIGHT cast (EW-WWWW!!!!!). But then again, we R watching this movie 4 the Predators, right?  And speaking of- despite the mostly negative comments here regarding the ALIENVSPREDATOR series & the attempts by reviewers 2 separate it from the 1st 2 Predator films here at AMAZON, there is a bit of noticable homage (AVP) in this film- the Predator's holographic map/imaging system & the revelation by Noland that they hunt in groups of 3s (recall in AVP, it was 3 Predators that entered the Pyramid2 begin their \\"rite of passage\\").  Poor Derek Mears who suited up as number of the creatures in this film! He clearly left NO impression in that God-AWFUL FRIDAY THE 13th POS \\"remake\\" (as Jason, of course) & he likewise does so (or doesn't depending how U look at it!)here. Any chance giving Kevin Peter (R.I.P. bro!)Hall's brother a phone call?   I had real high hopes 4 this film, the conventional wisdom being a sequel is SUPPOSED 2 follow & improve on the original (ALIENS/ALIEN, SPIDERMAN2/SPIDERMAN). It's not really that bad, truthfully. I'm just HOPING that the inevitable next sequel gets it RIGHT next time!
0760336954|1.0|Motorbooks/MBI/Quayside put out great Transportation Books as I have many,However I don't find the designs in this book all that Great,It is pandering more to the European Elitist Schools of Thought,While Like Abstract Art, Art and Beauty are in the eye of the Beholder. The only thing that is briefly covered that I find Attractive to my eyes are the New Camaro,Info On Bertone,Harley Earl,Giugiaro,Bill Mitchell,Real Designers not the computer trained round shaped designs coming out from the Likes Of Mechanically Horrible and Ugly Volkswagen and Audi, Not to Mention State Enterprise Fiat and of Course the New Ugly Less Jaguar-esque Jaguar,as Well The Ugly thing that is the Nissan Jukebox,and of course the new trend for Sissified Politically Correct Microcars and Hybrids,Cars are meant for fun not some of the tiny ugly shapes featured in this book most of them European Modernism and based on Furniture!Sadly with The exception of a few Modern Automotive Design has gone down the tubes.If this is progress count me out.
0765326353|5.0|What an incredible book.  I'm a big Sanderson fan and this was my favorite piece of his so far.  The world and characters he has created in WoK are so deep and interesting, just not sure now if I can wait until the next book comes out.    Way to go BS, 1000 pages has never been as fun and easy to read.  Thank you!
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I thought it funny that some reviews are so rude to this CD. It's a adventuresome selection of tunes that goes all over the place within genre's. It's so much better than the same old same old. I think it's the first Clapton CD that I have finished and wanted to start to have to listen again, it's that interesting. Lovely guitar licks, mature voice and well worth a listen, unless you just want Layla all the time :)
B001HN694K|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing the traditional Alice in Wonderland story. To laugh and smile and enjoy the fairy tale as an adult that I enjoyed as a child. I was very disappointed in this dark and weird version.  If I had read the editorial more closely I would not have bought it.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|First off, shame on you Amazon for misleading readers by falsely portraying this Ultimate Edition (\\"UE\\") as having been reviewed by 1,357 (at the time of this writing).  This UE bluray set was released yesterday, Tues, Oct 19, and as anyone can see, has been reviewed by only a handful of people, almost all of whom give this a 1 star or less review.  Well over 1000 of the other so-called reviews relate not to the UE set but to the standalone bluray version previously released.    Second, notwithstanding that I take responsibility for not reading the product description, if you are like me, busy with work, kids, etc., you make certain assumptions about respective products, especially those that are a part of a series that is marketed as \\"Ultimate.\\"  One such assumption, as here, is that if the first two released UE sets incorporate scenes not otherwise part of the theatrical version, all other released UE sets will follow suit.  That did not happen here.  You sold me something I (and likely everyone else who is reading this) already own.  You made the cost of owning this one film a $75+ investment for all us.  I mean, why, why, why??? would a parent ever blow $35+ for a bluray set in order to what, learn about how magical creatures were created in the world of Harry Potter?   Please.   In a world where content is king, this is a bottomless hole.  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.    Warner Bros (its C-levels, BOD, and others responsible), you burned me on this one.  And although you imagine that we consumers can easily absorb a $35 hit, you miss the point.  There are so so many choices out here in consumption land. You burn me, and you lose my trust, trust in your capacity to understand my needs.  Yours is a business filled with risk.  You only need to look across the street at your MGM buds to know how true that is.  You may temporarily sustain your profitability through the manipulation of this franchise, but all good things come to an end.  Andat the end of the day, those that run institutional investors and insurers are just like me, individuals who understand that when a business model loses its integrity in the minds of the people it is designed to serve, that's when it is time to pull the plug.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I received the product with no delays. It was still in plastic packaging and the disc had no scratches or defects. I was highly satisfied.
0061997811|5.0|As a total Harry Potter fan, I just knew this book was a 'must have'.  I'm delighted to report that I wasn't mistaken.  When I first received it, I skipped any reading, and went straight through to the little extra finds.  There are more than described in the sales description.  Without giving away any information, I must say that Harry Potter film Wizardry is a very good compilation of ALL the films.  You'll enjoy every single page. :)
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Rock solid and hilarious from the pilot episode - how often does that happen?  Pretty rare, I think, but Modern Family started off brilliantly and has gotten even better as it goes on.  It's funny and smart and sweet, with great writing and a terrific cast - Cam is my favorite , but there's not one single character on the show who I don't like and who doesn't hold their own with the comedy, including the kids.  I'm so glad it's doing great in the ratings and will be around for a long time, and I can't recommend it enough!
B001GCUO52|5.0|If you enjoy the series your going to enjoy this one. Its even better in 3d and its one of the few that you dont have to have a 3d tv or player.
B002RVZV9K|2.0|This move was disappointing to me.  For starters, I found the combination of those three personalities to be odd, but not in a good way.  In Jimmy Page, you have a genuine rock legend and a gentle soul.  In The Edge, you have a quiet, intellectual, journeyman musician who has nothing to prove to anyone, but is visibly in awe of what Jimmy has accomplished.  Finally, we have Jack White, the pure embodiment of pretentiousness.  It was a real eye-rolling moment when Jack made a strong anti-technology statement about music, just moments before they showed Edge's huge rack full of guitar gear.  It was immediately apparent that Jack and The Edge had very little common ground musically, and were merely trying to remain civil with each other in order to make it though the day.  The whole thing felt contrived and would have been a total failure, if not for Jimmy's good humor.    I think the producers should have focused more on the segments of each player individually and completely eliminated any scenes with all three together.  Better yet, they should have simply made a two-hour movie about Jimmy Page.  THAT would be a must-see.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Both my son and i love this movie! Lots of fun and not so bad for parents to have to watch 20 times! lol
B002SF9YUM|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest movies ever done. I can't believe nobody heard of it, and that it has gotten so little recognition. This is surely no mainstream as it is about art in different forms - painting, poetry, music. This is also about human rights, women rights. It's about love and friendship, hard choices, mistakes. Beautiful cimenatography, great performances, enchanting music, beautiful and heartbreaking story of extraordinary people. This movie will touch you deeply and will stay with you forever. Don't miss it!
0316098337|5.0|I initially resisted this book because it sounded to me like yet another formula book/TV movie. Ma is kept in Room, has Jack, and they are kept there in secret by \\"old Nick\\" for the first 5 years of Jack's life. Compelling reviews on Amazon got me more interested, however, and I gave it a try. I am very glad I did.<br /><br />The first part of the novel is a compelling mystery. Who is Ma? Who is Old Nick? Where is Room and why are they there? Everything is told from the 5 year old Jack's unique perspective, in a very real and believable way. The second part of the novel easily could have degenerated into the standard police/courtroom drama, but the author resists this temptation. She instead focuses on seeing the world in a brand new way through Jack's eyes. He has to learn that TV isn't real, that there are millions of other people in the world, and how to interact in society. This fresh take on seeing the world anew is what really sets Room apart. It makes me think a lot about how we learn and what influence our surroundings have on us and on our development. Room does not take the easy road. There is no Hollywood \\"We are saved and everything is fine now.\\" Ma and Jack both have to deal with the very real problems of re-integrating with society after spending years away from it.<br /><br />Room reminded me of the fictional book Flowers in the Attic, as well as the real-life cases of Jaycee Dugard, Natascha Kampusch, and Elisabeth Fritzl. Stockholm syndrome is also very interesting to research in the wake of this book, as it concerns relationships in extended captivity cases such as these.<br /><br />In short, Room is an amazing, important book that will really open your eyes and make you think in different ways. Highly recommended.
B003XMKN40|4.0|Eric Clapton as only \\"HE\\" could do it so well...with a good brochette of invited guests,all best.A must in any serious collection.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|We did not see Robin Hood when it was released, primarily because of the reviews by top critics.  The film was released on Blu-Ray yesterday and we watched it last night.  We both agree that it is the best film treatment of Robin Hood we have seen.  From casting, to cinematography, score, acting performances, script...even the titles, Ridley Scott's version was exciting, riveting, and had a nice sense of humor at times.  We liked it so much that it will be added to our DVD library, alongside the classic Errol Flynn version.  We also liked Sherlock Holmes and Nine, two other films that critics ripped apart.  We've concluded that critics don't like modern filmmakers messing with their preconceived images of what the movie should be.  Too bad, they're missing excellent \\"fresh takes\\" that are a lot of fun, if you approach them with an open mind.
0307266303|5.0|What a fantastic book.  Full of information, well told, and a page turner at times.  What a great inspiring story.  If this doesn't make you want to run, nothing will :-)
0545123275|5.0|I really don't need to report that this book is great. Before me 254 people already said so. I'll just say that I really enjoyed it and I cant wait to read the next one! Have fun reading!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I have always loved folk music, but this beats all! I love the lead vocals (Mumford) voice with it's slightly raspiness to it and the way he draws you into the words of the music. Also, the instrument playing just cannot be beat. Their articulation throughout the whole CD is just truly amazing. All in all, best music purchase I have made in a long while!
0345438205|4.0|The black monoliths of this series of books by Clarke are one of the great inventions of science fiction.  They convey the utterly alien, the utterly unknowable, and the incredibly powerful.  They turned Jupiter into a star.  They advanced primitive man to tool-users.  And they trigger the evolution of life on Europa.    Up until this book, the monoliths, and the unseen monolith makers, have been our watchers, beginning even in Clarke's original story, The Sentinel.  In this book, we may have grown up, grown up enough to challenge the monoliths.  We question their mission, and we try to defeat them.    There are many themes that are worth thinking about here -- species evolution, machine intelligence, the relation between religion and the drive for knowledge, between immortality and meaning, . . .     The only thing that bothered me about the book is what bothered me about the earlier book in the series, 2061.  So much is devoted to reporting what has happened \\"off camera.\\"  Frank Poole is the perfect vehicle for Clarke's reporting what has happened since 2001.  At the beginning of the book, in 3001, he's been rescued from his apparent death in 2001, with a millennium to catch up on.  And catch us up on.  It's only halfway through the book that Poole's new mission starts.    Still, I can't complain.  Can't wait for Google or Apple to come out with a black monolith.  I'd like one for my desk.
0525951652|5.0|The first volume in Ken Follett's ambitious \\"Century\\" trilogy takes place mostly during World War I.  A mix of stock characters help dramatize the story: the maid who dallies with the Lord of the manor, and becomes a leading women's rights activist; her brother the coal miner who also rises to become a political activist, an idealistic German aristocrat in love with a British woman as the war looms closer, and so on.<br /><br />The story is more reminiscent of a Harry Turtledove novel than Ken Follett's beloved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  The characters are not particularly profound and there are plenty of unlikely coincidences, such as one might find in John Jakes's North and South novels.  The good news is that while Follett is not writing up to his usual standard, he writes far better than either Jakes or Turtledove, and the story is fast-paced and highly readable.<br /><br />I was not at all disappointed in this book.  I have read almost all of Follett's books, and I enjoyed this one more than his recent World Without End.<br /><br />I'm rating this five stars for two reasons: first, it kept me absorbed for almost 1,000 pages; and second, almost all the one-star reviews here are from Kindle owners complaining about the price of the electronic edition.  Since these folks have not actually read the book, it does change the overall rating, and since I liked it I feel compelled to balance things out.<br /><br />This book is a lot of fun, although it lacks the depth and power of Pillars of the Earth.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|Terrible story, some movies should NOT be remade ever this is one of them, I regret buying this DVD.<br />Is a terrible remake as the story is nothing like the original 1980s Clash Of The Titans, and it has less to do with the original myth of Perseus, it couldn't be more far and different from it.<br /><br />Since no one own the rights to myths :P anyone can interpret the stories and characters as they see fit., but there they took way too much liberties than in the original Clash Of The Titans film. And unlike the original in this one they did not work at all.<br /><br />Visually speaking the movie is a feast for the eyes: the sets, costumes, wonderful animation/special effects by CGI (computer generated images), as well as the music and cinematography. Sadly the story isn't as involving and deep as the mentioned.<br />A note on the gods costumes; they look like a direct plagiarism of the anime 1980s series of Saint Seiya AKA Knights Of The Zodiac. Shiny armors that represent a certain constellation and the olympian gods themselves.<br /><br />I got the film for my birthday warned by all the bad reviews here in amazon.com, but did not abide by previous buyers. As a fan of all Greek myths I had to add it to my collection, now I should toss it in the trash where it belongs. The original Clash Of The Titans storyline is much better and richer than this one., since it was closer to the myth of Perseus. And had a story and a script that actually did make sense.<br /><br />Bottomline wouldn't even rent it!
B003EYVY0E|1.0|Buyer beware The Ultimate edtion of movies 3 and 4 are the movie you saw at the movies and bought on dvd or blu-ray years ago not extended editions of the movie. The Ultimate edtions of the first two movies had extended verisons of both movies. The only place you will see the unused scences from movies 3 and 4 is on disc 2 of each set. If you already have these movies on dvd or blu-ray don't waste your money on the Ultimate sets unless you really want a couple of trading cards and a couple a new featurettes. A waste of money.
B003YK42LQ|1.0|I grabbed my new King of Leon disk as I headed out to work yesterday morning. The plastic wrapper was still on the disk so I waited until I arrived at work to listen to it.     As I sat at my desk I put the disk in my MacBook. After the normal 'whirls, chugs, and spinning noises, the disk was ejected. Hmmm (I think to myself). Giving the disk a gentle push I try again. \\"Whirl, chug, spin ... eject\\". I don't have time for this so I try one of the other CD's I ordered EMINEM (recovery) and it plays just fine. The EMINEM disk is a little 'raw' for me but at least I can listen to it.    Later that night I did a little research into the issue via wikipedia and google. As it turns out the Kings of Leon \\"CD\\" is NOT an official CD at all ( see why: [...]). I have never encountered this issue.    Looking hi and low on the disk, case, and insert you will NOT find the official \\"CD\\" logo anywhere! The MacBook rejects it as such and spits it out.    What are you going to do? Lesson learned!
0143118420|1.0|I was excited when I got the book since I love learning about new cultures and food. The book could have been shorted to 3 chapters. Italy was not bad but her experience in India was rather monotonous. Don't even get me started on Indonesia. The part of her story where she tried to \\"help\\" the woman by raising money from her friends and family and then dictating to the woman how she should use it, felt narcissitic to me. Overall I am very disappointed with the book.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|**REVIEW DISCLAIMER**  This album has to be judged solely on it's OWN merits, not how it holds up to Youth and Aha Shake.  There exists a sharp divide within the KOL fanbase, going all the way back to the third album.  The purists maintaining they were there from the beginning and that the Followill boys sold out their southern rock roots for radio play and fortune.   The newcomers seen as carpetbaggers jumping into a party they should've known about long before they arrived.  I was on the bus from the first album, and yes, I prefer my KOL with long hair and flannels, banging out chord driven southern swagger, but that does not discount the quality of the SONGS in the three subsequent releases... I think this may have contributed to some of the more negative reviews I have read on this release.    Come Around Sundown... A platinum album well into the teeth of the download era, mainstream breakthrough finally after three critically acclaimed albums shot just under the radar, headlining outdoor arenas... The brothers Followill had the rock community guessing as to their ever varying direction for the followup to 2008's Only by the Night.  Would we get another groove driven, jangly new wave effort, or would the boys pull the rug up from under us and revert to the raucous southern smash in the mouth they came in on... now that they got everybody aboard the train?  What you get is the former, a safe play followup and a very logical successor to OBTN... we'll have to wait for the distorted power chords and anthems pertaining to cigarettes, shotguns and whiskey to return, if they ever do.      On the whole the album is solid front to back.  Second or third listen hooks and sing along choruses are again the order of the day.  As has been the case since since Because of the Times, Jared Followill's bass is out front of the guitars, creating most of the melodies for the songs.  Very rarely do you hear discernible guitar riffs, the six stringers used more as accompanying instruments and to add mood and atmospheric effects.  The transition to a band being fronted by their rhythm section has resulted in a definite \\"danceable\\" element to the sound.  This has no doubt been a factor in the droves of young fans the band has won over.  What sets this Tennessee outfit apart from the rest of the sheep polluting the rapidly decaying rock radio waves recently is simply this...songwriting.    Caleb's vocals are as versatile as ever and the lyrics are descriptive and abstract at times, rather than the cliched \\"you, me\\" verbiage we've endured these last dozen years or so.  We still get a brief flicker of southern roots, more so than on the predecessor.  Listen to Caleb channel Ronnie Van Zant on Mi Amigo as he calls out \\"you know son!\\" preceded by a short blast of falsetto on the last chorus... and who can resist the hook of Caleb boasting of his gal friend's admiration of his manhood on the same track...possibly the coolest KOL vocals since the sophomore effort.  Indeed, there are no radio \\"monsters\\" in this collection, and sales will probably pale in comparison to OBTN. In 2010 we'll take fun, well written rock records wherever we can get them... that's what you get on the fifth release from the Kings... take it as it is.
B003YK42LQ|2.0|This album is horrible. The lyrics aren't very good, the music is decent. Not really sure what they wanted to accomplish with this album. It has a feel as if it was rushed to be put out. I stand firm on my stance that their first three albums are flawless. When I first heard Only by the Night, I was sort of, speechless - as it was totally different. I ended up liking 3 songs on that one. The feeling I had when I heard this one, has nothing on the previous album. This album isn't worth buying. I would have given it a one stay, but because it is KOL, it gets a two. At least Black Rebel Motorcycle Club hasn't sold out. They have stayed true to their sound and music for a decade now.

0743298039|5.0|British bookshop keeper and amateur biographer of historic figures, Margaret Lea, is contacted, under peculiar circumstances, by a famous and reclusive author, Vida Winter, to pen Vida's bio. Having only written about deceased individuals, Margaret is apprehensive and suspicious about her involvement -- not only for her lack of contemporary narrative skills, but also because Vida is notoriously well-known for providing dishonest, fabricated answers during interviews.    Curiosity and opportunity perhaps getting the best of her, Margaret takes the job, knowing full well it might be a fruitless endeavor, and heads to Vida's British countryside estate to begin work. The life story Vida begins telling, whether authentic or imaginary, is replete with more mystery and intrigue than Margaret suspected, leading Margaret down a long, labyrinthine road to uncover the dark truths of Vida's secret past.    Setterfield's elegant, delicate prose not only brought the characters to life, but allowed the story to unfold at a natural, even pace, keeping me interested from start to finish. Laced with ample twists and turns, I was caught off guard numerous times, but was never at a loss for what was going on -- nor deceived by gimmicky plot devices.    Few novels are written with such grace, these days, so this was a much-welcomed treasure.

B002MW50KO|1.0|This Christmas album is beyond painful, beyond wretched: it's simply and completely unlistenable. Providing saccharine settings for the gurgling croak and the gravelly wheeze of a lifelong smoker pretty much defines the word \\"ill-conceived.\\" Since he's one of the greatest songwriters ever, and since he's donating his profits from this album to good causes, I may forgive Dylan someday, but first I'll have to somehow forget hearing Santa Claus dragged over the coals and the Little Drummer Boy strangled and the Herald Angels scream. Do you hear what I hear? Then plug your ears! What could they have been thinking when they recorded this disgraceful dreck?<br /><br />I'll give this much to the CD: it's given Amazon reviewers the opportunity to sharpen their wit and lavish the music with the caustic comments it deserves. Allow me to quote a few of them: \\"He makes Tom Waits sound like Perry Como.\\" \\"It's enough to make the most devout Christian consider atheism. Giving this two stars. One for each of Bob's tar-filled lungs.\\" \\"If I were a little kid, I'd run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen. Actually, I may do that myself.\\" \\"Perhaps a better name for the album would have been 'Your Crazy Uncle Gets Drunk at the Family Christmas Party and Starts Singing.'\\" \\"This collection of Christmas cacophony causes me to cringe. Forced to sit through it again I might very well have to hang myself by the chimney with care.\\" \\"Knocks William Shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever.\\" \\"Farcical at best and just plain creepy at worst.\\"<br /><br />Had enough? I think not. You may still be considering a purchase, so permit me to present a few more carefully chosen words of warning: \\"Just listening curdles my innards.\\" \\"Possibly the worst album ever recorded.\\" \\"Like being sucker punched at a birthday party.\\" \\"An album of Christmas music that could be used to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\\" \\"Jesus Christ, I feel like climbing up on a cross after one listen.\\" \\"Everyone involved in performing, producing, and distributing this monstrosity should be jailed for assault.\\" \\"Sounds like karaoke at a nursing home.\\" \\"Sounds like a cross between Joe Cocker and a chainsaw.\\" \\"Sounds as if he's been gargling with old razor blades.\\" \\"Sounds like he's singing through a tracheotomy.\\" \\"Sounds like Swamp Thing with a cold.\\" \\"Dylan ruins Christmas.\\"<br /><br />Please, please, please: listen to a few of the flabbergasting, nausea-inducing audio clips before you buy. And then don't. Give all the money you would have spent on this abomination to charity and, if you're religious, pray that Bob doesn't make any more albums like this one.ss after one listen.\\" \\"Everyone involved in performing, producing, and distributing this monstrosity should be jailed for assault.\\" \\"Sounds like karaoke at a nursing home.\\" \\"Sounds like a cross between Joe Cocker and a chainsaw.\\" \\"Sounds as if he's been gargling with old razor blades.\\" \\"Sounds like he's singing through a tracheotomy.\\" \\"Sounds like Swamp Thing with a cold.\\" \\"Dylan ruins Christmas.\\"<br /><br />Please, please, please: listen to a few of the flabbergasting, nausea-inducing audio clips before you buy.

B0038QGXHW|4.0|I`ve been listening to Keith Jarrett for years, have formed a strong opinion about what works emotionally as well as acoustically.  His album The Cure stands out above all of them with His version of Blame it On My Youth being unique.  An artist who can play his own beautiful phrase using the changes of an existing song is the acid test in my mind. Keith can do it.  Jasmine is very good, just a click down from The Cure.  Larry Benz
B0041OOJNU|2.0|The title song promises quite a lot, since it reminds me of Shakira's (so far) best album, \\"Dónde Están los Ladrones?\\". But then landing to reality is harsh, since hit single \\"Loca\\" represents the (to me) completely meaningless electro-dance pop. Third song \\"Antes de las Seis\\" is again good, almost up to her early masterpieces, but then absolutely horrible dance tunes \\"Gordita\\" and \\"Addicted to you\\" set in, making me really confused. Okay, electronic club/R&B dance is not my favorite music, but the dance songs on this album are so simple and heartless with artificial \\"sexy\\" dressing that to me they feel like an insult to Shakira's talent!     \\"Tu Boca\\" with its heavy guitars is good and a couple of other songs quite ok, but by Shakira's standards, having only 3 truly good songs and 3 frankly awful ones is not something to celebrate.    Sadly, \\"Sale el Sol\\" occasionally reminds us of Shakira's greatness, but somehow lacks the positive energy, spirit and brilliant songs her best albums have. If one likes the kind of dance music songs like \\"Loca\\" represent, then this album deserves a better rating. But since I don't, and the pop/rock and dance tunes here sound like they belong to two completely different albums (and artists), I can only give two stars with bleeding heart. I really wish Shakira will return to her roots - or at least leave simple dance music to Lady GaGa and others. It's songs like \\"Ojos Así\\" or \\"Si Te Vas\\" (1998) that really made Shakira one of the best pop songwriters ever. If you listen to \\"Sale el Sol\\" and \\"Dónde Están los Ladrones?\\" in a row, you understand what I mean. She can do so much better!
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Another beautiful album from Lamontagne.  What else is there to say? If you like his music, you'll love this.  I only buy cds from Amazon if the price on Itunes is ridiculous, but I must say, I do enjoy having the physical disk and album jacket etc.  Guess I'm getting sentimental in my old age.
B000YAA68W|4.0|I'm really glad that I read both The Story of a Childhood and The Story of a Return before watching this because it is BOTH! It was both but it was definitely missing some of the magic of the books. The books made me laugh, this made me cry. Well, the books made me laugh a lot and cry a little but this just made me cry a lot and laugh a little. It might sound stupid that a cartoon made me cry but this really has a depressing undertone to it, I guess because it's true. It really takes the power and pain from the book and amplified them for me. The books take the comedy of what she was going through and amplify it. I did enjoy the movie its absolutely beautiful and it goes over some things the book didn't or the book overlooked but some of the time frames seemed different than the book. Overall this was an amazing production. It did the book justice!      Spoiler - In the books I thought she says that she sees her grandmother two times before she died after leaving Iran, and in the film it says it was the last time she ever saw her grandmother. Some other things didn't completely cohere to the book but nevertheless it was a fantastc film. The art was amazing!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read. Could not put the book down for a second. My husband read it after me and read it in one night :) I''m a historical Fiction buff so this was not my normal style of book but I really really enjoyed it. The second one not as much and the 3rd even less but this one was a winner for me
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I saw the trailer for this in either 2006 or 2007 in Manhattan when I was seeing the film \\"Great World of Sound.\\" I had been captivated and waited in suspense for this to come out. I didn't have the chance to see it in theaters. The DVD from Amazon.com comes with the theatrical subtitles. The film isn't your average vampire flick; it's about so much more. It's a foreign film so some parts may seem slow moving, but the film's message was not affected by my cultural differences. I really enjoyed it. The film inspired me to read the book. It's long though so I won't watch it again for a while
1439133948|5.0|Kindle readers, worry not! Included with my hardcover copy of Cryoburn was a cd with ALL the Vorkosigan books, including this one. What a deal, i get the book the day it comes out, i can still read it on my kindle AND i get the rest for free! yay!
B000HEVALC|5.0|If I could only own one cd this would be it. I delayed listening for the first time until I shared it with my retired mother one afternoon. It doesn't matter how old (or young)this is the birth of rock and roll being recorded! These are the founders of most music today. To hear these songs by the masters is a delight. To listen to the jovial banter of this simple afternoon shared by these men is awesome! Normally you would find this type of piece in a museum; the fact that it is being shared with us makes it a true gift. Which by the way, this would make an great gift for anybody!
B003YNFYCO|3.0|A little over a year has passed since the release of the remastered stereo and mono box sets of the Beatles core studio catalog. We are now greeted with the reissue of the Beatles original compilation collections entitled 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 or the red and blue albums. While both collections feature a wonderful wealth of material from this incredible band, the release slightly misses the target.<br /><br />Purists rejoice! Included are the original track listings from the original red and blue albums from 1973 including lyrics as original included in the vinyl jackets. Artwork is also restored along with new liner notes and photos. If you have not picked up any of the 2009 discs, this collection is for you. For those of us who own both the stereo and mono box sets will feel they are returning to familiar ground as these remasters are the same from 2009. Nothing new here except for the packaging.<br /><br />Sound wise, these collections are  identical to the previous 2009 remasters and this is where this release shows its limitation. My biggest problem with those remasters was the decisions by apple to use the original master tapes and not the original multi-track recordings. Results are the best we've ever heard of the final master tapes but not the best of what those individual songs could sound like. Master tapes can often be second, third even forth generations old from the original multi-track recordings. Resulting in tape hiss and overall loss in quality. Also limiting are the way these records were mixed. Almost all of these original masters were mixed in a way where drums, bass and guitar appear only on the left speaker, while vocals and lead guitar appear on the right speaker. This can be a nightmare when listening to with headphones. My biggest complaint has to be the recording of Please Please Me (which is presented in this collection in mono). On my second pressing of the 1973 vinyl pressing of this release, the song is presented in stereo and while it uses the same \\"ping png\\" stereo mix as described earlier, it sounds incredibly better then what we get here.<br /><br />Having bought both the stereo and mono box sets, the John Lennon signature box sets and these two new releases, I am both pleased and appalled by the re-releases. After the 1999 release of the Yellow Submarine Songtrack and the 2000-2004 remix remasters of John Lennon's core colo catalog, I feel the Beatles music is taking a step back rather then forward. We live in the 21st century where we have the technology to really showcase this music. Why limit what can be done. Look at the 1996 remix of the Beach Boys Pet Sounds release and you will understand what I mean.\\"ping png\\" stereo mix as described earlier, it sounds incredibly better then what we get here.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|\\"Your going to give youself a heart attack if you think about it. Just eat it\\" Jared Edinger (childhood friend)<br /><br />  Well when I was seven years old that worked pretty well at getting me to shut my mouth at his fathers bad cooking and just eat it. Now that I'm an adult I would rather not eat poison, and I most certainly don't want to feed it to my children (as a side note my childhood friend feeds his children much better than his dad fed him as well). Food INC. is nothing short of eye opening, jaw dropping, in your face proof that the food industry is not to be trusted. Not only is our food supply tainted with bacterial killers while the industry refuses to truly fix the problem, but we are being sold poor health as well. Farmers are being told to raise chickens in a certain way which they know is not healthy for the chicken or for us. Cattle are being raised on corn based feed that promotes ecoli growth, and they are being kept in unsanitary conditions which also can impact our health. They industry has created soy beans that are immune to round-up (you know so they can spray that same round up on the crops to kill the weeds but not the soy beans). They are shaking down farmers to force them to buy their hybred crops or be eliminated from the market, and forced into bankruptcy. The amount of eye opening scenes come one after another.<br /><br />  This review can't do this film justice. However, if I were to come up with one thing I didn't like it is the scenes that pander the pro union message. I don't really care if you like unions or not. I just don't feel it added anything to the film.
B000002GG0|5.0|I apologize- when I originally heard Foreigner about 8 years ago I accused the album of being nothing more than horribly dated early 70's sappy soft rock.  Little did I know that the songwriting would grow on me significantly over the years.      The album opens on a REALLY high note with \\"The Foreigner Suite\\".  Perhaps this is Cat Stevens attempt at the progressive rock genre, or maybe he had so many brilliant ideas at the time that he couldn't find a way to lay each and every one of them down on tape without making the album run longer than his record contract allowed, but whatever the case, this song is REALLY magnificent.    Anyway, the first half of the song is easily better than the second half because Cat's trademark \\"bounce all over the place\\" style of writing a vocal melody is most noticeable on the first half.  He's also quite soulful and even has moments that almost bring me to tears.      The second half has one little uninteresting section when the song basically loses every one of those exciting moments found from the first half, and Cat just sings a really quiet vocal melody.  It's not that great, though.  It makes the entire suite not as perfect as one would originally believe.  I'm referring to the \\"There are no words I can use, because the meaning still leaves for you to choose\\" part.  Not the best vocal melody in the world, and it would be better if it had an instrument such as a flute or violin playing in the background.    Side two is very underrated these days.  \\"The Hurt\\" and \\"Later\\" are pretty solid early 70's rock tunes featuring typically great songwriting by Cat Stevens, and \\"How Many Times\\" is just plain terrific.    I really was wrong to dismiss this album originally.  The songwriting improved for me quite a lot over the years.  No, it's not his best album, but it's probably my fifth or sixth favorite album of his.
B003S898SG|5.0|Well, I think the first review by Mr Gaines covered it pretty well- in fact I have little add except to agree with pretty all that was said. It's more progressive (but still very approachable), great melodies, fantastic vocals and awesome solo's. Don't hesitate to buy it, and give it a couple spins before passing judgement. Another solid release from Angra.
0765348780|4.0|I've read the first three books, and after finishing the third I definitely plan on continuing the series.    I am one who reads fantasy for the mythology and the magic - the complex threads rooted in the past that play out in unpredictable ways through the characters that I come to know.  Others have made a point that Erikson is initially hard to follow.  That is true to a point but it didn't bother me.  \\"Gardens\\" is a great read even if you don't continue the series.  What bothered me most were the horrors inflicted by all sides, particularly in book #2, \\"Deadhouse Gates,\\" and the absence of any real love, compassion, joy, or indeed any positive emotion.  The main characters come to believe that life is nothing more than a futile struggle, to the point that the sense of futility started seeping into my own emotions.  I was ready to call it quits after \\"Deadhouse Gates,\\" but since I already had the third book, \\"Memories of Ice,\\" I decided to give it a try.  The horror is still there, but it is balanced with equal amounts of compassion, love, and integrity.  The story expands, and it becomes clear that there is an epic struggle between good and evil behind the apparently endless petty battles and changing alliances.  In short, book 3 gives the series a sense of purpose, to the point that it becomes Tolkien-esque in scope yet completely original.  No orcs, elves, or dwarves.  Instead we have the Tiste Andii, Moranth, T'lan Imass, K'Chain Che'Malle, and Forkrul Assail races, and a whole host of \\"warrens,\\" each bringing a distinct form of magic into the world and inhabited by one or several \\"gods.\\"    Read \\"Gardens\\" and enjoy the ride.  Read \\"Deadhouse\\" and try not to get lost in despair or annoyed with the endless chain of hopeless battles that Coltaine always manages to win in his ultimately meaningless crusade.  Read \\"Memories\\" and get lost in a rich universe that leaves you hungering for more.  Book 1: 4 stars.  Book 2: 2 stars.  Book 3: 5 stars.
B002VWNICW|4.0|I loved this movie, but the picture quality was - for me-   somewhat less than that of most blurays.
030758660X|5.0|Book was received with publishing error--pages were missing and other pages were duplicated.  Amazon quickly took care of this.  They quickly shipped a replacement.  Now for the good stuff!  LOVE this book!  I've already knitted one item and have the next ready to start.  Nice variety--you can knit something small and quick, or go for something big, like a sweater or cape.  Not all girly stuff either.  Plenty of items for your vampire or werewolf fan, and the \\"ordinary\\" people will find things to love, too!  There are beginner and more complicated projects.  I knitted the Paw Protectors (fingerless gloves).  Pattern was so easy, I didn't need to refer to it for the second glove.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|This remaster was well done, and the album itself is the pinnacle of Megadeth's work. Heavy, unapologetic, and fast, it's definitely worth the pick-up, if only for the remaster. The demo tracks aren't that great by comparison.
B002ZG974M|5.0|What a change from the typical Hollywood film. This small independent documentary about chronicling four babies lives in four different parts of the world was totally refreshing, and just sweet, sweet, sweet!    I sat back, relaxed, and let the film take me where it wanted. The film flowed beautifully without any narration and the scenes of these babies and how they respond to what's around them is completely mesmerizing.  It was sad to see the little Mongolian baby, who seemed to be abandoned most of the time and vulnerable to his surroundings; a bully of a brother, and many, many, unpredictable animals, but although I loved all four of them it was the infectious little African baby who stole the film.
0061433047|2.0|After pushing back at least once, the release date, I was so excited for this 4th book in the 'really more for adults, but published for young adults' book.  Crivens!<br /><br />The very onset of the book starts out with a young, very young (13 was she?) girl whose father found out she was pregnant, and beat her to the point of miscarriage.  The father, even after Tiffany gives him a chance to run away, comes back, just to hang himself.  TIffany herself buries the male infant.  So, now we have a story set up with a teen pregnancy, murder, assault, and suicide. Hm.  Not quite what I expected...  We find out later the father really didn't like the 'boyfriend' because he was a seamstress.  The father later turns up at the castle. Um? hunh?<br /><br />Also disappointing is the Feegles are now, as much as a Feegle can be, at a truce, and no longer hiding, from the \\"People\\".<br /><br />The ending was a bit soupy... a school on the chalk? Everyone's happy?<br /><br />I liked the book, I'll probably read it again some day, I love this series.  I also want my own Horace for a pet.<br />However, I was truly disappointed.  It just didn't seem to be in line with the first 3.  Oh well.  Hopefully Mr. Pratchett will continue to write as he is physically able, and the next one will be much better.<br />Perhaps we should put him under a Geas to do so.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for destruction is a classic debut album from one of America's best bands, with hits like Welcome to the jungle and sweet child of mine you can't go wrong to me every song is great.Slash is amazing on guitar and Axl Rose's unique voice and singing style,  set this band apart. This album is a must have for any serious rock n roller.
B003INBOEC|4.0|IP Man is a better than average action flick. In formula, it reminds me of some of the better US action films. Oddly, it is in this way that IP Man differs from some of the other Chinese martial arts films I have enjoyed: The fact that it is very American in formula. The story is simple, enjoyable and actually quite entertaining. However, I must point out that the Chinese nationalism in this movie is so over-the-top in your face, it toys with certain historical truths and is comically degrading to people of Japanese descent. I don't know, but there must be a lot of residual hatred over there OR quite simply, maybe this is the history that is taught in China! One example that at first I chuckled over, but then as I continued to ponder it, found that my laughter had turned to shock, occurs at the very end of the movie. This is not a spoiler. Just before the final credits, the subtitle states that in August of 1945, the Japanese surrended unconditionally because the Chinese had won the eight year war. No mention of the United States' involvement in the Japanese surrender at the end of WWII at all! I guess we didn't exist! And if you happen to be Japanese (I am not), the insults are constant throughout this film.<br /><br />Nevertheless, IP Man is another beautiful film. The cinematography is crisp, it is colorful or drab to depict a mood, and it is constantly gorgeous. I really liked the main Character of the IP Man played by Donnie Chen. What a man of honorable character (at least as depicted in this film)! The martial arts scenes are well done, staged within a more realistic context than say: House of Flying Daggers.<br /><br />In the end, this is a film to enjoy. Just be aware of the propaganda.
0634022296|4.0|This book is great for people who just want to strum and sing acoustics for fun. Just the basic chords and lyrics. The only real gripe I have is that they use a capo on some songs that there is really NO reason to use a capo on.
0307454541|3.0|Page turning crime drama, but uses common, base themes to rope reader in.  I had the feeling that the author thought, what do I need to make it a bestseller?  Violent sex against women, incest, a sexy super-heroine.  How can I make it less obvious than porn?  I'll make it the bad guys who are committing the violent sex against women, or make it an act of vengeance by the wronged heroine.  And I'll give the heroine superhero genius powers, and an edgy sense of style.  It's clear that this guy didn't really understand women with Asperger's.  As a woman with Asperger's, and the mother of a daughter with Asperger's, and a pediatrician who has treated many children with Aspergers's, I can assure you that Aspies don't get breast augmentation - they would see it as ridiculous self-mutilation in order to attract a the wrong kind of man, who values a woman's chest size more than her mind and common sense.  Still, I have to admit that I finished the first two books since they were brought into the house by a friend, but felt kind of disgusted with myself afterwards.

B00014TJ7K|2.0|I've listened to this CD almost 10 times & I'm NOT hearing the Five Star review level the vast majority of reviewers have given Cloud Nine. \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\", is a Five star \\"Beatles\\" level song & production. Its so good it makes you wonder whether the rest of these tunes were from another recording session. Loaned this CD to another George/Beatles fan & he was also NOT impressed beyond the one song. Felt it was too much like a 1980's ELO record. SORRY!
1851775722|4.0|This book is everything I thought it would be and more.  I make Victorian Garments and I loved the detail and colours of the costumes in the book.  A truly beautiful book that has inspired me to create even more costumes.
B0038AUYKU|3.0|As another reviewer points out, this book was originally published in Sweden in 1995, the same year as the movie Se7en (or Seven?) -- back then the media had not yet been massively overloaded with serial killers ad nauseam, that since then have overpopulated movies and TV to the point of having a hit TV show about a cute serial killer who kills serial killers and 6 (six!) Saw movies. So we can forgive him. It's no wonder that the people that make the BBC adaptation starring Kenneth Branagh decided to use this novel (the 5th in the series) as the basis for the first episode of the first season. Why begin with the first book when you can  start with one of them lovely mass murderers, and he scalps the victims, too!    So, if like me, when you read the first chapter you think, oh, god, not another friggin' bat-crazy serial killer, bear with the book. OK,It's not very original. We even have a scene in which the killer follows, gosh, Wallander's daughter and talks to her (yes, he knows where you live!). But they are the characters you know and love, Wallander, his family and his co-workers. And our politicians and plutocrats are served corrupt to the bone, like they should be. Involved in all kinds of illicit, violent, murderous, bloody, sadistic sex with minors. Like they should be. We love to hate the filthy rich and powerful. They might have the power, the money and the women, but we have the high moral ground.    So. Serial Killers. Corrupt politicians. Crooked businessmen. Plain crooks. Immigrant girls forced into prostitution. And inspector Kurt Wallander (and his lousy personal life) to try and tie it all together. As i said, not very original. Not very exciting. Not very surprising. But competently done and a decent read. And if you read the first four, you have to read on, don't you?    A note on the Kindle edition: I read the European Kindle edition of this book, from Random House / CCV Publishing. There is nothing wrong with it, but other Mankell novels (and from others, such as Arnaldur Indridason) from the same publishers have format issues, check the samples first!

If you like the blues and especially electric guitar driven blues this is the album for you. Now that you have decided to buy the album, do yourself a favor - go see Buddy. There are not too many years last to see one of the greatest of his generation or any other frankly. He is amazing and this album catches him live in his prime with a great backing band.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|KWS does his best Ry Cooder impersonation and documents some excellent blues. While KWS and his band are excellent the real stars are the various guest stars such Big Daddy Neil Pattman and Etta Baker. These elder statesman play with a grit and soul that is the essence of the blues. There is a reason that of the nearly 150 reviews there is not one negative review. It is a bonus that it was also caught of film and provided as part of a CD\DVD set. Enjoy.

0061122416|5.0|I read The Alchemist when I was 24, fifteen years ago. A friend had recommended it to me and I read it in a day or  two - it is, after all, a short book. I enjoyed it but didn't think a great deal of it at the time and remember telling my friend exactly this after I finished it.<br /><br />Ah, but how things change. I listened to The Alchemist on CD recently, as I was journeying to Burning Man with friends, for my third extravaganza in Black Rock City (the temporary city that springs up each year in the Nevada Desert to accommodate about 50,000 revelers). I was blown away by the profundity and beauty of the Alchemist this second time through. No, I was not on drugs.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons delivers a masterful reading of the book in about four hours. Certainly his voice adds much to this book.<br /><br />And yet the profundity and beauty of the book are completely independent of Irons' performance. In the fifteen years since I first read the book, I have read widely and thought deeply about philosophical issues such as the nature of mind, matter, time, soul, self, God and free will. I have also finished my own book on these topics recently (non-fiction). I found that Coelho captures what I call the \\"universal spiritual truths\\" flawlessly in his short book. His philosophical fable is essentially panpsychist in nature, and panentheist. These terms mean, respectively, that all things have some degree of mind in them (\\"the soul of the world,\\" \\"the soul of the universe,\\" the Sun as a conscious entity, etc.), and that the world is within God and not separate from God. These are philosophical positions most closely associated with process philosophy, a school of thought made rigorous and increasingly popular in the West by Alfred North Whitehead, Henri Bergson, Charles Hartshorne, John Cobb Jr., David Ray Griffin and many others.<br /><br />Now, does the Sun really converse with people here on our planet? Of course not. But does the Sun have some type of consciousness that flickers and fluxes as its mass heaves and buckles, with a stability of sorts reached in various parts of its huge extent? Quite likely. Does the Earth display enough stability and complexity to host a mind of a sort? Quite possibly. By the same reasoning, does the universe as a whole display enough complexity and stability to host a profound intelligence? Quite likely. And should we call this God? Who cares what we call it.<br /><br />The ultimate profundity of Coelho's book is, however, more subtle. When he writes that \\"if you truly want something, the universe will conspire to make it happen\\" and \\"all things are One,\\" he is expressing the gnostic/samadhi/satori experience of all mystics. This experience, the basis for every religion and true spiritual tradition is the realization that all things are indeed one. There is no real separation. You are the universe, I am the universe, we are the universe. By extension, because matter and mind are two aspects of the same thing, you are God, I am God, we are God. And this is how the universe conspires to make your dreams come true: whatever happens in the universe is YOU. You are everything that happens to the temporary collection of matter and mind that you normally think of as you. And if the little you (the little self in Vedanta, as opposed to the Self, Brahman) can master these truths and live these truths, the desires of the little you may ultimately align with the big You.mass heaves and buckles, with a stability of sorts reached in various parts of its huge extent?

0671042858|3.0|Then take the time to read this short (for King anyway) book about a young girl named Trisha who ends up lost in the woods.  It's not incredibly gruesome but I felt Trisha's fear and was always rooting for her till the end.  Anyone who's ever gone hiking on the more rural areas of the Appalachian Trail (or in the deep woods for that matter) can sympathize with Trisha with just how much everything looks the same.  Trees, plants etc.  It can all look very similar.  And when night comes so does the wild imagination of a scared child.  Definitely not the best of King but a page turner that you'll just want to plow through to the end.

0451169514|5.0|Although, the first time I did read \\"It\\", I was a young teenager.  I just read it again recently now that I'm in my 30's.  This book, and to a lesser extent the mediocre TV miniseries, had young people scared of clowns for life.  Like \\"The Stand\\", \\"It\\" is a long book at over 1000 pages.  Full of not only wonderful character development but geographical history of King's fictional Maine.  With the exception of the controversial sex scene towards the end I loved every minute of \\"It.\\"  I wasn't offended like many others were.  I just thought the challenge the characters were dealing with in that moment could have been handled differently.  Just my opinion but who am I to argue with the \\"King.\\"  A masterpiece of horror nonetheless.
030745455X|5.0|This book almost forces you to read it when you should be doing something else. It mixes several related genres: mystery, crime thriller, psychological suspense novel, international crime/espionage. The author clearly had a creative feast with his characters: the tiny, introverted Salander with mathematical and computer savant skills, a blond giant impervious to physical destruction, a celebrity journalist (Blomkvist) with dogged investigative skills and on and on. I had not read the first novel and when this one started in the Caribbean, I never guessed it was headed back to Stockholm. Overall Larson weaves an intricate plot of good guys and bad guys and good guys on the verge of doing bad things. Different groups chase each other for different reasons. Salander chases those who have tortured her in her past. Blomkvist chases Salander and the murderers of his friends. The police chase Salander to put her in jail. Vicious criminals chase all of the above to keep their crimes and profits under cover. The book ranges from entertaining and humorous to dark and even gory at times but is generally pure pleasure from cover to cover.[[ASIN:1931391912 The Griffon Trilogy (Pt. I)]]

6305428042|5.0|Halloween is around the corner and this is when I want to OD on everything spooky, creepy, and absurdly corny, cheesy hilarious.  Hocus Pocus has always been high on my family viewing list, mainly for the crazy story line and the amazing humor of Bette Midler.  I've curled up with my children on the opening credits, set deep in history, where the three evilly inclined sisters cause so much havoc in their small town. Bette Midler and her overbite, Sarah Jessica Parker and her ok-so-I'm-a-witch-but-I-have-a-weakness-for-boys-and-I'm-dumber-than-dirt, and Kathy Najimi and her vacuum cleaner take the fear out of the entire movie.  The family laughed at the hilarity, rooted for a 'black cat', and giggled over the undead.<br /><br />Despite the humor, the story line might be a little too intense for very young children.<br /><br />I love this film and so do my children, while they run around the house screaming AMOK! AMOK! AMOK!

I LOVE SHAKIRA because she is not afraid to experiment. You may not like the album but it does not mean the album's song was not good, face it guys we are not going to like all the albums of an artist you people sit here and tell me that they love each and every song of an artist that he or she has come out with, you are kidding yourself. This new album I did not like at all except for few songs, does that mean the album is not good no it means it was not my style. Please think about that I am saying. Now of course they are times where the whole ALBUM sucks but for SHAKIRA I have yet to see.

I always take this book with me on long trips or vacations just in case I need something else to read. I don't know how I never get tired of it.

As soon as I start reading the book, I am there with that band of rabbits going through obstacle after obstacle. There are several other animal based books by the author that I really enjoy.

B002ZG98LO|1.0|In the special features section of this movie there is a comment as to how the original \\"Predator\\" movie was so good because of \\"attention to details\\". Well, this sequel should have listened to it's forebear because the lack of attention to details makes it so bad.   (1.) Dialogue was comic book juvenile. Not very imaginative from writers with G.E.D.s. Especially the really weak and time worn military jargon and small guy tough talk obscenities.   (2.) Opening scene: Why people are falling out of the sky with parachutes even though they wouldn't normally have parachutes makes no sense.   (3.) The characters responses to their unusual situation was not natural even a child would have had more intelligent reactions. Just felt too scripted for filming reasons.   (4.) The random massive firepower released by our prey made no sense given their backgrounds. Why is there always an unlimited ammo supply. Must be a visual compensation for poor storyline and acting.   (5.) Predictable pecking order of to who gets killed and none of our prey even tried to intelligently solve how to rescue their  trapped or wounded comrades. The so called misplaced Doctor was just dumb.   (6.) Amazing how rapidly the environment changed by just walking for a few hours as they went from swampy lowlands to high altitude alpine reforested trees to desert to grassy meadows.   (7.) A poorly painted backdrop of neighborly planets so large and so close that the gravitational field would have ripped their planet into dust.  (8.) The usual clunky alien craft that looked like it had parts from a 19th century salvage yard and thus would have had the mobility of a rock.   (9.) Overall,  given the usual costume and fireworks props, bland acting, stereotypic dialogue confusing story line there isn't anything noteworthy in this sequel.
B003Y8YXEO|1.0|A few words on the remastering quality of this best of: most of the songs were remastered in the prestigious recording studio, Abbey Road, by Paul Hicks and Sean Magee. The result is however awful: the sound is muddy, there is neither clarity nor dynamism.     Compared to previous best of, this has to be the worst sounding compilations of John Lennon's work.    I am very disappointed by the bad quality of the remastering job done at Abbey Road, which usually carries out first-class remastering. Not sure if the blame should only rest on the two above sound engineers, but they do have some responsibility in this failure.

B002AGIEYG|5.0|[from ClassicalWETA.org]<br /><br />I might have skipped this release--the four Brahms Symphonies with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic--because EMI's recordings with Rattle and his band have been such a mixed bag in the last years, vacillating between civilized boredom and indistinct, haphazard blandness. They rarely felt fully thought-through, much less labors of love. That may not apply to all of them, but to enough for that general impression.<br /><br />I love Brahms' Symphonies--but unlike with the symphonies of, say Bruckner, Mahler, or Beethoven, I've never entered a symphony-cycle collection race. The reason is largely G&uuml;nter Wand's traversal with the North German RSO (re-mastered on RCA) which so satisfies my every Brahms-craving that there simply wasn't a need to go out of my way exploring every other possible venue. Sure, I also like Jochum/Berlin, Karajan/Berlin (70s), Szell/Cleveland, but even they don't seem essential next to Wand. Rattle-Berlin, so I thought, certainly wasn't going to change that.<br /><br />But when I was in Amsterdam recently, several musicians from the Concertgebouw raved about that recording. Musicians hear recordings differently than the passive listener--especially, but not only, when their own recordings are concerned. And I don't think their opinion is necessarily the measure of all things (mine is, of course!). But is there a better, more persuasive recommendation for Berlin's new Brahms than hearing from RCO players--members of the alleged `world's best orchestra': \\"That's how we would love to sound like. This is Brahms for the 21st century\\"?<br /><br />And so it is. This is Brahms with racing stripes--not so much for speed (Rattle is very flexible and not out to set new records), but for full-bodied, sleek, high tuned performance. If the opening of the First puts a smile on your face with G&uuml;nter Wand (RCA), this one wrings tears from your eyes, for its intensity bordering sophisticated brutality. It's not cold Brahms, either. Certainly not where Rattle evokes Elgarian plush in the second movement of the Fourth Symphony. The way the discernable string waves enter beneath the brass and flute solos in the fourth movement is enough to make one wince, they're so movingly played and so well captured. The recording (live) from the Berlin Philharmonic is magnificent: rich, present, detailed. Rattle's Brahms bristles, puts effective but not ostentatious spotlights on the excellent soloists and does create a sound that reminds again why the Berliners are such a special orchestra. In case those who can only judge by their recordings should have forgotten.e Rattle evokes Elgarian plush in the second movement of the Fourth Symphony.

B000XQXD9G|2.0|A Bay of Blood aka Twitch of the Death Nerve is something of an endurance feat that seems more interesting for its influence on the splatter movie genre (in particular the Friday the 13th series) than as a film. It's light on plot for a giallo, being little more than a collection of gruesome sudden deaths, some, like the opening murder of a woman in a wheelchair, imaginative, others less so, all related to various unpleasant characters out to control the rather grotty looking bay of the title to either redevelop it or preserve its natural beauty. The plot is largely thrown away in a series of flashbacks in the last couple of reels, but seems little more than an excuse for the killings, which are exercised with surprisingly little atmosphere: until the finale there's no real build up or suspense, just multiple murders from multiple murderers. There's also surprisingly little flair to it all, leaving a film that's not much better than the very average splatter movie. Still, at least there's some fun to be had from a duplicitous lawyer being dubbed in the American version by someone doing what sounds like a Gregory Peck impersonation.     Anchor Bay's DVD includes an audio commentary by Tim Lucas, stills and poster gallery, 2 radio spots and theatrical trailer.
B001BWQWKS|5.0|[from ionarts.org, Dip Your Ears, No. 96]<br /><br />The Quatuor &Eacute;b&egrave;ne have left audiences moved, enthralled, excited - wherever they have appeared. They have turned impartial critics into groupies and conservative audiences into Jazz-fans, and along the way they've convinced the EMI / Virgin record company to sign them to an exclusive contract. I loved the luxurious releases on the Mirare label (and wish Virgin would lavish similar attention on the presentation of the &Eacute;b&egrave;ne's releases), but moving from a boutique label to one of the big players is certainly a move that can only help bring the quartet to yet more audiences. A good thing, too, because their first release is a hit that deserves Billboard status, not just notable obscurity cherished by insiders. Ruthlessly and unabashedly pandering to their own strengths, they chose the primary gems from their repertoire: the Debussy and Ravel quartets, appropriately rounded off with Gabriel Faur&eacute;'s Quartet, the then 78 year old composer's last work.<br /><br />This choice of Faur&eacute; is ideal. For one it distinguishes them from their in-house rivals' - the Belcea Quartet's - debut album on EMI which throws in Dutilleux (as does the Juilliard Quartet) - and it offers the most intense, but never fussy or too extroverted, reading of this somewhat neglected work that I've heard. The &Eacute;b&egrave;ne's, who have been joyfully reckless and exciting in the recent live performances, show that they are as capable of very taut, detailed, extraordinarily defined and controlled playing, much to Faur&eacute;'s benefit. Debussy and Ravel, with overtones of warmth and spunk, respectively, are wilder and also more munificent affairs, unafraid of exploring extremes.<br /><br />The searing Andantino of the Debussy sets the mood for a luxuriant, opulent performance that becomes hugely interesting - rather than self-indulgent - because it can switch at any point into finely spun rhythmic phrases, forceful climaxes, and very subtle, delicate touches. This approach takes its time, and the Quatuor &Eacute;b&egrave;ne allows it that time. What makes it so successful is that there is never the impression of particularly slowness or of the music being pulled around gratuitously.<br /><br />The Allegro moderato of the Ravel blooms at a true \\"moderato\\", it ebbs and flows with one large, generous pulse. And yet again, the emotional peaks are of grand intensity that benefit not only from the contrast with the surrounding reflecting, lingering, and stretched music, but also from quartet-playing that projects emotion with one voice.

The Allegro moderato of the Ravel blooms at a true \\"moderato\\", it ebbs and flows with one large, generous pulse. And yet again, the emotional peaks are of grand intensity that benefit not only from the contrast with the surrounding reflecting, lingering, and stretched music, but also from quartet-playing that projects emotion with one voice.

B0006GQMC8|3.0|Teaming up Dirty Dozen alumni Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin as the `Mad Trapper' Albert Johnson and the Mountie on his trail in the wastes of the Yukon, Death Hunt is a decent rather than great manhunt movie from the appropriately named Peter Hunt, who puts his experience of shooting on ice from OHMSS to good use. Very loosely based on the biggest manhunt in Canada's history, Bronson's reclusive loner gets on the wrong side of Ed Lauter and his assorted yahoos when he forces him to sell his injured fighting dog. Things escalate, dead bodies accumulate and after a failed siege of his log cabin leaves him on the run across the Rocky Mountains, the whole thing blows up into a media circus as various desperate types try to claim the $1000 reward on his head while Marvin tries to bring him back alive. With its protagonist who just wants to be left alone hunted by a professional who respects him while the mob is baying for a piece of his flesh, in some ways it can be seen as a 1930s-set First Blood, which it beat to the screen by a year, though it's less over the top and has less action than you might expect (it's not until the last third that the manhunt really starts). It's the most polished and well crafted of Bronson's 80s films, benefiting from a decent budget and supporting cast, Carl Weathers, Maury Chaykin and William Sanderson among them, though Angie Dickinson, reunited with her Point Blank co-star, is wasted in a nothing part as a prospector's widow whose sole purpose in the film seems to be to lower the testosterone level and add a bit more star power. If it never quite hits the highs, both stars are on good form and it works well enough as a Saturday Nighter to forgive the many huge liberties it takes with the facts.     While the deleted Anchor Bay NTSC DVD only included a trailer as extra, the recent German DVD (released as Yukon but carrying the US title on the film itself) goes rather better with a radio broadcast of the film's press conference withthe stars, with Lee Marvin on dryly amusing form as he takes over the MC's duties because Judith Crist got stuck in traffic!

0446569895|4.0|For a man who seems to have spent most of his life in a state of complete oblivion, Ozzy and his co-writer make a great job of recounting his life so far.<br />I've had the pleasure of meeting Ozzy once or twice, and this book accurately reflects the nature of the man-- irreverent, funny, vulnerable, outrageous, unpredictable and vulgar, yet at heart good natured.<br />The co-writer has taken one of the most chaotic and ill-remembered lives ever, and somehow crafted it into a highly coherent and enjoyable narrative. The one criticism I have is the overuse of bad language. Of course Ozzy swears, it's part of his persona, but I get the impression that the writer tries to cram in as many expletives as possible, sometimes at the expense of a good narrative.<br />That aside, I enjoyed the book enormously. If you enjoy the rollicking side of rock, so will you.

B00314VYNE|5.0|YAAAAAAHHHHHOOOOO!!!!! IT'S HER!IT'S HER!IT'S HER-IT'S REALLY HER!! Yup, the good folks at Pixar/Matel/Target could not have produced a better replica of our favorite cowgirl Jessie! This excellent doll from the 'Toy Story 3' Target exclusive line is not only reasonably priced but perfectly executed. From the tips of her faux-leather/plastic boots to the top of her red-yarned hair, this Jessie doll belongs on every shelf, bedside or in the arms of anyone who yearns to love a toy. Her body is articulated like a classic Barbie doll (which may not withstand the tough-love of younger kids) but her outfit and expression are so perfectly on model you'll give a double take across the room to make sure she's not moved or blinked while watching you! I don't count myself amoung the huge faction of self-proclaimed Disney aficionados who deem what 'is or isn't' authentic character representation; I just know what I like. Suffice it to say this girl's off kilter smile would make the Mona Lisa smile broadly and squeeze her with love.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|All I have to say is that I am etremely pleased with this album.  I very much did not like KOL's last album, as I thought it was way to PoPPy!  Their best album by far is \\"Because of the Times\\".  I saw them perform during that album tour and man do they put on a show!  Caleb sounds just like he does on CD, in person.  This album is very strong and gets back to what KOL is good at, non-mainstream music!  My favorite tracks by far are \\"Pyro\\", \\"The Face\\", \\"Radioactive\\", \\"Mi Amigo\\" and \\"Back down South\\", with \\"Pyro\\" being the best on the album.    If you truly like KOL, you will love this album!

B0032JTV6U|4.0|I came to Glee late, I started watching reruns this summer, so I did not get the progression that was the first season of Glee.  That was a very disjointed way to get the story.    I got myself a weekend free and wallowed in the episodes.  First I watched them all, then I went back for favorites.  The extras are amazing, taken from the numbers in the shows and you can play them like a music DVD.  When you find a Glee person, they each have their favorite episodes and characters.  I loved the Madonna episode and the Lady Gaga songs were great.  The show ending at regionals was masterful, you never know why they didn't win.    The first year had some very interesting stories and character development.  I am looking forward to year 2 and I hope they keep up the good work.    I figured out that the reason I like the show so much is that the stories are funny, sad, silly and tuneful and I recognize all the music.
B000GX6MWQ|4.0|I own this very 1987 edition of TOP GUN. It has a clean picture and excellent HiFi sound.<br /><br />On a more personal note:<br />Tony Scott's TOP GUN is an old fave from my commissioned sales days. We used a [[ASIN:B000F9J886 laser disc]] of it to demonstrate the capabilities of high end projection TVs like [[ASIN:B0000206GS SONY]] and [[ASIN:B003HINHKC MITSUBISHI]]. That opening sequence with its anticipatory theme music and scenes of jets taking off from and landing on a carrier deck always enervated potential customers, which in turn made all of us \\"lot lizards\\" a bundle of loot.<br /><br />I must've watched certain parts of this film 200 times, no exaggeration, but a recent viewing is maybe the third time I've ever sat through it from beginning to end. TG is a blood-stirring actioner with lots of date night treats for us ladies, such as the beach volleyball scene. All those shirtless young guys! Val Kilmer was cut and didn't have an ounce of fat on him. How things can change in a mere quarter-century.<br /><br />Seeing it again was a very nostalgic experience for me, but in the cold light of analysis I've gotta admit this picture has a glaring flaw near the end. A flight of six MIG's commanded by black-suited pilots of unknown origin, without provocation or explanation attacks two American fighters. One of our jets is downed. 'Maverick' (Cruise) comes to the rescue of 'Iceman' (Kilmer), his hated class rival who won the coveted Top Gun trophy. Mav' splashes a few of the enemy and saves the day. Hoohahs all around the carrier deck. Yet, wouldn't such a dogfight bring on war with some other nation?<br /><br />OK, it's only a movie, and a darned entertaining one, especially if fast planes and handsome young pilots are your turn-on. One thing is sure: in my neck of the woods, TOP GUN was responsible for the proliferation in dozens of homes of 45\\" and 52\\" television sets and rack stereos (with surround sound). For optimum enjoyment, see it on a --BIG-- TV and turn that volume WAY UP during flight sequences. At very least, you'll be convinced that the beaucoup moolah you shelled out for a home entertainment system was worth it.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.5) Top Gun (1986) - Tom Cruise/Kelly McGillis/Val Kilmer/Anthony Edwards/Tom Skerritt/Michael Ironside/Tim Robbns/Meg Ryanquences.

0375842209|5.0|How can I add to the many reviews here. I listened to th audio version, which was exceptionally well read. Like other reviewers I did not care for the narrator's tone to begin with. But the unusual writing style grew on me. The story is marvelously told. The characters are full-fledged, very real people that I came to care about greatly. The quotidian details of life with the horror of war and viciousness of Nazi persecution as backdrop make the book especially telling and poignant. Liesl, her foster parents, Rudy, Max, and the residents of her neighborhood will remain with me for a long time. A must read for high schoolers and beyond.

B004132I4S|5.0|Sufjan Stevens had been gone `too long' from the indie-rock circuit when 2010's [[ASIN:B00406525S All Delighted People EP]] materialized on August 23, 2010.  His last full length was the critically acclaimed (and a personal favorite) 2005 album [[ASIN:B0009R1T7M Illinois]].  Only months following his recent EP,  Stevens drops the true follow-up to his 2005 effort, entitled [[ASIN:B004132I4S The Age of Adz]] (pronounced \\"odds\\").  The album is a departure from Stevens' most recent works, abandoning sole use of acoustic ideas in favor of electronic driven production that also incorporates acoustic elements that make Stevens so distinctive from others.  The result is a busy, overt effort that is genius for the most part.  Stevens's musicianship is apparent from the onset.<br /><br />The album opens with the brief \\"Futile Devices,\\" which finds Stevens in the comfort of his folksy sound that he has cultivated as of late.  Stevens's vocal performance is restrained, free of extra frills and overt nuance, as we have come to expect of the somewhat mysterious singer-songwriter.  The `stripped' sound of \\"Futile Devices\\" is quickly contrasted by the ingenious \\"Too Much,\\" a cut that opens with electronics instantaneously upon the first few seconds of listening.  The ideas are extremely creative and clever, finding Stevens merging his classical music brains (he still uses mixed meters) and his progressive side almost flawlessly.  He does this all while making this rather uncommercial listen have some appeal with a simplistic, yet poignant hook (\\"it's too much riding on that, it's too much, too much, too much\\").  While the cut is lengthy, it is enjoyable, and the bridge between the acoustic and electronic worlds is exceptional.<br /><br />\\"Age of Adz,\\" pronounced \\"odds\\" is an even lengthier cut, clocking it at 8:00 in duration.  Despite the length, the orchestration is experimental with superb parts for the brass and woodwind instruments.  In addition to the acoustic instruments, Stevens once again combines electronics with his knack for orchestration to make yet another five-star rated performance.  The only complaint would be that Stevens's rather quiet, reserved vocals (even at their most overt) are covered in the bombastic production work.  The track ends, however, with strummed guitar and tender vocals by Stevens - that is the Stevens we have come to be accustomed to.<br /><br />\\"I Walked\\" is another great cut, where clear vocals by Stevens laced in falsetto stand out easily.  Again, with pop songwriter's craft, Stevens writes another simple, minimalistic hook that is relevant even to the most mainstream listener.  The classical-sounding background vocals here ad a superb touch. \\"Now That I'm Older\\" is solid too, even if there is a `lot to take in' and `absorb' as a listener.  \\"Get Real Get Right\\" contrasts a slower paced \\"Now That I'm Older\\" with a quicker pace here.  Additionally, vocally, Stevens gets right to the point, entering much earlier with his voice than previous cuts.  Again, pop craftsmanship is executed with a nice hook.<br /><br />\\"Bad Communication\\" is one of three relatively brief cuts on this album.  As always, Stevens use of instruments here is exceptional.  \\"Vesuvius\\" is a stand out after several solid tracks, which begins with Stevens recapturing his acoustic ruminations.  Before the 1:00 mark, the electronic drums enter, beginning to shape \\"Vesuvius\\" into another electro-acoustic masterwork.  The production work is more tasteful than more bombastic performances (\\"Too Much\\" or \\"Age of Adz\\"), which is nice to hear from Stevens after so many `jam-packed' cuts.  \\"All for Myself\\" is another exceptional cut and the last truly brief listen.  Here, background vocals add a creative dimension, not to mention that great compositional-sense that Stevens possesses throughout this ambitious album.  \\"All for Myself\\" features one of the best refrains of the album, finding Stevens singing: \\"We set out once, forget our shirts with hairy chests and well rehearsed, I want it all, I want it all for myself...\\"<br /><br />\\"I Want To Be Well\\" keeps up the momentous trend with a `schizophrenic' nature about it.  While it clocks in at a whopping 6:29 in duration, it is well worth the listen, if for nothing else than to hear the usually clean-cut singer drop the f-bomb: \\"I'm not f***ing around, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not f***ing around.\\"  Sure, that's not the sole shining (or shocking) moment, as the main refrain is not too shabby itself: \\"so do yourself a good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes...\\" Closing cut \\"Impossible Soul\\" is truly the only questionable cut - at 25:35 it finds Stevens indulging a bit to much, even for the adept `classical music listener's' soul.  There are some superb ideas and great and shocking moments (Stevens uses auto-tune!), but it is too much.  What it does do, however, is reflect the `greatest hits' of this album, with combinations of acoustic and electronic sensibilities.<br /><br />Exceptional album? By all means, with only few things to quibble out in my eyes.  After a five-year hiatus, I am glad one of my personal favorite musicians is back on the scene with a true, full length effort.  I highly recommend this album!rsed, I want it all, I want it all for myself...\\"     \\"I Want To Be Well\\" keeps up the momentous trend with a `schizophrenic' nature about it.

However, after reading about a quarter of this book I have stopped reading it and am of the opinion that this is not a good read. It is laced with vulgarity, unrealistic language and situations for the period written about. I must conclude that the writer has digressed from clean, legitimate and entertaining writing to exploiting the marketing opportunities available because of past successes, name recognition and his concept of the current \\"popular\\" trends in writing.<br /><br />This is the last Follett book I will waste my money on.

B000E1YVZU|2.0|Before I get to the review, confession time. Even as a theater extremist, I never liked Rent. OK people, go on and eviscerate me.<br /><br />Why did I never like it? Maybe if I was born in the eighties or if I lived in New York, I'd like it. There were a few moments of brilliance in the show, and some catchy songs, but none of the positives ever added up really. It's really dated and cheesy, it's WAY too long, in fact I've had to scoff at a lot of my friends (as of recently) who worship it because of how dated, cheesy and laughable it is. Especially since I saw it for the first time on stage in 2009 and enjoyed the actors' performances but absolutely hated it. Even moreso, its cheesy lyrics prevent me from enjoyment, and half the songs are half-arsed copy and paste jobs. One particularly crowning moment of cringe worthy is \\"Will I?\\". Ugh, I had to sing that for a showcase and dreaded every second of it each night. \\"Will I lose my diiiignityyy, will someone caaaare, will I wake tooomoroow[...] FROM!!! THIS!!! NIGHT!!! MAAAAAARE!!!!\\" as if the lyrics weren't bad enough, it gets repeated what feels like 250 times. The worst part is when the song becomes an incomprehensible mishmash at the end with 20 different people singing at different times to the point where it sounds like \\"Will someone care?\\" is repeated over and over. I most certainly WON'T care, and I would if the characters didn't feel like stereotypes, cardboard cutouts and had any depth other than \\"She's her lover/he's a drag queen/he's making a movie about their lifestyle/etc.\\" So as you could tell, there was no way I could imagine any of those craptacular songs or dated story translating to film.<br /><br />A few nights ago this was on TV, starting at 10. That, with commercials, resulted in me staying up till 1 to watch a terrible movie based on a really crappy musical. However curiosity bit me in the ass and so I gave in and watched this film.<br /><br />The good thing about this movie is that it's a terrible adaptation of the play. A lot of fanboys/girls have gotten angry over this but I was quite happy- at least half those craptacular songs were out of the question and songs were turned into dialogue to avoid me smashing my head against the nearest sharp object. Add to that some GREAT cinematography and visual brilliance. I liked the look of the film- fit the bohemian mood great. The cast wasn't that bad, some of them surprised me- specifically Maureen. She made me like \\"Over The Moon\\" actually. So in a way this film is better than the play but that's not saying much.<br /><br />The songs somehow sound even more emo than the play- and mind-bendingly so. That, of course, is the result of a film exposing a play for how truly bad it is, showing the songs' true form. So that means \\"Out Tonight\\", \\"Will I\\", \\"I Should Tell You\\", and \\"Light My Candle\\" are more whiny, cheesy, and annoying than the stage play. And of course, the film drones on and on for too long, just like the play, but thankfully it's shorter. Were this film a minute longer I'd cry.<br /><br />I'll go out on a limb and also state how I can't understand how the whole concept of \\"Rent\\" IN GENERAL has a huge fanbase. Am I gay? No. Do I enjoy watching stuff about AIDS? It depends on if its done tastefully. Maybe if I were in the gay crowd I'd be worshipping it just as much as everyone and their dog. No wait- even if I were gay I'd still hate its guts- Hell I even know gay people who hate Rent. I'll also go out on a limb and state I'll never, repeat, NEVER understand how teenagers adore it so much. As an adult, I find it so laughably dated and cheesy. I'll admit I wasn't born in the eighties, so maybe that's why I don't get some of the references. And yet people as young as 9 (bad parenting much? This film, here in Canada is rated PG, and in USA PG-13. I wouldn't recommend the play to anyone under 15 at all due to its content!) worship it! When I saw the stage production some time ago, a member of the cast stated on how difficult it was- for him as a straight man- to be able to pull off the role of a gay dude and make a man-to-man kiss look natural. Being an actor myself I know how difficult it is. Coincidentally that very person was one of my closest friends, whom I had seen the play for specifically (to be fair though, he did great for what he had to work with, so I'll give him that.). Honestly, even with its popularity among the LGBT community and what not, I fail to see the appeal of the show.<br /><br />In short, this film is a 135 minute exercise in idiocy, but hey, at least it's keeping true to the true nature of the show. I go see a play like The Gershwins' Crazy For You or Kotis' Urinetown and am immediately transported to the locations those shows take place in (The setting of Deadrock, Nevada is one of the most fun settings for a show ever). I go see Rent and am transported to the top floor of a 40 story office building. This gets an extra star just for managing to cleverly depict the idiocy of the show on film.

B000K4X2UQ|5.0|This CD is what Whitesnake once was and certainly not what it became.  L...ITHOTC (the double album/CD version) is simply one of the greatest live albums ever recorded.  It's blues/rock (emphasis on rock) at its best.  The only blip on this album is a song called \\"Lie Down\\".  It's not the worst song ever made but Whitesnake certainly had much, much better material than this. There are two Deep Purple songs here:  \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\" and \\"Mistreated\\".  To me, that's fine, seeing that Coverdale had a hand in them and justice is done to both, especially \\"Mistreated\\".  I disagree with the one reviewer; this version of \\"Mistreated\\" is the best one I've ever heard.  Add to it one of the greatest live guitar solos ever recorded (Micky Moody !?), and you have a superb album-closer.  Early Whitesnake fans will love L...ITHOTC; Whitesnake fans in general will probably think it's just OK.  I say that because of certain band members on this and other early Whitesnake albums.  Whitesnake was,is, and always will be David Coverdale's band.  Great in every way !!  But right along-side Coverdale were Micky Moody and Bernie Marsden on guitars and Neil Murray on bass, the true cogs in the REAL Whitesnake.  Moody and Marsden (and to an extent, Murray) will forever be vastly under-rated in Whitesnake lore.  \\"Pop and trendy\\" sell, and Sykes,Vai, Vandenberg, Beach, etc. proved that, even in this band.  While good for what they are, they are NOT Whitesnake.  So, in the end, here it is:  Any Whitesnake album with Moody and Marsden----BUY !!.  \\"Slide It In\\", with John Sykes and the late, great Mel Galley, is worth having. Anything else----Forget it.

Like Bursting Out, Jethro Tull Live at Madison Square Garden 1978 captures the lineup of lead singer/songwriter and flute player Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre, keyboard player John Evan, drummer Barriemore Barlow, orchestrator/keyboard player David Palmer (now known as Dee Palmer) and bass player Tony Williams who was filling in for the late John Glascock who was ill.<br />The DVD has the entire October 9, 1978 performance's audio although some of the tracks have photos as the BBC didn't film a number of songs while the CD that comes with this has all of the tunes sans the final encore and stage bantering.<br />We begin with a unique Introduction which segues into a killer version of \\"Sweet Dream\\" which rocks alot harder than the studio version and Bursting Out versions. We then jump to the Heavy Horses album for the acoustic \\"One Brown Mouse\\" and Heavy Horses' title cut (which was inexplicably missing from Bursting Out). We then have the excellent but condensed version of \\"Thick As A Brick\\" which first appeared on the remastered Thick as a Brick remastered CD from 1997 (the live concert footage on film starts with this track on the DVD). Next is a rocking version of the Heavy Horses album track \\"No Lullaby\\" which is a superb version which includes a superb Ian Anderson flute solo. Then we have a little keyboard improv which segues into a stellar version of \\"Songs From the Wood\\".<br />Then comes the band intros (not on the CD) which then leads into a shortened version of the Bursting Out instrumental \\"Quatrain\\" which is driven by a killer riff by Barre that segues into a phenomenal version of the title track to 1971's Aqualung. We then have a classic version of \\"Locomotive Breath\\" which just rocks. Then it goes into \\"The Dambusters March\\" which gives way into an instrumental which rocks before going into another \\"Conundrum\\" type instrumental (the film footage ends midway through the song) with a phenomenal drum solo from Barriemore Barlow. Then we have an excellent version of \\"Too Old to Rock and Roll Too Young to Die\\" and a stellar medley of \\"My God\\"/\\"Cross Eyed Mary\\" (which ends the CD). Then the band does another rendition of \\"Locomotive Breath\\" which is similar to the version found on Bursting Out with the reprise of \\"Aqualung\\" at the end.<br />Jethro Tull Live at Madison Square Garden 1978 is a great companion to Bursting Out and is great to compare and contrats the versions found here and on Bursting Out.<br />HUGELY RECOMMENDED!just rocks.

B003TSEL7S|4.0|A great addition to the Camp Half-Blood story line! The same action and adventure we were introduced to in the Percy Jackson series, but new characters who feel neither forced nor out of place.  As much as I love Percy, Annabeth, Grover & the gang, it was great to meet new characters who will continue to move the story forward.  Some of it was easy to figure out, but other parts were a nice surprise.  If you were a fan of the Percy Jackson series, you will definitely love this one as well.
B003YWUTKM|5.0|English techno music masters The Orb and former Pink Floyd singer/songwriter/guitarist David Gilmour's new collaboration album together entitled Metallic Spheres is a must for both Orb and Pink Floyd/David Gilmour fans alike.<br />For many years The Orb have been one of the most influential techno/trance music acts to come out of England and many people and critics had compared them to Pink Floyd with their approach to making music. It turns out The Orb's two main members Youth (who also produces this album) and the group's mainstay mastermind Alex Paterson have long professed their love for Pink Floyd's music and how much Pink Floyd were an influence on their music. Also there were supposed remix bootlegs of Pink Floyd albums done by The Orb members themselves (all not bad by the way).<br />The Metallic Spheres album came to be when David Gilmour went into the recording studio with Youth (a/k/a Martin Glover) in June of 2009 to record guitar parts for an ambient remix of Gilmour's version of the 1970 Graham Nash protest song \\"Chicago\\" which David had recorded earlier in 2009 with Pretenders singer/songwriter/mastermind Chrissie Hynde and ex-Boomtown Rats singer/songwriter/mastermind and also Live Aid/Live 8 organizer Bob Geldof to help raise awareness of the plight of Scotsman Gary McKinnon (who, like myself, has Aspergers Syndrome (a form of Autism)) whom is being threatened to be extradicted to the US for hacking US military computer systems (don't the CIA, FBI, KGB, the man in red and the \\"intelligence\\" SOBs have other things to worry about than a person with Autism/Aspergers hacking military computer systems like going after murderers, psychos, terrorists and so on who actually do bodily harm to others). Anyhow, what transpired from the jam sessions was Gilmour and The Orb recording an album's worth of material which has turned out to be a great album.<br />The \\"Metallic Side\\" starts off like a classic Pink Floyd epic would have with sound effects joined by David's guitar and each other instrument coming to life especially in the section known as \\"Hymns to the Sun\\" has some of David's excellent guitar work. Then ten minutes into this is Gilmour's voice and his guitar work on this half is incredible. The section called \\"Black Graham\\" is excellent with superb acoustic and electric guitar work. The electric guitar work reminds me of Gilmour's 1970-75 Pink Floyd era and in a great way as well.<br />The \\"Spheres Side\\" is musically darker (in a good way) than the Metallic half at first and David's guitar work is incredible throughout the first part of this piece especially on \\"Hymns to the Sun (Reprise)\\". Then the piece takes on a more percussive feel than it did in the first half of this suite. Towards the end of this half when you thought David's voice and guitar pretty much disappears, it comes back when you least expect it before the album ends like any great epic would.<br />Metallic Spheres is a great album and a superb collaboration between one of the grandfathers of modern electronic music David Gilmour and The Orb and is not to be seen as the new David Gilmour solo album but an album he made with The Orb as a special guest who plays on the whole album. I hope they do another collaboration together.<br />RECOMMENDED!and each other instrument coming to life especially in the section known as \\"Hymns to the Sun\\" has some of David's excellent guitar work.

B003XX2PD6|4.0|A halcyon is a mythical bird said to have the power to charm the wind and waves into calmness.  Deerhunter do just that on their latest release, Halcyon Digest.<br /><br />Maybe the album title should have given it away, but when I pressed play I expected a fourth dose of their complicated, partially-disruptive instrument style wrapped around Bradford Cox's mid-toned, pace-setting voice.  Maybe even a track that sounds like the band is tuning their instruments or forgot for 33 seconds that the \\"On Air\\" sign was illuminated.  None of that lives on Halcyon.  What you get this time from Deerhunter is a greater calmness, more patience, and a perfectly listenable collection of songs.  And you will happily take it.<br /><br />The album moves freely inside a short range of sounds.  From the atmospheric, and surprisingly gentle opener, \\"Earthquake,\\" to the more pepped-up and jangly \\"Revival\\"  Halcyon just doesn't roam wild.  What catches this listener by pleasant surprise is the undisrupted, melodic style; the simplicity of the patterns in the songs; and how much more I appreciate Bradford Cox's voice as an integral part of the listening experience.<br /><br />The back half of the album is more traditional Deerhunter with the punchy \\"Desire Lines\\" and ghosty and semi-distant \\"Basement Scene,\\" but overall still greatly restrained.  At no point do the guitars run away with it or does a song just drop off into oblivion or morph into some stacked loops of percussion, vocals, and strings.  It holds tightly together to the finish.  Now, I do love the \\"two-fer\\" songs, where the front of the song and the end of the song sounds like they came from two different places giving you a two-for-one kind of feel (a la \\"Nothing Ever Happened\\" at the 2:00 mark where you \\"never saw it coming\\"), but with Halcyon it's an effortless 45 minutes soaking in songs with soft, round edges.<br /><br />The album finishes with \\"He Would Have Laughed,\\" a tribute to the late Jay Reatard and, even though pushing 7 1/2 minutes, cuts short at the end, just like Reatard's own life.<br /><br />Halcyon strikes me as the album that will net droves of new fans for Deerhunter.  It's palatable to the masses, sing-a-long-able, has some catchy hooks, and introduces a cool factor to the iTunes collection of all those Coldplay fans.  This is the album that will result in the acquisition of Deerhunter's back catalog and, for the savvy, an investigation into Cox's solo work under the Atlas Sound moniker.<br /><br />Trail Map:  Air - U2 - The Beatles - Animal Collective<br /><br />Score:  80/100<br /><br />If you listen to only one:  Desire Lines<br /><br />More music reviews at [...]at the end, just like Reatard's own life.

B001OQCV2O|4.0|I found this movie to be quite good even if I don't particularly like disaster movies. The acting was was well done and the special effects were really good.  If you have a home theater with surround sound it is highly recommended that you buy this in the Blue Ray format.  The plot is simple - The earth is undergoing a metamorphesus and only a select few will be allowed to survive.  Not because the govenment is cruel but because there just wasn't enough lead time to allow for more people to escape the disaster without a wide spread panic.  They select the smartest richest and most influential in the world to ride out the storm and become the Adams and Eves of the new world.

Probably that's why I love this book so much I've pretty much it makes me realize my mistakes, and teaches me how to do it correctly, right now I'm doing a personal project in which I'm also applying what I'm reading, so this book has become pretty handy. I don't think is a bible or something like that. But it guides you really well, in a lot of aspects of programming.
B00005PJ6M|1.0|After watching the abysmal \\"Excellent Adventure\\" I took another kick in the nads and watched this complete waste of time. If you think the first film is bad, then don't even think about this one. Once again our two uncharismatic do-do birds go on another \\"trip\\"! Whoopee! :-D I do want to point out that I like stupid stoner films and I can watch the dumbest of dumb when it come to them, but this film is boring, stupid and should have nothing of interest for anyone. There are so many better stoner comedies out there! Lets just forget this one ever happened!
B002E2M5IC|5.0|You have this man whose life is spinning out of control and he wants answers. Everyone has said those famous words \\" Why is this happening to me?\\" The rabbis do not have the answers at least not good ones. Which explains the serious man's comment \\"The boss is still the boss,doesn't make him right.\\" The answer that is finally given is from a rock song(if you even call it an answer) at the end of the film. I thought the movie was so layered with ambiguities that based on your own belief system you would come away with your own interpretation of  what they were trying to say. You could interpret this man as someone who does not want to cause waves or you could view him trying to be a serious Jewish man and doing what the good book says,\\"Love your enemy and love those who hurt you,which it seemed his wife and Sy and everyone else was doing. Was the tornado a freak weather storm, did his actions (changing the grade) cause it? So based on what your belief system is, you could say every action has a reaction,or every thing happens for a reason,or things just happen and their is no rhyme or reason why.       I viewed the movie as being satire on belief systems. I felt The beginning of the movie was a spring board for the rest of the film. Your personal beliefs could sway your actions. For example the wife thought the man who was invited in her home was an evil spirit or demon. The Husband did not,so he was kind. Her belief system swayed her to stab him. The same thing applied with the serious man and how he dealt with his problems and why they were happening. I thought the film was deceptively clever, and very funny.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|I had really high hopes for this film and that could have been part of my disappointment with it. I loved the premise and this is the kind of film that would normally pull me in, but I found the performances bland and the execution poor. I caught myself checking my watch to see how much time was left too many times. I think it's worth 2 1/2 stars, but it is a very forgettable movie that I doubt I would ever watch again.

B003EYVXXW|4.0|At the close of the 4th century AD, the Roman Empire turned on itself in a very fundamental way. For thousands of years, the ancient peoples of the Mediterranean world worshiped a multitude of deities, and participated in a variety of religious cults.  Religious violence was practically unknown.  A system of free inquiry, fostered in Classical Greece, continued unabated into at least the 3rd century of the Roman Empire.  With the conversion of the early 4th century Emperor Constantine, however, and the declaration that Christianity was the official religion of the Empire by his successor Theodosius at the end of the century, the ancient temples and shrines of the gods were overturned and destroyed, their priests killed or scattered, and , as Charles Freedman shows in his groundbreaking book &#34;The Closing of the Western Mind&#34;, the Hellenic spirit of rational thought and free inquiry was snuffed out.  The last astronomical observation in antiquity was  made in the city of Alexandria in 476 AD. . .not until the 16th century would progress again move forward.  But even by the 5th century, inquiry was dead.  This film follows this destruction with some dramatic license, but , on the whole, stays faithful to the few facts we have.   Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) is a philosopher who teaches in the Serapeion, the chief pagan temple in Alexandria and the location of the remaining library.  Two of her students, her slave, Davus (Max Minghella) and the aristocratic Roman Orestes (Oscar Isaac) are in love with her, but despondent, knowing that she has vowed herself to virginity, as she is of the Platonic view that the body is corrupt and that only the soul is of value.  As she ponders the true nature of the cosmos, beginning to doubt taht the earth is at it's center at a time when such a thought was deemed ridiculous, she fails to see the wholesale destruction of her world even as it comes hurtling at her headlong.  In the streets of Alexandria, more and more people are converting to the new state religion of Christianity, while it's leaders begin to exhort them to &#34;smash the idols of the heathens&#34;, the same temples their ancestors had worshipped in for generations.  As the Serapeion is besieged and Hypatia's family and household become unglued, she clings to her beloved principles and tries to carry on.  Soon enough, though, such a thing becomes impossible.   The film is a bit heavy handed in it's raison d'etre. . .but it is never saccharine, nor nostalgic for a &#34;better time&#34;.  The pagan world, as is shown, is completely at home with slavery and reactionary cruelty ; there is no &#34;good guy&#34; here, other than Hypatia, though her flaws are laid plain as well. The notion that the early Christians were all about lions laying down with lambs, turning the other cheek, and loving their neighbor is also firmly quashed. The only thing these people seem to imagine Christianity demands is blind faith that Jesus, the rabbi who lived and died almost four hundred years before the film opens, is their savior.  The destruction of pagan shrines, and non-believers themselves, does not bother them in the slightest.  The movie makes it plain that the world did not necessarily become a better place after Constantine, a man who's own behavior was hardly Christian in our modern sense of the word. It has been stated that Hypatia died because of a political struggle between the city governor and the Christian Bishop, not for a religious reason.  This misses the essential point.  There was no separation of Church and State (or temple and state) in the ancient world.  The Bishop feared the continuing influence of a non-Christian on a nominally Christian politician.  The crowds were roused to believe that to be unconverted was to be in the thrall of Satan.  Thus, she had to go.  The strongest point the film drives home is that as soon as monotheism becomes compulsory, the logical conclusion is that all dissenters are offensive to God, and must be removed.

1410430103|1.0|I hate to leave a book unfinished, no matter how lousy it is, and that was the only factor that got me through this one.  I was embarrassed reading it, not only for the author, but for all those people on Amazon who gave it 5 stars.  The story is strung together with the most unlikely and illogical occurrences.  Someone said the author uses \\"shrug\\" too often.  That's nothing.  The dialogue is packed with sentences that end in \\"..., right?\\" or \\" ....,OK?\\"  As one of the prior reviewers pointed out, this is an encouraging book to read if you've always wanted to write but felt you weren't good enough.
B003XRZZFM|4.0|Dimmu Borgir has lost the talents of ICS Vortex and Mustis in this outing, instead relying on session artists to complete the tracks.  The remaining trio does have the (dark) energy to keep the band moving, but this does seem a little too accessible to the masses, and perhaps a little redundant in places as well.  This is not what I would call an \\"accessible\\" band due to their lyrical content and the fact that you can barely make out what is being said most of the time.  Hopefully this is more of a bump in the road due to the band's losses and not some new direction they are taking in order to try to garner more of a fan base.  If you've read any interviews of the band, it is not exactly a secret that these guys are not out to please anyone and will do whatever they feel like doing, but I fear the lure of cash may have taken hold.    I still give this 4 stars simply because of who they are and the type of music they play, but this is the first time I've rated a Dimmu album at anything less than 5 stars.    The first few tracks are actually not bad at all, making excellent use of the choir and orchestra, but as the tracks tick upward you start to wonder if the CD restarted and you're still listening to the same tracks. Ritualist and Born Treacherous are almost interchangable at times, and then it seems like the last group of songs are using the same orchestra and choir tracks in a predictable pattern.  This is not to say the tracks are bad, but it feels like the creativity started to decline through the recording journey.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|My local electronics store already had the Alien Anthology bluray on the shelves this Tuesday (October 19).  At first I thought the street date had been changed at the last minute (it wouldn't be the first time).  But it appears that all the websites still list the release date for next Tuesday (Oct 26), so I guess my local store must have made a mistake (it wouldn't be the first time for that either).<br /> In either case, I already got my hands on the Alien Anthology set, and I thought that Alien fans who are still trying to decide whether it's worth the upgrade before next week's proper street date might want to know the following:<br />(Note: This review assumes that most of you have already seen the films, and there may be some very mild spoilers.)<br />[UPDATE:  I've added LOTS more detail about the extras, including the extended Alien 3 doc.  Find this under PROS section (3).  In PROS section (1) I've also answered some questions from another customer.]<br />[UPDATE 4: More specifics on why the 3rd and 4th films' picture quality won't wow you as much as the first 2 films'.  Under Cons section (1)]<br />[UPDATE 6: I've found more new extras on disc 6, including new deleted scenes from Aliens.  Details in PROS section (3).]<br /><br /> PROS:<br />1) All four films look very good on bluray, and much better than the earlier DVDs, with the first two films looking the best.  Alien almost looks brand new.  Aliens still looks its age (sometimes), but it enjoys the single biggest improvement in picture quality in the jump from DVD to bluray that I have ever seen for a classic film (or pretty much any film for that matter).  While there are still plenty of shots that still look soft or a bit grainy by today's standards, the entire film looks sharper than ever and the grain is far less distracting.  Some sequences, like the marines' initial investigation of the abandoned colony, almost look like they could have been shot this year.  The color quality and detail visible on the panning shot from the planet to Ripley's orbital hospital room at the beginning of the film totally blew my mind. Detail and texture are excellent throughout and I saw no signs that DNR had been overused.  After experiencing Aliens on bluray, I wonder how I was ever able to tolerate the picture quality on the DVD.<br />[UPDATE:  The Theatrical and Director's cuts of Alien both look equally great.  It's my understanding that Ridley Scott made some minor alterations to things like contrast, etc. in the Director's cut, but I frankly didn't notice any difference between the two.  I haven't watched the Theatrical cut of Aliens in years, as I much prefer the Extended version, so I may not remember which all scenes were added for the latter.  However, I did not notice any correlation between picture quality and whether a scene was in the Theatrical cut or added in later, so I assume that they all come from the same source and are of more-or-less equal quality.  If I have a chance to look at it again soon and do notice any differences, I'll post another update.]<br />[UPDATE 2:  I've watched the first 25 minutes of the Theatrical cut of Aliens and can confirm that the picture quality is identical to the Special Edition.  In other words, it will cause longtime Aliens fans' jaws to drop off right before they become temporarily blinded by its awe-inspiring glory.  This is truly the greatest film restoration I've ever seen prepared for the transition from DVD to bluray.  Because of the film stock used, I didn't think it would ever be possible for the film to look this good.]<br /><br /> 2) All four films also sound greatly improved compared to the DVD.  This is especially true for Alien 3.  Dialogue which was hard to make out on the DVD is now much clearer and easier to understand.  I did notice some audio sync issues with some of the third film's dialogue, but I think these are misalignments which were already present on previous DVD releases, and may therefore be inherent to the original film.<br /><br /> 3) The new extras are extensive and excellent.  Within the first couple minutes of sampling the new enhancement pods on disc 5, I learned a couple of tidbits I had been unaware of before.  These are a wonderful extension of the already superb making-of documentaries.  The MU-TH-UR interactive mode is easy to use and will probably prove helpful to those who are only interested in seeing certain parts of the behind-the-scenes material, but I haven't used it much.  I've only sampled a couple minutes of the trivia track portion of this feature (titled \\"Datastream\\"), but so far it appears as though it will mostly be a re-hash of material you can find in disc 5's documentaries.  The set also includes ALL of the extras from EVERY previous release of these films, as promised (at least as far as I can tell), in addition to the extended Alien Evolution and Alien 3 documentaries.<br />[UPDATE:  The extended Alien 3 documentary includes significantly more footage of Fincher directing on the set (lenghtier character discussions with the actors, etc.) and more detail on the schism between him and the studio that I don't remember seeing on the Quadrilogy DVD.  At one point during filming you see Fincher get on a microphone and say, \\"I can't believe Fox is the number one studio because they're all such a bunch of morons.\\"  Interestingly, while some of the new footage does reflect poorly on the studio, I think it also makes it easier to understand why some people had trouble working with Fincher.  I personally find this longer cut much more interesting, but it hardly feels like an entirely new, revelatory version.  Still, if you love a good behind-the-scenes documentary, the extended cut of \\"Wreckage and Rage: The Making of Alien 3\\" may help justify the upgrade to bluray.<br />  By my estimate, disc 5 contains around 17 hours of documentaries, including an hour to an hour-and-a-half of new enhancement pods for each individual film (these are mostly extended interviews and production footage).  I couldn't even tell you how many hours of content are on disc 6.  So it's understandable, due to space limitations, that some of this material still appears to be in standard def.  Although it's in SD, most of it has been enhanced so your bluray player will upconvert it (sometimes beautifully so) to fill a widescreen TV.  I find the text slides on the still galleries of concept art on disc 6 (which ARE in FULL HD) much easier to read now.  In disc 5's docs, most film clips, production artwork and photos, and many interviews will now fill the screen, while other interview clips appear pillarboxed with new imagery to the right and left instead of black bars (similar to the \\"Disneyview\\" feature on the Snow White and Pinocchio blurays, though mostly much less distracting than those were).  It all looks good enough that I don't think many people will be too disappointed that some of these extras are still in SD.<br />  BOTTOM LINE: The extras, both new and old, are a substantial improvement over the Quadrilogy DVD set (at least IMHO, your mileage may vary).  I doubt many people will feel shortchanged here.]<br />[UPDATE 6:  I've found more new extras on disc 6.  There are some deleted scenes from Aliens, at least one of which - featuring Burke in a cocoon - I don't think I've seen before.  The Patch and Logos image gallery will be appreciated by folks who love all the costuming/set dressing details.  There's a video reproduction of a ride called \\"Aliens: Ride At The Speed of Fright\\" which is notable for two things: it's REALLY cheesy, and it features a very young Jeffrey Combs (I think this part is new - I don't remember seeing it on the DVD).  The Parodies section is just some Alien-related clips from Spaceballs and Family Guy.  You'll also want to keep an eye out for Easter Eggs on this disc.]<br /><br /> 4) The set has a couple of impressive surprises that weren't mentioned in any of the studio press releases I've seen.  Disc Unbound is an automatic feature: when you eject any disc from this set, the Weyland-Yutani logo will pop up on screen.  You can then insert any other disc from the set and you'll go straight to the main menu - it will skip over all the studio logos and FBI Warning screens, making an Alien marathon slightly faster and less annoying.<br />  I was aware that this set would include isolated score tracks for all four films (as well as alternate score tracks for the first two), but was unaware that you can also access each piece of music in any order from an index which includes even more unused music.  I'm not certain, but I think I may have even spotted a couple of Bonus alternate tracks for Aliens that weren't even on the Deluxe Edition soundtrack CD.<br /><br />5) For those who are hard of hearing, all 4 films and even the extras on discs 5 and 6 include subtitles in around 15 languages, including English and Spanish.  Even the audio commentaries have subtitles in multiple languages!  Each film also has multiple language audio tracks, though it appears that only the English receives a lossless one.<br /><br /> 6) The packaging is the most elegantly beautiful I've ever seen for a bluray set.  Inside the slipcase is a hardcover book with each disc held securely within its own page.  These pages include photos from each film, as well as some basic info like plot synopses and director's credits.  There's also a booklet and insert tucked in the back which explain how MU-TH-UR mode and Disc Unbound work, and list the content on each disc.  It also has a note from Ridley Scott filled with tantalizing hints about what to expect in his upcoming prequel.  Everyone will be happy to know that the package is very compact and will fit perfectly next to your other blurays.  It's the same size as the Close Encounters of the Third Kind bluray, except that the spine is a little thicker since it holds more discs.<br />  The menu screens are also beautifully designed.  The menu for each film features a Weyland-Yutani computer interface with a continuous stream of 3D diagrams and info on various vehicles, weapons, and creatures from each film.  It also shows a spacechart indicating the name and location of the planet where each film takes place.  Many fans will want to watch the menus play a few times just to take in all the information and detail.  The menus are also quick and easy to navigate, and most video features on discs 5 and 6 include a \\"Play All\\" option.  On disc 5, for example, you can either play all segments of the documentray for each film separately, or you can simply choose to play all 4 documentaries at once.<br /><br />As beautiful as the packaging is, it does have a couple of minor problems, which brings me to...<br /><br />CONS:<br />1)  The 3rd and 4th films don't look quite as spectacular as the first two.  They still look far better than the DVDs, and I think the vast majority of people will be perfectly pleased with them.  For example, the underwater sequence in Resurrection looks more beautiful than ever.  In the shot where the alien drags the docking pilot back into the flooded kitchen, I could now clearly see a single hair floating across the foreground, a detail I had never noticed before during the dozens of times I had watched this movie on DVD.  The text of the electronic Bible from the extended chapel scene is also much easier to read now.  Nevertheless, you can tell that slightly less work went into the last two films, and some of the hardcore videophiles may be very slightly disappointed by the results after they see how magnificent the first two films now look.<br /><br />[UPDATE:  In my honest opinion, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection only look less impressive in comparison to the first two films.  I didn't notice any signs of DNR or any other technical issues at all. It's my understanding that the first, third and fourth films each had new HD remasters done for the 2003 Quadrilogy DVD set.  (If I recall correctly, I think that James Cameron chose not to do a new remaster of Aliens at that time because he felt the one they had was already about as good as they could make the movie look with the technology available circa 2003 - this is probably again due to the film stock they shot Aliens on.)<br />Skip ahead 7 years to today.  Now Alien has been given ANOTHER NEW HD remaster using the most up-to-date technology, and it looks outstanding.  Not only does it ALMOST look, for the most part, like a film that could have been shot in 2010, I think the picture quality on the bluray is often as sharp or sharper and better-looking than some films that really did come out this year (like Predators).  It's also nearly comparable to, at times dare I say maybe even better than the picture quality on Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, in my opinion (at least when you take Alien's age into consideration).  Aliens has also received a brand NEW HD remaster - probably its first in over a decade.  I was too young to see it in the theater, but I imagine Cameron is probably telling the truth when he claims that it looks better than it originally did in the theater.  I didn't believe it could ever look as good as it does on bluray because of how bad it looked on DVD and because of what Cameron and others have said about the weaknesses of the film they shot it on.<br />Alien 3 and Resurrection, it's my understanding, have NOT received NEW HD remasters circa 2010.  So basically, this is the first time that you're seeing the full quality of the HD remasters that were done for the 2003 Quadrilogy set (which obviously could not show them in HD).  They still look very good, and much better than the DVD.  Sometimes they have better detail and look sharper than Alien and Aliens do, but technologies for film restoration have obviously improved a great deal in 7 years, and for the most part I think that the first two films now look better (i.e. sharper, etc.) than the last two, at least with regard to expectation.  Think of it this way: we typically expect newer movies to look better on bluray than older ones do.  So when you see how near-perfect (excellent detail, depth, contrast, deep blacks, no distracting grain, etc.) Alien now looks, then see how the picture quality on Aliens (while certainly not \\"perfect\\") far exceeds anything you would expect for a film photographed on such problematic material, you then expect the picture quality on the last two films to knock it out of the ballpark and surprise you to an equal or greater degree.  Since they don't SURPRISE you (they only look NEARLY Just As GOOD as the first two films - even though their remasters were done 7 years ago, they were still done very well), many people who actually understand a bit about film restoration will clearly see a difference and wish Fox had spent the money to do a more recent 2010 remaster of the last two films as well, so they would look EVERY BIT As Good or better than the first two films, as we would expect them to.  Meanwhile, I think that most people in a more general audience will only see a difference in comparison to the first two films, if they see any difference in the picture quality at all.  Many (maybe not all) of those people will probably be completely satisfied with the fact that all 4 movies look far, FAR better than they did on DVD.<br />Of course, it's possible I'm misinformed and that further restoration was done more recently on the last two films, and just wasn't as extensive as that done on the first two.  But either way, the end effect is the same.  In other words, you'll look at Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection and say, \\"These look really good, way better than the DVD.\\"  You won't have the same reaction to them that you'll probably have to the first two movies, which is, \\"HOLY C%@P!!!!  HOW DID THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS OLD LOOK THIS GOOD!!!  AND HOW DID I EVER MANAGE TO WATCH THE SECOND MOVIE ON DVD WHEN IT COULD HAVE LOOKED THIS MUCH BETTER??!!!!!\\"]<br /><br /> 2) Thepackaging requires you to slide the discs sideways out from their pages.  While the discs are held quite securely, I found that they are very easy to pull out after a little practice.  As long as you're careful I don't think there's much need to worry about damaging the discs.  Another issue is how tightly the book holding the discs fits into the outer slipcover.  The best way to get it out is to hold the set on its side and gently shake it a couple of times till you can grab the book's edge and pull it the rest of the way out.  Personally, I don't find these issues all that bothersome, but I know some people will probably find it more frustrating.  Those who dislike non-standard book-style packaging may want to wait for the individual releases of each film in the hopes that they'll have more standard packaging.<br />  (NOTE:  Anyone who wants to bypass the issue of removing the outer slipcase after you open the set for the first time could just set the book containing the discs, minus outer slipcase, on the shelf with their other blurays - the packaging seems pretty sturdy and I think the discs would still be well-protected.)<br />  (NOTE:  The Alien Anthology booklet does not replicate all of the text from the booklet included in the Quadrilogy DVD set, so obsessive completists may want to remove the Quadrilogy booklet if you're going to sell or give away your DVDs.  Unfortunately, the Quadrilogy booklet is too large to fit inside the bluray package.)<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE:<br />  If you don't want all four movies, are allergic to non-standard packaging, or just can't afford the steep price tag, you may want to wait for the inevitable but as-yet-unannounced individual bluray releases.  (Just keep in mind that the extras for all four films have been condensed onto 2 bluray discs for this set.  At this point in time there's no way to know whether you'll get all of the new extras if you wait for the individual releases.)  Otherwise, this set is an absolute must-have.  While the last two films don't look quite as good as the first two, they still look pretty great, and this set has exceeded all of my other expectations (which were very high).  The picture quality on Aliens especially knocked my socks off.  The new extras are substantial, and the quality of the entire presentation sets a new standard for future bluray releases.  As a lifelong fan of these films I felt like the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set was a dream-come-true.  The Alien Anthology bluray set makes me feel like all my dreams were inadequate.<br /><br /> Just to be clear, I am not associated in any way with any Hollywood studio or any newspaper, magazine or website which reviews films or DVDs/blurays.

B002ZG997C|4.0|Though science fiction is not something I often watch or read.  I found it interesting to watch.  I liked it.
B003KTEGG2|5.0|If you havnt bought it yet, go ahead and just do it now.  At first I only liked a couple songs off of this album, with Compliments being the obvious standout.  The best albums are always the ones that take a bit to sink in, and this was the case, as I love pretty much every track now.  My favorite track is now Infinite Arms, with On My Way Back Home a close second, songs that I didnt even care for at first.  My kids are constantly singing the songs on this album to themselves as they play with legos and such which of course makes me all kinds of happy.  I am still not sick of Funeral from their first album and I expect this to be the case with Infinite Arms.
B00275EGWY|5.0|There is no question why this film won the Oscar for best picture of the year.  It was emotional, well acted, well written, et al.  I normally am trying to avoid articles and books about this illegal war, but this was an excellent exception for me.  Very moving.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show is the best comedy I've seen on regular cable EVER!!  I tried watching it after my husband had gone to sleep and I kept waking him up by laughing so hard in a completely different room!  Every character in this show is absolutely hilarious.  I can't get enough of it, I wish Modern Family wasn't only a 1/2-hour long show.
0439023513|1.0|There are so many good reviews and I think most of them have spoilers and say what I thought about these books. So I'm gonna keep it short.<br /><br />The first book was *FANTASTIC*.<br />The second book was good.<br />The third book was a disaster.<br /><br />I was bored from chapters 1 through 8, but I decided to persist because of what I had read in prior books. After chapter 8, things start getting better, but the author uses cheap techniques to keep the story going... (introduce bunch of characters to be killed? oh please...)<br />Katniss, instead of evolving and becoming better (mature, independent, etc) actually does the opposite and she starts getting very annoying at so many levels.<br />The ending was bad. It didn't feel like it ended, it wasn't satisfying. I accept and actually like books with an open end, but Mockingjay didn't leave an open end, as it didn't finish a cycle (at least not for Katniss). It was really vague and there were things that shouldn't be explained that were overexplained and other things that should have that weren't at all.<br />I like cheesy epilogues (Harry Potter &lt;333), but this one was poorly done and unnecessary.<br /><br />If I want to summarize my feelings by the time I was done with the book I would just raise the question: AM I FREAKING READING A FAN FICTION?<br />I wish I hadn't read this book. Please, don't torture yourself if loved the series so far.

B0041OOJNU|1.0|Corriente no bueno para las fiestas de fin de ano, por respeto a tus padres, abuelos o ninos. Yo no se que estaba pensando Shaki, en sacar esto, ella cambio bastante, algunas canciones son muy corrientes y ella se oye corrientota casi llegando a vulgar. No se compara a los primeros discos donde ella se dio a conocer por primera vez, de piez delcalzos hasta el primer disco en ingles y espanol, estubo muy bien, pero creo que como no vendia lo que ella esperaba, empezo con esa locura, canciones y video clips tontos. Bueno solo queda esperar para el proximo disco.
0330485385|5.0|I heard a lot of mixed reviews about The Lovely Bones so I began reading it assuming that I would be disappointed.  Instead, I loved it.  I thought that the story was poignant and realistic - especially the emotional rollercoaster of a family living with the loss of their daughter/sister and forced to live with the fact that her killer was never officially found.  But most importantly, this book had closure.  At some point along the way, I was afraid that while I would like the story, I would hate the book because of a lack of closure - that was not the case.  I don't often give a 5 star rating, but this book deserves it.
0316776963|3.0|David Sedaris has put together many short stories and essays.  Some not laugh out loud  but defintely brings a smirk at times, amusing and entertaiing at other times. I found my ratings from each of the stories  went from a  6 star, to a 1 star to a 4 star to a  3,4,6,4,6,5,1,2,3, and so on.<br /><br />You will understand  if all the brilliant stories were in one book  yes it would deserve a 5 star, but sadly they are scattered through some very average ones. My overall rating on this book is a 3.5 star. Definately worth a listen. Maybe try one of his other ones first.
142311339X|5.0|I really liked this book. It is  a great sequel to Percy Jackson series. The new heroes are likable and romance nicely intervenes with the plot. One thing that I really missed was Grover. Coach Gleeson Hedge is not that funny. Humor was an important part of the previous books and the author should try to keep it. Don't make it another \\"hunger games\\".
B0034G4OVS|5.0|This is simply one of the best movies I have seen in YEARS. As other reviewers say, this is NOT a horror movie - but a stunning thriller that keeps you hanging from the edge of your seat. Incredible filming, pace, and story. The actors were believable due to the fact that they filmed it in harrowing conditions at a Utah Ski resort.  I saw this film originally at Sundance in Jan 10. The director warned us before the film began, that if anyone in the audience felt sick, or needed to leave during the screening - they should do so immediately. Apparently they had numerous incidents of this happening during the premiere and at other screenings. I am not faint of heart - and I simply LOVED this movie. So much so that I desperately tried to see it again and marked my calendar for the DVD release. I am hosting a screening of this in my home on Saturday night. It is a MUST see for any thrill-loving movie-goer.  Don't miss this one! (Unless you are faint of heart or afraid of heights!!).
B000MZHW4A|5.0|This film shows a world of unbelievable violence and greed. Africa's beauty and wildlife are usually romanticized, but this film shows a much different picture.   If I hadn't already seen documentaries on this subject, I might not have believed it could be this bad. Not one for conventional jewelry myself, still I certainly look at precious stones much differently.     It is riddled with violent warring factions, street shootings, espionage, betrayals and the helplessness of the innocents caught up in it. At the center of it all, a large pink diamond in-the-rough; the cost for it to adorn someone's neck being far too high. Actors DiCaprio and Hounson do a superb job with their roles.     Hounson's character says he had heard his people being told they were better off when the white's ruled. I think they were better off before whites ever came, having brought capitalism in the extreme. Africa by right, belongs to Africans.    The speech made by a politician at the end summed it up well. I wish more movies like this were also made about the fur, animal souvenir and live-animal trades as well (such as 'Gorillas in the Mist').    A must-see, but for Adults Only.
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|OK before I start, I own the entire back catalog except for the last album which just didn't deserve my $.    This album is a very welcome and overdue return to Joe doing what he does best, writing songs that have the soul of a blues player and the punch of a rocker. This release takes us back to albums like the self titled 'Joe Satriani' and 'Time Machine' neither of which are my favorites but good honest releases all the same, finally it feels like Joe has realized that dumping on the effects and making crazy sounds only gets you so far before you loose the notes and feeling in the audio congestion.    That said, I wonder if these songs serve to suggest that maybe Joe has given us what he has to offer by way of truly original song writing and the magic is starting to fade. This album certainly for me at least offers the hope that returning to the roots will give us a couple more good thumpers before the fade, but the catalog has yet to give us a new 'Flying in a Blue dream' or 'The Extremist' and I have to wonder if they are ever coming again.    All this said, this is a definite Satriani album as opposed to the last couple of releases that merely enter the ear and leave as quickly as they arrive. As a side note, for me the most notable work on these 'proper' Satch albums has to be the wonderfully recorded drumming from Jeff and who cannot be excited to have Mike on the ivory now.    True Satriani fans should appreciate this album over the last couple.
0312600844|4.0|Ordered this book it was much cheaper than in the book stores. Saved a bundle. Arrived within two days. Can't beat that didn't even have to leave the house!
B003LR4QPE|5.0|I have been eyeing the original version of this set for literally ten years.  I never got, the original version, because it was always too expensive (about $2000) and too hard to find.  But this 10th anniversary set (which is very much like the original(read the product description)) is mine and it is like a dream come true. :))     This super high quality set has me so pleased and so satisfied.  AND for 300 bucks, this is a great great deal.  Im actually thinking of buying a second one to resell at a greater price later down the road.  Anyhow, Thank You Amazon!  Thank you HAENSSLER classics!
051788710X|5.0|Moss's classic book \\"Conscious Dreaming\\" came into my life just as I was wandering around the American West, looking to find a graduate school where I could learn about dreams, consciousness and psychology.  I was excavating a village site in Yosemite Valley at the time.  The park service was putting in a new parking lot -  pretty much anytime you kick up a rock in Yosemite Valley you have to call in a team of archaeologists because it's all sacred ground.<br /><br />In the evenings, I went back to my tent and read Moss's incredible stories of his shamanic lucid dreams, and how he learned to value the dream's path over his attempts to control the experience.  Moss isn't too worried about our conscious and sometimes childish attempts at dream control, though.  He writes, \\"Dreams are wiser than our everyday minds and come from an infinitely deeper source.\\"<br /><br />More than anything, what I took away from this book is Moss's reminder about giving thanks to the dream, a concept that continues to deepen as I get older.<br /><br />This is not just a book on lucid dreaming (in fact Moss doesn't use the term \\"lucid,\\" probably because of the weird dream control meme that surrounds it); this is a book about interacting with the imaginal realm with greater awareness -- and not only in dreams, but also in waking life.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0001XLY8S|5.0|What I really liked about it - besides the main theme of the love story between the preacher's wife and the young man who got dragged off to war - is the excellent portrayal of the \\"ravages of war\\" OFF the battlefield: all of the nasty things that those poor Appalachian people had to endure from local scoundrels, rascals, thieves, bullies, mean men, and other crude usurpers out to take advantage of the young, old, weak, sick, and poor who were left behind and caught-up in the middle of a national CIVIL WAR that most of them never wanted any part of. It really shows how war is hell and destructive in MANY ways and a breeding ground for even more criminal activity on top of the insanity of the war itself. ... I mean, these people SUFFERED! ... It shows that very well. It also puts an end - once and for all - that a woman needs a man around to get things done. These were STRONG, brave ladies - dignified and independent - who made it through the thick and thin of it ... all on their own. ... God bless 'em! ... A GREAT movie! : ) ...YOWZA! - George Koumantzelis / The Aeolian Kid
1597801585|4.0|The Windup Girl is a fleshed-out, well-plotted but character-driven story that takes place in a frighteningly plausible world and gets enough into the characters' heads that the entire lack of \\"good guys\\" is hardly even felt most of the time, as the reader is too busy worrying about what will happen to any one of the relatively terrible main characters. So why four stars? Frankly, the book may have just been too much for lil' ol' me to take at times.<br /><br />Before the plot really gets moving, and before we as readers have come to appreciate all of our POV characters, I found it hard going, and didn't always want to pick it up again, even though I was always happy that I did. The future Bacigalupi has created is just so bleak and depressing that before there was much narrative thread I kind of dreaded jumping back in--which is entirely my own personal flaw. On top of that, because the main characters are pretty much all amoral, self-interested, and racist, the jumping between perspectives at the beginning made it difficult to get comfortable enough with any of them to really care. The only one who isn't a horrible person is the title character, and in the first half or so of the book she was so beaten down that I had trouble even empathizing, and I love beaten down protagonists.<br /><br />But I persevered and when I was finally grabbed, the book didn't let me go. It really is an amazing look not just at a possible future, but also at the general state of social and political f**kery, along with some good old violence and suspense. I can't really call the issues that I had with the book flaws on their own anyway, so if you can handle it it's definitely worth reading.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|A complaint I just made to WB:    To who will listen:    I am absolutely DISGUSTED. The way this company has swindled Harry Potter fans by releasing TRUE ultimate editions of movies 1 & 2 in 2009, only to release FAKE ultimate editions the year after, is appalling. When the marketing campaign started for these ultimate editions last year, there was ABSOLUTELY NO indication that WB would release extended editions of the movies one year only to turn around and only release theatrical versions the year after.    I am not an idiot. I know exactly what the purpose was. This is another opportunity to screw fans over, plain and simple. This company should have accepted the fact that they missed their chance to release theatrical ultimate editions first, and then extended ultimate editions of the movies thereafter. This is a very very sad state of affairs when the respect of devoted fans, who have committed so much of themselves to a film franchise, are not taken into ANY consideration.     I challenge anyone at this company to refute these claims as anything other than sleezy. There is no other way to describe it, and you know it. The decision makers knew full well what they were doing. They made the conscious decision that they did not care about the fan. They knew this was a dirty practice and they went on with it anyways.     In the grand scheme of things am I going to lose my health or financial stability over this, of course not. However, I am being reminded that I live in a society where the opportunity to squeeze the greatest amount of profit is ALWAYS going to be considered a just act regardless of what it requires. Great job, you have also now justified why people download movies. By not being forthright with your decision process you have alienated a large number of movie goers. I can only assume that I am one of many people writing in to complain about this.    So again, in closing, I challenge someone higher up at Warner Brothers to respond to this rant. Please, give me something to enjoy after being treated like this. There is nothing you can say that will justify these actions. It was done PURELY for the money at the expense of the fan. If I never hear anything from this, I will not only take it as a sign of cowardice, but also as a sign that you, executives of Warner Brothers, can not explain this.    So thank you Warner Brothers executives, for placing a slight disdain in my mouth for a franchise that has been nothing but wonderful for me to grow up enjoying. How much money did you project you will earn from this move? Was it really worth it? I hope so.
0385738757|4.0|\\"The Scorch Trials\\" is the second book in the dystopia trilogy/series by James Dashner.  As the sequel to \\"The Maze Runner,\\" Dashner continues with the story of Thomas and the rest of the gladers and their recent escape from their captors.  Things change dramatically when it was revealed by WICKED, the Orwellian big-brother group responsible for their predicament, that their flight was a part of a series of trials, and that their escape marks the end of Phase One.  Outside of the Glade, Phase Two begins, and a whole new set of trials awaits them, what was referred to as the \\"Scorch Trials.\\"  Just like that, the gladers were off and running again.<br /><br />The action starts a lot sooner in this book than the first book, which made it that much more addicting to read.  Instead of running around in the maze, now they have to run 100 miles across the Scorch to reach a safe haven.  The premise of this test is simple:  Make it, or die.  The objective is clear, but the conditions are much more difficult.  Instead of battling Grievers, they now have to face Cranks (those that suffere from the Flare), the environment, and each other.  Along the way, we catch glimpses of Thomas's history, and the ultimate realization that everything is not what it may seem.  Who is telling the truth?  Who is friend or foe?  Will they make it through the Scorch and to safety?  Will Thomas remember his past, and will his past reveal his purpose?  I couldn't help but feel sorry for the characters as they struggle to define what is real, and what is safe.  They thought they left their troubles at the Glade, now they have to face a whole new set of more perilous and more challenging trials through the Scorch.<br /><br />One criticism is that I was hoping for a bit more development of the back-story.  How did such a technologically advanced world succumb to what seems to be a biological defeat?  Memories can be modified, creatures can be created, yet no explanation for what or how people are suffering from the flare, and the solution is to put kids in a maze, fake an escape, and then have them running 100 miles in the desert?  I am eagerly anticipating the answers in the final book.<br /><br />I am still impressed with Dashner's simple and straightforward writing style, and the ability to create an operatic plot.  The storyline is detailed yet absorbing, and maintains the reader's interest.  The ideas and situations have a unique blend of novelty and simplicity.  For fans of young adult dystopia, this series has validated its position as a bona fide must-read book.  Is WICKED good?  Or is WICKED not to be trusted?  Hopefully we'll find out in the third book.  Highly recommended.he flare, and the solution is to put kids in a maze, fake an escape, and then have them running 100 miles in the desert?

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is just great. it is a great size. its not too big, but definitely not too small. It has so many sections that can be customized for whatever you need to fit in it. The price is the best I found anywhere. I wanted an inexpensive backpack DSLR camera bag, and I found just that in this Amazon bag. I absolutely love the fact that there is no \\"Nikon\\" or \\"Cannon\\" logo, because then people do not know that its a camera bag, and people wont want to steal it. This bag is the best that I found for the price and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B003YK42LQ|3.0|Kings of Leon, you've produced a great album, one that'll play well in bars and high school dances, but you've lost your creative edge.  The sense of love, being lost in the woods, unknowing, bliss, feel & breath has been lost from Youth & Young Manhood.  If you were a fan of \\"Use Somebody\\" you'll like this album.  But even that song had more soul.<br /><br />As far as hit albums go, it's outstanding, but the new Kings no longer hold a warm place in my heart.  If this is what they were going for they succeeded, but this is more soul-less top 10 junk & we could only wish they'd kick out the producers & lock the studio door for a week on the next go-around.  If not, might as well continue on their current path and hire Timbaland to produce the next album.
0345505387|1.0|I have never been so disappointed!  I pre ordered this book and couldn't wait for it to come.  I must admit I was not expecting the \\"graphic\\" to be so graphic! If I didn't have to pay for shipping to send it back I would have returned it immediately - instead I have put it in my \\"burn pile\\"  I will continue to encourage others to read the Outlanders novels but will not mention this awful instalment.
B0043RGY9W|5.0|I was way excited for this release. I had ordered the Deluxe edition from the UK, so it took a while to get here.  Then I was a little apprehensive reading the reviews, how it did not live up to what people had \\"EXPECTED\\".              First off I am a huge Floyd fan, I mean huge. The Orb???  Electronic dance techno?  Never heard of them before or listened to any (For an uneducated guess at a genre I know nothing about) techno music at all.         In other reviews it states uninspired ambient music with random samples of Gilmours guitar thrown in hap hazardously.  So I was a little deflated before I ever listened to it.      Fast forward til today, received it in the mail.  Explained to my wife that I bought electronic music, popped it in the trucks cd player. Didn't groove. Read the liner notes \\"please use headphones for optimal effect\\".  OK, yeah. Optimal effect, to the fullest.  I was gonna let go of any expectation I might have, light up a bowl and close my eyes, with Hi Fi Headphones. Give it an honest listen.      Now for my review, it doesn't seem random to me at all.  Well mixed, well timed, mellow music.  A nice changed for me.  The guitar seems to be layered in perfectly with the music. I have respect for who ever put this together, to listen to samples and blend together so nicely. Seems like it could have taken a long time. No digs on any other reviewer, but open up, man. Maybe it helped that I have never listen to any Orb before.           That's it. Use as directed. Let go of what you might expect from either the Orb or Gilmour, and just enjoy the tunes alone by yourself.
B00284BMBM|3.0|I really enjoyed this guy's first cd (I started watching American Idol after his season.)  Enough so that I bought the second one.  In the first cd he is pop and so wonderful - one really great hard rock song - at least in my mind.  The new cd is quite the reverse.  One pop/soft and the rest hard loud rock and roll.  It is not offensive, I just need to play it when I want it loud.  Not at all like his first cd.  Grins.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|How many performers do you know that come on stage and give you over 2 hours of non stop entertainment? Its almost unheard of these days. But Stevie gives you all that and more. I have seldom heard a live concert recorded so perfectly.  The sound alone will blow you away. You can hear Stevie, perfectly balanced with the band jamming, and the audience perfectly mixed in. Excellent visuals by a diretor that was on top of his game makes this one of the most enjoyable live concerts DVD`s that I own. If you are even a boarderline Stevie Wonder fan you will love this DVD.   If you are a Stevie/Motown fanatic like I am. this one is a no brainer. For Stevie to do all of his hits would take a good 6 hours at least, but come join me for a wonderful 2 hour plus musical odyesey with a true musical genius.
0895260131|5.0|This book is very well written. It is so simple to understand, and so well researched, that you will want to use it to win arguments with people who \\"believe\\" they understand Islam and Islamic beliefs. This is my second copy. I purchased the first in 2005, then loaned it to so many people that I finally lost track of it. Had to buy another for reference. It's really THAT good!
1427210497|4.0|There are 368 reviews as of this writing. Understandably, Amazon does not distinguish between Audio and written versions. But in this case, it could make a difference.<br />The reviews run the full gamut from one to five stars. It's easy for me to agree with any of them, since what you want from a novel is a very personal thing. Zashibis (one star)complains about the unbelievable plot twists and cliched characters. He's right!<br />Restless Sleeper (5 star) says \\"It is a peeling back of family life...good and bad...while highlighting the \\"human\\" aspect of everyone involved.\\" She's right!<br />If I had to actually read this long novel, it might have lost my interest. If I had to sit down and listen to all 19 CD's, It might have been impossible. But doing it over a couple of weeks, during exercise and 1 long weekend of projects in the basement, I really enjoyed it. The references to the zeitgeist of someone middle aged like myself kept me nodding, smirking, and occasionally wondering if Franzen had read my mind.<br />I would not have tried to listen to this while driving. The nuance of the reader would be lost. Also, I'm afraid I would be unable to concentrate properly in sections where it really 'caught my ear'.<br />Another note on the reader - David LeDoux: His mix of voices covering male,female, and foreign accents were just perfect. Just enough to help keep the characters seperate in your head during dialogue.<br />All in all a good read, I mean, listen.
B00008CMR6|2.0|I bow to no one in my ardor as a John Wayne fan -- but I think Rio Lobo was phoned in.  There are holes in the plot big enough to drive an aircraft carrier through; parts of the film drag on -- it should've been cut by at least 15 minutes; whoever played the bad guy sheriff was badly miscast.   If Hawks was going to do a remake of previous John Wayne films, he could've done it a lot better.  The young actors were interesting; I found myself wondering whatever had happened to Jorge Rivero (in the James Caan/Ricky Nelson role as \\"Frenchy\\"); he was good-looking enough and athletic enough to hold the viewer's interest when he was on-screen.  I read that he was an earlier matinee idol in Spanish-language films.  Too bad for English-speaking viewers that he couldn't have appeared in more English-language films.  The movie started off interestingly enough, and the photography was good, but once it reached the point where the Civil War was over, it went steadily downhill.    As a John Wayne fan, I was very disappointed in this one.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Title says it all.  Pixar in my mind is the best animation studio in the world, and 90% of what they put out is pure gold.  Only exception recently in my mind is Cars.  To give you an idea of how I believe this compares to my other favorite Pixar films... see my list I've created below.  As an aside, I'm 25, married, and have an 8 week old boy.  Point being, I don't think these movies are just for children.    1. Finding Nemo  2. Monster's Inc  3. Toy Story 3  4. The Incredibles  5. Ratatouille  6. UP  7. Toy Story 1+2  8. Wall-E  9. A Bug's Life  10. Cars    I think that Pixar today is what Disney USED to be ~20 years ago.  Funny that Disney now owns them :).  If you haven't seen UP do yourself a favor and check it out.
B003EYVXUK|4.0|\\"Let Me In\\" is every bit as unnerving, absorbing, tragic, touching, and compelling as \\"Let the Right One In,\\" the 2008 Swedish horror film on which it's based. This is remarkable given all the ways it could have gone wrong, which is really an underhanded way of saying all the ways it could have been Americanized. The original film, and the novel on which it was based, was a vampire story in the strictest sense, but is wasn't a two-hour ordeal of tired vampire clichés like crucifixes and garlic; rather, it was a reserved, disturbing peek into the lives of two lonely kids, one of whom just happens to be a vampire. The remake, despite the conversion from Swedish to English, gives us the exact same peek, which was a wise move on writer/director Matt Reeves' part since it allows the audience to connect to the story on a more emotional level.    Indeed, the story is one of deep, primal emotions - isolation, neglect, fear, uncertainty, and, in its own disturbing way, love. This isn't to suggest that the film romanticizes the leads. That would not only be inappropriate given their ages, it would also ruin the suspense the story builds, for it's a convention used in far too many vampire movies. When I say love, I'm referring to the deep seeded need these kids share for some kind of attachment, some sense that someone out there actually cares for them. Despite vast differences in age and category of species, the two are very much alike. The boy, twelve-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), has no friends, is mercilessly bullied in school, and lives in a broken him, his parents divorced and his father no longer in the picture. The vampire, Abby (Chloë Grace Moretz), who has been twelve for a very long time, is forced to move from place to place and cannot get close with anyone. Her only companion is an older man (Richard Jenkins) who roams the city streets in search of unwilling blood donors.    The film, which takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico during the winter of 1983, shows Owen and Abby finding solace in each other's company. Owen doesn't initially know what Abby is. Why does she smell funny? Why does she walk barefoot through the snow? Why is she only seen at night? Why does she have to be invited into someone's home? And what could she possibly means by asking him, \\"Would you like me even if I wasn't a girl?\\" When he finally learns the truth, he hardly seems bothered or even surprised by it; perhaps his unfortunate family and academic circumstances have permanently numbed him. When Abby learns of the abuse he endures at school, she encourages him to hit back, and if the bullies persist, then he must simply hit harder. Indeed, the bullies are just this side of sadistic, subjecting him to the kind of psychical and psychological torment exhibited by sociopaths. When Owen whacks one of the boys across the head with a stick during a field trip, severely gashing his ear, it's only natural that we should feel immensely satisfied.    One of the more interesting symbolic approaches to Owen's emotional neglect was keeping his mother's face hidden throughout the entire film. Whenever she's in a scene, the camera is angled so that only her body is revealed; if we do see her head, it's either hidden in shadow, shot at a distance, obstructed by an object, or filmed from the back. Even her driver's license photo is obscured by an official seal stamped into the plastic. Perhaps the divorce was too much for her to handle. Or perhaps she's too devoutly religious. In any case, if there is any love between mother and son, it has clearly been stripped to the barest of expressions. We're not meant to see this woman as a mother. We're barely meant to see her as a person.    I suppose I should address the film's violence. Strangely enough, this leads me to this year's comic book adaptation \\"Kick-Ass,\\" in which Chloë Grace Moretz played a young vigilante superhero groomed by her father to be an unstoppable killing machine. I found the film reprehensible, in large part because a murderous eleven-year-old girl was depicted as something to be laughed at. A commenter on my review named Jason Bean posed an interesting question: How is it that \\"Let the Right One In\\" can be considered a work of art and \\"Kick-Ass\\" can be considered deplorable, especially when both feature children murdering people? The answer is simple: \\"Let the Right One In,\\" and likewise this American remake, doesn't treat violence as dismissible, emotionless camp; instead, it's treated as shocking, horrific acts of brutality. \\"Let Me In\\" is not the kind of film that gives you permission to laugh. Laughter would be a sign that you were never meant to see it.    There have been countless American remakes of foreign horror films. \\"Let Me In\\" is one of the few that deserves recognition. It stays true to its source without merely spitting it back at us with English-speaking actors; Reeves adds his own unique touches to the story, allowing it to stand apart from the original Swedish film. The greatest achievement of both versions of the film was the willingness to sidestep many of the overused vampire clichés most have grown weary of; it's not a supernatural thriller so much as an unsettling examination of two lonely souls. This glimpse into the dark side of friendship makes it even more frightening, I believe, than most of what passes as a horror movie these days. Why waste your time on an empty teen slasher film when you have movies like this at your disposal?
0316069485|4.0|Jason Jessup, a convicted child-killer, has been set free from prison after almost 24 years. His guilty verdict is overturned when DNA evidence demonstrates that the stain on the dress Melissa Landy was wearing came from her step-father.  The state has a limited period in which to retry or discharge Jessup, and their case is complicated both by the fact that the DNA evidence is against them, and a history of corruption in both the prosecutor's office and the police department.<br /><br />Los Angeles County District Attorney Gabriel Williams is determined to retry the case, and he wants a trial that will be seen as fair. So he invites Mickey Haller, defence attorney, to cross the aisle as an independent special prosecutor to prosecute the case.  Mickey persuades Detective Harry Bosch to help.<br /><br /> Did Jessup kill the girl or not?  And if he did, how will the prosecution prove their case?  The evidence is flimsy and depends on the eye witness account of Melissa's older sister Sarah who proves hard to locate and has a history that the defence can use to attack her credibility.  Through all of the twists and turns, it is Harry Bosch who seems most convinced that Jessup is the bad guy who should be convicted.  Jessup's defence attorney has other ideas.<br /><br />The action in this novel is fast-paced, and I found it difficult to put down.  I enjoyed the further development of the characters of Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch, and found this novel much more enjoyable than `Nine Dragons'.  I was distracted slightly by the change in voice between Mickey Halley (first person) and Harry Bosch (third person) especially as Harry Bosch was such an integral part of the story. And I'm not totally satisfied by the ending.  How about you?<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Ponyo has very rapidly made it into my personal top 3 favorite films of all time (right up there with [[ASIN:B002G1K82Q Across the Universe]] and [[ASIN:B00128VA76 Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium (Widescreen Edition)]]). Between the exceptional animation, inspiring characters, and heart-warming story, this film successfully captures an audience of 1-100 and beyond.     The visuals in this film are awe-inspiring... from Ponyo running gleefully along huge waves comprised of water-fish, to the magnificent sea spirit portrayed in soothing, powerful colors, to the elderly running free of their wheelchairs in an aquatic orb reminiscent of \\"Eden\\"... this movie is guaranteed to light up the hearts and faces of any child.     The storyline is such a beautiful portrayal of childhood innocence, and the enduring nature of unadulterated genuine love. Ponyo shows no hesitation in trading magic for humanity in the name of love, reminding us all that power and possessions are of little importance.     The characters are almost personifications of positive emotions. Ponyo herself is the epitome of the most unwavering, naive, pristine joy we could all use a little more of in our lives. Be it a light bulb, a bucket, or HAM, everything is an exciting new discovery that \\"blows her mind\\" in the most wonderful way. Sosuke is inspiring in the way he doesn't question anything, and just allows life to take him on a beautiful journey. \\"My fish is now a little girl\\"... \\"That prehistoric fish has come to life\\"... \\"The elderly can run again\\"... none of these concepts seem far-fetched or unbelievable in any way to Sosuke. Sosuke's mother is wonderfully dysfunctional yet determined. When Sosuke sees Ponyo running atop waves in the midst of a storm of biblical proportions, she stops the car in order to look for the little girl, trusting her 5 year old son in a way few parents trust their children.     All in all, this movie is a must-watch for any family. I personally watched it with a group of friends and family ranging from less than 1 year old to 35, and we all shared the same hysterical giggles and elation.

B002ZG99CC|5.0|I grew up with the original \\"Karate Kid,\\" so I didn't know if I'd like this one.  What did it for me wasn't Jaden Smith, it was Jackie Chan.  I have seen Chan in countless movies, both his action ones but also dramas like \\"Shinjuku Incident\\" on RedBox and he is a great actor outside of the bad American slapstick he often does.  In \\"Karate Kid,\\" he delivers a really understated performance and makes a fantastic character to see the good side of China through after Jaden gets shoved around a bit by the bad side.  A well made movie.
0439023513|5.0|This is the final book in the Hunger Games series.  It is well written and very exciting.  You must read the other two before you read this one, or you will be left out.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|The beginning of the movie called to mind \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" which really hurt it because the battle scenes and action just aren't that interesting in comparison.  The only reason I give this two stars instead of one was because of Mark Strong.  He plays the same kind of character he did in \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" and \\"Kick Ass,\\" but he's very good at it.  Other than that, Crowe is completely forgettable, Cate Blanchet is wasted and I wish that I hadn't wasted my time.
1416972250|5.0|City of Glass is the third installment in The Mortal Instruments series. Originally suppose to be the last; however, Clare plans to continue the series with a focus on Simon the powerful but cursed, daylighting Vampire. This novel was more action packed than the previous two, with a clear main enemy and ultimate challenge with a new backdrop other than NYC. Clary and the shadowhunter gang find themselves in Idris, the City of Glass and homeland for shadowhunters, soon to be attacked by Valentine who escaped in the previous City of Ashes. Clary is attempting to find a cure to save her mother and is helped by a new friend Sebastian whose attraction to Clary seems strangely wrong. Clary must find a way to use her strong powers to bring shadowhunters and downworlders together to fight off Valentine planing to destroy them all; otherwise, they will never stand a chance.  Jace and Clary are still tormented by their relationship and it takes a good 500 pages to get the kiss the readers actually want.  With an interesting twist on a spy in the group and a slew of new characters City of Glass is involved and develops quickly. Simon, once locked in jail for being a vampire who can withstand daylight, becomes a main character with a pivotal role to play inorder to save them all.  I don't think these are the best written literary works of YA finction; however, they are fairly entertaining, quick reads with interesting twists and a great fantasy world. They are quite addicting, but you never get the romance that the story is building up to. In their defense though, they are YA fiction, so they are written appropriately, which should be commended actually, even though it can be frustrating.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Franzen is the latest bad boy who reviewers love to hype.  This book is painful to read.  Each character is more vile than the last.  Their lives are thoroughly depressing and pointless.  Depictions of mental illness are childish.  Depictions of friendship, love, and romance are even less on point.  Mutual friendship or love never lasts more than about 10 minutes in Franzen-world.  After slogging through this long novel, I could not see the point.  Worse than a benign waste of time, it was truly distasteful.
1416914293|4.0|CITY OF ASHES, by Cassandra Clare, continues this action-packed series with more surprises. Clare definitely stepped up the game in this book where Clary becomes more fierce and the characters around her were growing and changing as well.    I sped through this book just like I did with City of Bones. Mainly because I wanted to see if Jace and Clary weren't brother and sister, and I was disappointed once again. The feelings between them were still creepy and weird to me but it was not in the forefront of the story. I actually became more interested in Valentine and his motivations for killing the young Downworlders. Although he was a terrible person, I was intrigued by him as a character.    The second book in a trilogy can sometimes lean toward being a \\"filler\\" book but I have to say this one was not. The plot actually thickened with the discovery of Simon as a vampire and the forbidden relationship between Alec and Magnus growing.    Clare added to the tension by inserting doubts about Jace and his relationship with Valentine. I was very interested to learn the actual truth of this boy's past.  The fast-paced action of this book made my heart pump with excitement for the final book of this trilogy, City of Glass.
1400052173|5.0|Excellant reading. A lot of information.  We met a relative of hers, whom turned us on to the book.
0385342047|4.0|I too am a big fan of Sophie Kinsella and have been following the shopaholic series from the start. This latest book is done in similar fashion to the other stories in the series. This time, Becky and Luke are married and their daughter is beginning to exhibit some of her mother's feisty personality - not to mention her keen love of shopping and fashion must haves. This was probably the weakest book in the series, but I still found it an enjoyable, quick read. Felt like I was catching up with an old friend.
6305075492|5.0|Since there are a lot of reviews on here of people are extremely familiar with this film, I figure I may as well write one since I only vaguely knew of this movie and was not expecting much, I love classic cinema and am surprised I had not heard of this until I got it as a recommendation for Instant Watch on Netflix, which is where I watched it so I cannot comment on extras or things of that nature, sorry.  :(  I wrote this review while watching it and after, it left a deep impression on me, and I can see how heavily it influenced everything after it, and for good reason, it is undoubtedly more than a great silent film, it IS a great film period!<br /><br />The power of suggestion is an amazing thing, I have watched silent films before, but none so effective as \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\".  The tension is so thick and the atmosphere so foreboding, I don't think anyone could have prepared me for the creeping terror of this film.  The look on the Somnambulist when he first wakes up, with his eyes, that genuinely scared me in a way I don't think any other movie has, it felt like he was staring in to my soul.  Dr. Caligari himself is very frightening, and at one point when the police were passing by and they said they had found the murderer, I genuinely thought that I heard him cackling!<br /><br />For all of our modern notions of what is truly creepy and scary we have completely blown off tension and true suspence and horror for endless body counts and gratuitious horror.  I can no longer watch such movies as they give me terrible nightmares, but movies like this, that are not so much horror as high tension are really the kind of horror I think most horror movie goers want, but lack the patience to really watch and enjoy a silent film or even earlier talkies.<br /><br />In fact the very thing that makes this film so effective is the fact that it is silent and relies on your imagination, it does not rely on someone explaining everything, much is left to the imagination in terms of explanaintion, the rest is shown visually.  The expressions on the actors faces are wonderful, how well they express everything, it really reminded me how great silent movies can be, and just because a new technology is developed, it does not necessarily mean its better, just different.  In a way, the introduction of talkies really dumbed cinema down in a way, I am glad to have sound and I am not saying I want films to all be silent, no, rather it would just be wonderful to see movies that take great care with mood, tone, and tenstion.  Often times, people rely on script and such to set the tone rather than using the camera to tell the story.  There must be a balance between style and substance, and sometimes in an effort to \\"capture\\" the way a silent film could evoke mood when done well, people may eschew the a well-written script in favor of mood and neglect making us care about the characters (many film niiors are guilty of this, and I am a film noir fan.  \\"Diobalique\\", which I enjoy despite that though it defintiely leaves me feeling hollow, comes to mind as prime example of the style over substance in film noir), and although this movie does not have a lot of character background, it gives us just enough to make you care, and even despite is creepy sets and mood, it never left me feeling cold like most films that aspired to these hieghts after this film did.<br /><br />So while this might not be a perfect movie (there is no such thing, its all in the eye of the beholder really), it does do some things more right then I have ever seen any other movie of this nature do:  the sets, the actors, the lighting, the make-up, the cinematography and music all work together to create a very chilling tale unlike anything I have ever seen (it was really the first of its kind in terms of a wide released movie),  this film is a complete masterpiece and deserves a patient veiwing.  Once you get past the \\"Oh, this is a silent moive and I actually have to pay attention.\\"  You will not regret it, it is worth actually watching closely as the film relies so heavilty on visuals because it is a silent film.<br /><br />I do genuinely wonder though, if the film would have been more or less affective with its original ending...  Who knows, only God I guess, but I wish they filmed both endings, I would have loved to see th original ending on film as well.  :)<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy, it is worth actually watching closely as the film relies so heavilty on visuals because it is a silent film.

B001H9MYPW|4.0|In Treatment Season 1 was a brilliant show, which offered four very intriguing, multi-faceted patients that therapist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) treated. Each one was multi-layered, surprising and interesting. It helped that all the actors were superb.    Season Two still offers good acting, but some of the patients' stories aren't terribly original, and one was very annoying. The strongest, most interesting and eventually surprising patient is Walter, played to perfection by John Mahoney. But Mia - who has a history with Weston - to me was a somewhat weak and uninteresting character whose story lacked depth. Oliver, a boy whose parents are getting a divorce, was a very authentic character - but his issues and the issues of divorce were pretty standard and expected. Not unusual. They could have appeared in many other TV shows.    April, a character who has cancer but stubbornly refuses treatment, to me was a VERY annoying character who I just couldn't seem to identify with. Perhaps the actress played her too whiny. I found myself getting frustrated with her constant self-denials and refusal for treatment, and the story seemed to get bogged down. It just didn't feel right to me.    Paul's sessions with Gina remained great, and Paul's legal troubles this season also were very interesting. All in all, still a good season, but I must confess that If I were watching it again, I would just confine myself to watching Walter and avoid the others.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|Shakira continues to surprise and amaze. This is her strongest work yet, there is no one on either side of the border who sounds like her. Her musical collaborations in this album include the new Puerto Rican sound (Gordita), and tracks in English and Spanish freely intermingling as if in a sensuous dance. Check out the music video for \\"Loca\\" to get a feel for the album. Antes De Las Seis is another highlight, a quite beautiful song that one doesn't need to understand Spanish to love. Her voice soars on Devocion, as well as the title track. As Wyclef Jean noted, she was grown in Columbia, but all the world is her stage!

0553805371|5.0|Our understanding of the world and the universe is something we (person-kind)have struggled with for a thousand years or more.  Now we are beginning to understand it.  I'm no expert on physics beyond the simplest of Newton's, but this book helped me understand the things I have wondered about all my life. There are many dimensions to this book. I mean religious, psychological, mathematical, philosophical, existential and even some humorous parts. I like the pace of this book, how he covers history of the understanding of our world and (in spite of his saying philosophy is dead) his logical and philosophical approach to a complex subject I would have otherwise never understood.  I'm glad he left out the math equations because I have seen those in other books and failed to understand them anyway. This is a really exciting time we live in and to miss knowing something of these theories and discoveries before I die (or pass into another dimension, ha ha) would be truly sad.
B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|I'm going to be honest--I couldn't force myself to watch this. But my kids have watched it a few times. My 7-year-old daughter loves it. My 11-year-old claims she's too old for it but I've caught her watching as well. It's not an absolute favorite around our house, unlike many of Disney's theatrical releases, but it seems to be pretty good for a direct-to-DVD movie.
0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals is an intimate look into the presidency and life of Abraham Lincoln. Goodwin does an amazing job delving into the lives of not only Abraham Lincoln, but those of his presidential cabinet. Learning about these influential men, their backgrounds, ambitions, and rivalries were fascinating to read. The beautiful political balancing act performed by Lincoln is absolutely astounding. His willingness to bring his political rivals into his cabinet as well as managing them with such a brilliant hand, proved his worth to our nation. Lincoln truly was a political genius as is proven by the patient and methodical management of his cabinet. What was so unique was Lincoln's ability to understand human-nature. His magnanimous attitude toward everyone did not go unnoticed by those closest to him, or citizens abroad. Goodwin also details aspects of the Civil War, the strategy, and feelings of the people of the era. While it is definitely not a 'light and easy' read. It is well worth the time. An amazing read!
B003XMUFGQ|2.0|It was, I admit, my own misconception that a CD entilted \\"Clapton\\" would likely contain music that defined everything one associates with that name. Very little of it actually resembles anything the guitarist has done before--though it may re-define the term 'laid-back'. It's pleasant, low-key, and unoffensive (nice to have playing in the background while concentrating on something else) but never actually stirring. It may grow on me--it may not.
0984536132|1.0|I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I bought my second copy of Ford's translation, mainly to see if it had gotten any better in this edition.<br /><br />The answer: Not by much.<br /><br />This is the same as the more gaudy version he's been selling for over a year, with the same errors and overstated claims.  He just put a somewhat more subdued cover on this edition.<br /><br />He has fixed a number of errors I and others pointed out, but as I compared my copy of his earlier version with this one, the blunders I'd marked in the earlier edition are usually still there, despite his thanks to  Larry E. Camp \\"for his dedicated proofreading of the second edition.\\"<br /><br />Let me give just two examples.  The first is indicative of the general sloppiness of the translation.  The very first line of the original edition reads: \\"Today, I am pleased that Fate chose the city of Branau Am Inn of northern Austria as my birthplace.\\"  I pointed out in a comment on that edition that the German is \\"Braunau am Inn.\\"  German does not capitalize prepositions.  That is the kind of error even a first-year student of German would not make.  The new version reads: Today, I am pleased that Fate chose the city of Braunau on the Inn of northern Austria as my birthplace.\\" He left the English grammatical error.  Would you say \\"I was born in Chicago of Illinois\\" or \\"I was born in London of England\\"?  I rather doubt it.  If that's in the first line of the book, you can imagine what comes later.<br /><br />Second, although Mr. Ford claims to have translated this himself, with some help, I really have to wonder if he knows much German at all.  There are many elementary errors in German in his sometimes unreliable notes.  For example, an error from the first edition which carries over to this one is on p. 215: \\"the Frankfurter Newspaper, a German Newspaper in Frankfurter which....\\" Note first the false capitalization of \\"Newspaper.\\"  Second, the name of the city is Frankfurt.  The \\"-er\\" is the German ending for  such instances (e.g., \\"Berliner Zeitung,\\" etc.).  Anyone with the most basic grasp of German knows this.  That fact that Mr. Ford doesn't makes me doubt whether he has anything but the most rudimentary knowledge of German.  Now, I may be wrong -- he may simply be careless.  However, my copy has numerous similar blunders.  So, Mr. Ford, if you are going to continue to print this thing, how about at least hiring a proofreader who knows German?<br /><br />He'll fix these errors as he publishes on demand, I'm sure, but there are so many, many others.<br /><br />Meanwhile, errors in translation remain in significant numbers as well, but I'll leave them for Mr. Ford to find himself. I've pointed out enough in the past.<br /><br />When Mr. Ford first issued this some 15 months ago he claimed his translation was the preferred choice of scholars.  He's given up that claim lately, certainly a wise decision, since as best I can tell no one with any scholarly standing has been willing to use his translation as opposed to the standard ones.<br /><br />If you are curious, look at the comments on his earlier edition, and you will be able to predict what will happen to this review: Ford's curious range of supporters, most of whom have the most limited command of German as best I can tell, will have most unfriendly things to say about me -- but they won't bother to explain why, even in the second edition, laughable errors remain., \\"Berliner Zeitung,\\" etc.).

I do recommend though that in the description of the product here they should put the name of the knife   Becker BK2, other wise no one when searching for it will find it.    the knife is flat grind, I have large hands and the knife fits pretty well.  Its a heavy knife, and I have done some mods to it so I can wear it scout style ( beats using the strap on the sheath ) the only complaint is the strap you use to attach it to your belt.  but you can take it out and use it scout style ( use some paracord to wrapped) and then no problems

B003YK42LQ|1.0|Is it possible that they were just lucky with their first three albums?  Or else they consciously decided it's more fun to make crappy songs that appeal to the masses then it is to continually make great songs that fly under the mainstream radar.

076115728X|5.0|Synopsis:<br />\\"Everyone who has ever said the word `oops' will be smiling when they see the masterpiece that Barney Saltzberg has created . . . funny and fun, Beautiful OOPS! is the best fit to give anyone, any age, anywhere, anytime.\\" ~Jamie Lee Curtis<br /><br />Overall thoughts:<br />This is a delightful concept book for all ages, even though it is suggested for ages 3 and up. With bright vivid colors throughout children of all ages will love turning each page to find something fun or a little different to get their creative muse turning. If you have someone who loves art . . . this would be a fun book to give as a gift.<br /><br />Author and illustrator, Barney Saltzberg is also the creative force behind the bestselling Peekaboo Kisses and last year's Good Egg. A singular work of imagination, creativity and paper engineering fills this book with pop-ups, lift-the-flaps, tears, holes, overlays, bends, smudges and even an incredible accordion \\"telescope\\".<br /><br />Children will delight in knowing they can create anything from torn paper like an alligator. Or see a spill become an elephant . . . a pack of puppies . . . or even a family of birds. Besides each page having a creative twist to an everyday \\"Oops\\", you also get a surprise trying to find how each page reveals the hidden creativity of the \\"Oops\\". Making this book extra special and a unique concept book.
087349976X|4.0|The book provides great projects and has given me a lot of ideas.  The only complaint is that while most of the instructions are easy to follow some of the instructions are not quite thorough enough to really figure out on your own.  I had to look some of them up on the internet to watch videos of the techniques.  But overall I'm really pleased with this book.
B00337KM2S|5.0|I thought Jason Reitman's \\"Up In the Air\\" was the best movie of 2009.  [[ASIN:B00275EGWY The Hurt Locker]] was good but overhyped.  The under-the-radar (in this country) BBC made-for-TV two-part docudrama [[ASIN:B003H8CK78 Occupation - Series 1 ( Occupation - Series One )  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 Import - United Kingdom ]]] was better than 'The Hurt Locker' in many respects.<br /><br />About 'Up In the Air': rarely has a film so incisively and painfully captured the spirit of the moment - mass layoffs, soulless firings, disconnected and transient lives.  Welcome to Corporate America, recession, jobless recoveries, the threat of double-dip recession and the possibility of more of the same over a long term.  Reitman's film nails the fallout from all that.  His coup is that interspersed amongst the scripted drama are interviews with real laid-off workers.  You can tell when these pop up in the narrative - there is real, palpable fear, anger and disappointment voiced to which no scripted work could do justice.  Reitman juxtaposes those pieces with the production line-like layoff work conducted by the characters portrayed by George Clooney, Anna Kendrick and Jason Bateman.  It's great film-making that serves to shake the heart and confidence of any working viewer.<br /><br />There's also some nice work here in smaller roles by the always good J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis and - in a slightly bigger role - Danny McBride as Clooney's character's soon-to-be (or maybe not-to-be) brother-in-law.  And you'll burst out laughing when Sam Elliott makes his brief but all-too-perfect cameo.

B000F7CMRM|3.0|Syriana wants to be [[ASIN:B000067IZ3 Traffic]] in its worldly, interweaving meditation on global complexity with warnings on the law of unintended consequences.  [[ASIN:B000MCH5P4 Babel]] and [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash (Widescreen Edition)]] fall into the same genre, though the latter on more of a local scale.<br /><br />The 'Traffic' connection isn't a surprise since Syriana's director/co-writer Stephen Gaghan won an Academy Award for his adapted screenplay.  In the making of featurette, all the lead actors speak of their strong desire to work with him.  I saw the original Channel 4 (UK) mini-series [[ASIN:B001Y44DHW Traffik]] and - while certainly not a paint-by-numbers job - you can draw straight lines between the plot and characters of the two works.  On the basis of that, Gaghan has this pull.  I don't really get that.<br /><br />'Syriana' is hard to follow.  Not that I can't follow or appreciate complicated narratives (Jacques Audiard's masterpiece [[ASIN:B002BWP3UC A Prophet]] is great in that regard), but 'Syriana' seems too clever by half at times and - at other times - ham-fisted: corporate interests, bad; CIA, evil-doers in their own right.  The end of the movie strikes me as implausible even in an era of extraordinary rendition and water-boarding.  I won't give it away here but only to say that it's an unholy alliance of the suits and the spooks with some all-too-transparent targeting of a public figure.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Fun thriller with some good chills.  A little slow upfront, but once the situation is in place it does have some pretty good moments.  A very nice change from all those serial killer gore flix and good way to kill an hour and a half.
B00006FDCD|2.0|There are some creepy scenes and the child actors do a good job acting. I also find Tim Curry's acting enjoyable. Besdies that,it also has too many plotholes,flashbacks,stereotypes & cliches done to death by Stephen King. Tim's overacting is so unbearable. Even Angus Macfadyen acting as Komodo in Warriors of Virtue wasn't that over-the-top. The stop-motion is poorly done. Some of the cast are cruel to each other for no good reason. The balloons are NOT scary. I seen scarier things on MAD the animated series. Overall,this movie stinks. I give IT a 2 out of 10.

B002VECMAE|5.0|Don't touch this...    How do you talk about... 'this' without scaring your potential viewers into going to watch yet another expensive production that has very big, possibly 3D explosions that make loud, reverberating booming sounds?    'Dr. Strangelove' was made at a time when almost everyone, while accepting the nuclear balance doctrine and seeing no alternative but to live it would agree that it was a crazy thing - which is why they were calling it M.A.D.. 'Men Who Stare at Goats\\", on the other hand, came at a time when most of us oh so strongly want to believe that, whatever it is that we are doing today is good, clean, inevitable and commendable. Like spreading freedom through torture chambers and bringing about world peace by means of remote-controlled, airborne missile launchers and possibly future nuclear-tipped 'bunker busters'. It's the classic trip, final destination 'Hell' walking a road freshly-paved with good intentions.    So, how to communicate with an audience unwilling and unprepared to face a full blast of reality, likely to close their eyes shut and pour hot wax into their ears at the first sign of cognitive discomfort? The makers of MHSAT tried 'comedy'. If the image of a naked guy blowing up his brains while on the parade grounds can be called funny or 'slapstick'. And maybe they succeeded by hiding the actual 'message' which reads \\"we are evil, we are doomed, we are scared and we don't care\\"  inside a thick coat of laughter and weirdness and moving the 'serious stuff' toward the end of the movie when the viewers, tired of laughing but possibly waiting for more my have lowered their reality-proof guard low enough for some of the good stuff to trickle in.    This was one of the better made, more important movies made in the past decade or couple of decades but it didn't make one iota of difference and it will be soon forgotten because... \\"we are evil, we are doomed, we are scared and we don't care\\" and there's no such thing as a Jedi no more. There never was.

0316069485|1.0|I don't see where all the praise for \\"The Reversal\\" is coming from. I've read all of Connelly's books in the series and this one is easily the worst. As a suspense/mystery novel I'm trying to find where these elements exist in the story line. There are no twists in the plot and I kept wondering what was going to happen to shake things up but you get nothing. The ending was very anti-climactic with a hint that something was about to happen but then the book ends and that's it.     You can easily skip this book and not miss anything in the development of the characters. My recommendation is that if you still insist on reading it then save your money and check it out from the library.
B003PIUC02|4.0|Loved the series. This set is AWESOME, watched all 13 episodes in 3 days! 1st disk is filled with lots of previews for Starz series otherwise I would have rated it 5
B003R0LBVW|3.0|Perhaps all of the media coverage and spotlight on this book raised my expectations to an unreasonable level, but this book is just average.  The characters have no self-awareness, no empathy, and especially no sense of humor.  Each is pulled toward bad decisions like a moth to a flame.  Each character idealizes or vilifies all those around them.  It becomes disorienting when someone switches from one polar cartegory to the other in a moment.  You will find it difficult to identify with or care about anyone in this novel.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I really loved this movie and the first one as well as the series. I totally recommend this movie to any and all SATC fans! I am also giving this a 5 star rating to offset the negative reviews. I don't feel the need to take every little piece of the movie apart and give it a poor review because it was a great addition to watching the SATC girls lives continue to unfold and go along with them on the ride of fun, drama, and adventure!
B000067QMD|5.0|Works just fine, and makes these bottles quite versatile.  When the child is younger, you can use the larger bottles to carry extra water, and when they're older, you can use the smaller bottles to carry food.<br /><br />As for the description -- as of this writing, the description on amazon.com neglects to mention that this is a 6-pack, and the only stock image provided shows 2 discs.  Make sure you're aware of this before you end up with too many discs.  ;)<br /><br />EDIT: A friend just purchased too many, thinking that there were only 2 discs.  I'm going to attach a photo showing 6 discs.
1439133948|3.0|These 3 stars are measuring Cryoburn against the rest of the Vorkosigan series; by any other standards it is well-written and presents a technology and an end-of-life issue truly worth pondering. But I pondered instead why I was disappointed.     Cryoburn does not have the weave of story arcs and characters pursuing different agendas whose convergence makes the rest of the series so entertaining. More tellingly (and perhaps spoilers for those who would otherwise read in anticipation) some villains are just names on a page, and the henchman who do appear in person aren't really ever successful enough to warrant the action scenes to stop them. A more competent villainy is also largely \\"off-stage\\". The \\"worst case scenarios\\" that this author is known for, and for which I would happily trade out any number of villains, are not allowed to play out. I personally love how usually in this series a personal worst-case meets a society-wide or even an intergalactic worst-case; it is so worth reading other books in the series for that alone.    Lois Bujold is a great author, and she and her publisher will make money, but I regret that there wasn't a friend to say, Lois, you have to step it up. You're giving us The Sharing Knife simplicity of plotline, in a universe where characters are literate and have scientific knowledge, and where there are political entities of every scale. What worked in the \\"flat-earth\\" context just seems lazy here.    Cryoburn does not stand by itself -- who's Mark, all of a sudden? I only know from the rest of the series. But, knowing of Mark from the rest of the series, I think if this had been his story, and Miles stayed home -- where he could have a story arc, to be sure -- I think there would have been more of the texture I associate with the series. Mark is a complex of story-arcs all by himself, although I can't see him dispatched on Gregor's official business, it would have to be something under-the-table for Laisa -- I can see Mark and Laisa forming some connection based on their economic acumen -- If Mark, headed to Kibou-Daini anyway on behalf of his life-extension business, were to undertake a clandestine mission on the side to look at -- or better, to scuttle -- a deal in which Gregor would not want his foreign born empress to seem to interfere, yes:  Add some sort of Barayaran politics there, and subtract the automatic backup that Miles commands from the Barayaran embassy on Kibou-Daini there; figure in bribes that could really tempt the main character, the stretch that Mark would have to make to deal with children and botched rescues and cryo-revivals (memories of Jackson's Whole), and perhaps even involve him in the physical fights -- Mark would be a lot more interesting than Roic in those situations, the possibilities of underestimating him more satisfying. And if Mark's seemingly shady doings placed his standing on Barayar or with Kareen, or even with the Duronas', in jeopardy -- Well, I think Mark could have made a real addition to the series, here, in place of Miles. I can even see Mark giving revolutionary pointers to the fanatics -- a sort of \\"Galen-as he-should-have-done-it\\" moment for him and a less fade-to-nothing ending for them. So many possibilities. . . which I have enjoyed coming up with in place of reviewing the actual book!
B003W5C0VM|3.0|When I finally uncorked this I couldn't believe how bad the film quality is.  All the restoration performed on other films yield sometimes great results but not this.  This barely has the impact it did on its limited release which I viewed twice in Chicago.  It was that good.  This is not.  A a sound document it is really great.  Why not release it in high-res?  While you're at it release the studio output in high resolution file form like the Beatles did with the USB Apple.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|For the cost, it is well worth the money. I went to climb the Half Dome with this and it keep my camera well secured. Quality of the product is also good with thick padding and there is quite a lot of compartment to put extra lens and also a tripod. the only setback about the bag is that unlike some of the camera bag, whereby you can access the camera from the side, Amazon basic camera bag required you to access the camera from the front which is kind of a hassle.  However, for the amount that you paid, it is worth it.
B000QFBW6K|5.0|If you want to buy this item, ignore the $500 to $1500 price tag Amazon sellers are dementedly charging for this only-briefly-in-print DVD set and heigh thee to Arkiv Music, where it's going for around $150 in a Region 1 edition. I'm guessing they stockpiled some, so get over there while supplies last.  UPDATE: KULTUR home video are re-releasing the Barenboim Bayreuth Ring DVD in what looks like identical packaging for about 100 bucks, available now for pre-order for a late October 2011 release. Given that the last iteration of this set was only available briefly, you may want to snap it up.  So if good conducting, very good acting, fair singing,  interesting if now dated use of lasers, and otherwise minimalist sci-fi/noir staging interest you in the Ring you can do worse.  The music dramas have been served so poorly on video as in the theater, this version is no worse than much of what's available, and only actually falls below the level of \\"watchable\\" in the last moments of Gotterdammerung.
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|Unfortunately, The predator franchise hit its high peak in 1987 with its original movie.  A mediocre sequel followed as well as a pair of terrible Alien vs. Predator movies. Now over twenty years later 20th Century is hoping to resuscitate the predator franchise, but will this be another classic or just another in a line of disappointing sequels?      Based on a 1994 script written by Robert Rodriguez the movie makes a brave but ultimately smart decision bringing the setting away from earth to the home planet of the predators. The movie starts with all the characters literally falling from the sky with no idea where they are or how they got there. The predators have assembled a group of the most dangerous humans and brought them to their world for the sport of killing them.      This group of human mercenaries, serial killers, soldiers, and gangsters are lead by Royce, who is played well by Adrian Brody. He embodies the 21st century American soldier, lean, fit but not overly buff like the heroes of old. Topher Grace plays the mysterious Doctor Edwin who seems to be the only person who doesn't fit with the group due to his unimposing demeanor but perhaps it wasn't a mistake by the aliens after all. Walter Goggins (of The Shield) ads some moments of humor playing the deranged serial killer Stan, who was days away for getting the death penalty for his crimes.      The film is at its best in its first half as the characters slowly uncover what this place is and why they were brought here. It plays out like an episode of Lost as the characters make their way through the jungle uncovering strange occurrences and slowly putting the pieces together. Hungarian Director Nimród E. Antal does a nice job at building the suspense and tension in the first half of the movie before the second half of the film derails.      The last half of the film plays out like your typical Sci-fi-horror movie. There is plenty of violence and gore but it is at the cost of the narrative. Like toomany movies today the action scenes are almost impossible to follow with quick, flashy cuts and loud fast paced music. The film draws to an end with a predictable ending leaving it wide open for a sequel.      In the end, Predators is not a bad movie but it is almost two movies in one. The first half is a good mysterious science fiction movie and the last half is generic science fiction horror.  The special effects are effective as the filmmakers tried to go with real humans in costumes whenever it was possible and this definitely ads to the believability and menace of the predators. Somewhere deep inside this film is the blue print for a much better movie and partially falls flat due to the promise of its first half. If you are a fan of the series you will not be disappointed and you could have gotten much worse. On the other hand, people looking for an intelligent and cohesive narrative may be disappointed.
B000088E77|5.0|\\"The band from down under\\", \\"Who Can it Be Now\\", \\"Down Under\\"........those were the tags given to this incredibly successful early 80's album by Men at Work. In my experience, I haven't run into 5 people who actually know the name of this album. In a unique way, that tells you how successful this album was. People were so into the songs that they forgot the name of the album. Where does time go? I listened to this album during 7th grade wood shop like it was yesterday!!! I also remember DOWN UNDER being the #1 song for several weeks in the top 40 countdown. I must say that the flute took a little getting used to, but it was something new and unique. All in all, this album is a smash hit, and should be in every person's early 80's section of their CD collection. 9/10
0307454541|2.0|I would read the first book and the last chapter of this tale.  Not an enjoyable read.
B000000OMB|5.0|Asia was Steve Howe, John Wetton, Geoffrey Downes, and Carl Palmer. These four guys would become instant stars with their debut album, simply titled, Asia. Howe was already an accomplished guitarist with the progressive supergroup, Yes, while Carl Palmer brought his talents from the equally-successful progressive trio, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Downes was a keyboard player for Yes' Drama album from 1980, and Whetton was an accomplished vocalist elsewhere. They would fuse their talents and come up with some of the most memorable songs of the 80's, and of all time. Songs like HEAT OF THE MOMENT, SOLE SURVIVOR, and ONLY TIME WILL TELL are classics to this day. These guys would stick around for several more years and albums, and wouldn't match the success of their first album. Still, they were a great band that put out some great music. 9/10
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This 2 season Complete series of Rome is Great.  It really gets its viewers to see how daily life as a Roman was and how the fall of the Republic and rise of the Empire happened.  HBO did a great job. The characters and scenes of Roman life is excellent.  Hope there can be more seasons in the future. Wished the battlefield scenes could have been more in detail.  Otherwise if you are a Roman History fan or not this series is worth buying. It is excellent.

B00144VBBS|5.0|I was very pleased with the cd, but when I received it, the case was broken and unusable.  I wasn't pleased about that.  I have purchased many items from Amazon and this is the first time an item has been broken.  Otherwise I was very pleased with cd and the prompt arrival of it.
0385342047|3.0|I'll admit - I've never read ANY of the other Shopaholic books.  I've wanted to, but have so many other books in my library, I've never gotten around to it.  I was given the chance to read this one and had some free time and gave it a go.    It was ok. An easy read, pretty enjoyable.  Having never read any of the other books in the series, I didn't really know all the characters and/or their back stories, but I could follow along and could pretty figure out who was who.    My biggest problem with the book was that the story was pretty much about Becky, who is trying to plan a surprise party for her husband while trying to find a new house.  There wasn't enough of the \\"Mini Shopaholic.\\"  I was expecting it to be more about Becky balancing life and her motherhood, but instead it's more of the same shopping and spending habits which causes a chain reaction of problems down the road.  The title could have just been Shopaholic Returns for as much as the story revolved around her baby and her mothering skills.    If you're a fan of the Shopaholic series, you'll want to read this one, but if you're like me and have never read any of the others, this isn't a good place to start
B0043GAZYS|4.0|I'm not much for reviews so I will keep it short. See this movie! I am surprised to see that it had failed so bad at the theaters. I have never anything like this movie and if you haven't seen it you haven't either. This movie has so much eye candy flashing throughout I thought I would have a seizure. The dude from Superbad seriously kicks butt, and it just as hilarious in a more intelligently witty way. I have seen it twice, and cant wait for a chance to watch it again to add stuff to my list of things I thoroughly enjoyed about this movie. Buy it, and tell your friends. I would love to see a sequel to this and Kick Ass then I think I could die a happy man.
0307454541|5.0|...Yeah, what they said was accurate.  No need to repeat, but I gotta agree.  The first 200 pages were a little hard to endure, but after that, the story line picks up the pace very fast and it was thrilling to the end.  I quickly ordered the DVDs and the next two in the series.  It's on Kindle, too!<br /><br />I've read several translated books and always had some trouble with names, phrases, and certain cultural references that I just didn't \\"get\\".  Not so, here. He's a modern writer with a broad education and he knows a great deal about what does work on the internet - it's not make believe at all.  Also, I found many on-line blogs and fans who provided a map and some other details that make the books even more enjoyable, and I haven't enjoyed reading as much since I found the JRR Tolkin books in 1970.
B003YUC9JI|5.0|When word came out that \\"The Karate Kid\\" would receive a remake, I have to admit that I was quite skeptical.  With the announcement of martial arts superstar Jackie Chan as the first star named, although I love Jackie Chan, I was even more skeptical because of the location of where the film would take place (China) and that karate is not a Chinese martial art.  Also, that director Harold Zwart  (\\"Agent Cody Banks\\", \\"Pink Panther 2') would be the direct.  And to even further my skepticism, the announcement of actor Will Smith's young son Jaden Smith (\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\", \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\") as the main character did calm my nerves one bit.<br /><br />That is until I watched the film.<br /><br />And what an enjoyable film \\"The Karate Kid\\" remake  came to be and many people agreed as the film which was budgeted around $40 million had made $334 million worldwide and the majority of the reviews were positive.  And as for the name \\"The Karate Kid\\", despite the film not having anything to do with karate, because the film is a remake, for the American release, the film will be known as \\"The Karate Kid\\" but in Asia, the film would go by the name \\"The Kung Fu Kid\\".<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" (2010) is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  If there is one thing that this remake does have an edge over the original is that this film was shot in China and the film looks absolutely beautiful in HD.  There is so much detail in this film, may it be the paint peeling off  from the walls or wood, the detail on the wood bars when Dre visits a Kung-Fu training area.  The film looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!<br /><br />The film is absolutely breathtaking as we see how wonderful the cinematography is (courtesy of Roger Pratt, \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\", \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\", \\"Iris\\", \\"Chocolat\\") when we see the various mountainous regions of China, the Great Wall of China and surprisingly how much access the filmmaker was given to shoot this film.  But also it helps to have the co-production with a major Chinese film company who also wanted to make the film look authentic and real.<br /><br />Colors are absolute vibrant, flesh tones look fantastic, backs are nice and deep and once again, the detail of this film and the colors are just wonderful.  Everything about the picture quality of this film is pristine and there is a fine layer of grain on the film.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" (201o) not only looks spectacular, the lossless audio is also fantastic.  The film is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and also presented in English - Audio Description 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The dialogue is crisp and clear.  The music of James Horner (\\"Avatar\\", \\"Troy\\", \\"Enemy at the Gates\\", \\"Titanic\\") is as always fantastic and you also get a good dose of popular music with Lady Gaga and Flo Rida.  But as the dialogue and music comes perfectly from the center and front channels but also, there is great use of the surround channels.<br /><br />Earlier on, you can hear the punching and the kicks coming from the surround channels but you can also hear the ambiance of crowds (especially during the tournament), the rain, Mr. Han working on his car (or demolishing his car), \\"Karate Kid\\" is such a film that takes advantage of the soundscape. Overall, the audio quality for \\"The Karate Kid\\" is fantastic!<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" comes with the following special features presented in HD, English Stereo and English subtitles:<br /><br />  * ON LOCATION: The Karate Kid Interactive Map of China - Director Harald Zwart talks about capturing China's culture in the film and also the challenges at shooting in the various locations in China such as the Wudang Mountains (4:24); The Great Wall which includes filming at the China Film Group Film Base at Huairou (4:45) and shooting a the Great Wall (1:36); Beijing:  Beiying Film Studios (2:36), Beijing Shaolin Wushu School (1:34), Feng Tai Sports Arena (2:05), the Forbidden City (1:05), Olympic Park (:59) .<br />  * Alternate Ending - (3:32) An ending that makes the film become more like what we would see from a  Jackie Chan martial arts film but it does take away the primary focus of  the story which is about Dre.  Cool action sequence but I'm glad this ending was not used.<br />  * Play All Hosted by Jackie Chan - (29:44) Featuring the production diaries as one full documentary hosted by Jackie Chan.<br />  * Production Diaries Hosted by Jackie Chan - A total of nine production diaries which include: Training Jaden (3:12), Jaden Smith, A Day in the Life (3:50), The Forbidden City (3:59), From Jackie with Love (3:56), The Great Wall (3:10), Olympic Village (3:06), Director Profile (2:19), Taraji P. Henson Goes to China (2:40) and Wudang Mountains (3:19).<br />  * Chinese Lessons - Learn Chinese! - An interactive feature that teaches viewers basic Chinese words and phrases.  Lessons include: Basic Greetings, Numbers, No Hot Water, I Want to Go Home, Training and General Vocabulary.<br />  * Music Video: Justin Bieber Featuring Jaden Smith \\"Never Say Never\\" - (3:49) It's known that both Bieber and Smith are good friends and this is probably the first time I've seen Jaden Smith taking part music but definitely following in his father's hip hop footsteps.<br />  * Just for Kicks: The Making of The Karate Kid - (20:09) The making of \\"The Karate Kid\\" remake and the challenge that the filmmakers had of remaking the original, martial arts training for Jaden Smith,  what kind of presence Jackie Chan had on the set.  Filming in various locations of China, the music of \\"The Karate Kid\\" and more.<br />  * movieIQ+sync(TM)<br />  * PS3 Wallpaper Theme<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" (2010) was much more than I expected and I admit, I was a big skeptic when it came to the announcements and then watching the trailer.  I watched the original film several dozen times and as mentioned in my review for the original film, it's a film that I just never get tired of.  It's hard not to dislike a film about an underdog but with \\"Karate Kid\\" (2002), there are many things that impressed me.<br /><br />First, the acting performance by both Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan.  Jaden Smith really went through a lot in the training of this film and with the original film,  Ralph Macchio was pretty much a man playing a teenage role, while Jaden Smith, he is a young kid and what the director (especially his producer parents) brought out of him was pretty well-done.  He has the bravado and slight cockiness like the original film's Daniel Larusso but it is quite evident, Smith went through major training much more than Ralph Macchio probably had to go through.<br /><br />In fact, Jaden Smith studied martial arts for more than half a year, three months learning Wushu and weapons training from a stunt coordinator that has worked with Jackie Chan.  So, to make this film look convincing, Jaden Smith really dedicated himself into practicing as well as enduring pain for this fim.<br /><br />If there is one thing where the film was make it or break it, it was the chemistry between Smith and Chan.  Jackie Chan was absolutely marvelous in this film.  We have heard Jackie talk about wanting to play serious roles and we have seen that with his 2009 film \\"Shinjuku Incident\\" but not only does the filmmakers give him action scenes, they gave Chan the opportunity to show that he can do emotional crying scenes and there is no doubt that Chan's performance will have people tearing in one of the more emotional scenes of the film.<br /><br />What also works is how beautiful this film looks and how well the pacing was for the overall film.  Harald Zwart did an incredible job in the overall execution.  From wanting to get the right shots, getting the right look and feel for thefilm and even being under the gun of shooting in locations that were difficult to shoot at or they only had less than a half hour window to shoot at.<br /><br />For example, filming at the Forbidden City (which was the first time since \\"The Last Emperor\\") is constantly visited by visitors throughout the day and so they only had 20 minutes to shoot during the early morning before the visitors arrived.  Zwart managed the time and schedule very well.<br /><br />So,  Zwart was able to accomplish a lot during the filming of \\"The Karate Kid\\" and it helps that he was paired with a wonderful cinematographer, Roger Pratt and musician/composer James Horner.  Zwart's cinematography is fantastic and if anything, what he was able to capture on film looks absolutely gorgeous in HD and the same goes with James Horner who knows how to create movie soundtracks.  Horner has done a tremendous job for films like \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Avatar\\" and he did a great job for \\"The Karate Kid\\" and it helps that the film does have music that will appeal to younger fans who love Lady GaGa, Justin Bieber and Flo Rida.<br /><br />And also deserving recognition is screenwriter Christopher Murphy and writer Robert Mark Kamen (\\"Taken\\", \\"The Fifth Element\\" and \\"Transporter\\" films) in making sure the story for this remake was good and doing a lot of the research needed to make this film seem authentic.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, you really can't go wrong as not only do you get a film that looks absolutely fantastic and sounds wonderful on Blu-ray, you also get a good number of special features included in this release that makes \\"The Karate Kid\\" worth owning.<br /><br />Overall, I know there are quite a number of my friends who refuse to watch this film because of its title (since the martial art focused in the film is Kung Fu) and those who still appreciate and love the original film that they can't support a remake.  Some have issues with filmmaker Harald Zwart and even Jaden Smith playing the lead role.  But I don't blame them because I know how that feels because I felt the same way.<br /><br />I was very skeptical towards this film and the truth is, there are many remakes that are terrible but this is not one of them.  The film is not only faithful to the original film but it gives us even more than the original to love and enjoy, and as I will always love the original film, I have to say that I really enjoyed this remake of \\"The Karate Kid\\" as well and  I really enjoyed this Blu-ray release!  It's an awesome release!<br /><br />If you loved the film  or looking for an action-based, underdog against his rivals type of martial arts film that is inspirational, heartfelt and entertaining,  \\"The Karate Kid\\" (2010) is highly recommended.the original film, it's a film that I just never get tired of.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|A brilliant and beautiful film that goes in unexpected ways to move the viewer. Fine performances by all but Rachel Weiss stands as tall as the great lighthouse of Alexandria in a nuanced, deeply felt performance as Hypatia. the screenplay too is a star here and shows great insight and an unbiased look at religious intolerance by the three religious groups in Alexandria at the end of the Roman Empire.<br /> The realization of a gorgeous if slightly faded Alexandria is stunningly achieved in this film. Bringing to mind and even surpassing the sets of Joseph L Mankiewicz' 1963 'Cleopatra'. This city that stood as a beacon of learning, art, architecture and wonders seems to breath and move as if sixteen centuries were blown away by a magical wind from the desert.<br />  The film will raise a lot of questions in the minds of viewers who may have very fundamental beliefs in Judaism or Christianity and could be construed by the less astute as anti Christian. It is not. the film simply shows true events of the clash of belief at the end of the classical age. Many were guilty of barbarism in the name of their gods then, just as some are today.<br />  Finally the tragic end of the film is heart rending for not only the obvious reasons but for the fact that had men been more enlightened towards the wonders of the minds and brilliance of women we might be a lot further along in our evolution as a species than we are today.
B003DZX44I|5.0|The story of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" was born as a fairy tale back in the 1740's by Madame Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and then revised in 1757 by French novelist Jeanne Marie Le Prince de Beaumont received its animated adaptation courtesy of Walt Disney  in 1991.<br /><br />The film is directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (both worked on \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" and \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\\") and the screenplay adaptation by Linda Woolverton (\\"The Lion King\\", \\"Mulan\\" , \\"Arctic Tale\\" and \\"Alice in Wonderland\\").<br /><br />\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is the 30th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line and is considered one of the greatest Disney animated films of all time.  The film was an amazing success as the film which cost $25 million to make had made over $377 million dollars worldwide and the film was also the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (note: The second was 2009's \\"Up\\") and was successful in blending traditional animation with CG.<br /><br />And now the popular animated film receives its first release on Disney Blu-ray and receives a \\"Diamond Edition\\" release.  In this release, we get more special features than its previous 2002 DVD release but also three different versions of the film which includes a special extended edition, the original theatrical release and the original theatrical release with storyreel picture in picture (watching the film with the original storyboards in picture in picture format).<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />Everything about \\"Beauty and Beast\\" screams gorgeous, vibrant and magnificent with the release of \\"Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition\\".  In my 2002 DVD review, I talked about how beautiful the animation was and how well-painted the backgrounds were but after watching this on Blu-ray, I'm going to focus on how vibrant the colors are, how well-defined the lines are, how  detailed the backgrounds to the simplest of objects such as wood, leaves and objects are.  How every character and object and its shadowing are well-done.<br /><br />\\"Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  From the daylight scenes that showcase the amber oranges to the winter scenes that show the whites and blues, to the night-time and more ominous and darker scenes, blacks are nice and deep but yet you can still see detail where shadows are present on objects.  You can see the stains on the roof of the background and can easily make out the different color bricks on the chimneys, the pattern of wood on the home and well.  And of course, the animation and how free flowing the characters are, especially in the dance scene.  For a film that was created in 1991, you can't tell this animated film is nearly 20-years-old.  This film still looks incredible and it looks wonderful in HD.  I detected no banding, edge enhancement, haloing, combing or compression artifacting.<br /><br />This is the definitive version to own of this title yet and if you have a Blu-ray player and love Disney animated classics, picture quality-wise, this is a title that simply is a must-own.<br /><br />As for the included DVD, the DVD is presented in 1:78:1 aspect ration-enhanced for 16×9 televisions.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition\\" is not only fantastic in picture quality, the film is absolutely fantastic via lossless as well.  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz.24-bit) as well as 5.1 DEHT French and Spanish language tracks, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" does not disappoint.<br /><br />If anything, I wished that everything Disney releases were in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and fortunately, the animated classics have received this attention.  Audio literally envelops the soundscape with immersive audio coming from the front and center channels, the surround channels, the rear surround channels.  Dialogue and music is crisp and clear, the slight sounds of leaves, horse galloping, the leaves rustling, the Beast growling, the sound of flame flickering, pots and tea cups clinkering, these are all well-done.  And it doesn't stop there, there is also LFE present as well.<br /><br />But if anything, one thing that \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is known for is its music.  Alan Menkin's music for the film is wonderful.  You will find yourself singing to songs such as \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Be Our Guest\\" and \\"Belle\\" and the truth is, the music captivated many people in 1991, so much that it won an Academy Award for \\"Best Music, Original Score\\" and \\"Best Music, Original Song\\" and also won two Golden Globe Awards as well for its score and for \\"Best Original Song - Beauty and the Beast\\".<br /><br />As for subtitles, \\"Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition\\" is presented in English SDH, English ESL, French and Spanish.<br /><br />As for the included DVD, the DVD is presented in 5.1DEHT English and Spanish Language Tracks with English SDH and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition\\" comes with the following special features presented in HD (note: original DVD features that are on the Blu-ray are presented in standard definition):<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary - Audio Commentary for the special extended edition is included.

B000K4WLXA|3.0|After years of waiting for a followup to their original groundbreaking RPG video game, Square Enix(original Squaresoft)finally got around to doing this feature animated sequal as part of their Compilation Of Final Fantasy VII series which also included two video game prequals, a game sequal, and an anime prequal. Even though it was originally supposed to be about a 20 minute-long feature, but was instead turned into a full-length movie at the demand of the fans. It was animated by Square Enix themselves, who of course also did the original Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within movie as Square Pictures, and was directed by FF regular, Tetsuya Nomura.<br /><br />It starts off where the end of the Final Fantasy VII game left off with Red XIII doing his Lion King impression, but then cuts back to 498 years later, which is 2 years after where we last left our heroes. Apparently, the Planet survived the attack of the Meteor, although the main city of Midgar was destroyed. So the survivors open up some cheap condos in the smaller town of Edge. Whiny emo-clown Cloud has become a delivery boy and adopted Marlene(Barret's kid)plus a boy named Denzel who is a dead ringer for Roxas from Kingdom Hearts. Cloud and Denzel are suffering from a new disease called Geostigma, but the not-so dead Rufus Shinra really has it bad. He tries to enlist Cloud to help him and some of the remaining badboy Turks from stopping a trio of biker dudes who are apparently looking for the head of Jenova's head. Jenova was the cause of all the monsters and darkness on the planet, and also Sephiroth's \\"mother\\". Kadaj, Yazoo, and Laz want to use Jenova's head to bring all the pieces of her together along with children infected by the Geostigma to cause the destruction of the planet. They gather all the children to Edge to try take down a large statue in the middle of the city which they're convinced is where Jenova's head is buried other, and then summon up a horde of demon dogs plus one mutha of a dragon. Cloud along with the entire old AVALANCHE crew show up and stop the monsters, then begin a long chase with Cloud trailing down Kadaj. Jenova's power tuns Kadaj into a resurrected Sephiroth, and he has an epic sword battle with Cloud. Cloud pulls some \\"Knights Of The Round\\" attack on Sephiroth which kills him(kinda), and Aerith's spirit makes some magical rain that cures everyone's Geostigma.<br /><br />This movie was a payoff for alot of the FF-anitics, although there were some complaints about inconstancies in the story, but were more or less resolved in the special Complete edition of the film when it was re-released on Blu-Ray. The first draft of the movie was supposed to be about Cloud with his newly adopted family that he and Tifa put together, but this was later used as the basis for the Reminiscence Of FFVII segment used on the DVD as a recap of the events from the game. The production involved making the characters look as realistic as possible, but still having weird anime hair and overstylized fashion sense. It was a serious step up from The Spirits Within and most of the FMV scenes from the games, even though you can tell that there's still something some lacking in the characters' facial expressions and movement, but still astounding animation. The dub for it though was really bland, where as the voice actors are good in their own rights, they really didn't give seem to give this any real effort. Plus, the dialogue for both the original Japanese script and English dub was terribly mismatched, and if you watch the deleted scenes you'll see that lots of rewrites were done with the dialogue to already completed footage. The DVD release features a short OVA titled FF: Last Order which is a full accounting of Sephiroth's turn to darkness, and his fight with Cloud and Zack, although this was 2D animated by Madhouse. The Blu-Ray release also has another short of On The Way To A Smile which is an original animation based on a novelle that comes with the Collector's Edition DVD that tells of Denzel's origins. The movie recieved a pretty big buzz when it was first released in America, although it was one of those cases like The Phantom Menace where after its initial reaction on the fan market, it changed somewhat after its presence had been examined a little further. Its one of those things where fans get all worked up for an continuation of something they loved, but when it comes out, they realize that its not all they had hoped for. The other major drawback is that the movie is totally useless to anyone who hasn't played the entire original game. However, this should be seen as a labor of love for fans of the game, and something they will treasure(until they get tired of it).at tells of Denzel's origins.

B003KGBISY|5.0|If there is one title in which many fans of the Criterion Collection have always considered as must-have, must-own, it would be Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film \\"Seven Samurai\\".  And now Kurosawa's masterpiece receives the Blu-ray treatment!  And I can tell you right now, if you are a Kurosawa fan, own a Blu-ray player...\\"Seven Samurai\\" is simply a must-own on Blu!<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1:331.  According to the Criterion Collection\\", the original negative of the film is no longer available, so a duplicate negative was created from the original fine-grain master positive using wetgate processing.  This high-definition digital transfer was then created in 2K resolution on a Spirit Datacine from the dupe negative.  For the extensive restoration of \\"Seven Samurai\\", several different digital hardware and software solutions were utilized to address flicker, instability, dirty, scratches and grain management.  Including da Vinci's Revival, Discreet's Fire, Digital vision's ASCII Advanced Scratch and Dirty Concealer, MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean.<br /><br />I've done quite a bit of comparing between this blu-ray version and the previous two Criterion Collection DVD releases and all I can say is that the \\"Seven Samurai\\" on Blu-ray is simply fantastic.  This is a remarkable restoration of the original film.  I was noticing detail, for example, the flag that Kikuchiyo hung up on top of the house, you can see the threading quite clearly.  You can see detail and patterns on the clothing much more clearly as well as detail of the surrounding area (the farming village) from the buildings to the fields as well as the closeups of the character's faces.  You can actually see the strands of hair instead of just one big black and gray mesh, you can see strands of hair which was not as visible on the DVD version.<br /><br />Blacks are nice and deep, whites and gray contrasts are just right.  I didn't see any artifacting, massive flickering or even edge enhancement.  You do spot some scratches but nothing major.  There is also a good amount of grain present in the picture. This is clearly the best looking version of \\"Seven Samurai\\" right now and fans of the film will be in awe of how beautiful this film looks!  Fantastic!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, the surround mix was created from original optical track recordings, original stereo music masters, and original production sound effects masters.  The original monaural soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from an optical soundtrack print.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.<br /><br />Audio is presented in Japanese LPCM 1.0 (mono) and Japanese LPCM 2.0.  The package does mention a Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio track but this was mistake on the packaging.  But for the most part, audio is quite clear and if there is one thing that fans will notice is the clarity of Fumio Hayasaka's score.<br /><br />Donald Richie, author of \\"The Films of Akira Kurosawa\\" wrote in his book about the differentiation of the music which I noticed much more in this soundtrack.  Drums are associated with the bandits, folk-music, flute and percussion with the farmers and a male chorus (low humming) with the samurai.  Audio was excellent and I detected no audio problems, hissing or dropouts whatsoever.<br /><br />Optional English subtitles are included.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #2' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features presented in HD (1080i):<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />  * Roundtable Audio Commentary - The following audio commentary is by  film scholars David Desser, Joan Mellen, Stephen Prince, Tony Rayns and Donald Richie.  Originally included on the \\"Seven Samurai\\" 2006 DVD re-release, the audio commentary features a different scholar taking on about a half hour or more segment of the film and giving their commentary for the film.<br />  * Audio Commentary - Featuring the original audio commentary from the 1999 Criterion Collection DVD release by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  * Akira Kurosawa: It is Wonderful to Create - (49:10) The making of \\"Seven Samurai\\" as part of the Toho Masterworks series \\"Akira Kurosawa: It is Wonderful to Create\\" featuring interviews with Kurosawa's key collaborators, writer Shinobu Hashimoto, set decorator Koichi Hamamura, script supervisor Teruyo Nogami, actors Seiji Miyaguchi and Yoshio Tsuchiya and more.  This is a wonderful documentary for anyone who wants to know how this masterpiece was made.  This feature was originally included in the 2006 DVD release but is now presented in 1080i.<br />  * My Life in Cinema: Akira Kurosawa - (1:55:59) Filmed for the Directors Guild of Japan in 1993, this featurette showcases director Akira Kurosawa talking with filmmaker Nagisa Oshima.  Two two talk about Kurosawa's life and career.  This conversation between the two is very cool, especially if you have followed the careers for both filmmakers!  This feature was originally included in the 2006 DVD release but is now presented in 1080i.<br />  * Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences - (55:12) A documentary exclusive for the Criterion Collection, this documentary takes a close look at the history of samurai in Japanese life and art and the influence of the samurai figure in film leading up to Kurosawa's masterpiece.  Another awesome documentary featuring Tony Rayns, Donald Richie and David Desser discussing samurai in Japanese films.  This feature was originally included in the 2006 DVD release but is now presented in 1080i.<br />  * Trailers and Teaser - Featuring three trailers (3-5 minutes each) and a teaser (:42).<br />  * Galleries - Using your remote, you can view galleries via behind-the-scenes and the film's movie posters.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" comes with a slipcase and a 60-page booklet. The booklet features essays by Kenneth Turan (The Hours and Times), Peter Cowie (Seven Rode Together), Philip Kemp (A Time of Honor), Peggy Chiao (Kurosawa's Early Influences), Alain Silver (The Rains Came), Stuart Galbraith (A Magnificent Year), A Tribute from Arthur Penn, A Tribute from Sidney Lumet and an interview with Toshiro Mifune (In His Own Words).<br /><br />Also, the \\"Seven Samurai\\" is presented in a digipack case in which both the case and the booklet fits into a slipcase.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Like many fans of the Criterion Collection, I purchased the original \\"Seven Samurai\\" when it was released, followed by the DVD re-release and then here I am once again reviewing another magnificent release of the film but this time on Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" on Blu-ray has much more detail and clarity than any previous release of the film and for those who are passionate about the film, this is the definitive version to own.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the Criterion Collection is passionate about Akira Kurosawa and his work.  From the various Criterion Collection releases to the eclipse series releases and the AK100 set released earlier this year, Akira Kurosawa is a filmmaker that many people all over the world respect and with the announcement of the Blu-ray release of \\"Seven Samurai\\", needless to say, many fans have been waiting patiently and it was definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />The film exemplifies the magnificence of Kurosawa and here we are with a beautiful release of this film, with the intermissions and not hacked and cut like when it first was released in the US.  In Japan, it was uncut.  In the US, in 1954,  this 207 minute film was reduced to 160 minutes and further cuts were made.  And I can't even fathom this film being shortened, as nearly every minutes, every hour of this 207-minute film was important to the story.<br /><br />But there is so much to love about \\"Seven Samurai\\", it's storytelling is well-paced, the characters especially the samurai were well-planned and their scenes were well written, the discussion of strategy was well-thought and planned and the action is well-executed.<br /><br />Both actors that have worked with Akira Kurosawa in his previous movies, Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune were fantastic!  Shimura as Kanbei, the disciplined leader who is aware, always thinking and is very astute when it comes to the samurai way and always practicing caution with his knowledge of strategy and how the farmers can use their surroundings to their advantage.  It's one thing for Shimura to shine two-years earlier as Kanji Watanabe in the 1952 film \\"Ikiru\\" but in \\"Seven Samurai\\", Shimura fit the part as a samurai leader.  Convincing and a leader onscreen that wins your respect and you want this man to truly succeed.<br /><br />Actor Toshiro Mifune as Kikuchiyo is phenomenal.  A popular actor in Kurosawa films such as \\"Drunken Angel\\", \\"Stray Dog\\", \\"Rashomon\\", in \\"Seven Samurai\\", Mifune masterfully plays the wannabe samurai Kikuchiyo who tries to convince everyone he is a samurai but his public display, awkward, weird, unusual, abrasive and crude at times, shows that he is a man with a kind heart and a man who wants to be with men like Kanbei and earn his respect as one of them.  But no matter how unusual Kikuchiyo is....whether he is impulsive, talks a lot, laughs a lot and downright mouthy, this is a character who rises to the occasion.  He is a man who does all he can to defend the farmers from the bandits, he is also a man that will earn the respect of his comrades.<br /><br />Awesome performances by both men but also everyone in this film.  The main characters to the supporting characters are well thought of, are well-utilized...and each talent and even the crew braved through cold weather, cold water and gave the best performance onscreen as Kurosawa demanded and expected the best and got the best performance out of them.<br /><br />As mentioned, the film is 207 minutes long but by no means does the film make you want to look at the clock.  I've seen long films before but with \\"Seven Samurai\\", I was glued to my seat.<br /><br />Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his review of the film,  \\"Akira Kurosawa's `The Seven Samurai' (1954) is not only a great film in its own right but the source of a genre that flowed through the rest of the century.\\" (from Roger Ebert, \\"The Great Movies\\", pg. 400)<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" is a wonderful triumph in cinema.  Kurosawa's wanting to create a jidaigeki samurai film but wanting to make it real, making it entertaining for the viewer that no matter how long the film is, the viewer is captivated.  We know this war with the bandits is not going to go perfectly, some will live and some will die.  We watch to see how well the plans of Kanbei are executed, how well prepared the farmers are in defending their home and we see how ruthless and cunning the bandits are and how they also have other weapons such as muskets and bows and arrows to their disposal.<br /><br />Film critic Pauline Kael wrote about \\"Seven Samurai\\" (in her , \\"It is the Western form carried to apotheosis - a vast celebration of the joys and torments of fighting, seen in a new depth and scale, a brutal imaginative ballet on the nature of strength and weakness.\\" (from Pauline Kael, \\"For Keeps\\", pg. 61)<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" is a battle of underdogs vs. a large group of samurai-turned-bandits and we find ourselves supporting the seven samurai and the farmers in hoping they can become victorious?  But with victory comes a price.  But it's not about just the battle, it's about the relationships of each characters.  The samurai who follow the Bushido way, the farmers who hire the samurai for protection but at the same time, have their own set secrets of what they have done to samurai in the past.  The farmer who lives with revenge for the wife that was taken from him, the man who wants to be a samurai but sympathizes with the farmers for a reason.  There is so many layers within this film, masterfully pieced together, amazing shots that Kurosawa is known for and like a maestro, manages to make the 207 minutes an incredible cinema experience.  The word \\"masterpiece\\" can be a bit misused and even overused but there is no doubt, \\"Seven Samurai\\" is a Kurosawa masterpiece and a truly a magnificent film.<br /><br />As for this Criterion Collection Blu-ray release of \\"Seven Samurai\\", there will be some who may want to know if it's worth it, especially after purchasing the magnificent 2006 DVD release.  While not having any newer special features, you do get the best presentation of the film (and special features) in HD, as well as the two audio commentaries, the three lengthy special features that with special re-release and the booklet as well.  This is truly the definitive version of \\"Seven Samurai\\", a wonderful HD version of the film and if that matters to you, then \\"Seven Samurai\\" on Blu-ray is absolutely worth it.<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" is Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece that has been one of the highlight release for the Criterion Collection for more than a decade.  It's a film that many cinema fans have in their collection and if you are a cineaste is practically essential to have in your film collection.  This Blu-ray release of \\"Seven Samurai\\" looks fantastic and is the definitive version to watch and own.  Overall, with the film, commentary and lengthy special features, \\"Seven Samurai\\" on Blu-ray is a 5-star release and it receives our highest recommendation!trategy was well-thought and planned and the action is well-executed.

Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his review of the film,  \\"Akira Kurosawa's `The Seven Samurai' (1954) is not only a great film in its own right but the source of a genre that flowed through the rest of the century.\\" (from Roger Ebert, \\"The Great Movies\\", pg. 400)    \\"Seven Samurai\\" is a wonderful triumph in cinema.  Kurosawa's wanting to create a jidaigeki samurai film but wanting to make it real, making it entertaining for the viewer that no matter how long the film is, the viewer is captivated.  We know this war with the bandits is not going to go perfectly, some will live and some will die.  We watch to see how well the plans of Kanbei are executed, how well prepared the farmers are in defending their home and we see how ruthless and cunning the bandits are and how they also have other weapons such as muskets and bows and arrows to their disposal.    Film critic Pauline Kael wrote about \\"Seven Samurai\\" (in her , \\"It is the Western form carried to apotheosis - a vast celebration of the joys and torments of fighting, seen in a new depth and scale, a brutal imaginative ballet on the nature of strength and weakness.\\" (from Pauline Kael, \\"For Keeps\\", pg. 61)    \\"Seven Samurai\\" is a battle of underdogs vs. a large group of samurai-turned-bandits and we find ourselves supporting the seven samurai and the farmers in hoping they can become victorious?  But with victory comes a price.   But it's not about just the battle, it's about the relationships of each characters.  The samurai who follow the Bushido way, the farmers who hire the samurai for protection but at the same time, have their own set secrets of what they have done to samurai in the past.  The farmer who lives with revenge for the wife that was taken from him, the man who wants to be a samurai but sympathizes with the farmers for a reason.  There is so many layers within this film, masterfully pieced together, amazing shots that Kurosawa is known for and like a maestro, manages to makethe 207 minutes an incredible cinema experience.  The word \\"masterpiece\\" can be a bit misused and even overused but there is no doubt, \\"Seven Samurai\\" is a Kurosawa masterpiece and a truly a magnificent film.    As for this Criterion Collection Blu-ray release of \\"Seven Samurai\\", there will be some who may want to know if it's worth it, especially after purchasing the magnificent 2006 DVD release.  While not having any newer special features, you do get the best presentation of the film (and special features) in HD, as well as the two audio commentaries, the three lengthy special features that with special re-release and the booklet as well.  This is truly the definitive version of \\"Seven Samurai\\", a wonderful HD version of the film and if that matters to you, then \\"Seven Samurai\\" on Blu-ray is absolutely worth it.    \\"Seven Samurai\\" is Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece that has been one of the highlight release for the Criterion Collection for more than a decade.  It's a film that many cinema fans have in their collection and if you are a cineaste is practically essential to have in your film collection.  This Blu-ray release of \\"Seven Samurai\\" looks fantastic and is the definitive version to watch and own.  Overall, with the film, commentary and lengthy special features, \\"Seven Samurai\\" on Blu-ray is a 5-star release and it receives our highest recommendation!
B003EY7IUY|5.0|I'm unsure why so many reviews gave low stars for this book?!?!?  It is the same great format as all the \\"Shopaholoic\\" books and a great light hearted read!!  Becky is up to her ears again in a dilemma-what else wool you expect-and now she has a \\"Mini-me\\" along for the ride!  A great book- I can't wait for the next one!!!!!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|If you are looking for a pretentious art film, this is not.  This film is an important social commentary on the struggles that a very large number of our population face.  This film is truly great.  Will Smith is amazing in it.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Having collected pretty much all the Beatles' CD releases since 1987, I would like to present my considered (but by no means definitive) views on the re-release of the 'Red' Album Compilation (1962 -1966) which has been newly minted in remastered form by Apple Records.     For all fellow Beatles fans considering whether to invest (again!) in this title - I have played and compared it, track by track, against the original 1993 CD and also against previous digital releases that hold some of the same tracks, namely The Yellow Submarine 'Songtrack' CD Album (from 1999) and The Beatles '1' CD Album (from 2000). My aim is to provide a useful, constructively-critical guide to anyone unsure about committing themselves to this purchase.     Disc 1     1.\\"Love Me Do\\" - 2:23 (Mono)   I found the version on the '1' Album to have better focus to the vocals and more clarity to the tambourine than both the 1993 & 2010 Red versions.     2.\\"Please Please Me\\" - 2:03 (Mono)   I think The 2010 'Red' version has better bass definition than the 1993 'Red' version and the electric guitars sound crisper, Ringo's background drum fills are also cleaner.     3.\\"From Me to You\\" - 1:57 (Mono)   It seems to me that the '1' Album's version sounds less bright overall than the 1993 & 2010 'Red' versions, with John & Paul's vocals being noticeably clearer with less (distracting) delay to the studio echo which George Martin applied to them.     4.\\"She Loves You\\" - 2:22 (Mono)   In my view the '1' Album has the better version of this track than both the 1993 & 2010 'Red' versions as the mix is less muddy and the symbols don't tend to wander in and out of focus, Paul's bass and Ringo's drums are also better defined.     5.\\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" - 2:26   Although I think that the new 2010 'Red' Album version is an upgrade of the 1993 release, it's only slightly better than the version on the '1' Album, with the stereo image being slightly wider and the hand-claps that punctuate the track (which areprovided by all four Beatles)sounding more lifelike.     6.\\"All My Loving\\" - 2:08   I actually prefer the 1993 'Red' Album version of this track to the 2010 'Red' Album version, as the vocals and guitars appear clear and crisp in the centre of the stereo image - the newer release has them driven (annoyingly) hard right with the remaining instrumentation placed more distantly left of centre.     7.\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" - 2:13   In my view the version found on the '1' Album contains a better rendition than either the 1993 or 2010 'Red' Albums - having a bolder presentation of Paul's vocals, cleaner lead and rhythm guitars and added depth to the bass; there's also a satisfying punch to Ringo's kick-drum.     8.\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" - 2:34   The 2010 'Red' Album gives a slightly wider and taller stereo image than it's 1993 counterpart, it also presents far more detailed and realistic bongos and better focused vocals, bass and electric guitars.     9.\\"And I Love Her\\" - 2:31   The 2010 'Red' Album again beats the old 1993 CD release with a rendition that adds just the right amount of gain to bring out the full emotion of Paul's lead vocal, perhaps at the expense of just a touch more audible tape hiss, the trademark blocks used as percussion throughout the song also have a more realistic 'clack' which is all conveyed with better reverb & studio depth.     10.\\"Eight Days a Week\\" - 2:45   The smoother intro to The 2010 'Red' Album version and its more accurate portrayal of Ringo's drums and symbols steadily builds to create an image that beats the 'splashy' mix on the previous 1993 release.     11.\\"I Feel Fine\\" - 2:19   The new 2010 'Red' Album's rendition is now far less 'brittle' as the opening guitar feedback is generated and the lead guitars kick in, John's double-tracked vocal is also now clearly portrayed in the centre of the stereo image.     12.\\"Ticket to Ride\\" - 3:10   I actually prefer the Beatles '1' Album version of this track, the stereo is ever so slightly wider with larger sound to the vocals, guitars and drums.     13.\\"Yesterday\\" - 2:05   Again I feel that The Beatles '1' Album has the better sounding version of Paul's classic song, his acoustic guitar sounds a little more 'real' with a more audible ring after the strings have been gently strummed; the chamber Orchestra sounds fuller and cellos especially can be heard to better effect than the 2010 release.       Disc 2     1.\\"Help!\\" - 2:19   In my opinion the 2010 'Red' Album version relays the best version of this superb song, the added clarity now means there is now no doubt that both 6 string and 12 string guitars exist in the rhythm track and John's pleading vocals are placed fully forward in the mix.     2.\\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\" - 2:11   In my opinion The 2010 'Red' Album version has the best portrayal of the tambourine, maracas and 12 string guitar used on the backing track, John's vocals are superior to the 1993 release.     3.\\"We Can Work It Out\\" - 2:16   It's my belief that The Beatles '1' Album has the best sounding version of this joint collaboration between John and Paul, as Ringo's drums sound more realistic and the picture painted by backing track comprising the accordion, tambourine and symbols is more solid and crisp than the 2010 'Red' version.     4.\\"Day Tripper\\" - 2:49   I think the best lead and harmony vocals of this track can be found on the Beatles '1' Album version , they also don't suffer from audio drop-out and the lead and bass guitars sound far better than the 2010 remaster.     5.\\"Drive My Car\\" - 2:27   The 2010 'Red' Album now gives a clean and accurate representation of this bouncy song that beats the old 1993 'Red' album version with ease the vocal echo now gives studio depth to the lead vocal provided by Paul.     6.\\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" - 2:05   I believe The 2010 'Red' Album has the best sounding version of this song from John, the remastering now brings clarity to George's Sitar and makes is clear that there were timpani bells as well as tambourine used in the percussion.     7.\\"Nowhere Man\\" - 2:44   I believe the version on The Yellow Submarine 'Songtrack' CD sits head and shoulders above those created for the 1993 or 2010 'Red' Album releases in fact the stereo image is so broad, defined and detailed it makes the other albums' versions sound almost mono in comparison.     8.\\"Michelle\\" - 2:42   Starting a run of three tracks that sees the 2010 'Red' Album as the place to find the most satisfying versions, this pseudo-French song from Paul is now a step-up from the 1993 release in most departments, most obviously with the fuller bass and cleaner vocal.     9.\\"In My Life\\" - 2:27   The 2010 'Red' Album continues its run with John's moving retrospective song, the new remastering bringing Ringo's drums and symbols into a fuller stereo image packed with information.     10.\\"Girl\\" - 2:31   The final track in this fine run for the 2010 'Red' Album has the sultry brushwork by Ringo on his snare drum clearly sweeping around the mix with ultimate realism, the strong intake of 'breaths' from John are also now far more detailed.     11.\\"Paperback Writer\\" - 2:31   I think the Beatles '1' Album gives a better view of this song than either of the 1993 or 2010 'Red' Album releases, the lead vocal stands further forward of the harmonies and the bass really drives hard.     12.\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" - 2:08   It's abundantly clear to me that the version contained on the Yellow Submarine 'Songtrack' CD is the one that leaves the listener most satisfied; it has been created without the clumsy panning to the right when Paul first delivers the vocal of 'Eleanor...Rigby' and it also includes superior depth and detail to the cellos as well as conveying all the drama of the score George Martin created for the Chamber Orchestra.     13.\\"Yellow Submarine\\" - 2:37   Without a shadow of a doubt the best version of this track still remains the title track from the Yellow Submarine 'Songtrack' CD, it surpasses the version on the 2010 'Red' album in every respect.       So in closing, I recommend this new 2010 release to all those new to the Beatles musical catalogue as it's the best place to start your journey of discovery - for all those others who are already 'hooked', you can buy this CD knowing most of the tracks will give an upgrade in sound quality to the 1993 release....    However, if you don't have them already, I also recommend that you buy The Yellow Submarine 'Songtrack' & '1' CD albums to fully realise the best sounding versions of these 26 tracks.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I bought this for my mom, she had seen it on a PBS (public broadcasting station) for much much more than what I bought it for.  It is eactly what she wanted and came earlier than the date promised.
B0040JHNZ2|4.0|Great read and an excellent plot. Not quite in the same league as the John Masters trilogy about the First World War although it shares several similar sub-plots, particularly the \\"Upstairs -Downstairs\\" relations between the classes in Britian during the early 20th Century. Enjoy the way Follett manages to bring in all major political characters of the period and weave them around the families. Definitely a book to have with you on any long journey, holiday break as you get immersed and it is difficult to put down.Now will go back and re-read the John Masters.

0740785508|5.0|Okay, I'm not a great artist, I admit.  And this book has not magically transformed me into one, but it is a great book for inspiration.  The images in the book alone are worth more than the cost of this book to me.  It takes work and practice to create art, and this is something that Gurney tells you in this book.  As Gurney tells you in the beginning of the book, it is not a step-by-step approach on how to draw, but rather a look at what really goes in \\"behind the scenes\\" to create great works of art.  If you are one of those who think an artist just grabs his pencils, paintbrush or other drawing instrument and then sits down and creates magic, think again. Art involves interpreting the world around us.  In this book, Gurney offers a look into how to use the world around you as a base and then bring new life into it through your imagination.<br /><br />If you're looking for step-by-step instructions on how to draw, this is not the book. But if you are looking for inspiration and methods on how to add imagined/fictional/sci-fi (whatever) to your art, this is the book.
0060012358|4.0|What would happen if a cat and some rats all CHANGED such that they could talk to one another, and think, and plan adventures of questionable legality? What would happen if Terry Pratchett used this premise as a story? The answer to these questions is \\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents,\\" which is witty, hilarious, and thoughtful all at the same time.<br /><br />The story takes us into the thoughts of Maurice the cat, and the rats he hangs with. Unlike many other stories from the point-of-view of the animals, Pratchett takes the premise itself as an issue for the characters themselves. They all - Maurice and the rats - remember life before the Change, and deal with the effects after it.<br /><br />\\"Maurice wasn't like other cats anymore. Other cats were, suddenly, stupid. Maurice started to hang around with the rats instead. They were someone to talk to.\\" Maurice's approach is very pragmatic. The rats, on the other hand, \\"spent a lot of time worrying about why they were suddenly so clever.\\" The rat Dangerous Beans is the one most preoccupied with that mystery. He is an albino runt with very poor eyesight. And a restless, changed mind.<br /><br />To propel this unlikely, but fascinating, premise, Pratchett employs the Pied Piper plot. More correctly, Maurice employs that plot, for financial gain. Finding a \\"stupid kid\\" with a pennywhistle, Maurice hatches a plan to pay for this odd troupe's way in the world. It's a variant of the protection racket: they'll find a little town with no major rat problem, infest it with their own clever rodents, terrorize the inhabitants, and then bring in the kid with the pipe to save the day. For a handsome fee.<br /><br />The book begins with the troupe spying out their newest target. We see how they work together to dupe the local bourgeoisie out of some money and power, and get a taste of the thinking of cats and rats as Pratchett imagines it. Then the story takes us to a town with a mystery: no rats at all. Soon our heroes are themselves in danger, and theirs isn't the only scheme going down. Amidst trying to solve this mystery, and keep themselves alive, they all ask some very hard questions - about the nature of their `cleverness,' the future of their cooperative relationship, and the burdens and responsibilities of conscious thought.<br /><br />I applaud Pratchett for his skill in telling an enjoyable story with characters worth rooting for, and wrestling with questions and issues worth tackling.theirs isn't the only scheme going down.

0307454541|1.0|I started reading this book because I noticed that a movie was going to be based on it and because I was hearing good things about this book. I am 16 and I have to tell you that in the first few pages I was lost. It is based in Sweden with places that I have no idea where they are and it made it really hard for me to center myself in the book. This book is more for older people who actually understand politics. Only got to page 12 and then stopped.
0393072231|4.0|So--there have been some large structural problems in the economy in the last thirty years or so.  There's been a gap between wages and profits that has grown because of the attacks on unions and deregulation of many markets.  Wages have stagnated, making more people work more hours to achieve a standard of living relative to what was once possible with a one-earner household with a high-school wage.  Asset prices have increased so that housing has to be bought at a higher price with ever more leverage.  Capital, in its genius, flows ever upward.<br /><br />This is a pretty common story nowadays, and while it should have been obvious while it was going on, the backwards glance shows so much more.  There were some minor shocks to the system in the last thirty years, but the bursting of the housing bubble should-- hopefully, eventually - help us reevaluate the economic system we live in (Lewis goes into detail with the exact mechanism.  It is not simple, in fact it was designed to be opaque as possible to as many people as possible).  Sadly though, it seems that we are happy with the status quo and are content to recapitalize the banks and hope that what was going on will start again.<br /><br />It will, and when it does we will have had documents like this book to look on afterwards to tell us that once again in hindsight we should have known what was going on.  The thing is, there were several people that knew what was going on.  They saw the irrationality of the markets in CDO's and other asset backed securities and bet against them.  They were few, and many had doubters and some made a lot of money anyway.  This is the story Lewis tells, and he tells it well.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Reviewing the series as a whole and taking into account the very real limitations of time and money I can say unequivocally EVERY scene with Joseph Mazzello as Eugene Sledge is unwatchable. Likewise Part 3 and majority of Part 8 directed by Jeremy Podeswa are so \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" bad it's shocking Spielberg allowed his name in the credits, even as just an Executive Producer. For the record there are some VERY redeemable parts, specifically Part 2 and the last few minutes of Part 8 both directed by David Nutter and featuring Jon Seda as John Basilone, but for me, for the most part the series as a whole just didn't work.     One unavoidable reason is the well known fact that the Pacific theater was NOT romantic and therefore will always be a challenge in-and-of-itself to make entertaining. The Japanese (with good reason) were not seen as human and there is NO glory in slaughtering dogs. Also, what few women that make it into the series are so one dimensional and cliche for such a high profile project it's no surprise that the director of their parts (Podeswa) plays for the other team.     Ultimately the weak female performances and/or directing limitations of Podeswa and the weak performance of Joseph Mazzello as Eugene Sledge made for a grade too steep to climb.     Of interesting note I think if part 2 was released as a stand alone film about Basilone's Medal of Honer actions at Guadalcanal it would be regarded as one of the most entertaining and visceral battle sequences ever put on film.     C+ for the effort.
B0038AUY96|5.0|If you are reading this then your curiosity has been peaked by a recommendation or you may have, like myself, read the Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy and have heard that Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole detective novels are also very good.  Not true.  They are great. Equal to Larsson's book and better if you like crime/detective novels. If you are an American like myself you'll feel like you know Oslo pretty well by the third book and have found a new friend in Harry, a sympathetic schlub of a detective with unique Colombo-ish insights. Nesbo is a story teller of the highest order who'll keep you guessing all the way. Enjoy.
006145205X|5.0|As an environmentalist, I often despair of the choices our society continues to make, regardless of the damage we are continuing to do to our planet.  This book gives me a new perspective on human ingenuity and new hope that we will find a way out of our disturbing predicament.  This is not the simple Pollyanna view that We Will Find A Way.  This is a scientific and historical evaluation of all of the changes humanity has made over the millenia that suggests we remain capable of much more.  I will share this book with friends.  And I will re-read it, since Ridley's knowledge and analysis have so much to offer.

I can't wait until the next one!

B000O590I4|5.0|*** 2010 2CD DELUXE EDITION Review ***<br /><br />To my knowledge this troubled 'DELUXE EDITION' (Decca 984 194-9) has had no less than 7 release dates - May, July and November of 2007 were first cited, then January, February and April of 2008 - and now it finally arrives Monday 18 October 2010 without the tiniest bit of fanfare. It has a 2007 Copyright date on the rear so it's effectively been delayed three and a half years. But has it been worth the wait - yes absolutely. But to the considerable details first...<br /><br />DISC 1 - Decca 984 195-0 (77:52 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 8 are their 3rd album \\"Vagabonds Of The Western World\\" released 21 September 1973 in the UK on Decca SKL 5170.<br />(It was released as London XPS 636 in the USA, but contained a very-slightly edited version of \\"Little Girl In Bloom\\"; it's the full UK version that is used here)<br /><br />Tracks 9 and 10 are their 2nd UK 7\\" single from May 1973, \\"Randolph's Tango\\" and \\"Broken Dreams\\". Both tracks on Decca F 13402 were non-album at the time.<br />(Note: the version of \\"Randolph's Tango\\" that is used here is known as the 'Full Version' at 3:49 minutes - the promo-only 7\\" edit at 2:25 minutes is Track 17)<br /><br />Tracks 11 and 12 are their 3rd UK 7\\" single and the first to feature a track off the album. \\"The Rocker\\" was issued as a 7\\" single in the UK in November 1973 on Decca F 13467 and is an edited version (2:41 as opposed to the album's 5:12 minutes). It was backed with another non-album Phil Lynott track, the jaunty \\"Here I Go Again\\".<br /><br />Track 13, \\"Cruising In The Lizzymobile\\" is non-album also. It's correct title is \\"A Ride In The Lizzy Mobile\\" and is a genuine Thin Lizzy vinyl rarity as it was only ever issued on the B-side of the 7\\" GERMAN release of \\"The Rocker\\". Its CD debut first came on the \\"Vagabonds Kings Warriors Angels \\" 4CD box set in 2001. Its rare picture sleeve is reproduced in the booklet.<br /><br />Tracks 14 and 15 are from the GARY MOORE period of Thin Lizzy. \\"Little Darling\\" (featuring superb brass arrangements by Fiachra French) was originally issued 11 April 1974 in the UK as a 7\\" SINGLE-ONLY release on Decca F 13574 (it's B-side \\"Buffalo Girl\\" is on the 2010 remaster of \\"Shades Of A Blue Orphanage\\"). \\"Sitamoia\\" first turned up in August 1976 as an exclusive track on the compilation LP \\"Remembering Part 1\\" on Decca SKL 5249 and was also later issued on a UK 3-track 7\\" EP in January 1978 on Decca F 13748.<br /><br />Track 16 is the 'December 1977 Overdubbed & Remixed Version' of \\"Slow Blues\\" which features Gary Moore on Guitar and Keyboards (it's released for the first time on CD here).<br /><br />Tracks 17 and 18 are the UK 'Radio Promotional Edited Versions' of \\"Randolph's Tango\\" (2:25 minutes) and \\"Whisky In The Jar\\" (3:43 minutes)<br />[Note: \\"Whisky In The Jar\\" and its non-album B-side \\"Black Boys On The Corner\\" are on the 2010 CD remaster of \\"Shades Of A Blue Orphanage\\"].<br /><br />DISC 2 - Decca 984 195-1 (64:02 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 5 are a \\"BBC Radio 1 In Concert\\" (recorded live 26 July 1973 at the Golders Green Hippodrome in London)<br /><br />Tracks 6 and 7 are a \\"BBC Radio 1 John Peel Session\\" (recorded 31 July 1973)<br /><br />Track 8 is a \\"BBC Radio 1 Rock On Session\\" (recorded 26 February 1974)<br /><br />Tracks 9 to 12 are a \\"BBC Radio Bob Harris Session\\" (recorded 6 March 1974)<br /><br />Track 13 is a \\"BBC Radio 1 John Peel Session\\" (recorded 4 April 1974)<br /><br />[Notes: tracks 5 and 12, \\"Suicide\\" and \\"Showdown\\" feature Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson]<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />There isn't a plastic wrap like previous Deluxe Editions, instead there's a similar-looking 'Deluxe Edition' paper band running around the entire double digipak at the bottom and you have to cut it from sealed to open the side. Both inner flaps contain the lyrics and black & white session photos that were on either side of the rare insert that came with original UK LPs. The \\"Legend Of The Vagabond\\" story on therear cover of the album artwork is reproduced too and the 16-page booklet has a detailed assessment of the album and the band's history to that point by compiler and noted writer MARK POWELL. The power trio of Phil Lynott, Eric Bell and Brian Downey are also pictured.<br /><br />The iconic and especially commissioned artwork of Dublin artist Jim Fitzpatrick (a theme followed through to Jailbreak, Johnny The Fox and Black Rose) is fully displayed. Fitzpatrick's artwork was steeped in romantic Gaelic folklore and he was kind of Ireland's answer to England's Roger Dean (Yes, Badger, Greenslade album sleeves). Fitzpatrick and Lynott were lifetime friends and he produced over 250 pieces of art for Lizzy and Phil.<br /><br />SOUND:<br />The original 1991 CD reissue has been sounding decidedly dated for decades, the 2001 box set versions were an improvement, but these 2007 polish-ups are subtly wonderful. I've raved about PASCHAL BYRNE'S work before (see my reviews for \\"Ain't No Saint\\" the 4CD John Martyn box set and \\"Blues From Laurel Canyon\\" by John Mayall), and this set is no different. The first generation tapes have been remastered - not too brash - fantastic presence - each track a revelation. As a rabid fan of this album since a spotty teenager in Dublin, to hear these tracks punch above the belt like this is a genuine thrill. As the blistering slide guitar work of Eric Bell opens \\"Mama Nature Said\\", you can at last hear the organ work of JAN SCHELHAAS in the background (ex Gary Moore band, later with Caravan & Camel) and the clarity of Downey's drumming on \\"Gonna Creep Up On You\\" is awesome. The rather silly Kid Jensen talking track \\"The Hero & The Madmen\\" is probably the album's worst offence (whether it sounds good or not), but Eric Bell's truly fantastic guitar work on the full version of \\"The Rocker\\" still astonishes (lyrics above).<br /><br />CONTENT:<br />The previously unreleased remake of \\"Slow Blues\\" is OK, but you can't help but feel that something already good should have been left well enough alone. The single edits and very cool non-album B-sides are a huge bonus and the BBC sound quality is ace throughout. But what I wasn't prepared for was the quality of the live stuff on Disc 2. Powell's liner notes describe the July 1973 Hippodrome set as 'blistering' and he's not joking - absolutely on fire, Eric Bell comes out doing an almost note for note version of \\"The Rocker\\" that is stunning. And it's also great to hear live versions of \\"Sitamoia\\" and \\"Little Darling\\" at last sounding so alive. Speaking of which - although it doesn't say in the liner notes, I'd swear the incredible guitar work between tracks 9 and 13 (especially on the unbelievably good \\"Black Boys On The Corner\\") - is Gary Moore.<br /><br />To sum up - die-hard fans may have a lot of it already, but the improved sound will be a big draw. The 8-track album by itself may not tempt many newcomers, but for me the huge amount of truly excellent bonus material make it yet another 2010 'Reissue Of The Year'.<br /><br />God bless you Phillip Paris Lynott wherever you may be (\\"...bippin' and boppin' and telling a dirty joke or two...\\") - and what a band.<br /><br />PS: The last compilation album touching on the 1971-1974 period of Thin Lizzy was called \\"The Continuing Saga Of The Ageing Orphans\\" released in the UK in 1979 on Decca SKL 5298. Of it's 11 tracks, 3 were untouched cuts off the \\"Vagabonds Of The Western World\\" album - \\"Mama Nature Said\\", \\"The Hero And The Madman\\" and \\"Vagabond Of The Western World\\". But the other 8 tracks were December 1977 remixes and remakes of old Decca material. They contained contributions from Gary Moore and Midge Ure.

B002ZG99CC|3.0|Its an ok remaking of the original \\"Karate Kid\\", however the original movie is much better and much more convincing. I just wish they would have given crdit to Karate as a martial art since the movie is called \\"Karate Kid\\". If you noticed, the word Karate was not mentioned once in the movie! They should have called it the Kung Fu kid, but they probably knew it would sell better if they gave it the name of a classic like \\"Karate Kid\\".    It would have been cool too to make it based on Jiu Jitsu or MMA, since nowadays they are more propular than most traditional martial arts such as Karate or Kung Fu.

B002ZG98VE|4.0|A very interesting \\"historical\\" version! First, Richard I never spoke English! He was hit by a crossbow, but died in the arms of his mother. There was no \\"French invasion\\" by Phillip; the French did invade years later in John's reign when the Welsh and Scots also attacked English lands. The reference to the Barons Dispute did lead to war and then the signing of the Magna Cartr. Will the sequel focus on the heavy taxation of John to support his war? This will be central theme for \\"Robin Hood Part II\\" plus the First Baron's War and the loss of all land holdings of Normandy. Who will pardon and 'restore' Robin? King John died a broken and unloved failure in life. Ridley Scott will recreate English History again.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Okay, first of all let me say that I love the James Bond movies (especially the Brosnan, Connery ones). The Brosnan Bond films in the 90's and 2000's were very good. Unfortunately, the Daniel Craig ones don't even hold up to the quality normally associated with Bond movies. The camera angles were so bad that I couldn't keep up with the action scenes. Also, Daniel Craig CAN'T ACT! He was a horrible disgrace to everyone's favorite spy. Unlike the other actors who filled his role, he doesn't have the 007 wit or charm.    Now let's move on to the story. Throughout the movie Bond supposedly pursues the man who killed his wife (I think, the movie isn't very clear on that) The story is very hard to follow. There are several scenes that are almost carbon copies of ones from previous Bond films. The movie appears to be a collection of scenes that don't make much sense and the story in my opinion, should never have been written. If this is the future of James Bond movies, I won't see another one in the theater for a very long time.    I gave this movie a one star rating because Amazon doesn't offer a lower rating.

B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I am a life-long Clapton fan since the 1960's. Although I generally prefer a more hard-driving beat, this is good for a more kick-back mellow blues mood.  I do like some of his earlier blues albums better, but after several listen-throughs, I ended up putting about 2/3 of the disk on my ipod to go along with JJ Cale tunes.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|There is an old saying which I always adhere to...\\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\\" Eons of years experimenting with gene combinations has given Nature a one-up on humanity. So, why is it that we find ourselves delving into realms better left alone? SPLICE is an interesting and perhaps a more cerebral look at the us+them quandry. What is wrong with our species that we have an inate need to \\"fix\\" stuff? Often, this works to our general betterment.....then, there are the times we should have left well-enough alone!<br /><br />I am a fan of scifi and the \\"alien\\" possibilities. In Splice the alien DNA is ours plus other Earthly genes. Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody make a believable couple of ambitious scientists desperately attempting to find a new protein and achieve auspicious merit in the genetics field. Having a corporate timeline nipping at their heels, Clive and Elsa go beyond the point of ethical acceptability and create a new human hybrid. Dren is a quasi-human being of dubious character within an ever-changing form.<br /><br />Watching the interaction of the scientists attempting to cope with the fallout of their experiment is fascinating. At some point, we must confront ourselves and ask what we would do in this situation. Not only is there conflict between Elsa and Clive, but as things progress also between Dren and her creators. How are we to cope with the unknown? At what point do we pull the plug? What makes us human? What makes us inhuman? Ethics....when did they disappear in the race for glory and/or money?<br /><br />Splice is not a slasher movie. It takes the scenario and runs with it to some places we would rather never go! This is a thinking person's storyline. If you are so inclined, it makes you ponder where the future of science is headed. Are we ready for the eventualities? Or, to misquote from \\"Jurassic Park\\"...\\"Just because we can, doesn't mean we should!\\"<br /><br />The special effects in this movie are well-done and create a believable creature(s). We can understand how Clive becomes drawn to Dren and how Elsa embraces her own intrinsic mothering instincts. As a creation in CG, Dren works. However, it is the character/personality of this creation which draws us into the plot, rather than the physicality, however appealing.<br /><br />I advise those who watch SPLICE not to assume anything going in. Do not try to figure it out! Just let the characters and storyline take you to an unexpected place and enjoy the ride. This is a film where the journey is the prize, not the destination!<br /><br />Finding this little treasure in the theatre, I will end up buying on dvd in the near future. Some ideas are well worth running with and this has given me food for thought. Would love to see a \\"Re-Spliced\\" as may be promised by the ending : ) Howz about it Sarah? Sequel please! : )<br /><br />Enjoy!w Clive becomes drawn to Dren and how Elsa embraces her own intrinsic mothering instincts. As a creation in CG, Dren works.

B000IJ79UW|4.0|The first (and best) of the big-budget Christopher Reeve adventures, with the expanded 151-minute version a slight improvement over the 1978 theatrical cut. Winning performances, Richard Donner's affectionate direction and John Williams' score easily surpass the uneven special effects. A comic-book epic done right.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|There's almost 200 reviews already, so there's really not much I can say that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />For the most part people will either love or hate this series. Both my husband and I enjoy it, however, I must say that the violence does get to me and I tend to cover my eyes in some of the more gruesome scenes. It is absolutely not something you watch when the kiddies are around - I'm sure it would cause nightmares for weeks.<br /><br />All-in-all it is an interesting, seemingly realistic series that has been very well done, albeit very violent and gory. If you're not squeamish you'll likely really enjoy it. If you are squeamish, you may still like it & just cover your eyes during gory scenes like I do.
0307389839|4.0|I discovered Haruki Murakami many years ago, when the New Yorker first published \\"The Elephant Vanishes\\".  I was hooked immediately, and have read everything he's produced since then (at least everything that's been translated).  As such, I am very much a Murakami enthusiast, and it has been said that this book is particularly for people like me.  It's difficult to distance myself from my enthusiasm for Murakami's work, but I will say this... the man managed to get me interested in running.    Keep in mind that I don't run.  I have horribly flat feet and after a while, running bothers my neck.  I CAME to the book because of Murakami, agreed, but I STAYED there because of the book itself.  Murakami's voice is very special, it is deep yet simple, profound yet humble.  The only other writer that ever struck me in quite the same way was Primo Levi.  \\"What I Talk About...\\" is the perfect example of that very special voice, it's a quiet poem in a still desert, a whisper of a song at sea. Like an abstract painting, it brings a mood upon you, though you're not quite sure why.    As such, I imagine that most people who actually buy the book will either be Murakami enthusiasts or runners, but you'll love the book because of that voice.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|Ladies and Gentleman, prepare to meet \\"Charlie\\", Britain's most dangerous inmate...the man with that disarming, enigmatic smile and biceps to die for.<br /><br />Trying to define the man who calls himself Charles Bronson would be a mistake.The man, the myth, the misunderstandings, the manic attempts to disentangle from the penal establishment... The movie \\"Bronson\\" achieves what can only be described as a visual feast of an epic life of monumental disparities. Tom Hardy, whom I believe is one of, if not Britain's finest actor, becomes Charlie. Every movement, every breath, the famous grin, the rage of the man himself is all there on the screen. Physically the resemblance to Charlie is almost unnerving, the slope of those massive shoulders, the shaven head and again...that unforgettable smile!<br /><br />Like most of us, before this movie I knew nothing of the man who strikes fear in the most brutal and hardened of men in Britain's prison system. After the movie I sent for Charlie's books, which if you find the man as intriguing as I do, you will also. Here is a man of formidable strength both physical and spiritual. This is a soul who recognises his own weaknesses and holds himself accountable. Yes, Charlie even relishes in his notoriety and fame, and believe me he IS famous : ) Please remember, this bear of a man has never killed anyone, never harmed a woman or a child!<br /><br />A tortured soul in a rock solid frame, somewhere between the circus strong man and the circus clown, the man called Bronson reminds me of a poem...\\"What immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry...\\" Charlie was born, no, created to be different, to hold a rage so powerful no earthly soul could hope to contain it, to own a heart so gentle only an immortal could have forged it. Well, sleeping tigers should not be awakened and when you piss-off Charlie watch out! He takes hostages. He rips off roofs of prisons and holds the whole of Britain in awe as he steals some free, fresh air blessed hours in the sun and consequently loses more years in jail! Here is the man who fears literally no one on this Earth! God bless you Charlie! It's like trying to contain a tornado...not going to happen!<br /><br />I am encouraging you to watch or buy this movie. You will be introduced to one of creation's most fascinating people. Enjoy the superb cinematography of this film. Marvel at the character which Tom Hardy has so electrically embodied. There is little if any fault I can find with this film. I was mesmerized, not only by the stunning performance by Tom, by the mastery of the movie's execution, but mainly by its' subject, a man out of time, out of place, but not out of his mind...since he has three times been declared legally sane. Not sure I could pass that test ; )<br /><br />For those who get drawn into the \\"Charlie\\" trap...he has a site freebronson.co.uk<br /><br />You will be among excellent company if you decide to sign his petition : )he sun and consequently loses more years in jail!

0061673730|4.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance arouses strong feelings in readers, for better or worse. The details and themes of the book have been discussed at length, so I'll simply try to add a little perspective to the ambient buzz. I hope we all dial it down a bit. A work of art can have great value even while having real flaws, and even more unquestionably, the artist's hang-ups can be separated from the artist's talent. Pirsig's views on philosophy, life, meaning, etc do not, by themselves, warrant acerbic responses. On the other hand, even if Pirsig has cracked the code of the universe, we're stilling just dealing with a novel here. The book should be judged on its own merit, not whether the writer is overwrought or melodramatic in his critiques of the current state of the philosophy academy. I happen to have found the book very impactful and intriguing, while simultaneously finding his views on the current state philosophy to be wrong (or at least misguided).     The critiques (that Pirsig goes off on rants, his narration is too self-consumed, etc) have a kernel of truth to them. Then again, so do the countless examples of fawning praise (the book is wonderfully multi-layered, Pirsig's writing is penetrating and insightful, etc). I lean toward the latter, but the former have enough going to warrant taking one star away.     What I like best about the book is how it strikes at the very core (of insecurities, philosophy, meaning. etc). One could call it an \\"axiomatic exploration,\\" and such a thing is not new to philosophy or literature. Not being new is no crime; I find the idea that this book should be criticized because it hasn't presented anything wholly revolutionary or new to be a bit amusing. I mean, is this the standard we usually apply? So what if countless fans have reoriented their world view around Pirsig's ideas, or if Pirsig is a true believer of every assertion in the book? Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a work of art, and should be judged that way. Now, not all critiques have been this unfair or unfocused. If one finds the philosophy presented in the book unimpressive, or the prose inauthentic, or the plot too thin, OK fair enough (I should warn you that I tend to care more for characters and their experiences, than for plots. And I can't judge how good or bad the arc of the book is, because I tend not to need or desire very much of that). But the value of the ideas presented in the book, and the prose therein, are in their ability to provoke empathy, thought, wonder, and perhaps even a little existential angst. If the book does a poor job of that, so be it, but it sparked all these emotional responses in me and in many others.    One gets a feel for how heavy life is for the narrator, how hard he takes things, and the challenges present in his dealings with himself and others (but mostly with himself). Affection and blame fly in all directions in the book. Whether either is warranted is not the point. If the book catches you at the right time, it may change your life, at the wrong time, it may annoy the piss out of you. While evoking all sorts of feelings, good and bad, it neither single handedly changed my life or caused me to want to pull my hair out. But it definitely had me hooked as I was reading it, and after I finished, it left quite an impact. That says a lot about a book, in my view.
B001CJJWJ8|5.0|I have a dozen or more recordings of this, perhaps my favourite Verdi opera, yet one which languished unregarded for a good half century before Bing's famous revival at the Met in 1950 with Bjorling. There never has been and now never will be a pefect recording of what remains a very dark, complex, \\"adult\\" opera, full of weighty, serious matters both personal and political, and containing some of the most glorious music Verdi ever wrote. As a bonus, the plot is largely free of absurdities unless you balk at the surreal ending when a mysterious monk who appears to be the deceased Carlo Quinto rescues his grandson Carlo from King Philip's wrath by pulling him back into the safety of the cloister.<br /><br />I give it five stars despite some weaknesses as to do otherwise would be foolish given the success of Solti's taut yet flexible direction in moulding his experienced cast into a dramatically convincing ensemble. The orchestra of the Royal Opera House are wonderful - the prelude to Act 3 absolutely sings and sighs - and the sound is terrific for a recording forty-five years old, broad and spacious with merely a hint of hiss. I was mainly tempted to remove a star on account of Fischer-Dieskau's Rodrigo. His cloudy baritone was never a Verdi voice; he barks, yells and strains in moments of high drama, particularly during the confrontation with Filippo, which is emotionally gripping but vitiated by the sad contrast between Ghiaurov's big, black bass and Fisher-Dieskau's windy posturing; he simply has none of the Italianate bite and power provided by real Verdi baritones like Gobbi or Bastianini, but he is better in the lyrical exchange with Eboli in the garden in Act 2, and I suppose this is as good as he got singing the music of a composer for whom he was ill-equipped.<br /><br />Other vocal drawbacks are minimal and the strengths are manifest. Bergonzi, never large of voice, compensates with beauty of tone and shading of dynamics and he makes an excellent match for Tebaldi, then in the closing stages of her career but still able to float a line and swell her voice impressively. Ghiaurov and Talvela remain the most imposing and gripping bass duo ever to record their scene, with the possible exception of Cesare Siepi and Jerome Hines. Eboli, a fiendishly difficult and disparate role with its requirement of two essentially different voices for the two big scenes, has nonetheless been well served on disc and Bumbry is up there with a roster of the finest mezzos of the last fifty years: Cossotto, Verrett, Baltsa, Simionato, Borodina et al. Hers is a seductive yet weighty sound and she really inhabits the part. Joan Carlyle is superb as a soaring \\"voce dal cielo\\".<br /><br />I would not place this above other favourite recordings of the five Act version such as the 1961 studio recording by Santini with Labo, Stella, Bastianini, Cossotto and Christoff (an admittedly offbeat choice of a very hard-to-obtain set), the live 1977 La Scala set with Abbado or Giulini's famous studio recording. There are equally indispensable four Act versions, too: the other classic Santini set of 1954 and the interesting Karajan version from Berlin in 1978 - but this Solti performance remains amongst the best.ebaldi, then in the closing stages of her career but still able to float a line and swell her voice impressively.

B001PO53IO|4.0|Nobody was more skeptical about this series than yours truly. I was not a fan of the prequels, and I thought that [[ASIN:B001GQSY64 Star Wars: The Clone Wars [Blu-ray]]] movie was more of the same. Then, thanks to a five-year-old, I started watching [[ASIN:B003TLMPHI Star Wars: The Clone Wars - The Complete Season Two [Blu-ray]]] on Cartoon Network. And man was I blown away! Finally a Star Wars production that captured the rich universe like the original film trilogy. So naturally, I was anxious to see what I had missed out on with Clone Wars Season One, and the Blu-ray specs alone were enough to warrant a purchase.    I must say, however, the first half of Season One is mostly a disappointment. There are couple of cool episodes, especially one penned by Paul Dini called \\"Cloak of Darkness\\" and another called \\"Lair of Grievous.\\" Otherwise, the first 12 episodes of the series are slow going in finding their real stride. By the time you get to \\"Jedi Crash,\\" however, the show starts to build steam. I think the main reason for this is that the creators were desperately trying to find the right balance between kiddie and adult entertainment (and that's no easy thing). But I'm happy to report that they do, and to much greater effect by the time we get to Season Two, which is practically flawless.     Other than a slow start story and character wise, the Blu-ray set of The Clone Wars is downright impressive. Seeing this show in widescreen 1080p is the ONLY way to see it. It's just gorgeous. Add to that mini-featurettes on EVERY episode and several directors' cuts, and you've got one of the best tv series Blu-ray sets available. If you've been on the fence as to whether or not you should commit to this series, I highly recommend you give it a chance.     Or just skip the movie and Season One and start with Season Two...

I am one of those annoying people who almost always gets it 5 minutes into the plot, and I did with this movie. However, watching the acting, the interplay of characters...each little gesture of hand and eye...each struggle, internal and external, to dredge away the lies and reveal the truth is exquisitely portrayed!<br /><br />For all its complexity and \\"other-worldy\\" atmosphere, Shutter Island is filmed with scrutiny, careful attention to detail and a love of the genre.

But the effects of this war will be on the global scale.<br /><br />This is the third and final book in Collins' fantastic trilogy. Her post-apocalyptic world is bleak yet stirring. Her storytelling is completely engrossing and impossible to put down. Usually, I can't get into books written in present tense. But not only do I not mind her writing style, but after a while I don't even notice that it's present tense. As before, the adventure is non-stop suspense and drama. Ending in a climactic showdown with several surprises along the way, readers will be satisfied with the conclusion. I wasn't left wanting. It's a whirlwind of hope, despair, grief, and triumph. A story of epic proportions, I can't recommend this trilogy enough.

The link of course is the courage to adapt to various styles and to offer the listening public something that takes a slightly different direction.  Like anything new, one tends to randomly listen to the hook tracks like Hard Times Blues, Travelin Alone, Judgement Day and That's No Way to Get Along.  After a couple of listens you find yourself listening to everything from track 1 through bonus track 15.  I got this same feeling when I first heard Pilgrim which was again, a departure in a slightly different direction from the previous record.  A great disc to listen to with as always, an exectionally gifted crew of contributing artists. I must admit, the CD was not exactly what I expected, but that's what makes surprizes so rewarding.

0385738757|4.0|I won't go to much into the plot so I don't spoil anything but The Scorch Trials continues from where The Maze Runner left off. Thomas wakes up after his rescue at the end of The Maze Runner to find he's still in WICKED's game (not a big surprise given the epilogue in book 1.) Things just go from bad to worse for Thomas and his friends in The Scorch Trials as they are forced to travel through a barren waste land hinted to be somewhere in Central America. As added trouble for them they learn about Group B, mentioned at the end of book 1, who appear to their competition for surviving the trials.    The plot was good but lacking in terms of originality. While the first book was unique with its complex plot about a group of teenagers with amnesia stuck in a giant maze, this book is more of a typical post apocalyptic tale. The \\"monsters\\" in this book are more like intelligent zombies and they aren't involved enough to be a legitimate concern for most of the book. The real conflict comes from the relationship between Thomas and Teresa where you never really know what's going on. While this was compelling, it also seemed a bit tedious by the end of the book (I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume it was intentional in order for you to feel as frustrated as Thomas was supposed to.)    The writing is where this book (like the last) both shines and hurts. The story is fast paced and easy to read so you don't get bored very often while reading this book. But the language is what annoyed me. I understand that this is intended as a \\"Teen\\" book but while the story and situations were at least PG-13 the author tried to keep it appropriate for children by making the language G rated; to me this threw off the balance of the book taking me away from the story.    Overall, I highly enjoyed reading this book and my only disappointment is that I have to wait until the final book comes out. (I'm assuming it will be next October given the last two releases.) Luckily, I enjoyed reading The Maze Runner a second time as much as the first so I'll be looking forward to re-reading the first two books prior to the conclusion. If you haven't read The Maze Runner, definitely give it a shot and if you liked it as much as I did you shouldn't need anyone to tell you to read The Scorch Trials.

I'm glad I didn't because I most definitely want to see certain scenes over and over. Love the Babe who helper Perseus. I believe one of the moons of Jupiter was named after her: IO    It was better than the original in every way. I believe the story plot is based on classic mythology so how can anyone say it was short on a story plot?    The special effects were fantastic!    I'm glad I saw this after I saw Avatar so that I can appreciate the acting of Sam Worthington    They obviously created the expensive owl robot then decided that the movie worked better without a comedy relief. That looked like one friggin expensive owl robot!    People who only like romantic comedies with gay comedy relief characters will most certainly give bad reviews to this movie.    Without question    If you don't like this movie you will most certainly love anything with Julia Roberts in it

0307454541|3.0|Maybe it was good that I never had holidays in Sweden. After all, judging from Wallander, Mankell, Hakan Nesser etc., Sweden seems to harbour the most gruesome collection of sexual predators, sadists, child molesters and woman haters on Earth.<br />And here in Larsson's novel they are again thick on the ground. I counted at least three sadists, but I may have overlooked the odd one. Add a girl with Asperger's syndrom - sorry, autism is yesterdays fashion - who naturally is also a computer genius. Garnish the broth with a male journalist who is good looking, well tempered and so attractive that women actually throw themselves at him. Procure a few villains from central casting - an Armani - suited financial highflyer and a company CEO. And as this is not yet spicy enough add some incest - father with daughter and brother with sister. I nearly forgot - yes, there are the ultimate stock villains also lurking in the background, Nazis. Then stirr the whole mix and you get 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.<br />It is actually an enjoyable read, well paced and not too fast paced. Well suited for a few hours on an airplane or a long read at the beach. It is actually well written and the author takes his time to be descriptive, uses descriptions of mundane things to deliberately slow down the pace of the book, which is a welcome respite from the breathlessnes of much modern crime fiction. And if you love cliche and familiarity you will be served well by this book.
B004624N6K|5.0|This is not Donde Estan Los Ladrones or She Wolf.... Oral Fixation or Laundry Service.  And certainly not Pies Descalzos.  This is a new era in Shakira's life and with a new era comes changes in her persona and her music.  We have to understand that Shakira's past albums will never be repeated and it is foolish to yearn for her to do a \\"Part 2\\" of something that is over and done.  True fans should learn to appreciate what Shakira is doing.  Whether it is experimenting with Pop, Dance, Electronic, Hip Hop or Latin music.  I personally have enjoyed & embraced every single one of Shakira's albums.  Yes, some are stronger than others but they all hold a special place in my life.  That being said, I would like to begin my review of Sale El Sol.    I have to say that I am very impressed with this new album.  I enjoyed this album since my very first listen.  As many other reviewers have stated, Shakira does return to some of her previous roots but at the same time offers something very fresh and new.  This album has to be Shakira's most experimental as she explores different genres to bring us a good blend of music.  The title track, Sale El Sol, explains that there is hope after our moments of sorrow and that after the storm, the sun comes out.  Antes De Las Seis channels the mellow songs featured on Ladrones/Fixation and talks about a person who is being vulnerable and giving their all only to be shun by the other person.    The album also features some fantastic dance songs which are absolutely infectious and impossible not to dance along to.  Loca, Addicted To You, Gordita, and Rabiosa are very fast paced and full of energy.  Shakira teases with El Cata, Calle 13, and Pitbull to bring a fun filled atmosphere to the album.  These songs are meant to make the listener feel as if they were on the dance floor in the way La Tortura, Loba, and Ojos Asi previously did.    Shakira continues to demonstrates that she has a beautiful voice and is able to convey such emotion in songs such as Lo Que Mas where she sings about making the difficult decision to move on from a broken relationship.  Devocion and Tu Boca feature a very edgy sound and loud vocals by Shakira which were evident in her Ladrones album while Mariposas brings some of the style that she displayed in Laundry Service.    Sale El Sol also contains remixed versions of Waka Waka and a wonderful cover of the XX's, Islands.  Shakira's version has a faster pace and sounds more uplifting than the original.    This album serves as a great summary of the previous albums she has done in the past.  Rather than creating a sequel, she borrows elements from past albums to create Sale El Sol.  This album has a little bit of everything and doesn't fail to please the listener.  Whether you're a die hard fan or a new listener, you will be able to enjoy this album and appreciate the effort that Shakira put into the album.      Sale El Sol is a beautiful set of songs that reminds us how diverse Shakira is.  She is not afraid to explore different musical styles and this album is a perfect example.  Shakira demonstrates that she will not settle with only one style and will continue to challenge herself to explore other areas.  No matter what the next album will bring, Shakira will continue to shine...

0765326353|5.0|This book is about 1000 pages, and past about page 200 I couldn't put it down.  I read the last two-thirds of this book in about a day and a half.  It is really good; the characters are well developed, convincing, and like-able, the magic is unusual and mysterious, and the world is very interesting and not your typical fantasy world.  It reminds me a lot of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series, which I thought was also excellent.
B003X8597A|5.0|Rienzi! Where do you start. I have the complete Schott Vocal Score to this music drama of Wagner's and you should see the sanctioned cuts he has made through it. One wonders why he actually wrote it so long in the first place. I believe that the first ever production took place over two (2) nights.  As a staunch Wagnerian, I would gladly sit through the 6 odd hours of Rienzi, as it contains some of Wagner's most lyrical music.  This is the only music drama that Wagner never ever wanted to be performed at Bayreuth, it had to be performed elsewhere. No reason was given.   Will we ever get a COMPLETE studio recording of this wonderful music drama.  (I use the term `Music Drama\\" as Wagner's works are not Operas, they are Music dramas, even he refers to them as such.) I doubt it.  Back to this production from Deutsche Oper, Berlin:  I HATE modern stagings of Wagner. The production does nothing for me at all. It might as well be a completely different music drama. Nothing like what Wagner had in mind when he wrote it. However: the singing is brilliant and the cast exceptional. Torsten Kerl makes a wonderful  Rienzi, Camilla Nyland is excellent as Irene and Kate Aldrich does justice to the role of Adriano Collono. The orchestra and chorus are under the baton of Sebasitan Lang-Leesing (our very own Chief conductor of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra). One of my many complaints is that you never see the orchestra and the conduction is not included in the curtain calls.  The sound quality is exceptional. But sadly the production didn't cut it for me. The cost to do these weird productions is just as much as a traditional one, so why do it. I though the idea was to draw people to the theatre, NOT drive them away with these STUPID childish productions.   I turn the TV OFF and just listen to the music, that's how I cope with this production. It's much better that way as there really in nothing to see. You might enjoy it, but I didn't and make no apology about it.

From experience, some cases are so slim it is hard to take your camera out quickly, but that will not happen with this case.<br /><br />The belt loop and strap offers different ways of carrying the case.

0385732554|5.0|\\"The Giver\\" is one of the most provocative and thoughtful books that has an intriguing story line as well. Right from the first sentences, readers meet Jonas, a 13 year old boy, who's thoughts and observations sound very natural and familiar, like somebody you already know and care for.<br /><br />Page by page, a new world that is set in some distant future unfolds with its \\"dangerous simplicity\\". The wrong and right is not spelled out in the beginning of the book, so the reader has a chance to follow Jonas and to see everything and to decide for themselves. Jonas observations add up to questions, and he starts to see everything a bit differently, he starts to question himself if everything around him is exactly as it seems.<br /><br />Further, the story flows into a beautiful climax - Jonas meets the Giver - a person who has an ability to \\"see beyond\\", the ability that Jonas himself has as well and was chosen to develop it further as Giver's student. The Giver \\"gives\\" Jonas all kind of feelings and memories that humanity has accumulated but denied to burden themselves with. Instead, it was up to one person to know all there is to know and to \\"shelter\\" everyone else from it. But Jonas knows too much now, and he decides to take action - something that no one have ever succeeded at in the community - he decides to flee in search of other, \\"real\\" way of living.<br /><br />The book ends at even more provoking and intense note. But Jonas knows the truth now, and he is free to choose for himself. He is free to feel all there is to feel - excitement and pain equally...<br /><br />Julia Shpak<br />Author of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\". Available on Amazon.

0316069485|5.0|I like all of Michael Connelly's books and in the past I have had a special fondness for his standalones, but The Reversal may well be his best ever.  The premise: Lawyer Mickey Haller has been asked by the D.A. to prosecute a case in which the previously-guilty perp's case has been reversed.  The case is more than two decades old and Mickey has concerns.  He's always been on the defense side of the aisle and prosecuting is alien to all of his instincts.  Moreover, he wonders if the D.A. is dodging the case and setting Mickey up for some great fall.  He agrees to take the case but only if he can have sufficient independence to do things his way and only if he can appoint his own team.  Mickey wants his ex-wife Maggie to be his #2 and he wants his half-brother Harry Bosch to be his investigator.<br /><br />The case is fairly simple.  A young girl, dressed up for church, was abducted and found dead in a dumpster shortly thereafter.  There is some DNA on her dress which doesn't match the prime suspect's, but there are several strands of her hair found in his truck.  He was at the scene and he was familiar with the location of the dumpster in which her body was found.  An eyeball witness (the little girl's older sister) identified him as her abductor.  Since then, however, she has led a dysfunctional life of drink, drugs and bad men and the defense team intends to challenge the accuracy of her memory.<br /><br />The plot is not convoluted and endlessly complex; it is, instead, a very close examination of a limited number of facts.  It is very much like a `Prime Suspect' episode, but with dual protagonists.  It is also a superb courtroom drama.  For those who love such books and relish the writings of Steve Martini, we now have Michael Connelly working that turf (and not a minute too soon, as Steve Martini is now writing suspense/espionage books).<br /><br />The Reversal is Mickey's novel more than Harry's, though Connelly cuts between the two of them in alternating chapters.  Mickey's sections are told in the first person, Harry's in the third-person/omniscient.  The architectonics of the plot are very, very impressive and the courtroom lore/strategizing/maneuvering are delicious.  Connelly is writing more like a lawyer than a journalist.  The characters are interesting, particularly the smarmy, British defense attorney and Maggie `McFierce' McPherson, Mickey's ex.  The witnesses all speak in their own unique voices and the judge is precisely the sort you would choose to adjudicate your own case if you were accused of murder.<br /><br />This is very impressive work.  Un-put-downable.  Perhaps the book of the Fall, though the new Lee Child and Dennis Lehane are looming on the horizon.<br /><br />Highly recommended.are told in the first person, Harry's in the third-person/omniscient.

B0000041DF|2.0|I am a real Rachmaninov fan.  Few composers receive as large a share of my musical appreciation as Rachmaninov.  His music is full of a tremendous power and passion, combined with that wondrous, ever-present melancholy.  And out of his creative output, his 3rd Piano Concerto is almost certainly near the top of the list of his greatest compositions.  It's overflowing with sheer melodic strength and a structural strength that puts it above, in some respects, the more popular 2nd Concerto.<br /><br />How does Argerich do in delivering this obvious masterpiece?  Well, I personally don't feel that she does a satisfying job.  Why?  Well, there are, as I said earlier, two aspects that characterize Rachmaninov as a composer: passion and melancholy.  Argerich gives a rather violent approach to this music that certainly could be considered passionate.  But there is a side to Rachmaninov that she doesn't touch - resignation and retrospection.  While the listener is sure to go away feeling excited, one will not go away feeling like they are on the verge of a life-changing experience.<br /><br />Let me explain in more detail.  For me, Rachmaninov's music is overflowing with so much obvious sentiment and emotion that the performer does not need to try to bring excessive emotion out of the music - it's already there.  Think of Rachmaninov as a person.  Was he outwardly emotional?  No, he wasn't.  Did he desire that his music be played with hysteria and in-your-face excitement?  I'm not convinced.  I think the performer should unveil the wonderful emotion in a careful, thought-provoking way while avoiding any exaggeration.<br /><br />The Rachmaninov that Argerich attempts to portray is full of the very hysteria I think Rachmaninov would despise.  She attempts to play this concerto at a break-neck speed.  She can't afford the racing tempo; there are wrong notes literally right and left.  Her tone sounds harsh and almost pounding.  One would hope that in the quieter, lyrical moments she would relax and give us beauty.  But she doesn't.  One almost wants to tap her on the shoulder and let her know that her life isn't at stake.  Her partner Chailly on the podium doesn't add much good to the situation.  He certainly has a tough job on his hands, as Argerich has a tough time sticking with his tempo.  He doesn't do anything appalling or offensive, but he doesn't pull anything all that remarkable from the Berlin Radio Symphony.  Argerich certainly overpowers him.  I can't help but wonder if he was inwardly frustrated by the whole affair.<br /><br />Why have so many people been so pleased with this album?  No doubt you are thinking, \\"Well, maybe this guy has some valid points.  But why have so many other people been so impressed?\\"  Good question.  There are a few answers to this question.  First of all, I don't think it is possible to ruin Rachmaninov.  As wrong as I think Argerich is, the music is not totally spoilt.  Secondly, some people have not had the joy of listening to the types of performances I have and they don't have anything to compare this recording to.  Thirdly, some people will still prefer to have their Rachmaninov done with the hysteria Argerich delivers, even after hearing the performances I recommend.  While I don't appreciate this recording and I can't make myself enjoy it, I don't consider those inferior who are willing to look past its weaknesses and enjoy it.<br /><br />If you want to hear Rachmaninov done in a more reflective, thoughtful way, I would strongly recommend Leif Ove Andsnes' recording of the Concerto, with Antonio Pappano and the LSO, that came out in October of 2010 - [[ASIN:B003Z0BSU8 Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos Nos. 3 & 4]].  Andsnes' technique is absolutely flawless.  Listening to his recording is for me a life changing experience.  He unleashes powerful excitement without out sounding harsh and he gives tender, affectionate lyricism.  One moment the listener will be on the edge of his seat; the next he will be fighting the tears.  There are many other great pianists who have recorded this masterpiece, besides Andsnes and Argerich that you may also want to check out.  Ashkenazy, Hough, Kissin, among many others, have recorded this concerto.<br /><br />In closing, I would recommend this recording to those who are still interested and willing to put up with its shortcomings.  This recording should also belong in the collection of Classical music connoisseurs, as it is certainly a radical, controversial one.  But for the average listener, I would recommend looking elsewhere for a satisfying performance of this touching concerto.many other great pianists who have recorded this masterpiece, besides Andsnes and Argerich that you may also want to check out.

0385738757|5.0|The Scorch Trials picks up right where The Maze Runner left off and it certainly starts with a bang. James Dashner incredibly makes this installment even better than the first. There is non-stop action and unexpected twists and turns in every single chapter. Thomas is once again thrown into this crazy environment, fighting for his life, as well as the lives of his friends.<br /><br />WICKED is more involved in this one, but we still don't really know much about them. Is WICKED good or is WICKED bad? That really is the question to ask throughout this entire book. Dashner really made me question everything and everyone. Like Thomas, I wasn't sure what to believe.<br /><br />Be prepared for more than a little creepy action going on because the Cranks sure are terrifying. Dashner vividly describes the pure nastiness that exudes from the zombie-like creatures. The short chapters kept me completely enamored with the story. It was more than a little difficult to put the book down because things just keep on happening. Whenever the action seemed to slow, Dashner did something that had my jaw hanging open. I frequently found myself asking what? How? Why? Why? Why?<br /><br />Nothing is what it appears in this book and Dashner perfectly captures Thomas' confusion, his anger, his fear, his every emotion about being thrown into this hellish world and trying to come out of it alive and relatively unscathed. His dreams about his memories were one of my favorite aspects about the book and the tiny clues they offered made me want more and more.<br /><br />The Scorch Trials is a jaw-dropping thriller filled with the most insane and unexpected twists. Dashner will blow your mind with everything that WICKED puts the Gladers through and for every question raised, we get the teeniest insight into what is really going on. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and have you begging for the final installment.<br /><br />Opening line: She spoke to him before the world fell apart. ~ pg. 1<br /><br />Favorite line(s): He didn't care about the others anymore.

0525951652|1.0|I did not read this book expecting something good (I read it because I had to, long story); so the book did have some room to rise above my expectations. It didn't. It so didn't.     Follett is a typical Master-of-the-Thriller kind of writer, on par with the likes of Lee Child and Dan Brown; that is to say, a hack with an incredibly limited set of literary skills. This includes even vocabulary, which, let me tell you, does NOT bode well for a 1000-page \\"epic\\". I can't count the times a character was \\"elated\\", or \\"stared in disbelief\\" at something, and these are just two of the paint-by-numbers, all-purpose, dead-in-the-water expressions that are supposed to mark for us some character's reaction to something. The whole thing reads more like the first draft of a script, so poorly is it written, and I'm sure Mr. Follett had the TV or film rights in mind while writing. Because on the level of style, this is NOT a literary text.     As to incidents and characters, it is a parade of cliches, hollow melodrama and outright boredom. The book is padded unto absurdity with pointless \\"introspection\\", characters reiterating their own thoughts every other page, events recapped in long and utterly superfluous paragraphs. The book could've been at least two times as short and tell the same story.     And then there is Follett's apparent idiotic assumption that a historical novel, in order to be a \\"good\\" historical novel, should read like a History textbook or an encyclopedia half the time. About 80% ot the historical information in the book is infodumped in the lamest possible way, with the poor characters having pointless conversations about this or that economical or sociological detail in scenes that usually have nothing to do with progressing the plot or giving us an insight into those characters - and of course it does nothing to build atmosphere either, since historical novels gain their punch from making history come alive; this CANNOT happen when a bunch of cardboard cutouts TALK ABOUT history, while they sit at tables. Not to mention that in order to write a good historical novel, you DON'T NEED the amount of information that this book struggles under. Hilary Mantel managed to write a brilliant novel and win a Booker without so much as a paragraph of infodumping about Britain's state under Henry VIII in the first 100 pages of Wolf Hall (that's where I'm at right now).     I get that this meaninglessly elaborated, poorly written story COULD provide a kind of immersion by virtue of its sheer bulk, but no matter if you like it or not, I wouldn't call Fall of Giants a literary experience by any stretch of the imagination. In that last respect, it fails utterly.

This book moved rather slowly for me and I was bored at times reading it.  Just when the book started to move along and get my attention the author did a cop out in the writing.

This is NOT a book on HTML, but on the new things in HTML5; don't expect a \\"how to build a website\\" primer here!    The book starts off with a brief history of HTML, then dives in to the new features. Chapter two is all about detecting which features of HTML5 the user's browser supports; this will be particularly important for the next few years as compatibility improves. Chapter 3 discusses the new semantic elements and markup; this is probably my favorite part of HTML5 as it makes it much easier to just type everything by hand without making a mistake.     The next few chapters discuss using the canvas tag (to draw on the screen) and the new video and audio elements, followed by the geolocation options. As someone who hasn't done much with HTML forms lately (but needs to) I really enjoyed chapter 9, which shows the new form elements and discusses how they degrade gracefully on older browsers. I wasn't that interested in the final chapter, on microdata, but it's good to know it's out there.    Overall, I enjoyed the book; it's a quick read and a good introduction to what's available; while I'm more likely to Google a particular element for more information, at least now I know what's out there.    Disclosure: I received a free review copy of this book; my full review is available at vulcanears.com.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Worth every penny! The quality is just superb. The extras are terrific and the commentary by Stephen Rebello is illuminating and erudite. Thank you for getting this right!
030726999X|5.0|Mr. Larsson's idea of descriptive writing is a laundry list of food the character is eating; or sometimes a laundry list of the laundry they are wearing. You can expect to read this, \\"He grabbed a sandwich of [blah-blah-blah], a cup of coffee [or latte or beer] and sat down to read [or talk or whatever].\\" Also, all of the women -- Oh, everyone, actually -- is wearing a pair of dark slacks, a white shirt and a gray jacket, not always in that order. Descriptions of individuals' looks were the same. About 5 words covered it: color of hair, shape of face, general size. He also goes on at seemingly excessive length about political issues, although they eventually tie in to the story. These negatives definitely seemed to increase with each book in the series.<br /><br />Okay, so the man cannot or did not bother fussing over descriptions. But by Jiminy, he sure can tell a story! If you can overlook the short shrift he gives to descriptions, and the lengthy and tedious political histories, the story itself is utterly compelling, exciting, surprising, and well worth the price of the book, this one and the earlier two.<br /><br />That said, it is a tragedy that we have lost this author so early. May he rest in peace. But -- if the New Agers are right -- perhaps he is working on his next novel, and will \\"channel\\" it through some very lucky (and also talented) earthbound individual. Just a thought. [[ASIN:0978543513 Dear Dr. Roth: Letters To My Website]]
0385738757|5.0|If you enjoyed the first book, you will certainly enjoy this book as well.  There are constant twists and turns in the story which makes it very hard to predict the outcomes.  If you didn't like the first book then most likely you won't want to read this book.  This book was exciting from start to finish! I am anxiously waiting for the final book to come out next year.   There is more violence and deaths in this book so be prepared for that, especially if you have young readers in your household.
B0012OVEJO|5.0|Mere hours after Polish record label Metal Mind Productions announced that it was releasing a limited edition 5-CD box set containing legendary Florida progressive power metal band Crimson Glory's complete catalogue, founding member and lead guitarist Jon Drenning made the following announcement:    \\"Crimson Glory does not recognize nor sanction the new CD releases or box-sets made by Metal Mind Records (Poland). They are producing our CDs illegally and thus have ZERO rights to market, promote, advertise, release, distribute or sell any of our material; therefore they have ZERO rights to make any profit from our image, likeness or music.\\"    This has been an ongoing battle between Crimson Glory and Metal Mind ever since Roadrunner Records took yet another step in blatantly disregarding the band's legal requests to cease and desist all involvement with Crimson Glory by illegally selling the rights (which they did not possess) to the Polish record company in 2007. It is a glaring example of what a shambles the music industry has become, and it is crucial to the band that their fans recognize the reality of the situation: Since Roadrunner's involvement with Crimson Glory nearly 20 years ago, not a single cent generated from the production, sale, or publishing of ANY Crimson Glory record has been returned to the band.    \\"We have become disenfranchised from our own music,\\" says Drenning, \\"with everybody making a profit from our efforts but us! As a group of hard-working dedicated musicians who have now given 25 years of our lives and hearts to this band and this music, it is beyond heart-breaking to watch these companies deliberately break the law and profit from selfish and downright criminal actions. This music is our passion; creating each record has been a labor of love, and what's happening to us and our music right now is frustrating and insulting.\\"    Drenning adds, \\"We wish to make it perfectly clear to our friends and fans out there, all over the world, that these and any other albums or releases are not being produced or distributed with our permission, and that the money they wish to spend on our records is money that we as a band have earned but will never see until this matter is properly resolved. While we appreciate our fans wanting to purchase our material, it's imperative that everyone out there recognizes that in doing so, they are only helping to make a criminal richer. In the meantime, Crimson Glory is presently negotiating with other labels regarding the remastering, re-releasing and future distribution of all of our material, and anything to do with the band regarding album releases, tour dates, promotional material etc will be shared via official press releases and the Crimson Glory Myspace and Facebook pages ONLY.\\"    Credit for story: Mark Morton at [...]    As the Reviewer I would like to add: \\"in my humble opinion, Crimson Glory's debut is the closest the prog-metal genre ever got to perfection.  Absolute must-have if you love early Maiden sound (more melodic) with, again... my humble opinion, a supreme vocal talent to the mighty Bruce Dickinson himself! Midnight (John Patrick McDonald, who has since tragically passed away), expressed more emotion singing than most people can feel.\\"     Also, check out their second album, [[ASIN:B0012OVEJY Transcendence]], phenomenal.
B0040QYROK|5.0|No, the Blu-Ray is not released yet.  But this review is written in rabid fascination and anticipation for the release.  I have the earlier \\"completion\\" and it was the best they could do at the time.  But now this new release will give us crisper images and a lot more film.  They've been searching for quite a while for the lost footage.  Maybe it's not all there, but a lot of it is.  The other reviews are of the earlier releases, and many of those are less than clear.  I don't even own a Blu-Ray player yet, but the newer version demands the best I can give, too.
0061353248|2.0|Ironically for Dr. Ariely, who writes at lengths about his often very dull social experiments, he doesn't do much to avoid the stereotype of an academic professor who thinks he has the world figured out. While the author has been busy studying other people's irrationality, he doesn't make too much effort to try to overcome his own.     I do not mean to dismiss this entire book as there are some interesting sections. Perhaps the first couple of chapters are worth a quick read, but I do not recommend spending too much time on it. The writing is too dull to be for the pop audience, and it is far too lacking in careful notation of experimental methods and results to be for the science audience. I suppose that if you were to memorize some of the chapters, and agree with his conclusion, then it would make for some interesting conversation at parties to give you some air of being intellectual.    All that aside, what is most aggravating is that certain political and social inclinations of Dr. Ariely start becoming transparent by the rather large leaps he makes in conclusions from the data he has collected. At times it appears that he had a certain conclusion about the how-and-why of people's behavior, how it could be controlled, and then he went about designing experiments around this construct to confirm his bias - with university students as his primarily guinea pigs. Once the experiment conveniently fits the conclusion from this very unrepresentative sample, he then applies it to the world at large. At this point he want to suggest to you whether band-aid should be pulled-off fast or slow, how to control your sexuality, why the government should force people save certain percent of their earning, and in a restaurant you should order your food first before everyone else does.     I have an idea for a book myself: Predictably Ignorant, The Academic Gurus That Know Little About the Real World
B000002USP|4.0|This Pet Shop Boys album is produced excellently and recorded amazingly. The vocals are high and clear. The melodies are easy to recognize and very popular. The theme of unrequieted young love is sad and confusing, but very deep and emotional. The subject matter is dangerously romantic, and some what ambiguous. Overall an engaging disc with an intense pop beat.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Purchased this after having watched the LIFE DVD (also excellent), having seen it advertised on there.  Such an incredible way to \\"travel\\" and see God's awesome creation, as filmed by extremely talented and hardworking camera-crews.  We've only had time to watch the 1st disc so far, and think it was worth the money.

1601252463|5.0|Just when I thought it couldn't get better, Piazo puts out the advanced players guide. Several new classes ( that eliminates the need to min max existing classes) , prestige classes and tons of custom options that are very easy to use , to tailor your character to fit any role or player. What's most impressive to me is how every class now really stands out.   A must have if you play pathfinder and want a little more variety out of your game.
0312370849|4.0|Ms. de Rosnay has given the world not only a history lesson but a book well worth reading for its high quality prose and plot line. As an author, I am always on the hunt for well written books that I cannot put down. Sarah's Key more than qualifies. Though I thought the story riveting -- and unlike other reviewers I found both Julia's and Sarah's storylines compelling -- there was one important question I kept coming back to again and again. Knowing what they knew, why did Sarah's parents allow their four-year-old son to be left behind? I know this is a work of fiction, but had it been me, I would have made sure my famly was all together at the time of arrest. The parents had heard the rumors -- they knew what was awaiting them. Had Ms. de Rosnay given us a more in-depth reason for why Sarah's mother and father allowed her to lock her little brother in the cupboard, I would have rated the book five stars.

142311339X|5.0|Rick Riordan has crafted yet another fantastic read that made this 23 year old graduate student completely incapable of doing anything else until I finished the book. I know some people won't like the addition of the \\"Roman\\" aspect, but I say well done sir. As a massive mythology nut, I wondered throughout the first series why there wasn't any acknowledgment of the gods' dual personalities (Greek/Roman). Glad to see it incorporated in the new series. Can't wait to read the next one!
1601251831|5.0|I have run campaigns and adventures in many systems. Never have I seen such a well planed out reference book.<br />Piazo has eliminated many distracting bits of info, and organized this reference so it can be used on the fly. The bestiary lays out a strong universal monster template with , easy to read symbols, offense and defense stats and the basics of the beast behavior and proper use.<br />I use to have to have a mountain of index cards, now I just flip open the book and run on the fly. The bestiary is a must have companion to the pathfinder core rule book.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|Leave it to Disney to \\"throw some sex and money at it\\" and hope for the best.    Persephone is portrade as a prostitute, cleavage and sex referenced everywhere.   How sad.  I had heard they were good books, but have no desire to read them now.
0525951652|2.0|I have read a lot of Ken Follett's work.  This was the poorest.  The characters were weak, with cookie cutter personalities.  They stayed the same throughout the book, no \\"development\\", totally predictable.  I was very disappointed with this book.
1601251505|5.0|One of my friends came to game night with a copy of this book, after passing the book around , it became clear just how good the pathfinder rule set was. This beefy book is packed to the gills with improvements to the 3.5 system.<br />If you are a fan of the d&d 3.5 I strongly urge you to check this book out. Many of the WOC staff that supported the 3.5 rule set have had a hand in the book.<br />Overall pathfinder has breathed new life into our game sessions. Piazo has a firm grip on their target audience and has simplified a number of troubled areas of the 3.5 game with out dumbing anything down. The pathfinder book has eliminated many of the penalties and grey areas and replaced them with a elegant and simple to understand bag of goodies.<br />Pathfinder is the certified next of kin to the WOC 3.5 and a real must have for the serious gamer.
0439023513|2.0|The first two books are decent reading.  If you can make it past the first 70 pages of the book, this one finally moves along.    However, it is extremely violent.    The story, characters, and plot do not accurately follow with the previous two books; it is disappointing and leaves you with an \\"ugh\\" feeling because it simply leaves out the human part of humanity.

The second season has everything you want from a series of fantasy/action. I have no idea why those !@@#$^%$&%*^)**(&*% (you can add whatever you want) executives decided to cancel this superb series.

B000L3CHC0|5.0|He was interested in a more prestigious brand, with the median price. I was in doubt between Victorinox and Tissot. When the watch arrived at my residence (Brazil), I was very impressed with the beauty and elegance. We know that there are several vendors selling fake Tissot on the Internet, but did comparative tests (sapphire display, dimensions of the case and operation of the chronograph, and a quality print of the details of the dial). Great buy, I recommend to everyone!

B0019K06WM|5.0|This is in my top 3 Desert Island albums. I cannot say enough about this Gem. This album is what is known as, MASTERPIECE ! The talent of these two men and the music contained, far exceeds what one may have imagined from past endeavors. Sorry folks, but this album takes the cake of everything put out by CSNY and CSN combined. A must OWN !
B003EYVXYG|2.0|The title \\"Survival of the Dead\\" gets it all wrong. I don't think that the Romero series will survive after this weak movie! Lousy acting (annoying stereotypes throughout), lame storytelling (there's no suspense at all, not even one single shock moment) and pretty bad make-up and gore effects. Mr. Romero definitely did a lot better in the past!
1416550534|5.0|This book did start out pretty slow for me.  I would read 2-3 pages before bed and get super sleepy.  But once I got about half way through the book I could NOT put it down.  The ending is fabulous.  I thought the author's choice of words was alittle hard to read at times.  Not just normal every day talk but words I rarely ever hear....  But I still highly recommend this book to my friends.  This author is a great story teller and you really get to know each character.  I thought I knew what would happen in the end and was suprised and pleased with the twists and turns this author makes in this book.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|For those of you who are sick to death of the philosophically mid-gray tone of commentary on social issues in our Western democracies. For those who are sick of fudge-factor, smeared insights and a cacophony of mis-representations through a myriad of nuances, ignorance and obvious mis-representations by vested interest groups...........then this is a book for YOU.  I haven't read such pure logical thought on this subject - ever.  (The purity of thought in this book is similar to the purity of thought in  \\"Iron on My Mind\\" by Dave Draper on the benefits of weight training -  totally focussed.)  The author goes from Qur'an and aHadith text to classical interpretation, to historical event and then to modern interpretations and outcomes and events based on historical precedence........ BEAUTIFUL. The author shows that the philosophy of Jihad is not just an event here and there but a 1400 year process still continuing today. For those who think a little about the future of our multicultural societies then this is riveting reading. For those who think about the changing demographics in our societies due to immigration from whatever, then this is for you. For those who think about the weaknesses of our democratic systems and how the traditions of our communities can be manipulated towards a different future, then this is a book for you. This is a can't put down book.
0439023513|5.0|This is an incredible book and the author chose a perfect way to end the series. Although filled with more despair, hardships, brutality and deception than one human being can take, the twist at the end was a welcome surprise and made it all worthwhile.  As I closed the book I had a smile on my face and thought to myself  \\"Katniss is my hero!\\"
B00005JKDR|4.0|If, like me, you find yourself wondering what makes the big guys in the entertainment industry so big, you've come to the right review.  We all know Pixar has established itself as the premiere computer generated feature film studio, but as if gems like the Toy Stories aren't proof enough of their supremacy, enter Monsters Inc.  Nine years old already, this one manages to push all of the right buttons of what a CG feature film could and should be while managing to appeal to viewers of all ages.<br /><br />Reaching the top of a given industry can be serendipitous, sure but this one here represents proof of the gradual climbing process that separates this studio from the others.<br /><br />Monsters Inc., for the two or three human beings on earth who have yet to see it, follows James P \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan (John Goodman), a big blue furry monster and his friend and coworker Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a smaller green Cyclops, who happen to work at the power company within the city of Monstropolis: Monsters Inc.<br /><br />Subscribers to the theory that monsters work at the utility companies in our own world will be glad to know that in Monstropolis, energy is derived not from the burning of coal or turning of turbines but by refining human screams, which are collected in steel canisters.<br /><br />The monsters travel through doors linked to those in children's' bedrooms in our world and do their best to scare said kids into a nice shriek of terror. Sulley just so happens to be the number one scream-generator at Monsters, Inc. despite intense rivalry from the #2 guy, Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi). Meanwhile poor Mike, a member of the preparation team, handles Sulley's paperwork, arranges doors and changes his collecting cylinders.  It turns out only the biggest, scariest and most elite employees have what it takes to become scarers.<br /><br />Sulley and Mike's careers at Monsters, Inc. and the very welfare of Monstropolis are in jeopardy once Sulley accidentally lets a human child into the monster.  It turns out that while humans are conditioned to fear monsters, so too are monsters trained to be terrified of human children.<br /><br />What we have here basically is a layered parody of blue-collar life as the catalyst to deliver an inversed look at the myths all kids can relate with.  The plot structure is impeccably tight with enough levels of amusement to appeal (classily) to just about anyone who encounters it.<br /><br />I'm personally partial to all of the instances where an oblivious Mike Wazowski, a role seemingly custom made for Billy Crystal, narrowly avoids fame but is no less enthusiastic about it.<br /><br />Taking in this film, even a decade after its initial release, it becomes apparent that Pixar's charm is actually derived from some of the simplest ideas imaginable.  In fact most other animated films suddenly look way overcomplicated by comparison.  The visuals have since been outdone in terns of complexity, color, and texturing yet few releases since can claim having delivered such a well-rounded package.<br /><br />Additionally a lively Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX mix done up by a team at Skywalker Sound. It's as active, and vibrant as the visuals! As a bonus Randy Newman's charming score comes through with spectacular clarity.<br /><br />In all, it had been nearly a decade since my last visit to Monsters Inc. and as a result of a recent mission to visit/ review as many computer generated features as possible, purchased the 2-disc DVD set being reviewed here. Conclusion: Pixar's path to supremacy is lined with some of the finer examples of the genre.ns out that while humans are conditioned to fear monsters, so too are monsters trained to be terrified of human children.

0439023491|4.0|Sometimes I struggle with middle books as they are usually filler material you must read to get to the good stuff.  However, this one is a little different.  Although not as captivating as Hunger Games, Catching Fire is necessary.  It gave the reader more time to understand the characters and to develop Peeta and Katniss' feelings for one another.  When the Quarter Qwell was introduced I found myself saying \\"as if, couldn't she think of an original idea?\\" but at the end I realized how much I appreciated it because it was necessary to the development of Peeta and Katniss' relationship which is critical for Mockingjay.
0743298039|3.0|I liked this book, but normally I can read a 500+ book in a day  or two, it took me several days to read this and I could easily put it down. It is good writing, a gothic tale, there is mystery, angst, the old house, creepy people, etc.... but I have read much better gothics. So that is why I only rated 3 stars
0439023521|5.0|Although marketed to teens I found this book (and series) to be appropriate for all ages.  In fact, there are many situations that may be more suitable for a mature audience and hard for young people:  brutal murder, starvation, a profoundly corrupt government and its abuse of power, just to name a few.  I am a 38 year old professional and mom of two babies and I was hooked almost immediately.  I truly cared for these characters and their ability to overcome hardships without completely losing their mind.  A must read.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|I recieved my copy of 'The original mono recordings' earlier today.  The 'printed inner sleeves' feature was of importance to me because of the promised attention to detail of the original vinyl packaging.  Unfortunately, the only disk that has this type of printed inner sleeve is the first disc 'Bob Dylan'.  Was this an error on the manufacturer's part as a result of making the set release date?  If so, Is there ANY way to obtain the correct inner sleeves?  Very disapointed.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is my first automatic watch.  I was looking for a military-style watch and was drawn to the green dial.  It looks better in person than on the computer (and it does look good on the computer).  Reading some of the other reviews about the accuracy had me a little concerned, but most discrepancies were in a range that I could deal with.  After one week of observation, my watch loses about 6 seconds per 24 hours.  I check it each day against the Naval Observatory Clock in Colorado.  It would seem from reading the other reviews that mine is the only one that runs slow as opposed to fast.  As for the odd one or two reviews about watches that stopped altogether... that's puzzling since my experience (so far), and that of most other buyers is very positive.  One review mentioned the audible sound of the autowind mechanism.  Mine is totally inaudible.  If that mechanism is touching the case at all, the watch should be returned immediately.  Which brings up the point of the clear, see-through back.  A gimmick?  Not so.  The inner workings are beautiful, and it's a great way to confirm whether or not the autowind mechanism is working properly.  As for water resistance?  Dude, give me a break!  If you want to go swimming with a watch, buy a diver's watch!  And would someone please tell me why in the heck anyone would want to take a shower with a watch on? I have a clock in my bathroom, I check the time when I get in the shower, I know about how long it takes me... is there a need to wear a watch in the shower?  Anyway, as far as resistance to water, it should be able to take the occasional splashing from hand washing, and maybe the occasional getting caught in the rain, but that's it.  I love this watch.  It's got a nice weight to it, and the size is perfect.  It's a little smaller than my Seiko Chronograph that I bought in 1997 (which I still wear) but it's not small, as some reviews seemed to indicate.  If you have a big wrist and favour big watches, it might seem small.  Get out a metric ruler, put it on your wrist and see what 38mm looks like, and then make the call.  The strap, for me is fine also, not small or thin.  It matches the watch.  If you want Quartz accuracy, uhh... buy a quartz watch.  If you like watching a sweep second hand move gracefully around the dial... buy this watch.  If you like looking at your watch more than you need to... buy this watch.  I'm trying to think of an excuse to buy the blue or black version of this watch.  All in all, I find it a very nice watch to look at, not obnoxious or tacky, and very legible.  Less than a hundred bucks, it's a steal!  I have 3 other running watches, and they're all sitting in a drawer right now feeling betrayed!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Absolutely stunning blu-ray of this great film. I somewhat lament the loss of data on the top and bottom (as this is the theatrical presentation, cropping the full frame). IMHO, the picture (particularly the shower scene) suffers a bit. Still a must-own though. More Hitchcock please!
1556438850|5.0|This is a great resource of yoga teachers and students. The book covers a good deal of information thoroughly. I really appreciate the authors efforts to provide unbiased book about yoga the history, philosophy, energies, etc. You can check out the table of contents for a list of subjects this book encompasses. As a Christian who practices yoga I really appreciate that this book does such a good job of remaining objective and not trying to \\"convert\\" the reader's to \\"yoga as a religion.\\" I am currently enrolled in a Yoga Alliance certified 200 hour teachers training out of 11 required books so far I like this one best.
0385342047|4.0|Your view of this book will depend to some extend on your perspective.  If you are looking for some lighthearted entertainment, then I would highly recommend this book.  Even then you need to be open-minded about young children and find them entertaining and delightful.<br /><br />I realize there are plenty of people who find no humor in the antics of a two year old shopaholic.  But to me the stories - although some stretch you imagination a bit - are a delightful escape.<br /><br />This book is one in a series of adventures of Becky and her addiction to shopping.  She gets into all sorts of problems trying to hide her addiction.  But now she has a two year old - Minnie and her daughter obviously got her shopping genes.<br /><br />This makes for more interesting stories and more problems for Becky.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Sophie Kinsella, you will probably find this an improvement over her previous books, approaching but not quite equaling the original which was such a hit.  It is a bit long and at times seems to lose its focus - shifting from Minnie to a big surprise party for Luke.<br /><br />It is meant to be entertaining and in my opinion it does that.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I never purchased earlier versions of this so I cannot comment on the quality of this vis-a-vis them.  I do know there are technical limitations to what can be done with kinescopes and aged tape. Those who think or want these things to look current may be missing the point. There are many, many of us who believe the world turned around on February 9, 1964 with this first opportunity for the masses to see The Beatles in action. (OK, they were on Paar and some other shows but rememeber, Sullivan's show was the cynosure,,,it was legitimcay; that's why - at least in this case - Epstein was brilliant)<br /><br />Moreso, look at what else was on these shows. How much would you pay for a DVD of Frank Gorshin or Two Ton Tessie O'Shea...or even Georgia Brown???? Sullivan brought vaudeville to TV and The Beatles changed that. From here on, Rock 'n' Roll became normal for family vieiwng. How many groups did we get to see after these performances. This was a tipping point.<br /><br />But besides that. Watch these four sets of performances - you can set the DVD to just show The Beatles. Watch the maturing in their performances across the three February shows and then see the quantum leap in how they are at that 1965 show. They had played Shea the month before; probably the first stadium concert ever. Notice also how much better the Sullivan showm techies handle the staging itself.<br /><br />This is historic stuff!

It works, it is a must have for anyone!!!  30 days I can't believe it...I didn't loose the weight it says but I can feel the difference in my body, clothes and activity...I bought this for all my friends for their birthdays!!!

0439023521|3.0|This book is a clever reworking of Mary Renault's \\"The King Must Die.\\" Renault created a very imaginative story line around Theseus and the Minotaur -- using the bull dancers from ancient Crete. Collins has taken that story line and set it in the future.
B003EYVY0E|4.0|I am generally happy with this item but was very baffled by the fact that the contents of disk 2 and 3 as listed on the inside cover were \\"switched\\"  The features on Disk 2 were actually switched with Disk 3, So all the features, tours and special games are actually on 2 whereas the documentaries and trailers (3) are on disk 3 as opposed to 2.  Mislabeled disk batch? Who knows, maybe this mixup, if limited to a specific number may turn this set into a collectors goldmine....
0345505387|1.0|I have never been so disappointed in anything in my life!!  I took the word \\"graphic\\" to mean that the story would be bloodthirsty etc because it was supposed to be the story told from Jamie's point of view.  It ended up being a lurid comic strip thing on shiny paper and the drawings were terrible in my opinion.  I suppose we all have a picture in our head about what Jamie and Claire might look like but this book ruined it for me.  I have shown this book to family and friends and they are all disappointed.  I know the author has a right to do what ever she wants with the characters but in my opinion I was  ted my money big time.  Sorry to be so negative but I had the date of release on my calendar and was really looking forward to the book.  Am I the only one?  I would be interested to hear other points of view.
B003YOZNBK|1.0|Why, oh why, did this film suck?  It had so much potential when brought up at last year's Comic-Con, but like 2005's 'Constantine' before it, the cool premise went ker-plunk.  I had an interest in JH when I first read a couple of '90s comic mini-series, which is where the supernatural parts got slipped in.  They were great.  This, on the other hand, should have been on cable or straight-to-video.  Yeesh!  Hold your nose and rent it once and wait for 'Cowboys And Aliens' in 2011 to hopefully get the stink out.  (And Constantine should have been a Brit.  Sorry Keanu.)
0553805371|5.0|There is only a paperback edition of this book on sale in Hong Kong, but I really love to have one in hardback, so I ordered it from Amazon and I am more than satisfied.  The book has many beautiful illustrations, readers would definitely enjoy them while reading the text.
193413712X|3.0|Marilynne Robinson, author of GILEAD, describes Pulitzer Prize winner TINKERS as  \\"truly remarkable,\\" and as conferring \\"the illusion of ghostly proximity to other human souls.\\"<br /><br />Robinson's book is about a minister, and there's one in TINKERS. I had trouble with both of them, namely the long descriptive, philosophical and sermonizing passages that I had to read twice or more to figure out what the heck the characters were trying to say. There just isn't a whole lot of plot.There are also long, monotonous descriptions of clock works, which really didn't tell me much about how a clock works. I guess there's also supposed to be a connection between making a clock and nature. There's a description of building a bird's nest, which seems to require the same amount of patience as fixing a clock. Paul Harding is really good at description, which might be why he employs it so much, but that's no reason to ignore plot.<br /><br />The book jumps back and forth between a grandfather (the minister), a father (a peddler or tinker) and the son, an antique clock repairman, who is dying on the first page of the book.<br /><br />Howard Crosby, the peddler, has epilepsy, and there was also mental problem with his father, the minister, although we never specifically find out what it is. All of this affects George: the lack of a father, the lack of money as a youth.<br /><br />Howard is probably the main character of the book as his epilepsy and amiable nature get him in all kinds of trouble, with his wife especially. I cared about Howard and worried about what would happen to him and wondered why he did certain things, some of which might be unforgivable to certain people.<br /><br />The ending is so ironic some might say author Paul Harding wrote it first and tried to make the rest of the book fit.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|For $17.99 i think this is a great value. You get the new 5.1 soundtrack and like 2 hours of extra documentaries. One is in HD the other isnt. Great quality video on the blu ray and it makes the whole thing more vivid and you can easily read things like the print on Marions newspaper etc. Perfect! Black and white looks very crisp in 1080p.
B003WMX3SY|5.0|I pre-ordered this case, When receving the case, found out missing parts, bad QC,  some mobo standoff and one HD side bar missing, I called Amazon, they offer to take it back,   but the case is fine except the missing part, so I tried calling Antec, I am glad I did, I could speak to a representative in reasonable short time, very helpful and courteous, and I received the missing parts in the next few days,   excellent Antec customer service,   unlike Thermaltake, I purchased a Armor+ case, one rubber feet missing upon deliver, tried to contact them, Thermaltake never replied, so my Armor+ case still sitting on 3 rubber feet, although Armor+ is a great case even one feet short, but Thermaltake's customer service sucks, if anything missing on their product, there is no remedy, except returning to Amazon, Amazon is the best in taking care of problem.   After missing parts problem resolved promptly, I am extremely satisfied with Antec LanBoy, as well as Skeleton I purchase previously,  Antec has great customer service, and is trustworthy!
B001G8XON0|4.0|Moulin Rouge looks and sounds fantastic in high definition. They have done a great job with the movie itself. The DTS soundtrack is amazing. I am thrilled to finally have this on blu ray.    My only complaint is about the extras. There is a lot of good stuff here, but many of my favorite extras from the 2 disc DVD set are missing - the multi angle extended dance numbers, the dance rehearsal footage and some of the best deleted/alternate scenes. The dance rehearsals in particular are a loss because you can see the full choreography for the Can Can, Like A Virgin and the Hindi dance, much of which was cut or not shown in the film. It's really fun to watch and a shame it's not included.     The rare footage that is included is presented in a small window with a decorative border. This is very annoying and distracting. I would much rather see it full screen, even if it is lower resolution.    Overall I still strongly recommend this disc for the gorgeous presentation of the film itself. Just be aware that some of the best extras are not included, so hang onto your 2 disc DVD set, or seek out a used copy.
B00003CXB4|5.0|So, it's been a very long time since I've seen this movie, though I think the DVD quality is better and, well, it's the Lion King. As with all the Disney classics, I loved it as a child and can't wait to share with all the kids who have yet to see it.
B003PIUC02|5.0|As the title of my review implies, Spartacus: Blood and Sand is one of the best original series that I have seen in years, something that for the first time in quite awhile I really got into and was captivated by. Before I get into the review, I will throw out a caution - if you're really turned off by lots of graphic violence, nudity and strong sexual content then this is NOT for you as there is quite a lot of that content. That being said, fortunately that is not all there is to the series and even that aspect is blended very artsitically into the series as a whole.    The series follows a man who's true name we do not know but to whom his colleagues and commanders refer to as Spartacus after a Threcian king that apparently conquered a large amount of enemies with a small force. This name is bestowed upon him after his first showing in a Gladiator colliseum after he defeats a number of trained gladiators single handedly. The character Spartacus begins as a Threcian warrior who agrees to join forces with the main Roman army to fight back enemy forces near his territory. Unfortunately for him, his goals in protecting his family and kinsmen do not meet with the goals of the Roman commander and he comes to be an outlaw captured and sent to the gladiator arena to die. Obviously he does not die so easily or else there wouldn't be much of a series.    Some might compare this beginning of the plot to the movie Gladiator and I will say that it is somewhat similar; but with enough dissimilarity to adaquetly distinguish itself from what I felt was a very sub-par movie. The trials and tribulations of Spartacus working his way up through the gladiator ranks is protrayed beautifully in this epic saga as Spartacus makes friends and enemies among his fellow gladiators. The roles of the gladiators and the ruler of the gladiator house that Spartacus is bound to, Batiatus, are masterfully played by the actors that were selected and Spartacus himself is a very likeable character thatone can relate to well. All the time that he is in the gladiator house, he is searching for a way to reunite with his family, which was taken from him by the Romans. At the same time, he begins to lose himself in the glory of being a gladiator and has to decide what is more important to him, friendship and family, or glory, fame and honor. Overall, it is just a very gripping series and I truly hope that the actor Andy Whitfield will be able to return from his battle with cancer to make a 2nd season and beyond.    Also on a side note, I once again have to commend Amazon on their incredibly quick shipping. I ordered this on a Monday with super saver shipping and received the blu-ray set on the following Thursday...3 days, amazing!    If you haven't seen this and don't mind the violence and sexual content, please do yourself a favor and watch.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This is an excellent short series from HBO with a terrific cast. A couple of the guys play either themselves or a fictional Marine which speaks well of the general accuracy of the piece. The brutality of war, the confusion of this particular war (the invasion of Iraq), the brotherhood of men in combat -- all are well depicted and depicted pretty much without rose-colored glasses. These are Marines, not shiny perfect heroes. I recommend this series very highly.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|We first heard Mumford & Sons on our local public radio, and loved them! The CD does not disappoint and has many catchy songs. The only downside is that Little Lion Man has several curse words mixed into the lyrics (which we didn't know since we had only heard the radio version), so it's definitely not family-friendly.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|While the title of my review has probably been overused, that is the only word that can describe season three of this fantastic show. After a mediocre second season, the third season pumps in twice the laughs, twice the intelligence and twice the ingenious of Jim Parsons as the great Sheldon Cooper. The third season picks up with the boys returning home from the North Pole and suddenly Leonard and Penny are in a relationship. Before you know it the show takes an amazing twist with a whole new bunch of challenges for our genius foursome as they tackle being in relationships, dating and of course trying to keep Sheldon under control through it all.<br /><br />This season brings us some great milestones, such as Howard meeting the cute Bernadette, Sheldon singing Soft Kitty to Penny and of course the battle between Sheldon and Will Wheaton. The stars never miss a beat in this season and of course our favorite guest stars make their triumphant returns including a special surprise at the very end of the season. Still, this show continues to make me laugh and I am quite impressed with how well this season turned out. If you have never seen this show before this season contains the one episode you must see. The Einstein Approximation in which Sheldon gets stumped and goes insane. If you thought he was crazy before you have never seen anything yet.<br /><br />Now with an Emmy win for Sheldon, this show continues to ride strong, and hopefully for a few more seasons.
B000YDE46Y|5.0|These are amazing boots, but the sole insert moves around a bit.  I reccomend buying some inserts
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are impeccable on screen. Even though I've already seen the movie online I decided to purchase a blu-ray version to fully enjoy this masterpiece. The story follows a hitman who takes in an orphan after her family is killed by corrupt policemen. The action is very exciting since Jean can take down so many enemies with ease, including SWAT members. This film is a classic and should be a part of any action fan's collection.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I had this movie already and it got super scratched so I needed a replacement.  Great price, got it quickly.
B003FSTN7A|3.0|I do not know if it is me or a lot of my favorite series but this season seems to be consistent with my other favorites, criminal minds, bones etc.  but I find this season lacking and boring especially the path down memory lane when the Dubois get married and especially the Peta EPISODE.  I feel there are just too many writers pushing their agenda on the audience in all these series.  I will not buy anymore of any of them.  That includes criminal minds which was my favorite medium and host of others I watch.  good luck
0399156577|4.0|it had some problems.  I really enjoyed the book and as I released my tight grasp on the book at midnight last night I felt a little let down by the ending.  Given that so much attention had been given to the dogs and the search and rescue scenes throughout the book,I would have expected them to have been more involved in the take down.  This book could have had a much better ending that way.  I thought the dog training was interesting and made me want to buy a dog.  Simon wasn't your usual perfect guy and the plot, serial killers and interaction among the characters were all interesting and believable. It would be interesting to read a sequel to this book to learn how the other friends and relatives fare and to see if Fiona and Simon are still together in a year from now.
0143038583|5.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is just fabulous. As a long-time vegetarian I thought I was already aware of the issues concerning where our food comes from, but I learned a lot from this book. Not only is it extremely well written, but the way Pollan goes through his thought process really gets the reader thinking too.<br />I spotted a few small errors, but nothing major. The author touches on the link between global warming and agriculture, but misses the opportunity to mention what an important factor it is.<br />Highly recommended!
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis has a gift for making complicated, esoteric subjects seem very logical and simple.  He almost makes it look too easy; as a reader, you're sometimes wondering, well, if it was so obvious, why didn't I earn $26 million per year like one of the \\"dumb\\" guys in the book?  Same thing when you read \\"Moneyball\\" and you wonder, hell I could have run a baseball team better than some of those yahoos.    Anyway, in this book, Lewis tackles the meltdown of the subprime mortgage market in 2007 that led to the meltdown of Wall Street in 2008 and the recession that still bedevils the US economy as we end 2010.  He does it through the stories of a handful of investors who understood early in the game that the subprime market was going to blow up, and who manuevered to find ways to exploit the gigantic mistake that most investors were making.  It's a compelling story that will resonate for all of us for decades, as we live with the legacy of empty homes and subdivisions, millions of foreclosures, and people of modest means whose financial lives are ruined.    Steve Eisman, with whom Lewis begins his tale, is probably the most entertaining of the bunch.  Monstrously socially inept, Eisman had the outsider's view necessary to see that mortgages were being sold to people who couldn't possibly repay them, even while that was being hidden from everyone else through complicated mortgage bonds. Even more remarkably, Eisman said it over and over again publicly --- literally challenging the titans of Wall Street at conferences and through emails to his clients.  He dared them to keep taking the other side of his bets that the subprime market would collapse -- and they kept accepting his challenge. Eisman made something like 20 times his investment, while famous Wall Street firms went bankrupt on the other end of the trades.     Just behind Eisman was Mike Burry, whose story is even more bizarre. Having lost an eye to a childhood disease, Burry was a social outcast who traded stocks in his spare time while becoming a doctor. When he decided he didn't like the site of blood and gore (which took him 'til his residency was nearly done!), he became an investment manager.  He was hired by a Wall Street guy who'd been reading his recommendations on online message boards for a few years.  Working from a different angle, Burry also bet against subprime, and they in fact convinced Wall Street to create new financial products that enabled them to bet more easily. Burry walked away with 20-30 times his investment.       Then there's Jamie Mai and Charlie Lederly, who set up shop in a Berkeley, California, garage with a small stake from family members. Their obsession was to find unlikely events that would have a huge impact if they happened, and then bet on stocks that would jump or collapse if the unlikely thing occurred. They believed that investors seriously underestimated the likelihood of these unusual events -- and they made their biggest bets on subprime, well in advance of the \\"unthinkable.\\"    Finally, there's Greg Lippmann, who actually worked at Wall Street giant Deutsche Bank.  He was making the bets on behalf of his firm, but he knew that his firm was exposed to too much risk.  He begged investors to bet against his own firm -- and found few takers because everyone was drinking from the subprime Kool-Aid.    The unreality of the situation unfolds over a couple of years, and the people who spoke with Michael Lewis give a wonderful fly-on-the-wall view of some critical junctures, such as industry conferences and meetings of financial titans.  There's a bit too much macho and cussing for my taste, but that is part of the swagger of that world.  And that's why, despite my Columbia University MBA, I chose not to go to Wall Street.  My temperament is more like Michael Lewis', and I've eschewed the money in order to do something I like beter (though I'd be pretty happy to make $26 million or $2.6 million or even $260,000 in a year).
0439023521|5.0|I just read the last page of the third book tonight and felt moved to write this.  There is no question that The Hunger Games is a fantastic and powerful series and that Suzanne Collins is brilliant.  The series is marketed as Young Adult Literature.  Just be aware: by no stretch of the imagination are these children's books.  They are fast paced and suspenseful, and tell of the best and worst of which humanity is capable.  The literary and historical references are plentiful.  But they are utterly gut wrenching in the description of Man's cruelty and inhumanity.  Fairytales are scary, but this is not a fairytale.  Without reservation, I highly recommend the series to adults.  I have just finished the series, and my highly literate 6th grader is already nearly finished the first book.  Now that she's already well into the series, I will let her continue, but probably warn her of some things coming up.  I find myself doing a lot of  hand holding and nightmare control.  It does elicit some deep discussions, though.  Just be aware.
B001O2HLFA|5.0|The best sounding Wake Of Poseidon CD ever! Other than the original LP and some Japanese LP pressings, this is as good as it gets! Outstanding tracks: Cadence And Cascade and Wake Of Poseidon!
B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|my little boys weren't too into it, but i liked it.  really nice feature that it has both bluray and dvd!
B002ZG977Y|1.0|First, this has nothing to do with the original; if you expect it to-you will be disappointed.  They even cast away the cool mechanical owl and basically exclude the pegasus that were so prominent in the first film (foreshadowing their total disregard for the original and storytelling in general).  The original had bad special effects with a great story and likable characters.  While this version has awesome special effects that are very realistic and impressive, the characters never develop and are honestly not very likable.  I so wanted the other marginal reviews to be wrong and to love this movie. I had HBO growing up in the 80's and would watch the original every time they put it on (which was a lot; this is back when there was only one HBO and it actually played movies!).  I like Sam Worthington and love Liam Neeson but found myself feeling very detached from their characters.  I think this movie is worth watching for the special effects but I certainly don't want to watch it again.  Too bad!
1427208476|4.0|Hard to put down once you get started. Hauntingly tragic and horrific, the impact from this book will linger with the reader long after the last page is turned.
B001V9LPWQ|3.0|I love all the Disney films and this one is no exception. However, that being said, I do feel like I was stiffed in the fact that the Platinum edition had FAR more bonus features. Gone is the Silly Symphony \\"Goddess of Spring\\" and all the radio broadcasts, and basically anything that was on the bonus disc of the Platunum version. Notice also that Barbara Streisand's version of 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' has been replaced with the generic teen Disney star of the moment. Typical.<br /><br /> I also feel that the prior release was better in the fact that the movie was made to fit the screen (Original Theatrical Aspect ratio) rather than the (1.33:1) ratio that it is now. I think this is done simply for the pointless DisneyView art of Tony Bluth. Granted, the picture is radiant and beautiful, but this the blu-ray format and therefore supposed to be able to hold 6 times the information of a standard DVD. So why aren't they being utilized to do so?<br /><br />I'll be keeping my Platinum edition.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|To start with, I am a huge Reacher fan.  Read them all.  Loved them all, except this one.  If I wanted chase scenes, I'd watch 70s TV cop shows (Cannon, Mannix, etc.).  But, I don't, so I wasn't turned on by this Reacher (13).  However, 12 and 1 is a great average.  If, however, you like the almost-getting-caught-at-every-turn (not unlike \\"The Firm\\"), you'll love Gone Tomorrow.  I had just gotten used to better than this.  Let's hope #14 is better, and #15....
B003ZEQMIC|2.0|This is not the movie; I was expecting the movie. This item is labeled \\"Disk Two\\". It is several documentaries about John Huston and his movies. Interesting, but not what I ordered. Where is \\"Disk One,\\" which I suppose is the movie?
B003CIG7AE|5.0|Something happened on the way to album #3: Band Of Horses grew up.  Where before they had peppered their album with more upbeat, but kinda-sorta lightweight numbers like \\"Is There A Ghost,\\" or \\"Weed Party,\\" (note I'm not saying these are *bad* songs) they opted this time out to focus almost solely on the meatier deep-album material found on those two like \\"I Go To The Barn...,\\" \\"Monsters,\\" \\"St. Augustine,\\" \\"Detlef Schrempf,\\" \\"Marry Song,\\" and \\"Window Blues.\\"  Crafting an album out of darker, starker songs like those means it necessarily may alienate some listeners looking for the more \\"fun\\" rock songs, but the end result is something that feels much more like it comes straight from the band's heart.  It's almost a page out of the Fleet Foxes songbook - the harmonies are played up, songs are stripped down, and things get really intimate.<br /><br />Especially important in how well this album works is the selection of tracks themselves.  Right up front are the three harder songs, almost as if to get them out of the way, and then album steers more toward the quieter lands with the majority of the rest of the album, interrupted only by \\"Dilly\\" and \\"NW Apt.\\"  At the heart of it all is the completely stripped down, very quiet \\"Evening Kitchen,\\" which sounds almost like it's subject - the band gathered together around a table, simply singing a favorite song together.  It's truly beautiful.<br /><br />What's most striking besides the direction of the music is the lyrical content.  Where Cease To Begin and Everything All The Time spent more time dealing with more simplistic concepts (Is There A Ghost, Weed Party) Infinite Arms shows the band growing more comfortable with lyrics that seem to reach for a little more depth and intimacy, if not necessarily opaque meaning.  It's just one more thing that draws a line between Infinite Arms and the first two as the difference between a band finding it's way and a band that has really begun to define itself.
0525951652|2.0|Meh.  I have loved some of Follett's books (Pillars, World, eye of the needle) and since this seemed similar to Pillars/World I was really excited to read it.  It even started out well.      It quickly turned into a history textbook of WW I rather than being a fiction read with interesting characters, however.  I found myself skimming/skipping HUGE sections of the book that just told strategic elements of WW I history.  I already KNOW history.  If I'd wanted to read a nonfiction book about WW I, I would have.      I know that it's meant to be the first in a trilogy, but the ending?  It just stopped.  Nothing to make me even want to get the 2nd and 3rd books.  No cliffhanger, no twists, nothing.    Marginal.
0316098337|5.0|Wow.  Really, just wow.  This book is, by far, my favorite read of 2010.  I admit that coming into it, I was skeptical.  SO much hype, so much buzz, so much chatter about how wonderful and fantastic and lovely this book is...could it really hold up to that? Could it deliver as promised?  Oh yes...yes it could. It does. It did. Room is -spectacular- on so many levels.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of Jack, a 5 year old little boy who has never seen the world beyond that of the single room in which he and his mother live.  His world consists of that room, his Ma, and the fantasy land inside the television.  It's amazing how spot on the author was able to portray a curious, intelligent, and yet very socially handicapped young child.  His voice was so plaintive, so real, that it makes the reader want to reach into the pages and hug him close.<br /><br />I could just go on and on about every tiny little thing that I absolutely loved about this book, but I still don't think that I could really do it justice.  The novel just packs such a huge emotional punch that you really have to read it yourself to experience the beauty of the author's story.  Read Room.  You will absolutely not regret it.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This film was excellent!  I would love to see it offered in the school system for suggested and/or required viewing.
B0011NVC98|4.0|This movie is made from the epic poem \\"Beowulf\\" which I teach each year to seniors.  I decided this year after reading excerpts from the poem we would do a compare and contrast using this movie and discuss why Hollywood takes such liberties with stories.  It was a great learning opportunity.  It is worth a few bucks to own.
B003A4IFDW|5.0|I had never heard of this artist until hearing her sing on the Tavis Smiley show.  I reviewed the songbook on Amazon and thought she was amazing.  Bettye LaVette sounds a bit like Tina Turner and is as good.  I thoroughly enjoyed this CD and would recommend it.

B000VI04KM|5.0|I'd been meaning to buy this box set for a very long time, and I'm glad that I finally did it.<br />The sound quality is excellent, as are the liner notes and discography. The music is something that is truly fabulous and to have it in one set like this - wow!<br /><br />Now I've started wondering what has been left out! I'm hungry for more and wonder what JB's album 'filler' (no disrespect intended) tracks were like. I'll bet there's some gold there too!<br /><br />If you're a music lover or perhaps a music student (esp bass players, drummers, guitarists) you must get this set.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|I love most songs in this cd... some songs remind me of her pies descalzos cd.  I'm looking forward her future cds. I love Shakira... but i still love the original of the Waka waka... Thank you Shaki you r the best.

0451228375|5.0|I would definately recommend this book.  It is VERY long, so be prepared to commit.  It has drama, suspense, mystery, love stories...everything you could want.  I will say the ending ended all too nicely.  About 10 pages from the end, everything was in shambles, and (without giving too much away) at the end, everyone lived happily ever after (kind of).  It is actually nice to have a book wrapped up so nicely.  The books I've been reading lately leaving you thinking \\"WHAT?!?!?!\\"  I read Pillars of the Earth as well and need to reread that.  I remember loving that book, but I can't remember it very well.  At this point I would have to say World Without End is better.  I felt I connected to the characters much more.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, very action packed.  I felt like Angelina's acting was some of the best she has done to date.  I would go see it again!
B003ZDZ22U|4.0|Okay, I SLAMMED \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" - and for good reason.  IT WAS/IS TERRIBLE!  But you can read that review separately.  With \\"Forever\\", Miley revisits familiar stylistic territory.  She goes back to her bread and butter -- catchy, melodic power pop/pop rock.  And this is where she belongs.  Yet, I know that TO HER, she has mentally put 'Hannah' behind her.  All she cares about now is 'Miley.'  Let's face it.  She recorded \\"Forever\\" to kill a contract.  Once she goes back to being Miley, I'm afraid she'll return to the synthetic, computer music of \\"Can't Be Tamed.\\"  That seems to be where her heart is.  And that's a real pity.  Because on \\"Forever\\", we are presented with a truckload of great songs -- save the first two, which are forgettable, but not terrible, dance numbers.  Once she gets the dance baloney out of the way, it then becomes one great song after another.  With the dance R&B beats kept to a minimum.    \\"Forever\\" will go down in history, along with \\"Hannah Montana 3\\", \\"Breakout\\", and the first Hannah Montana CD as among her finest work.  The real shame of it all is, now that the fictional Hannah character is coming to an end, so it is true that there won't be any more Hannah CDs.  And it seems that the 'Hannah' side of Miss Cyrus has a better musical handle on things than the 'Miley' side.    I honestly believe that when her 'Hannah' Disney handlers were putting together the \\"Forever\\" album, they said, in not so many words, \\"We don't want another 'Can't Be Tamed.'  We're going to do this album up right.\\"  Too bad those handlers won't be around for the next Miley CD.    By the way, I would've given \\"Forever\\" 5 stars if not for the 2 dance songs at the beginning.  It's REALLY a solid album.
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|*Possible spoilers beware!*<br /><br />Remember when the Barbie movies weren't just watchable, but GOOD? That's what the Tinkerbell series is so far.  It has beautiful graphics, memorable, quirky characters, and well-written stories that children and adults can enjoy. We all know this stuff is made to sell toys, but as long as it was good, I didn't care. Direct to home video had a bad reputation for being awful, feature-length, badly animated swill, but Barbie raised the bar with movies like Princess & the Pauper and Barbie in a Christmas Carol. The problem is that Barbie has jumped the shark into pop culture and politics in an effort to be \\"relevant\\" rather than telling good stories to which children can relate.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with this development, but when the Tinkerbell series debuted I was ecstatic. The music, graphics and stories are fantastic--this is approaching Pixar quality stuff, folks. In this installment, Tinkerbell's inquisitive nature gets her into trouble. She is captured by a by a lonely young human girl, and the other fairies must rescue her. Because fairies can't fly in the rain, they must rely more on their ingenuity, and we spend quite a bit of time watching them try to get around in the human world. I think children will relate very well to Lizzie and enjoy the action as well as the comedic situations.<br /><br />For me, spending so much time in the human world was a bit of a disappointment. We all know the human world; it's the fairies and their world I want to see most. However, we got to see a lot more of the other fairies, their talents, fears and personality quirks in this one, and that was a treat. Terrence was MIA in most of the movie, which was kind of a let-down since he is Tink's best friend. Vidia in particular is one of my favorite peripheral characters, and it was great to see her keep her cranky snark while finally redeeming herself for her actions in the first movie, making her part of the fairy family.<br /><br />As for the extras, they're OK... I'm not much for the extra features, but I did watch the deleted scenes. Deleted scenes are usually deleted for a reason, but I wish they had left the prologue about the father's childhood trauma in the final cut. He came across as very one-dimensional in the final version. It was difficult to sympathize with him even as an adult who knows how hard it is to make time for your children and still make a living. Leaving this scene in would have gone a long way to making the father more likable, and considering they rendered a separate deleted scene for the heck of it, I don't see how this would have cut into the profit margin or added too much time to the film. Leaving it out for the effect of Lizzie finding Tinkerbell for the first time just didn't cut it (pun intended).<br /><br />I am upset that the package did not include a digital copy. I am getting tired of the arbitrary way Disney decides whether or not to include a digital copy for my iPod, especially since the price points between ones that include a digital copy and the ones that don't are exactly the same. I shouldn't have to purchase an additional digital copy when I've already got the movie in two formats to begin with. Not to mention one of the extra features on the disc shows how to transfer a digital copy to your computer--but this package does not include a digital copy! Talk about frustrating!<br /><br />Overall, this is a great family movie, but it is not as good as the first two. Even the music seems to have been taken down a few notches for whatever reason (I don't see a companion music CD for this one like the first two, and I wish they would bring back Loreena McKennitt). I don't think this series has jumped the shark yet, and I'm looking forward to the next installment. I do enjoy watching it, and I think you and your little ones will enjoy it a lot more than the junk Barbie has been producing lately. Four stars for an overall great direct to video on its own, subtracting one comparing it to its predecessors and what might have been.ssors and what might have been.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I don't usually buy soundtracks and my attention is not often caught by music in a movie.  The music in this movie quickly captured my attention, and I got the soundtrack soon after.  I am heartily disappointed that Debussy's \\"Claire De Lun\\" was not included.  I thought that was a powerful scene, and such a beautiful song.  The fact that the song is barely older than Edward Cullen carries more weight than most of the very modern songs on the album.  I was also extremely impressed by Rob Pattinson's music.  I had no idea he was also a musician until I watched the movie again with the commentary.  I hope he doesn't let his music go to the wayside as he hinted in one interview I'd read.  I don't care for Paramore's songs on the CD.  I'm surprised there are two songs of theirs. If they were omitted and Debussy included, this soundtrack would have easily earned four stars minimum.
B003PIUC02|5.0|The show is amazing! Bruta battles and Sexy women take the stage in this amazing storyline. Price was ok, coulda got cheaper elseware but loyal shopper.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|If you haven't caught the Vampire fever then you better get on board. This series is one of the best I've seen. You'll be hooked after the first five minutes. It's the New craze around the world so don't miss out. Buy the Blu-ray disc or the standard DVD and get ready for a ride and time of your life. Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley, & Ian Somethalder are addicting and have a great chemistry. Quarantee it will become a favorite in your movie Library.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I believe that anyone who likes fantasy, humor, action, and romance all in one, should read The Lost Hero.<br /><br />I can relate to a lot of these characters and it is just simply a joy to read. I like Rick Riordan's other books, and this one did not disappoint. Love it! I hope you enjoy it as well.
0553805371|3.0|I read Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time in a creation and cosmology class around 12 years ago, and I recall that it was an excellent book so I had high expectations for this book.  This book is good but not great.  First off, this book is clearly written and I feel that it brings a subject that could be complicated into layman's terms.  Some people obviously would end up liking this book because they make some good arguments.  Unfortunately, I don not find their main argument about M-theory being some form of a unifying theory of the universe too compelling.  Not being a physicist, I cannot claim any deep knowledge of M-theory but I just find that the authors' conclusions are speculative, at best.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|Just downloaded this from Amazon recently. Real hard rock with a soul flair. No ones ego seems to be pushed, just four great musicians grooving off of each other. They say it was recorded in a couple weeks live in the studio. The feel is just awesome. I hate over produced, overdubbed, and over tweaked albums. This thing seems so tight like a lot of the old rock music was. Pretty damn good for veteran rockers!
B000VSBX34|5.0|Took a little while to receive it but I was contacted by the seller for the reason for the delay.  Brand new, nicely sealed.
B004132I4S|4.0|This is a very busy album and it requires more than one listen to understand it.  So it's not for everybody.  But, it is rewarding for those who are open to really listening to it.  On my first few listens I liked about half the songs and didn't care for the others.  Then I saw Sufjan in concert and he pretty much performed the entire album.  It was a completely awesome experience to see/hear this live!  I suddenly fell in love with some of the songs that I previously didn't like.  So either the songs really are great or Sufjan is so cunning that he can make you love anything.  Probably a bit of both.  Parts of the show reminded me of a first date that gave you butterflies in your stomach.  It was that good.  I remember thinking, \\"will I still like this in the morning?\\".  And yes, I like every song on the album now.  If you give it a try, you might too.
0316077054|5.0|Great book a little slow to get going but love the series so far can not wait for book three to come out if you like the Twilight series you will love the caster series
0439023521|5.0|I was at work one day when my co-worker started talking about this trilogy she just finished and how I should definitely read it. I took her word thinking it sounds like an interesting enough story worth reading. What I didn't expect is to get so wrapped up in the characters and the story itself. I literally could not put it down. Any downtime I had was spent reading just to see what happens next. It has the love triangle of the ever so mesmerizing Twilight Saga along with the essence of the book 1984; Love, \\"Big Brother\\", rebellion, battle scenes without too much gore. The characters are so well written you can't help but fall in love with them. When I finished the first book I simply HAD to read the second. With each chapter Suzanne Collins leaves you hanging at the end, and you can't help but turn the page, dying to know what the next chapter has in-store for Katniss. It's brilliantly written, with just enough humor, emotion, desire, love and any other human emotion can be found in this book. It's one of those books you wish you could tell everyone you know about so they too can experience such a wonderful and inspiring journey, hence why I am writing this review. :)
B002IVLH6A|5.0|Great CD! Best song on the album is \\"Just Breathe\\"! Beautiful song - you'll want to play it over and over again - I do!
0199535639|5.0|THE WOMAN IN WHITE by Wilkie Collins is for me his all time best novel. It took me about six months to read the book, but that didn't have anything to do with the story line.<br />I have an eye problem and italics in small print is very difficult for me to read. The fact that I keep coming back to trudge on gives you an idea of the power of this early British gothic/mystery/romance. All the element are there county house, upper class residents, mysterious relatives, and a young woman in love with an impossible man.<br />One of the best early classics, which earns it reputation by being a good read instead of an academic favorite that every student ever suffered through.<br />Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Product was as advertised, brand new, and only the best of the best as Eminem always is..Shipped to me quickly..Good doin business, thanks.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. I like movies and shows about the time period and was a big fan of Rome. I don't have Starz on my local cable so I was excited to see this on dvd. The plot is tight and the characters are well rounded. The show stayed exciting through out the entire series. It was so good I was glad I already had the next one on dvd and didn't have to wait for the next week to come to watch it.     The photography and editing is really interesting. I watched it on my big screen (HD) tv and it was amazing. The fighting is show in a process of editing that I don't know the name of, but I'll try to explain. The fighting is show in a way that it looks like live actors colorized over silver liquid on the screen. I'm sure there is a word for the editing style, but I don't know much about that. What I can say is that it visually adds a mixture of increased excitment while making it seem less ordinary. Not just another battle in a movie.   The special feature part of it describes it (as they were trying to make it) \\"a graphic novel in motion.\\"     I think they did it!  The dvd series alone is worth the money, but it also has a lot of special features, with cast and production interviews and history information.    A great purchase.
1439181780|5.0|I have finished reading \\"The Power\\" for the 2nd time.  This book has life changing suggestions to change the way you think to change the way you feel - it tells you how to look for the positive in all situations.   Even when it is really hard to find a positive aspect to something that has gone wrong - there is always a lesson to be learned so that in itself is positive.  It also has made me realize what love really is - not just for a person or family but for the whole of life.  I have just purchased the audio as well because I'm going to take a 2-3 hour driving trip and I would like to listen to it on the way.    I'm not saying you are going to receive a million dollars but I'll bet you'll feel better about it if you don't  :)    Barbara Johnson  Cave Creek, AZ
0553805371|5.0|With all the hype you'd think there would be some major revelation found in the pages of this highly technical yet still easily readable to the lay person book on Physics.  Hawking was said to proved That the Big Bang happened without God but does so by postulating the particles causing it spontaneously generated in this universe from another(or that is how I understand the M-theory of everything being postulated).    The book is about how did everything get made and how did we come about?  He talks a little about the Mystery of being and introduces the M-Theory.  He alsotalks a bit about the history of science and how what people believed to be 'Laws' of nature changed over the years as the Scientific Methold slowly developed.  Hawking delves into reality.  Both our 3 dimensional reality and other possibilities.  It is fascinating to think about ther being other universes in parallel step to this one (not necessarily one where copies of ourselves wear a goatee).    I did enjoy reading his thoughts on the nature of the universe.  It is very thought provoking but in the end will change no one's deep seated opinions of the origin and cause of the creation of the universe from nothing.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I just love this show. It's such a great show. I was introduced late to it, but have since caught up with the DVD's. It's a must have for any collection. I highly recommend the series to anyone who likes smarty, witty humor.
B002ZG994U|5.0|First to truly appreciate this movie you had to have watched at least a few episodes of the original series.  The move changes the original story line - brings it up to modern day - but the underlying story remains the same.  As I write this there are 44 Amazon reviews.  31 are 5 star, four are 4 star.  Need I say more?  Just what the other nine  reviewers were expecting I haven't a clue.  No I didn't bother to read all of the reviews.    Buy the movie, have some friends over, pop some popcorn, grab your favorite beverage, sit back and enjoy the movie!  :-)
0767817664|4.0|THE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD. THE MOVIE ITSELF IS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING, THOUGH IT'S NO EXORCIST. I AM UPSET ABOUT THE FORMAT. THE ONLY REASON I GOT THIS IS BECAUSE IT STATED IT WAS IN FULL SCREEN AND WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. IT ENDED UP BEING ONLY WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. I WANTED A FULL SCREEN FORMAT. I DON'T LIKE WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. OTHER THAN THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE AND THE MOVIE ITSELF, I'M UNHAPPY WITH THE TRANSACTION.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I have to admit I really wasn't into seeing this movie.  I saw the trailers but it just didn't look like something I would get into.  My oldest son saw it and loved it.  Then my youngest son wanted to see it so we went.  I am SO glad that I did.  This movie was fantastic.  It's a long movie and you MUST pay attention the entire time or you will end up clueless as to what is happening and why.  It is well worth the time and attention though.  A couple points of advice, use the bathroom before you go in and if you must have a beverage during the movie get a small unless you know your bladder can hold it.  There are precious few moments that allow you to get away.  Of course watching at home the PAUSE button is your new best friend.  Enjoy!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|A huge hit back in 2008, i always wanted to see this film, and i wasnt disappointed; it lives up to its reputation. 700 years into the future, Earth has essentially become a massive garbage dump due to trash being grossly accumalated, so much so that us humans are whisked away on a massive ship in space to live lives of complete leisure. Wall-E, a trash disposing robot is left on Earth for cleanup duty, all alone except for a tiny plant he grows and his endless love of \\"Hello Dolly\\". Enter Eve, a robot sent to what remains of our desolute planet to see if it is capable of habitation. He meets her, falls in love, and a deep friendship soon ensues.<br /><br />Pixar makes the best animated films, simply due to the realistic themes that allow us to see the truth in the world as well as ourselves, only in animated form, and Wall-E is yet another great masterpiece of filmmaking. It touches on the environment and the eventual damage yet to come, loneliness, friendship, love. Powerful themes we can all relate to. If you havent seen it, get a copy!!!!
0374530718|4.0|Philosophy ideas can be quite dry and painful to read sometimes, but in Sophie's World, the Author was able to deliver that dull philosophy ideas obiter dictum (said by the way) with an interesting storyline. The book is great for anyone who just developed an interest towards philosophy idea, although the plot was somewhat scary (at least to me) but the author really gave an astounding world in Sophie's World  However, the philosophers ideas can be too brief and many great philosopher (like Martin Heidegger) has been only mentioned briefly, in fact, he only mention Hidegger's and Nietzsch' name when the 'philosopher' was talking about Sartre.  Great book nonetheless
B002RKXO5O|5.0|One of the best concert videos I have ever seen.  What a crime that American radio stations still refuse to play TT's music on the air.  Can you believe that Americans have never heard of \\"Rule the World\\" or \\"Greatest Day\\"?  Shame.  BUY THIS DVD!!!!!

I saw Memphis Blues on Amazon and listened to a couple tracks and figured it would at least be an odd / interesting addition to my Blues collection.  I am amazed.  Her range and depth, and choices of songs are great.  An utterly wonderful surprise.  The woman can sing the Blues.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|After their release of their \\"Foundations\\" album, Zac Brown Band is back on the scene with \\"You get What You give\\".  \\"Foundations\\" set high expectations for the sextet.  The Album won the Zac Brown Band a Grammy Award last year for the Best New Artist and gave them four number one singles on the US country charts and a crossover smash hit \\"Country Fried\\".  \\"You Get What You Give\\" lives up to the hype.  The album is chalked full of their signature grass roots sound and brilliant musicianship.  Notable tracks on the album include;     - \\"Let It Go\\"- The opening track on the album has been stuck in my head ever since I first heard it.  The song has a very catchy and fun melody combined with catchy and inspirational lyrics that you wanna just kick back and enjoy life.          - \\"As She's Walking Away\\"- The catchy foot-tapping and sentimental tunes was rightly crowned as Zac Brown's first single off their new album.  The song features country music legend Alan Jackson.  The two provide beautiful harmonies that combine a legendary Nashville icon with a new crooning rising star.    - \\"Knee Deep\\"- After Zac Brown's beach-themed hit single \\"Toes\\", Zac Brown teams up with the legendary Jimmy Buffett.  The two sing about being \\"Knee Deep in the Water Somewhere..\\" without a care in the world... A perfect escapist tune.    The album showcases many hits that could only be expected from the recent success of The Zac Brown Band.  They are true to their Georgia roots while making hits that appeal to all audiences.  One criticism I have, however, is the group's new found obsession with beach-flavored tunes and reggae beats.  We already have a Jimmy Buffet... and Zac Brown just isn't him.  Singles such as \\"Chicken Fried\\" and \\"Highway 20 Ride\\" have shown the world that Zac Brown is very capable of creating hit singles true to their Georgia heritage.  Other Nashville artists have traveled down this sam road, most notably Kenny Chesney who transgressed into a five album funk of beach tunes before going back to his Tennessee roots.      The album, however, has much to offer and is an exceptional album that one can certainly expect from Zac Brown.
B003TZ9EGO|2.0|Not at all what I expected.  These mixes are, in my opinion, awful.  There's no imagination used in the mixing.  I've loved mixes of various artists for many years now and was excited to see Lady Gaga ones.  However, this CD left me extremely disappointed.  Stick with the originals on this one - the mixes aren't worth a dime!
1439133948|5.0|We've waited years for a new book in the Miles Vorkosigan series. With Miles safely married (see KOMAR, A CIVIL CAMPAIGN, and the short story WINTERFAIR which was previously available only in the omnibus MILES IN LOVE), our last installment DIPLOMACTIC IMMUNITY dealt with an off planet adventure that cropped up while Miles and Ekaterin were on a delayed honeymoon. I was afraid that the next in the series would be dealing with Miles inheriting the Countship from his father. I figured that Bujold was not yet ready and maybe would never be ready to bump off Aral Vorkosigan--because frankly, the Count was a great character.<br /><br />In most respects, this book is a return to the earlier Miles. He's working on a thorny assignment on a planet that has never even heard of Emperor Gregor much less knowing what an Imperial Auditor is. They think Miles must be an insurance adjuster. For backup, Miles only has the Barrayaran consulate with a staff of two and a single Armsman, Roic.<br /><br />The book opens with Miles lost and alone in the catacombs of Kibou-daini, a planet where the dead are frozen and the corporations that run the cyro-catacombs get to use their voting proxies and assets until the corpses are thawed and revived--which rarely happens. One of these corporations is trying to open a branch on Komar and Miles has been sent to check it out. His cover is that he is attending a conference, but protesters invade the conference and snatch some of the delegates. Miles has a weird reaction to the drug that is meant to sedate him and he escapes. His bodyguard has been taken prisoner.<br /><br />Things look bleak until Miles finds a way to the surface and is discovered by Jin, an eleven year old boy who has become a waif living on the streets.<br /><br />What follows is a typical Miles space-opera adventure wherein Miles with sheer hyperactive persistence uncovers dark plots, rescues a frozen damsel in distress and generally sets the world of Kibou in an uproar. If I mention that Miles's brother Mark is involved, the reader will know to expect confusion, chaos and general craziness. Despite the eerie setting of a planet where the dead are frozen and the living are mostly disadvantaged by it, this is a light-hearted story but Bujold saves her final, most wrenching twist for the epilogue.<br /><br />This hardcover edition contains a bonus CD-ROM that contains the entire Miles Vorkosigan saga to date. I was especially happy to see that the short story WINTERFARE which tells the story of Miles and Ekaterin's wedding was included. One can read directly on your computer without any additional software or transfer it in Kindle format--this is a great bargain!is involved, the reader will know to expect confusion, chaos and general craziness.

Each is lovingly rendered by renowned Tolkiet artist Ted Nasmith. I truly hope to see Nasmith become the official illustrator for ASoI&F the same as Alan Lee and John Howe have become for Middle-Earth. If you are a fan of the novels this is a great calendar to have. I just started reading GoT and am nearly done and this calendar has truly helped bring some of the places in the novels come to life. Simply gorgeous!!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|[[ASIN:B003ZDZ1WG The Band Perry]]  Wow. Wow. Wow. Just wow. I haven't been this excited about a new artist for several years. I rarely buy CD's anymore because of a (usually) inferior product at an inflated price. The record companies killed the CD because of their greed and mismanagement, but I digress. This is one of those rare CD's that amazes you from the beginning of track one until the end of the final track. It has happy songs and sad songs. The creativity, talent, vocal harmony, and instrumentation of this band should mean that they will be around a good long time. I thought it was ironic that their dad's name is the same as the vocalist for one of the greatest bands of the 80's: Steve Perry, meaning that that should be a harbinger of good things to come. Looking forward to their next CD already. 'If I Die Young', though I love the song, is hard to listen to, having lost my 20 year old stepdaughter to a car wreck back in May. The sharp knife of a short life, indeed.
0307341550|4.0|I picked this book up on one of my recent book-buying sprees; who can resist a great book sale? AND .. well, I liked the cover :)<br /><br />So ... how do I go about reviewing this without spoilers?  Camille is a cutter (which doesn't really count as a spoiler, as we find this out very early on).  She cuts words into her flesh, which is enough to weird you out, but when we meet her MOTHER, we're REALLY weirded out.  As I read this book, I kept thinking \\"This would have made a great Bette Davis movie\\".  It was creepy like that.<br /><br />I LIKED this book; it was entertaining and quick to read, AND it has some twists and turns that you don't see coming (and a couple that you kind of do).  YOU see what the truth is before Camille does, and you're hoping against hope that her strange mother and her ineffectual enabler stepfather don't break Camille before she gets to the truth.  Her sister Amma makes \\"Mean Girls\\" look like they don't have a clue as to the mean game, and Camille is feeling the oddmeister vibe, even though she's trying not to.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give it a thumbs up.<br /><br />Sensitive reader:  There are some ticklish spots here.

Guy confessed, but, of course, couldn't come up with a reason for doing it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Camille, do you ever feel like bad things are going to happen, and you can't stop them?  You can't do anything, you just have to wait?\\"<br /><br />\\"Anyway, me and Rae pulled Ann off and Natalie had this needle sticking right out of her cheek just an inch below her eye.\\"
0385528752|4.0|This book uses an understanding of the limits to human rationality to explain how it's sometimes possible to make valuable behavioral changes, mostly in large institutions, with relatively little effort.<br /><br />The book presents many anecdotes about people making valuable changes, often demonstrating unusually creative thought. The theories about why the changes worked are not very original, but are presented better than in most other books.<br /><br />Some of the successes are sufficiently impressive that I wonder whether they cherry-picked too much and made it look too easy. One interesting example that is a partial exception to this pattern is a comparison of two hospitals that tried to implement the same change, with one succeeding and the other failing. Even with a good understanding of the book's ideas, few people looking at the differences between the hospitals would notice the importance of whether small teams met for afternoon rounds at patients' bedsides or in a lounge where other doctors overheard the discussions.<br /><br />They aren't very thoughtful about whether the goals are wise. This mostly doesn't matter, although it is strange to read on page 55 about a company that succeeded by focusing on short-term benefits to the exclusion of long-term benefits, and then on page 83 to read about a plan to get businesses to adopt a longer term focus.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|This thing works great except it comes with a saphire tip stylus. My recommendation is to order the ict04rs - 2 diamond tip replacement stylus' at the same time, it will cost about 30 bucks and this definitely is not wasted money. Trash the saphire tip. Audacity as a recording tool works fine. If you really want perfect conversions go to Kagi.com and get Denoise and ClickRepair and you enjoy your music till your last day here.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|\\"Think About the Times: the Chrysalis Years 1969-1972\\" is a three CD set of Ten Years After's fourth through eighth albums.  This set consists of 1969's \\"SSSSH.\\", \\"Cricklewood Green\\" and \\"Watt\\" from 1970, \\"A Space in Time\\" from '71, and \\"Rock & Roll Music to the World\\" from 1972.  This was the highwater mark for Ten Years After, as the album \\"SSSSH.\\" made its debut the same month the band took to the stage at Woodstock and put on a performance that would see the quartet of Alvin Lee, Leo Lyons, Chick Churchill, and Ric Lee catapulted to stardom.    All the tracks in this set are of incredible quality, the sound being clear which really helps let the music take center stage.  Five single versions are also added to the tail end of the albums that they originated from.  The singles include \\"If You Should Love Me\\", \\"Love Like A Man\\", \\"I'd Love To Change The World\\", \\"Choo Choo Mama\\", and a live version of \\"Love Like a Man\\".  It's also great to hear the evolution in the band's sound as they progressed during this period.    As a group that perhaps gets overlooked way too often, this set allows someone to gather the band's best four albums in one shot and really engage the music from this legendary rock group.  Alvin Lee is an incredibly talented guitarist, that when backed up by Ric, Leo, and Chick; is virtually like a steam roller of sound coming through your speakers.      I truly enjoy listening to all the music this set offers; and I believe that any fan of Ten Years After, or rock music from that period in general, would be very satisfied with this collection.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Received this last week and did the Level 1 workout. I like how motivating Jillian is. I thought it might be annoying, but it's good. She really pushes you to get the most out of 20 minutes. It's a pretty good overall workout for 20 minutes and I like that she focuses a little more on stretching at the beginning and end. I feel like the workout is a bit old school, but all the moves are effective.
B002ZG98CS|5.0|A lot of really good movies were released in the summer of 2010 but none of them put a stupid grin on my face quite like Machete.  From the opening credits to the big finale, Machete is completely brilliant.  The characters are strong and perfectly cast (Lindsay Lohan anyone?) and Machete himself is one bad mother something something without even trying.  For me, the Machete \\"mock\\" trailer in the Grindhouse movie was one of the (few) highlights.  Glad to see the movie finally realized here and in such a flashy and epic manner.  Robert Rodriguez has always had a very distinct style and flair and Machete is definitely his stylistic masterpiece.  Every single aspect of the film comes together beautifully here.  The movie knows exactly what it is and doesn't take itself too seriously-but at the same time can also be very thought provoking when it wants to be.  Plus having the likes of Robert DeNiro, Don Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Jessica Alba & Steven Segal in your film certainly doesn't hurt.  Danny Trejo is completely brilliant as Machete and really gives a performance worth rooting for.  Machete is easily the most fun I've had at the movies for a very long time.  This is a d*mn fun movie.    **Mild Spoiler Warning**  I hope the sequel teaser at the end of the movie comes to fruition much like the mock trailer in Grindhouse did.  I would love to see another movie or two in this series.
031606792X|2.0|So I am admittedly an adult who read the twilight series. I did so at the urging of my friend's mom who is 60. I liked them up until this book. Sure the writing style isn't genius but they were a simple read and a nice break from the grownup mysteries that I'd been reading since the authors felt compelled to throw in way too many sex scenes. So these books were a nice reprieve. Plus they made me feel like I was 17.<br /><br />Yeah well this book sucked. Bella is so whiny and self-absorbed in this book its intolerable. And *spoilers*<br /><br />the pregnancy? The birth scene?? Mother of god was that necessary? Renesmee? Or whatever the hell it's name was. So dumb.
0316098337|3.0|The first half was entertaining, the second half I found myself not really caring what happened to them.
B00008K7AM|4.0|What I like about the Hot Chick is that it's \\"appropriately\\" funny meaning it's not a dirty teenage comedy like so many other films released at the time.      There's no sex or crude humor in the Hot Chick unlike so many other teenage comedies, so this is a movie that people of all ages can appreciate and not be offended by.    The plot is about a teenage girl waking up one day as a man because she stole something valuable in a shopping mall that results in a curse, and the guy she turns into is... Rob Schneider's character.      This means Rob Schneider's character has to convince her friends... I mean HIS friends that he's actually the same person, but a guy now.    It's a very inoffensive style of comedy without hardly any cussing or inappropriate scenes, as I mention above.  Very very rare to see teenage comedies that are like this these days.    It has its dry moments of storytelling which is why I take exactly ONE point away from the overall rating, but besides that, I recommend it to everybody who's in the mood for a light-hearted comedy film.
0316098337|4.0|I'm with the majority on this one - great book! How the 2 folks on here giving the book 1 star can explain that is beyond me.  Perhaps the reason I loved the book so much is all because of reading on the Kindle.  Since I've had the device, I no longer read the jackets of books, therefore bypassing knowing anything about the books I read.  And I like that.  Books are a total surprise to me - I hate spoilers - and I find not knowing where the story is going so much more rewarding. While the 2nd half of the book did seem to lose a little steam, I still could not put the book down thanks to falling in love with the character Jack and being willing to follow his tale anywhere he chose to take me.  So I recommend not reading too much on the plot of this book - just pick it up and let it take you on a wonderful ride.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|Life is precious and fragile, and most of the time, we take it for granted. We fail to see that life is limitless, because we create arbitrary boundaries for ourselves, which stifle our true potential. We settle for the commonplace, and lie to ourselves by believing that this is all that there is. Most individuals will never break away from the traps that they have set up for themselves, and they will never know true freedom. However, some do find the will to escape, to be free, to grasp at a possible alternative. Some live their entire lives this way, and for others, it may only be a moment - but it is better to have had that one moment of true liberty, than to have lived your whole life without it.    Never Let Me Go is about all of this and more. It is a film that you will never forget, and as you leave the theatre, you should have a renewed appreciation for the intricacies of life. It is a somber experience unlike anything that you have seen in quite some time, but it is that emotional punch that drives the film.    In order to avoid spoilers, I will only provide a brief synopsis of the film. This film relies heavily on its secrets, in order to be effective. The film opens in an alternate, dystopian world at Hailsham, an English boarding school for young boys and girls. Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy have been best friends for quite sometime, and as a result, the quiet, reserved Kathy has developed an innocent crush on Tommy, a timid young man prone to random fits of rage. Meanwhile, headstrong Ruth sets out to garner the young man's affections. Young Kathy is heartbroken, but carries on. One day, while the children are in class, their schoolteacher suddenly breaks into tears. She pulls the blinders from their eyes, and reveals the harsh realities regarding their strict upbringing at Hailsham. It turns out that these children have been consigned to an unspeakable fate, which will alter their lives forever. After this revelation - which costs the teacher her job - we move forward in time, as Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy weave in and out of each others lives, as the threat of the inevitable hangs ceaselessly over their heads.    This is a film that will grab you from start to finish. At one hour and forty-two minutes, this film runs the entire scope of human emotion. You care for these characters, and you feel as if you know them. You want to see them live; you want them to run, to escape, to own their lives. You want them to realize that there are no boundaries - that they were never there to begin with.    If you feel as though I have not given you much of a synopsis, know that to say anything more would be detrimental to your experience of the film. This film was directed by Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo). He handles the material with such respect and delicacy, and as a result, he allows us to connect emotionally with what we see. Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightly, and Andrew Garfield truly live inside of these characters. Their strengths and weaknesses are up on the screen on full display for all to see. You will never forget these characters. You will never forget this film. This is truly one of the best films of 2010.
030726999X|5.0|This book picks up where the second left off in every way - the story, the pace, the tension.  This is a book you cannot put down.  Do not read this until you have read the first 2 books - you will be missing too many key pieces of information and background.  Larsson writes in a very crisp, clear style that is easy and fast to read, but tells a great story with all of the excitement and intrigue you want in a mystery.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book and the whole 3 set series.  Bought this in hardcover because I could not wait for a paperback or the waiting list at the library.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Let Me In is one of the most beautiful films of the year, and probably the best remake that I have ever seen. It is based on the Swedish film, Let The Right One In, which was released two years ago to monumental acclaim from both critics and art-house audiences alike. This touching story, concerning a young man's crush on a 12 year old vampire named Eli, captured the hearts and minds of everyone who was lucky enough to see it. If Ingmar Bergman were to direct a vampire-themed film, it would look a lot like this. However, one should not think of the film as yet another entry into the recent \\"vampire\\" craze. It is much more than that. This is the film that Twilight only wishes that it could be.<br /><br />The remake deviates structurally from the original, only in that the opening is a bit different, and a few minor characters have been altered or dropped altogether. The integrity of the storytelling remains intact, and as a result, much of the remake resembles the original in all of its snow-drenched glory.<br /><br />Kodi Smit-McPhee plays Owen, a lonely young man who is constantly bullied at school in the most brutal fashion. He spends his evenings at home playing with knives, and spying on the attractive neighbor next door. In addition to these disturbing quirks, he has an almost addictive fondness for Now and Laters, and constantly eats the candy throughout the film. Chloe Moretz plays Abby, a young girl who moves in next door with a man that we initially assume is her father. The two meet on the playground one night, and bond over the intricacies of a Rubick's Cube. Soon, Owen develops a crush on his new friend, oblivious that Abby is really a vampire, and that her \\"dad\\" is in fact a serial killer, who creeps out into the night, stalking and killing random victims in order to bring buckets of blood back to Abby, in order that she will survive.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an older cop tries to figure out who the mysterious killer is, as the bodies continue to surface.As far as Owen is concerned, the bullying still continues at school, but with a little advice from Abby, and a little bit of weight training, Owen realizes that he can stand up for himself in one of the film's most shocking - and darkly comic - sequences. It doesn't take long for Owen to realize who and what Abby really is. In all of his fright and confusion, he decides to stay by her side, and as a result, Abby vows to protect Owen in the only way that she knows how.<br /><br />As I said, this is one of the best films of the year. Both of the leads deserve Oscar nominations for their layered performances. The cinematography is breathtaking. The score is beautiful, although there are moments in the film that could do without a background score. This is my only criticism of this otherwise perfect film. Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) has crafted a worthy tribute with Let Me In.<br /><br />It is worth mentioning that this film is rated R, and while the film centers on two adolescents, it is not a film for the 12 and under crowd. It is much too disturbing at times, and the language is pretty rough. I would also encourage Twilighters to see the film, so that they may have a clear example of a film (Let Me In) and a product (Twilight).
B003PIUBZS|2.0|If you enjoy gritty, graphic movies such as Gladiator and 300, and quality historical-based TV shows such as Rome, then you'll absolutely hate Spartacus: Blood and Sand.  This show is nothing but cheap-looking special effects, soap opera-style acting, and tons of slow-motion blood and sex which looks so fake that it's hilarious (even the naked women look fake, like they're made of plastic).  Unlike shows such as Rome and movies such as Lord of the Rings, the budget computer-generated special effects in Spartacus make it look like the actors are running around in a cartoon fantasy world.  The writing is poor, the acting is laughable, and the endless slo-mo scenes of decapitation and/or intercourse will have smart viewers scratching their heads and wondering how this show managed to stay on the air.  Spartacus: Blood and Sand  is more like an R-rated cartoon than a gritty, realistic, adult-oriented action show.
B000V1MMLI|5.0|This disk has very clear quality and you can listen to it all day without getting sick of it!The book has all of the best songs and it includes art work and lyrics.But be aware that if you have a young fan like my 10 year old son,the book contains graphic art work such as nudity.Plus the songs are not censored.The package also contains a bonus disk with these songs,blue,empty walls (acoustic),feed us(acoustic),and falling stars.In the back of the book there is a card that gives you discounts of his official site.(plus it shows that you are a official fan.My son carries it in his wallet every where he goes.The delivery was very fast and came in a very good condition for a small price.I am the ten year old who wrote this with my mom correcting me.This is how i truly feel if serj is reading this i think you are a great singer and a inspiration.
0525951652|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. It is no Pillars but was still enjoyable to read. Don't let all the one star reviews from unhappy eBook customers and people that haven't read the book fool you. It really is worth reading. I definitely went away with much more knowledge about WWI and circumstances surrounding it than when I went in. Good read!
0373774184|4.0|This is not one of my favorites but it is still very good and was my bestest friend's fav back in the day.  So I am putting in a good word for this one.  What I do strongly recall from this story is that the hero confidently owns his bad rep and tries to protect that of his charming neighbor.  Eventually, she wears him down despite his good intentions!  Girl power back in the day.
B0006ZKN7E|5.0|My mom was in her own world, isolated, until I found the Super Ear.  Now she can hear all that's said to her.  I've bought several of them because the wires do get displaced easily but even so, it's a bargain.  I bought a $2600 hearing aid that she hated and wouldn't use!  She's been in the hospital now after a heart attack and the doctors thought she had brain damage until I showed them how to talk to her with the Super Ear and they were ecstatic that she responded easily to all commands when she could HEAR them!    I love this and keep extras on hand in case of breakage.
B001NE80P4|4.0|So many reviews already, just want to add my rating to the overall score.<br /><br />I actually thought this was the best of the 3 and loved the music and play within a play concept.<br /><br />The one thing I would have changed is the ending song.  The ending \\"high school musical\\" theme was the weakest song in the show.  They should have made it the ending credits song and used the actual ending credits song \\"just getting started\\" as their closing song.<br /><br />Can't have everything.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|It is wonderful to watch a movie without blood and guts hanging or pouring out of edifices somewhere on someone's body or sexual content so hot you could fry bacon on it.  Although sad but true, this is a good movie for children since it shows compassion and love between a human and an animal.  Not many people realize how devoted a dog can be and the suffering that goes on when abandonded or when they have lost their master. It would be great to find a human life-mate this devoted.

B000U1ZVD0|4.0|Wyatt Earp is one of my favorite movies. It's so well crafted and acted, it's one of those movies you can go to when you wanna just sit down and watch a \\"good\\" movie. I had a couple of issues, but really only one.  The disc stopped before I could finish the movie. Not a fault of the seller which has been great for me in the past, but just some problem with the disc.  Besides that it was a good transfer. I have both an HD DVD and Blu-Ray player and I tend to prefer the HD DVD's. Although I thought the movie was a little over dark, probably to compensate for the lack of blacks in lcd panels. I have an hd tube tv that doesn't have that issue, so to me it was over dark. Other than that it is a clean movie, hd but still keeping the feeling of film.
1402210795|5.0|As already noted by the book summary, Sherry, our young hero, is determined to take control of his fortune from a relative.  To do so, he must marry, and after being rejected by the heiress/childhood friend he admires, he ends up marrying his other childhood friend, the penniless and orphaned Hero (aka Kitten), instead.<br /><br />This story is perhaps notable because Sherry and Kitten are both rather young and idiotic and are directly or indirectly guided by Sherry's circle of friends who almost play an equally large role in the story as the hero and heroine.  We follow along as the couple slowly matures, both as people, and as a couple in love.  So while Sherry starts as a self-centered, reckless young man, he comes to realize that he cares for his naive wife and ends up having to become a more responsible person for her.<br /><br />GH handles it just right so that you feel pretty much as if you were one of Sherry's friends.  We are sympathetic and find their struggles more amusing than annoying despite them making so many foolish decisions.<br /><br />One of my favorite GH stories.  Enjoy
0307277453|5.0|If the critics are knowledgeable in the field, then they can go have fun with a textbook.    For the rest of us who just want to discover the origin of ourselves and what it means to be human without having to enroll in a class, we'll stick to this kind of book.
0553805371|1.0|The book is for the largest part a repetition of \\"A briefer history of time\\" which itself is for the largest part a repetition of \\"A brief history of time\\". It seems the authors haven't learned much news in order to amaze the reader nor are they interesting enough to someone who has read the two before mentioned books.Despite their promises that this is a marvelously concise book with new answers would I state it is a lot of old stuff and so is the humor they try to insert here and there, boring and not original. If you have some knowledge about their field of expertise the book doesn't give new insights, but if you never have read anything on cosmology go ahead and buy it. All in all, I think the authors, nevermind how much respect one must have for them based on their overall work,should be ashamed to come up with so much old information and knowledge and represent it as new in order to sell well.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is the absolute best deal in flash photography IMHO.  The Nikon SB-400 ( I bought mine new for only $109 ) is a compact, easy to use, surprisingly powerful SLR flash that produces extremely high quality results.  I have own much more expensive flash in the past and have not had better results that I am getting with this flash except for more power.  1) It's super light making it extremely portable.  2) To bounce flash, all you have to do is flip the front part of the flash up and voila, beautiful lighting.  You can alter the degree of bounce by moving the front portion of the flash in fine increments.  Very easy to use and produces the gorgeous, natural indoor shots.  In many shots, it's hard to tell at all if I am even using flash indoors.  The final results looks more like using a high quality fixed, low light lens -- hand held.  3)  Flash sync speed is 1/500.  Now, I don't read the specs of all the flash out there, but I don't remember seeing any flash that have this high sync speed. This is extremely useful when one needs flash and also needs to capture \\"moving object\\". 4)  It's fairly powerful for such a small flash.  I recently attended a ballroom dancing competition and use this flash with my Nikon D40 to produce beautiful pictures.  I set the flash sync speed to 1/500.  I was shocked to see that the flash was able to reach the subjects and produce great results over 50ft away.  The recycling rate was amazing as well.  I would shoot away, 2-3 shots continuously and had good results on most of the shots. 5)  It uses two AA batteries which is very convenient.  I use eneloop rechargeable batteries and it just seems to go on and on ...<br />I don't believe in easily giving 5 stars to a product since there are so many similar products out there that most of us have not tried or tested.  However, I really think this is a 5 star product considering its price/performance.  I have had this flash for over a year and a half and have shot thousands and thousands ofpictures and it's as good as new.  Fill flash and indoor shots are dead on for exposure and color on my D40. A definitive best buy.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|You're most likely buying this because you've liked one or more of the Kings of Leon's past 4 albums. Did you like it? Well then you will most likely enjoy 'Come Around Sundown.' These guys have always provided oodles of the catchiest riffs and vocal melodies, backed by a talented rhythm section while simultaneously rocking out. No reason to start hating them because their sound is starting to evolve a little more each album. Whether you think it's good or bad is up to you of course but to simply put it; bands always evolve. These guys are still rockin' it.
B003Q6D29Q|5.0|First of all, I haven't read the 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishigiro that this film is based on, nor did I know much of anything about it apart from the basics (dystopian English alternate-world story) before seeing the film. So the few problems I mention or areas that I feel the film is deficient in dealing with are wholly a product of my experience with the movie - I suspect that some of these issues might be less problematic in the novel.  As you can see from my rating and review, I think the positives far outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />Second of all, if you know even less than I did, be prepared for **SPOILERS**<br /><br />All that out of the way, what we have here is a story taking place in a roughly contemporary (1978-94) England, a country (and presumably, world) radically changed by medical advances that did not happen in our world. Or...maybe. The most fascinating element of this film to me, and I'm sure the most infuriating to many viewers, is that we never get a really clear picture as to just what the technology is, how things have changed. The focus here is not on technology, on the science fictional aspects, on gadgetry or medicine. We get a few references to cloning, but never any details; we learn fairly quickly that the children we're introduced to at the Hailsham boarding school have a \\"special\\" destiny, and the film follows three of them in particular, one of whom, Kathy (Izzy Meikle-Small as a child/Carey Mulligan as an adult) narrates the film from 1994 at around the age of 30.<br /><br />Kathy, her companions Tommy (Charlie Rowe/Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Ella Purnell/Keira Knightley) are all being raised in a comfortable, serene - almost idyllic - countryside school to face a very particular and peculiar destiny. We get several hints early on - but only get the full heartbreaking story from a sympathetic (and summarily dismissed) young teacher named Lucy (Sally Hawkins): the children are all clones who will be harvested for their organs before the age of 30, dying typically after their third or fourth \\"donation\\". Lucy delivers the news with compassion and sadness; the rest of society, including the leaders of the school and apparently virtually all donors, have simply accepted this new world order, for the sake of the longer lives (we're told in a brief script at the beginning of the film that the average lifespan has passed 100) and comfort it has given them. The donors are essentially regarded as cattle.  Eventually they move on from the school to \\"The Cottages\\" a few years later in the second third of the film, as the forward and vivacious Ruth has taken up with the awkward and introverted Tommy, which Kathy considered becoming a \\"Carer\\", helping to take care of the donors before she herself becomes one.  In the last third of the film, 1994, all three confront their inevitable destinies.<br /><br />In most such visions, the story would be about attempts to escape the repressive regime, or overthrow it. The genius and heartbreak of NEVER LET ME GO is that it shows a society - or a very tiny portion of one - that is completely conditioned to the way things are now; nobody even dreams of running away or changing things, and the idea of there being an ethical dilemma is never actually broached by any character until quite near the end of the film. This was, I'll admit, something of a problem for me as I was watching the film - it's really quite hard to take the blind acceptance of such an awful fate on the part of everyone; but I think that Ishiguro and the filmmakers here are making a statement that only seems unrealistic if we forget the history of the last century. I do have a slight problem with the notion that things could have happened so very quickly in a democracy like England, but if we look at something like Orwell's \\"1984\\" - set 35 years after its publication - as a model, we shouldn't be surprised. The English dystopian vision has always seemed a particularly mordant and immediate one. And setting the film in essentially our time also allows it to be made much more cheaply - it's \\"science fiction\\" certainly, but it doesn't require the kinds of sets and effects that we usually think of the genre as having nowadays.<br /><br />I think that another factor that is going to be problematic for many is that we just see a very small fraction of this society, which must be so very different in many aspects but which looks essentially the same to we viewers. We are kept in the presence of our three main characters throughout, and we never see the recipients of any of these peoples' \\"gifts\\"; we never encounter the government; we never hear anyone from outside of their little world express an opinion. For me this helped keep the exquisite sadness and intensity of the growing sense of loss that these young people had fresh and vivid throughout, and without encumbering the actual film with external voices, we are allowed to consider all the ethical ramifications and meanings of this changed world entirely on our own. The donors could be read as metaphors for slavery; for how we treat animals; for abortion; for the place of women in a man's world; in short, for any way in which the rulers and the majority of a society have treated and continue to treat those without any power. There are several moments where the word \\"soul\\" is used - though the film has no visible religious agenda, the notion is that the idea of living organ donation is perhaps accepted because the clones are viewed as not having souls, as not being fully human - an argument that was made not so long ago about other kinds of people in the world we live in.<br /><br />The acting and nearly everything about the production is pretty impressive; director Romanek has just made two previous features, ONE HOUR PHOTO and STATIC, over the past 15 years.  I haven't seen either of those, but he has a sure hand here, putting together Alex Garland's screenplay and the performances of the fine ensemble with a minimum of sentimentality or lingering, overt emotion - which if anything serves to increase the power of the storytelling and the ultimate tragedy of the piece. Rachel Portman's music is very low-key, repetetive, insistent; at first it irritated me a bit, but gradually it grew on me, mirroring the ultimately dead-end, resigned lives of the protaganists. Of the cast I have to single out Carey Mulligan, who seems likely to get some of the same kind of awards talk she did a year ago when she burst on the scene in An Education. She has to communicate a calmness, empathy, resignation and yet a flicker of never-ending internal determination and purpose throughout the film, and I don't know that many actresses could have managed.<br /><br />As Orson Welles once said about [[ASIN:B002XUL6SA Make Way for Tomorrow]], another heartbreaker about the inevitability of fate, it would make a stone cry.  One of the best of 2010 - don't miss it.me also allows it to be made much more cheaply - it's \\"science fiction\\" certainly, but it doesn't require the kinds of sets and effects that we usually think of the genre as having nowadays.

0385342047|2.0|I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books, and have enjoyed the way she tells a story.   Unfortunately, Mini Shopaholic seemed to have been written in a hurry and lacked all the fun and irony of her previous books.  I kept thinking that something funny or meaningful was going to happen as I turned the pages, but nothing ever did.   It was just 400 pages of Becky planning a surprise party for her husband with a few mentions about her toddler's bad behavior, her job as a personal shopper, and her shopping addiction.   The title and beginning of the book makes one believe that there will be some development of the newest Brandon character, Minnie, and her relationship with Becky.  That didn't happen in the book, other than the description of a few of Minnie's temper tantrums, none of which Becky could control, and a brief encounter with a nanny whose assessment results in saying that Minnie has no issues, but that Becky needs help for her shopping addiction.   Everything in the book seemed ridiculous including the fact that 2 year-old, highly intelligent Minnie could only speak a maximum of 2 grammatically incorrect words at a time (such as \\"Mine book\\").     I don't understand what Sophie Kinsella was trying to accomplish with this book.  The only interesting relationship discussed was that of Luke and his birth mother, but the reader is left hanging in terms of what happened in the past that caused their communication to cease, and why Elinor is different (older, more sensitive) from the way she was in the past.  Sophie briefly mentions Becky's sister, Jess, and could have done more to show how Jess has changed and how the sisters' relationship has changed now that she is married and living next door.  Luke, who was a strong character in past books, is made to seem clueless and shallow in this book.   None of the previously likeable characters in the Shopaholic series was likeable in this book.  Minnie is a brat and the only realistic aspect of the book was at the beginning where Luke says he doesn't want another child because of the way Minnie is and that they need help to figure out why she is out of control.    Another issue with this book is that there is too much over-the-top, wasting of money, on the ridiculous party which was the plot of the entire book.  Throughout the book, although there is mention of how bad the economic times are, it doesn't seem to have affected Becky's expectations in terms of her own living standards and spending habits.      I assume that in the future, Sophie will develop Minnie's character.  I hope she doesn't make Minnie a clone of Becky.  I hope that there will be some substance in terms of the mother-daughter relationship.    This book was disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|I am not an old school KOL fan. I have the three albums released prior to this one and they never really made into heavy rotation for me. Loved \\"Use Somebody\\" but that album as a whole didn't appeal to me as much as the singles. However, I LOVE \\"Come Around Sundown\\". I've been listening non-stop since I put it in the CD player in the car. I am a big fan of songs that have a \\"sad sound\\" and this has several. The guitars are almost haunting on several tracks and Caleb's vocals are gorgeous throughout.    If you are one of KOL's original fans, this might not be an album for you. If you're a new or more recent fan, I highly recommend it.
B003TXSF5C|4.0|Stephen Hawking's books have been used for a number of years in my public school classrooms. \\"The Grand Design\\" is another authoritative resource for the \\"Evolution/Intelligent Design\\" debates. Hawking is an excellent and acknowledged expert.  His books are well written and documented. I have used his methods and techniques as classic examples.  Because of the current interest in the controversial subject of \\"Origins of the Universe\\", his works are particularly timely.  It's the Kindle version my iPad.  I heartily recommend \\"The Grand Design\\" for use in the classroom.
1563899426|4.0|A good start but doesn't really get rolling till later issues.  I've always liked fairy tales and comic books, yet felt skeptical when reading the synopsis.  Seemed like a rather gritty and radical departure from the tales that I loved.  Curiosity was good for this cat.
B003INBNXO|5.0|BEST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE PERIOD!!! DONNIE YEN WAZ MADE FOR THIS MOVIE AND HE MADE ME BELIEVE THAT HE WAZ A STUDENT OF IP MAN AS WELL!!! HE PLAYED THE ROLE SO DAMN GOOD!!! I BELIEVE IF IP MAN HAD WATCHED THIS MOVIE HE WOULD OF BEEN MORE THAN THRILLED AND SATISFIED!!!
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|So many reviews already, so will just add my rating to the overall score and add a few comments.<br /><br />Overall, a great action movie well-played by the charismatic HJ.  Think they could have cast Sabretooth and Gambit better but they did not do a bad job (just didn't match the movie in my mind.)
006135323X|2.0|I received the book in a brand new condition but unfortunately the edges of the pages are not cut properly. sounds like they are torn apart and it is not easy to turn the pages. I would have expected that they pay more attention to their international deliveries.
B000AYELVU|5.0|For me, best of the three series.  My only complaint is the miscasting of Rogue in the series.
0743201140|4.0|haven't opened it since I got it. Makes a great paperweight and serves as an excellent converation piece when visitors come into my office.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|With so many reviews, just wanted to add my rating the the overall score and note how this was my personal favorite since I have always loved this story and love books.  Also, the stained glass opening sequence, the creepy castle, and initially scary beast gave this story the best atmosphere of all the modern Disney fairy tales.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Received this shipment a day later than I had expected, but I'm an impatient guy anyhow. The dvd came exactly how it was described. No wear and tear or scratches. GREAT BUY! Thanks!
B0001I561E|4.0|So many reviews, just wanted to add my ratings to the overall score.<br /><br />Even years later, this is still funny.  Robin Williams was brilliant and the duet (rare in a Disney musical) has got to be one of their best songs.

B000AYELVA|4.0|First in the series, notable performance by JH making Wolverine his own (since he does not physically resemble the original character much.)  My main complaint would be Rogue horribly miscast.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|To say these artists are in their 60's does not detract from their energetic performance before a sold-out audience. Like wine, they've just got better with age. Great to see Cliff with the Shadows again. They don't disappoint. Wonderful show. Very entertaining and highly recommended.
0061245097|5.0|With so many reviews already, I'll just add to the overall rating and add a few comments.<br /><br />Thus far, this series has been the best in the genre.  I think the reason is that, finally, we have a heroine that can even come close to competing with the big boys as a hard hitter.
B003XRZZFM|5.0|Simply a masterpiece in Symphonic Metal. Its progressive, original and very creative, something which is hard to accomplish in the current state of metal music. Whether or not its \\"true Black metal\\" or blah blah blah, The fact still stands that this is some amazingly epic music.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|One of the best super hero movie series.  Darkest of the three.  Best battle scene at the end.
B0010ZR160|5.0|This movie presents us with an honest, responsible person having to make a very bad choice.<br />The choice is between \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", where \\"A\\" is also the default choice. Choosing either way will have bad consequences: the chooser is aware of this. He also knows that there is nothing to be gained by shrugging the whole thing off: choosing not to choose is the same as choosing \\"A\\".<br />This is what is properly known as a \\"dilemma\\".<br />It is also a moral dilemma such as it is rarely encountered in movies. This film is not only very well made and acted, but it has a moral depth that transcends entertainment. It is a lesson on the equivocal, slippery nature of life.<br />The setting is a rough working-class neighborhood in South Boston. It is a place where, in normal conversation, the \\"f\\" word and its various derivatives pop up after just about every other word. There are lots of drugs and crime. This is shown mostly in a low-key, but relentless, unflinching way.<br />In younger days, as a poor student renting cheap quarters, I did live in a neighborhood somewhat like that, although there was less crime - at least free-floating, disorganized crime -- and less drugs. So: not as dark and harsh as that in the movie, but close enough to compare for realism. My opinion: this movie has realism in spades.<br />The end is tragic in the classic sense: a good person is brought low, and into a kind of personal hell, by capricious fate and the limitations of human nature.<br />It is a morality play of sorts, but the lesson is given very matter of fact, without high-minded words and cheap \\"poetic\\" gestures.<br />This film makes you think, and keeps you thinking long after the last credits fade and the lights come back on.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|Always loved comic books and here's a live action one! Great cast and humorous story.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|YES...WE ALL KNOW THAT MADONNA / BRITNEY DID WHAT SHE DID ALREADY,  BUT THIS IS A NEW GENERATION AND EVERY GENERATION NEEDS A NEW ¨SPIN OFF¨OF THOSE ARTISTS AND THIS IS HER.  AND FOR THOSE WHO SAY THAT SHE HAS NO TALENT AND THAT SHE CANT SING...MADONNA, SHAKIRA, GWEN STEFANI ETC  ALSO CANT SING WORTH A CRAP OR HAVE VERY LIMITED RANGE BUT THEY´RE AMAZING ON-STAGE PERFORMERS AND THAT´S WHAT SOLIDIFIES THEM AS ARTISTS.  LADY GAGA IS A MASTER IN KNOWING WHAT HER AUDIENCE WANTS TO SEE AND HEAR. LET´S FACE IT...THIS ALBUM IS WHAT IT IS...YOU KNOW WHAT YOU´RE GONNA GET AND THAT´S OKAY.    I DONT WANT TO HEAR A SGT. PEPPER´S-LEVEL ALBUM EVERY TIME.  SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO HEAR A FUN POP ALBUM THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE DANCING AT TIMES AND THAT´S WHAT WE HAVE HERE.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|So many reviews already, just want to add my rating to the overall score.<br /><br />Growing up, I could not get enough of this film.  Errol can carry off green tights and still look manly.  Tough act to follow.
0307454541|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but I would warn prospective readers that it gets kind of dark.  Also, the end is not as masterful as the body of the novel...seems kind of predictable, whereas the story that leads to the end is quite the opposite.
B000F8O35U|5.0|So many reviews, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score and put in a word for the one that started the whole fairy tale cartoon revival with the music as one of the main features of the story.
1416972250|4.0|I loved this book. It isn't as great as the first two but was still fun to read. I really love these stories, they made want to keep reading just to find out what was going to happen. I would recommend this series to anyone-It is one of the best that I have read in awhile.
B003XWEQ1G|2.0|The film was ok, but I was mainly disappointed in the quality of the Blu-Ray. I watched the Directors Cut and the quality of the HD was inconsistent. In the same scene you can see the crisp and clear HD and then a very grainy shot is edited into it. It bugged me enough that it distracted me from enjoying the film.    *** SOME SPOILERS BELOW ***  As for the movie itself it fell short of my expectations and frankly I expected more of this incredibly talented cast and director. So you know where I'm coming from I really liked \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" (for all of its historical flaws the character development is really nicely done and I found the story compelling) and I think Crowe and Scott make a great team. \\"Robin Hood\\" had a lot of potential but fell short of being really good. The characters were dangerously close to become caricatures of themselves and the last battle scene had me laughing out loud instead of on the edge of my seat. Lady Marian dressing up in armor and riding out with a cavalry of prepubescent boys charging into battle on Shetland Pony's was hysterically funny. I don't think that was the effect that Scott intended it to have but it broke up the tension and it was no longer dramatic. There were other things like Robin's father was a stone mason that was also a political visionary that came up with the ideas behind the Magna Carta that really didn't add anything to Robins character. Scott may have been trying to explain Robins anti-authoritarianism but it really didn't work for me.  *** END SPOILERS ***    I don't know how much my enjoyment, or lack of it, was colored by the poor HD quality. I do not reccommend the Blu-Ray version because of this.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|The [[ASIN:B001IF5YLQ Apple Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter MB570Z/A]] was exactly what I needed to connect my 2009 MacBook Pro to an HDTV. I also bought a [[ASIN:B001TH7T2U AmazonBasics HDMI to DVI  Adapter Cable (9.8 Feet / 3.0 Meters)]] to connect the adapter to the TV, and if you want sound you'll need a [[ASIN:B00004Z5CP Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6ft)]].    Since my TV is not a display screen that was specifically built for computer viewing, the refresh rate was not fast enough for the movies I played on my MacBook, but it wasn't slow enough to diminish my movie experience. Also as a note my TV is 720p, so using these cables on a 1080p HDTV might make the refresh rate more noticeable.    Overall I enjoy using this product to watch YouTube videos and iTunes movies on a much larger screen.
1935251740|3.0|A large part of 'Biocentrism' is spent exploring the Copenhagen interpretation while completely ignoring the opposite viewpoint. The book makes a good case for bio-participatism. However it fails to succeed in arguing the case that reality is centric to consciousness or biological beingness. This tunnel vision is remarkably similar to the mechanistic philosophy of modern day science in that it assumes things can only be one way and not also the other.<br /><br />I look forward to the day when both mechanical and transcendental aspects of reality can exist side-by-side the same way irrational numbers sit adjacent to rational ones on the number line. Reality as composed of both physical mechanisms and intangible conscious meanderings is a potpourri of natural, imaginary, real, complex, and every other form of abstraction imagined or unimagined. In no way should a theory of everything be boxed or shoe-horned to fit into one idea just so we can pat ourselves on the back and in an illusory way conclude \\"all things are explained!\\"<br /><br />Even though the writing style was extremely approachable and the personal elements humanizing. I found Dr. Lanza's finger pointing and general condemnation of broad categories of scientific research as self serving and hypocritical. This really came to the fore on pg. 175 when he wrote,<br /><br />  '\\"Let man,\\" declared Emerson, \\"then learn the revelation of all nature and all thought to his heart; this, namely; that the Highest dwells with him; that the sources of nature are in his own mind.\\"<br /><br />  If only the physicists had respected the limits of their science as Skinner did his.\\"'<br /><br />Dr. Lanza is as guilty of this as any physicist when he claims the building blocks of biology or consciousness have any bearing on inert physical structures. Achieving a physical theory of everything would likely provide some insight into consciousness. However like an EEG we'd probably have no real picture of what quantum-states or brain-waves are telling us about what's going on in a persons conscious subjective mind. Similarly understanding consciousness down to its roots would probably tell us something about physical reality, but more than likely we can expect that it would have little to say about quantum gravity. Blurring the lines to say one tells us wholly about the other and vice versa is the height of sophistic thinking.<br /><br />While it's fun to think, \\"Reality is a function of my conscious existence.\\" The evidence is still very much inconclusive any way you look at it.
0312600844|4.0|Enough already with author's great need to throw a big bunch of words in that most readers don't know a thing about. I was an English major and have not seen most of them. It disrupted my reading. Otherwise, the story was interesting, sad, but surprising and held my interest all the way to the end.    Character-driven plot was very clear and I could picture each and every person inside and out. I would recommend this book to others if they don't waste their time trying to get the jist of the unknown words thrown in for \\"intelligence put-on.\\"

B003MZ0I84|2.0|Very disappointing album.  First album was great - lots of powerful stuff.  2nd album good, but this one, Hands All Over, is pitiful.  Can I return it for a full refund???  Album cover is great, album content is just too much light weight pop schmalz for my liking!!!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|There are a lot of interesting TV shows out there, but if I miss a few episodes of those, it's not a big deal. With The Vampire Diaries, I HAVE to watch the next episode, I HAVE to know what happens next, I HAVE to know the title of the songs that play in certain scenes, and I HAVE to know more about the actors in it!    I discovered the show a little late and ended up watching the whole first season on DVD in 2 days. I just finished watching the 6th episode for the second season and realized that not since FRIENDS have I come to care so much for characters on a TV show! And I'm 33.     These are just some of the reasons I love the show:    - Well written plot with lots of twists and turns. This is one case where the show completely outdoes the books.    - Very Romantic    - Lots of supernatural action    - Not as high school-ish as I thought it would be. It can be dark at times with mature themes.    - Extremely good-looking cast that can REALLY, ACTUALLY act!! Chemistry between characters is amazing.    - Well-chosen music to complement key scenes    - 22 episodes per season (I love True Blood too, but there are only 12 episodes per season!)    - Elena is a strong main female character, and much more likable than her character in the book. She does an excellent job of playing dual character Katherine too.    - Stefan, Elena's vampire lover is \\"good\\" but is strong and kicks ass when he needs to. Unlike Bill in True Blood, he doesn't get annoying and I actually want Elena to end up with him!    - Damon as the bad vampire brother embodies all the reasons why women in real life often fall for the bad boy -- he's the guy you love to hope you can change!    - Vampire effects are subtle, yet effective (read NOT cheesy), and shows that sometimes less is more    - As much as I loved the Twilight Saga books, it became more apparent after watching the Vampire Diaries that the movies were terrible!     I could go on and on, but you'll just have to see for yourself. Watch it!!:)
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Yes, another item for my Clapton collection.  But, oh myyyy, what a nice item.  Not as smoothly consistant as some of his recent past, but there are some wonderful gems within, and nothing fails.  The guy can do no bad. And let's not forget, he's freaking getting old....., but maybe not. Rock on Eric, rock on!!!
1401307787|1.0|The book is filled with stories, however the delivery of them is not well written in being captivating.  I would buy \\"The Power of Now\\" and another book on meditation or attend to a meditation group.  I don't like this book after experiencing \\"The Power of Now\\", a much better book that delivers almost the same information in a more captivating way - which makes it easier for the reader/listener (I bought the audio book) to follow and pay attention.  Peace.
B003TML0VO|5.0|Have always enjoyed covers well done.  Duh, deep, huh!  But really, as I waited for my Amazon delivery, I read the Rolling Stone review of this new Santana set, and was disappointed that I had made the purchase.  Until, I heard it - and Wow!!!  Well done, Carlos!!!   Most notably jumping out of my speakers was Sunshine of Your Love, the old Cream tune that I never particulary loved even by Cream.  Santana uptempos the beat and voila, a very cool tune, and, what a cover should be all about - give the old,a slightly new spin.  Vocalist guests are also well matched to their various selections.  A solid album - and if you like this, you need to check out Styx \\"Big Bang Theory\\" from 2005, a cover album with little or no promo that absolutely rocks my socks.
0312370849|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get through this book as I expected it to be a very heavy read... another Holocaust book.  But to my surprise, I couldn't put it down!  I just had to find out what was going to happen to Sarah, her brother, and her parents.  I didn't learn about the Vel'd'Hiv' in school and was saddened to read about it in this book.  There were tough moments throughout but de Rosnay did a wonderful job getting her story around it in the present day.  This is a must read!  Excellent.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I first heard Florence+the Machine on the Eclipse soundtrack and was hooked. I needed more information after hearing the cover of 'Addicted to Love'.<br />This album is good. It's real good. The songs are so different from one another. A lot of variety in this album. The songs are smart, funny, and catchy. This CD is good for hanging around the house or rocking out in the car. A little for everyone on this. Try it, you'll definitely like it.
6305176299|4.0|When Los Angeles SWAT cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his partner, explosives maven Harry Temple (Jack Daniels), foil a bomber's plot to extort ransom for a high-rise elevator full of office workers and rigged to fall 40 stories straight down, they make themselves a very bad enemy.  Before many days have gone by, the bomber rigs a city bus with an explosive device that will arm once the bus hits 50 MPH--and explode if it drops below that speed.  Trapped on board with a group of passengers, it's up to Jack to figure out how the bomber knows what's going on, then trick him long enough to get the people off.  Sandra Bullock is great as Annie Porter, who takes over the wheel when the driver is accidentally wounded, and the steadily ratcheting tension--even after you've seen it once or twice--equals any superhero flick around.  The late Dennis Hopper is also very effective as disabled former-cop-turned-extortionist Howard Payne.  The language is a bit raw, so you don't want to expose your youngest kids to it, but teens, especially boys, should enjoy it.

0312600844|5.0|It is encouraging, I guess, that the five star reviews are running slightly ahead of the one star reviews.  I hope potential readers won't be put off by negative reviews at this site that complain about: \\"disgusting\\" sex scenes (of the 560 pages, there might be a total of 3 that describe a sex act, and the descriptions are quite tame by modern standards); Freedom being a rewrite of [[ASIN:0312421273 The Corrections]] (similar only in that both are about dysfunctional families; one might as well complain that Updike kept rewriting [[ASIN:0449911659 Rabbit, Run]] in his [[ASIN:0679444599 subsequent chronicles]] of Rabbit Angstrom's life); unlikeable characters (the main characters are believable, multi-faceted, and troubled; just like real people, they are likable in their best moments, not so likable in their worst); the \\"boring\\" plot (if the realistic, intense drama of human interaction bores you, then yes, you might be better off reading a fantasy or a thriller); the glorification of \\"liberal\\" politics (a main character, Joey, is an unabashed conservative, yet he's quite a sympathetic figure by the novel's end, while liberal Walter comes across as politically naive through much of the novel); or chapters that are too long (a problem easily solved with a book mark).  Given that a shocking number of one star reviewers give no reason for their rating beyond \\"hated it\\" or \\"worst book ever,\\" I have to wonder how many of them even read it.  If you're thinking about buying this book, please don't give any weight to the one-line one star reviews.<br /><br />Freedom is a splendid novel about characters who can't help hurting each other--a common feature in even the best of families.  At times it is grim, but ultimately it's uplifting:  the characters struggle to overcome their self-imposed limitations and their pain and to become better, fuller individuals.  The sad aspects of the story are balanced by humor, while the negativity found in each of the main characters is balanced by a capacity for personal growth.  The novel is filled with moral lessons for those who are open to them.  Chief among these is the need to find a way to be better to those we love, to understand and appreciate them, and to be more forgiving of ourselves.  Freedom illustrates that there is no magic formula for becoming a better or happier person; the characters each explore their own paths, sometimes faltering, sometimes failing.  None of them are perfect ... but who is?  The point is:  they try.<br /><br />Franzen writes with elegance and sureness and subtlety.  This is one of the best American novels I've read in years.

B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Like one of the reviewers on the product page, I went into the theater thinking \\"OK, let's get this film over and done with\\". I remember seeing Predator in my early teens and absolutely loving it, then seeing Predator 2 maybe a year later and thinking it was garbage. And 2 \\"Alien Vs. Predator\\" piles of crap didn't help either, despite AVP: Requiem being somewhat gory fun. So I cast all worries aside, turned off my brain and just decided to sit back and let the film begin.<br /><br />And I walked out of the theater surprised that they managed to make a film that works not only as a sequel, but a standalone movie! Of course, I wasn't expecting anything Shakespeare or Art House, and therefore I managed to enjoy it well enough.<br /><br />This film finds us with a number of unknowns who wake up after being dropped into a strange jungle. There's something odd about this jungle though- according to the girl in the military, this wasn't like any jungle. Of course it's not long before the discover the horrifying truth- they're on a rock in Outer Space! After doing some discovery, they gind out they are soon being hunted by the Predators. But there's more than just THOSE predators- these people could kill each other off even if there weren't any!<br /><br />Of course, nothing is amazing about the plot and we've seen it 23 years ago. But do give this film a chance; if you need some nice and brainless fun, just go in and enjoy the show. The film is full of action and there is a LOT of gore, and Adrien Brody is a frackin BEAST. There's a lot of funny scenes too, and so therefore, if just entertainment is what you want, be sure to check this out.
0385738757|1.0|I had such high hopes for this second book. It started off good, but then it just got bad, and then got badder.<br />I should have waited to get it from the library, and then I wouldn't have been as upset. The story just made no sense.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />How likely was it that all of the boys would all be in one room, so the bodies could conveniently be taken out of the main room?? When they had to travel 100 miles, and get to the destination by a certain time, I was really excited. I thought it was going to be a great adventure. But then all they did was walk and walk, and the girl Teresa just shows up out of nowhere in the house, and how likely was it that none of the boys insisted on going with Thomas? I hated that even when there weren't that many boys, none of the others hardly said anything. It was like he didn't know what to do with them. That little lightning flash wasn't enough excitement for all that walking.<br /><br />Time after time, Thomas would encounter characters, and tell them his story, but they were never incorporated into the story, so what was the point?! So many times, certain memories were remembered by Thomas, but none of them made sense when you put them together, or even at the end. Why is it that Thomas never tried to reach out telepathically to the other boy when he was separated from his group?? I thought there was going to be a big confrontation between the two Maze groups, but that never happpened. That thing with Thomas and the new girl all hugging and kissing also didn't go with the story, and in the end when it turns out she was a part was a plant of the Maze creators, but yet, it wasn't never explained, and I hava a feeling it won't be in the last installment either. And don't get me started with the party, and the people just happened to be listening in, and learning Thomas was The Thomas. And why did the Creators say they had a cure, and not spread out the cure to everyone else. The rich has a sort of vaccine??? But it's not being spread? Why, when everyone else is dying, and the experiments are being run to find the bluepint.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure know what the Maze and all the tests are for, but now I hardly care. The story just was a big hype with nothing happening. The writing wasn't that great in the first novel, but now the story's gone downhill, too.<br />I will definitely be listening to the audiobook of the third one, and not buying it.

At the direction of Barrayaran Emperor Gregor to investigate the planet's cryo-corporations, Imperial Auditor Miles Vorkosigan arrives on the planet to attend a cryonics conference.  However, he is a few days on the orb when someone drugs the interplanetary diplomat.  Miles escapes from his wannabe kidnappers, but his mind is hazy from whatever was given to him.<br /><br />Jin Sato rescues a dazed Miles.  Jin's mother led a cryo reform movement until she was declared incompetent and frozen.  Living amidst the impoverish masses, Jin runs a cline for the poor.  As Miles learns about the cryo war over heirs and inheritance, he begins to meet the natives inside and outside of frozen coffins.<br /><br />This is a great addition to the Vorkosigan diplomatic science fiction thrillers.  Following regal orders, the hero investigates a convoluted series of events that appear only loosely tied by a cryo theme.  Vorkosigan finally connects the dots only leading to greater peril; by those who do not want to come in from the cold.  Simply put, Cryoburn is a timely super entry as the Imperial Auditor uncovers the stunning truth and he also learns Diplomatic Immunity will not keep him alive.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B003Q6D25K|3.0|Paranormal Activity 2 (Tod Williams, 2010)<br /><br />I started watching horror films in 1974, at the tender age of six, with The Exorcist. That one left with me with nothing but a raging crush on Linda Blair (that still burns thirty-six years later, by the by). And any other movie you can think of that got trumpeted \\"scariest movie EVAR!\\" by some critic or other pretty much left me the same way, either wanting to see it again because it's just awesome or wondering what all the fuss was about. In the intervening time, I've seen hundreds of horror movies. Maybe over a thousand. Of them, there have been four that, after the first seeing of them, I have absolutely refused to spend any time in a dark room. The first was Larry Hagman's 1972 Beware! The Blob, and in my defense, I was eight years old. (Can't remember completely, but I think it was the scene in the barbershop that traumatized me.) Second came Pet Sematary, my junior year in college (the sister did it, absolutely). The third was Candyman (it's the sound mix in the first meeting between Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd, which means if you haven't seen it on the big screen, you've no idea what I'm talking about). And the fourth, and I can't tell you what did it without insane amounts of spoilers, was Paranormal Activity 2.<br /><br />The worst part is, it's not all that good a movie, really. If we learned one thing from the original Paranormal Activity, a movie I was very impressed with, it's that Oren Peli is a master of blocking shots. If we learn one thing from Paranormal Activity 2, it's that Tod Williams (The Adventures of Sebastian Cole) does one hell of an Oren Peli impersonation. But every time he tries to revise and extend the convention of the original (and to be fair, he only does that once), he turns to the language of another film. (Or, to put that in not so kind a tone, the climax here is a complete rip-off of the climax of Jaume Balaguero's superior [REC].) I walked out of the theater thinking \\"meh\\" and figuring I'd give it three stars for being watchable and having a few really good jumps, but not being anything at all original. And then I got in the car and started home, and the impact of the movie started to creep in, and by the time I'd finished the seven- or eight-minute drive, I was gibbering and cowering in the corner and crying for my mommy like a schoolgirl. And that has not a blessed thing to do with Tod Williams, or almost anyone else involved in this picture; it has to do with a guy whose name you probably don't know, Michael Perry. But more on that in a minute.<br /><br />Plot: this is a prequel of sorts to the original Paranormal Activity, which allowed the team to bring back Katie and Micah, the beautiful couple from the first film. (Yes, guys, Katie Featherston is still that hot.) They are marginal characters, however. The film actually centers around Katie's sister Kristi (I should've jotted down names, because IMDB isn't listing anyone but Katie Featherston as I write this), her husband Dan, Kristi's stepdaughter Ali, and Dan and Kristi's son Hunter, who begins the film as a newborn, but is about a year old when the bulk of the action takes place. If you've seen the original, you know exactly how this is going to block out; you're going to be bored off your skull for the first half of the film with home movies. (To be fair, Williams does start the minor things happening pretty quick, but nothing that will make you jump until much later.) At one point, they come home and find the house trashed, so they have a security company come in and put up hidden cameras in the house. You know what's coming from there; you've seen the original, and Williams does nothing until the last ten minutes of the film to differentiate it from its older brother.<br /><br />Those last ten minutes are all down to Michael Perry, who's written for such disparate, but excellent, TV shows as House, Millennium, and FreakyLinks. He does just about everything that makes mehate a sequel if I know it coming in, but he somehow manages to do it all correctly. First and most importantly, he took a two-person film (and anyone who knows me will tell you I'm a sucker for a two-person film) and made it into a family gig. I figured that was strike one before I even walked into the theater, but I have a friend who has both a German Shepherd and a toddler who steadfastly refuses to see this movie because it contains a German Shepherd and a toddler. I admit, I was one of those poking fun at her, since she's as much a horror fan as I am. But Perry knows how to mash your buttons like a caffeinated twelve-year-old playing Super Mario World, and I totally get it now, even though I have never owned a German Shepherd and haven't had a toddler in well over a decade. You add a kid and you add an animal and while you're taking the easy road to scaring the bejesus out of your audience, you're taking the effective road.<br /><br />Second, there's the whole \\"there was no explanation for the bad stuff in the first movie\\" syndrome. Scary things are scarier, in general, when you have no freakin' clue why they're even happening. As a side note, it also avoids those messy plot holes. (Combine those two things and that's what makes Ils such a better movie than Haute Tension, for example.) I figured it was inevitable that Perry would do the \\"let's explain the events of both movies here!\\" thing, and so I wasn't surprised when he did. And it's not even all that original an explanation, but it's simple, it's effective, and it does explain both movies perfectly... especially when you get to those last ten minutes.<br /><br />Which brings me to point #3. It depends on which version of the original film you saw (I have seen two, and have been told at least one more exists) and how you interpreted the events in the final scene if you saw the correct (read: original) ending. If you thought you were seeing what I thought I was seeing (most of the action took place off-camera, as you'll recall), then I can't figure out a way that the last ten minutes of this movie don't break canon. I've been trying to make it work in my head ever since I saw the movie. I'll have to go back and re-watch the end of the first one tonight to see if I missed something, but as far as I can tell, there's a canon fracture here... and I didn't care, which astounds me more than anything else about this movie. It didn't. matter. one. bit. It's cheap and it's loose and it's so obviously tacked on for convenience's sake (like a number of other pieces of the script) and it doesn't matter because it's like getting hit smack in the forehead with a piledriver. And yes, when you're sitting in a brightly-lit cafe with your pals, you will deconstruct this ending and you will, rightly, tear it to shreds, as you will for most of the movie. But the fact that it's not well-conceived does not in any way mean it is not well-executed. While trying not to give anything away, I will risk a possible slight spoiler and say that the entire reason this ending works is the ambiguity of it. It's obvious that Perry knows exactly what he's doing by making this ending ambiguous. I think had he shown what happens in the conclusion to which you are obviously being led, it wouldn't have had nearly the effect that it did. Instead, he just lets it hang there and lets your imagination do the work. That's some sort of demented genius, though I'm not sure what yet.<br /><br />While unsuccessfully searching for cast information for this flick (and Katie Featherston fetishists take note that the actress who plays Kristi really could be her sister, just shorter hair and a bit perkier of a personality), I stumbled across a story where Peli is interviewed, along with Featherston and Sloat. In it, Sloat comments, \\"When you can't really see what's going on, your imagination starts to run wild. And the truth is that anything you can imagine is going to be better than anything you can actually see.\\" That's it, exactly, it's why this works (and where it stumbles in certain places when Williams crosses the line between \\"showing just enough\\" and \\"maybe showing just a little bit too much and giving the game away\\"). Peli says \\"It taps into people's primal fears of what happens at night and while you're asleep and most vulnerable.\\" And I have yet to see if my second night post-Paranormal Activity 2 will let me shut off a light.<br /><br />I have no idea how to rate this film. It's derivative, it's not especially well-made, it takes no risks, and the downside of putting more than two actors in a movie is that you run the risk of getting some who just aren't all that great at acting. But I cannot deny that, quite simply, this movie scared the living hell out of me more than any movie I've seen in the past eighteen years. It's base, it's manipulative, but it's brutally effective. As outright ludicrous as the comparison is, perhaps you should think of it as the thinking man's I Spit on Your Grave; it's just as manipulative and exploitative, but it relies on atmosphere instead of all those messy bits. So given how conflicted I am (and given how I want to get this out before the first showing on the east coast, which I think is in about an hour and a half as I write this), I'm going to give it the gentleman's C and let you decide. ***<br /><br />Oh, one other thing, and I can't believe I didn't say it it's so obvious: do not see this without seeing the first one. The final portion of the film will make basically no sense without it, and it contains THE major spoiler for Paranormal Activity.

B003JQLJVG|4.0|Robert Plant has never been a man to rest on past laurels. He certainly doesn't need to produce new output for commercial reasons, as he could have retired for life before age 30 on the proceeds of his 12 enormously successful years as front-man for Led Zeppelin and co-songwriter (with Jimmy Page) of most of that band's most memorable numbers. However Plant has never been in the business just for the money: he has a love of performing, of recording, and of the musical material.<br /><br />\\"Band of Joy\\" was the name of the Birmingham-based, pre-Zeppelin band to which Plant and (the late) John Bonham belonged prior to them joining Page & Jones to form Led Zep in 1968. This album is however no nostalgic 1960s retrospective, though it does update and re-interpret many older American folk songs from earlier decades, a genre for which Plant holds a life-long interest and passion.<br /><br />This inevitably leads to the collection of songs on \\"Band of Joy\\" to be compared with the Grammy-winning Alison Kraus collaboration \\"Raising Sand\\" and although there are some similarities, this album is different. Some of the numbers do really stand out: a superb re-working of Richard Thompson's \\"House of Cards,\\" Crume & Kelly's \\"Falling in Love Again\\" with its very early 1950s jukebox feel, and \\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" linger in the memory. Only time will tell if any of these recordings slowly emerge as minor classics. What is obvious after a few listenings, however, is how this collection of songs hangs together as a whole. Despite the age of some of the original material, it sounds simultaneously contemporary but with a period feel (Dylan's \\"Modern Times\\" or even the 1990 \\"Notting Hillbillies\\" comes to mind).<br /><br />Plant's much-matured voice is pleasing on the ear and the range and passion evident for a man in his 60s continues to impress. The ensemble playing from mainly Nashville-based musicians is near-perfect: professional, crisp, faultless, at times magical, and the supporting vocals of Patty Griffin fit the material particularly well. The CD is nicely presented with its red-and-grey theme colours and all lyrics to the songs helpfully printed in full (but of course you won't get this with a download).

B003KGBISY|5.0|THE FILM    What does one say about Shichinin no Samurai?  For me it is the greatest film ever made.  Friendship, class warfare, romance, battle and a slice of life - Kurosawa packed this one dense.  We reap the rewards of the master at the top of his game. Seven Samurai is an aural, emotional journey into Japanese history and human nature.   Though there is an endless cast, each part comes through as memorable, a credit not only to Kurosawa's direction and editing, but the thoughtful performances of the actors.      There is no glory here.  In the end, this is a profound story of survival.  Stray bullets cut down the bravest and the strongest just when victory seems secure.  The ones left standing, in the end, are not heroes.  They are just lucky to be alive.      THE BLU-RAY    Having shot Hasselblad for many years, the square frame feels natural to me, even on my Sony Bravia.   Asakazu Nakai and Kurosawa's calculated photography brings us the story in a strong graphic way.  This is an intimate story that comes through in the Blu-Ray more so than the older releases.  I wouldn't say it is a huge leap, but details, including the celluloid degradation, are accurately captured.  Any softness I could spot, I would attribute to the limitations of the glass in the lenses Nakai was shooting with at the time.    Grain and reticulation in the emulsion look accurate and don't appear to have been tampered with with any sort of noise reduction.  And if there has been some digital tuning, it appears to be almost invisible.  There are plenty of scratch marks on the print but naturally, this is a hard thing to avoid for such an old film.    I have owned every release and I've already given the other ones away.  This Blu-Ray isn't on par with a modern technical marvel such as The Dark Knight.  But it is a faithful representation of the masterpiece I love.  You'll never see it better.

Drugs are the excuse. Even the war against them. What you see is the inner meaning of being good or bad and how these extremes do appear outside in just a single manner. (That's why in Superman the bad guy is absolutely bad and the good one is absolutely good. If not, Clark Kent would have to face a dilemma. And dilemmas don't have one way out but two or more and, worst of all, consequences. You don`t even miss Superman here because -sorry- he is not an option.)<br /><br />Even though everyone who reads this expect to know something about the plot, I'm not going to do that, but tell you that I finsihed the book one week ago and still is going round in my mind. Why? Because this is a book that reminds you that everything you hear about drugs is a system with just one rule: the relative value of a truth is absolute. When you get a \\"candy\\" you always get the visible part. What does it lie behind? A drug, a drug dealer, a drugie, a cop...<br /><br />Dostoyevsky said that without God everything is permitted. The problem with \\"The power of the dog\\" it is not only the irony of writing God the other way round but it is exactly about that. Despite having a God soaring throughout the novel, everything is permited!<br />Don Winslow made possible the Dostoyevsky's nightmare.<br />If you don't believe me, go and read it.<br />You're just one click ahead.

B003W16T9K|3.0|DG's bargain reissue of Abbado's Schubert symphony cycle is welcome, if only because it undermines the absurd price (almost $150 at the top) being asked on the used market for the original set.  When this cycle was issued in 1989, the Gramophone bent over backwards to support the Chamber Orch. of Europe, an offspring of the European Community Youth Orch. Abbado showed faith in his young musicians by recording with them instead of, say, the Vienna Phil., and on several grounds he was right. The smallish ensemble feels right for Schubert's youthful scores; Karajan's set with the Berlin Phil. feels at times like breaking a butterfly on a wheel (does anyone quote Alexander Pope anymore?), and the level of execution is satisfying, if not brilliant.<br /><br />At the same time, however, the Gramophone reviewer repeats a truism: Abbado has never shown himself to be strong in the Viennese classics, tending toward a cool slickness.  In the case of his Schubert, perhaps it's appealing to hear the music elegantly glossed over.  In the early symphonies Abbado finds a flowing pace for the lyrical slow movements, nicely balanced with vigorous, alert, light-footed Scherzos. It's amazing that we are spoiled when choosing among recordings of Sy. #1 and #2. In the days when Beecham was almost the only conductor who championed early Schubert, and he began with Sym. #3 (as I remember, Beecham only performed the first two symphonies and Sym. #4 a scant handful of times and sometimes once). Abbado's readings have lots of charm but not the substance of Harnoncourt, who aims to make even the earliest Schubert symphonic writing sound like Beethoven. Abbado takes us into the light, sparkling world of Mendelssohn, where many listeners are happy to be.<br /><br />These general comments carry us through Sym. 1-6, which all receive the same agreeable, refreshing treatment.  the only minor-key symphony, No. 4 in C minor, draws many conductors into a darker mood, and to some extent Abbado follows.  The Adagio introduction to the first movement of this work, subtitled \\"the Tragic,\\" has power, but it leads into a generically played Allegro without any weight.  the slow movement comes back with a touching poignancy, but then there's a relapse into the Scherzo, where Abbado flattens out the off-kilter syncopation instead of taking advantage of it. So it goes form work to work. As nicely done as they are, few rise to the level of best in class -- remembering that we have complete sets from Kertesz, Colin Davis, and Karajan among top conductors and good if lesser ones (in my view) from Wand, Bohm, and Jonathan Nott.<br /><br />Ultimately no Schubert cycle is worth the purchase without an outstanding no. 8 \\"Unfinished\\" and no. 9 \\"Great\\" to cap it off. Unfortunately, Abbado's \\"Unfinished\\" is one of the most uninvolved I can think of, moving in pedestrian fashion through glorious music that apparently doesn't touch him, or us. As for the Ninth, it comes off better, but to be frank, this symphony has tremendous amplitude and works best with a large orchestra. Abbado gives one of those good-enough performances that don't stick in the mind. One longs for more point and vigor, and above all for a point of view. The strings of the COI, not its strongest section, have to scramble a bit in the scurrying finale. I should also mention that DG's late-80s digital sound tends to be wiry on top when the violins play with force or in their highest register.<br /><br />Although it comes on five CDs instead of the four that Karajan and Kertesz take, Abbado's set can't be faulted for stinginess. He gives us an orchestrated version of the great four-hand piano Grand Duo in C and the overture from Rosamunde. The Grand Duo is more than a curiosity, but as it tends to happen when transcriptions try to give us a \\"new\\" symphony, you notice instead hos unsymphonic the writing is.<br /><br />In the end, it's the Kertesz set on four CDs that I'd choose for a bargain and the Harnoncourt, alsoon four CDs, for the great Concertgebouw and the conductor's bold ideas.ouw and the conductor's bold ideas.

0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is a complex, heart-wrenching story. Anna Fitzgerald was engineered so her sister, Kate, would have a better chance of living through a rare form of leukemia. Kate's cancer has come out of remission and her kidneys have given out, so Anna is expected to donate one of her kidneys. Anna then decides to sue her parents for the rights to her own body. Her unexpected decision shakes her family's foundation to its core and leads them to battle it out in court.    I really love this book. I have read it twice and both times, I finished it in a day. The voices of each character is so real and compelling, thanks to each main character having their own narrative and script to match. It really sets this book apart. I may not agree with each character's actions and decisions, but their motivations show that they come from an understandable, good place. This is true from confused, innocent Anna to her juvenile delinquent brother. I like that in this novel, there are no real bad guys or good guys or a clear defining of what is right and wrong. On one hand, Anna shouldn't have to donate a kidney if she is unwilling, after being poked and prodded for other donations since birth. On the other hand, Anna's mom, Sara, wants to make sure that Kate lives as long as she possibly can. Both sides are valid, but which one overrules the other? Jodi Picoult takes a controversial subject and adds humanity to it.    The ending of this book is amazing, unlike the film adaptation. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but you really won't see it coming. I broke down crying when I read it and I bet you will too. I highly recommend this book.
B002S0OBMS|1.0|It's clear that Mr Webber has indeed gone off the deep end. Using the book \\"Phantom in Manhattan\\" as the basis for this production, Mr. Webber creates a score that more resembles Jesus Christ Superstar than the classical sounds of the original Phantom. Ramin Karimloo delivers as the Phantom, but Sierra Boggess (whom also played Christine in the Las Vegas production of Phantom and Ariel in the Little Mermaid on Broadway) continues to do what she seems to do so well: disappoint. I had my reservations about this production but kept an open mind and after listening to the soundtrack/seeing the production in London, I can honestly say that this musical should have never been made. Why spoil a good thing? The characters have changed completely and not one element of this production stays true to Phantom. Therefore, we can hardly consider it a sequel. To those who are ardent fans of Phantom (and who have an ear for good singing), don't waste your time with this one.
0199537151|5.0|Victor Frankenstein was a precocious child, inspired by and obsessed with the scientists of the past. In university, he continues his obsession, which culminates in the creation of a man made of corpses. As the creature awakens, Victor is horrified and disgusted and runs away. He becomes stricken with illness shortly afterwards and his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, helps nurse him back to health. After four months, Victor finally recovers, only to find that his little brother, William, has been murdered. Sure that the fiend he created is responsible, Victor returns to his home. The tormented creature eventually reveals himself to his furious creator and relays the events leading to William's murder. After his heart-rending story, he begs his creator to make a woman for him who will accept him and become his mate. Victor agrees, but has second thoughts. Should he create another monster like the one already in existence? If he decides against this second blasphemy, what repercussions will he and his family have to endure?<br /><br />Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein is an iconic work that has spawned countless spin-offs, sequels, remakes, copies, and re-imaginings. It's hardly surprising considering the eloquence and skill that she exhibits. With all the allusions and references to literature and works of science, she shows her vast education, which is even surprising today for an eighteen year old. I absolutely love this book, but I used to hate it. I remember reading it as a child and finding it boring and hard to understand. As an adult, I see the different philosophies being illustrated and the significance of its place in the romantic era. It explores themes such as the nature of man, the effect of isolation verses society on man, and the ethics of science. These are themes that science fiction authors are still writing about today, as seen in the film Splice, Scott Sigler's novel Ancestor, and countless others. This is really the epitome of the gothic novel, which conveys its messages with a dose of horror and suspense.<br /><br />The characters and their development is really what makes Frankenstein special. I can see the suffering and anger on both Victor's and the creature's side. Victor is a good person who got swept up in his fervor for science without thinking about the consequences. After making the creature, he tries to move forward with his life, but his past follows him. The creature, on the other hand, is actually a sympathetic character. Far from the shuffling, silent monster seen in film, he exhibits great intelligence and is shown to be inherently good. After being consistently rejected and abused by man, he turns to violence and really only to mimic how people have always treated him. He only ever desired to be loved and accepted. I tend to side more with the monster because he was created and then immediately abandoned with no instruction on how to act or survive in the human world. I find the fact that Victor finds this acceptable and proceeds to further antagonize his creation reprehensible.<br /><br />I could probably go on and on about how Frankenstein is one of the best books ever written, so I'll stop here. This work is still relevant today and can both horrify and interest modern audiences. I think everyone should read this book at least once.which conveys its messages with a dose of horror and suspense.    The characters and their development is really what makes Frankenstein special.

B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|I'll start off by saying I am actually a Disney fan. Liked their old classic animation and am a big fan of their \\"Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Lion King,\\" era. Also like suspending my skepticism and scorn for all the negative Disney reality and taking someone who has never been to their theme park before, especially children and seeing their eyes grow to the size of pie pans.    That said, this Tinker Bell movie does not have the draw or magic of a classic Disney reconversion of a fairy tale or even one of the more modern fairy tales or original Pixar stories of recent years.    I'd have trouble showing this to any young male children and can only picture a very young girl who really like the character of Tinker Bell as being interested in watching the film. It is just one of those DVD's you would rent and have your kids watch once and be thankful you did not buy it, since it would sit on the shelf and never be watched more than once.

B003R0LBVW|2.0|I loved The Corrections and after reading the extraordinary reviews of Freedom in the New York Times and other publications, I pre-ordered the book, beginning it the day it arrived. In the end, I could only force myself to read 250 pages before deciding  the book wasn't worth the investment in time. While I found Freedom quite readable that doesn't mean I thought it was worth reading. I felt no connection to any of the characters. While Franzen describes in excruciating detail every aspect of his characters' lives, he never gives us real insight into their hearts. I simply couldn't care less what happened to them, therefore felt no compulsion to read on. Franzen may be the darling of the publishing world but there are dozens of writers out there who write books that will have a lasting effect on their readers and this one won't.

0765326353|1.0|I just finished The Way of Kings.  It was painful to get through this novel, and took me over a month.  The characters were terribly boring, the plot boring, the names cheesy (Voidbringers? please...).  The only Sanderson books I will read will be The Wheel of Time books (which are Mr. Jordan's anyway).  I seriously have to ask this question: Are his BYU students giving him 5 stars?  If you want good fantasy with rich worlds and cool characters read Song of Ice and Fire.  Sanderson's magic systems are so convoluted and messy it's not even remotely interesting or enjoyable. The characters try to be funny, and aren't. :(  This book is a fail - I am literaly SHOCKED that Game of Thrones and this tied with 4.5 stars.  WOW!!!!!!!!  If you want good fantasy try Wheel of Time, Song of Ice and Fire, or Lord of the Rings....

0374158460|4.0|Friday October 22, 2010 >  \\"Freedom\\" by Jonathan Franzen.  New York:  Farrar,Straus and Giroux, 2010.  562 pages.    The novel is a fast-paced read, especially for this type of book. The characters are well-developed and do go through a semblance of development as the author uses several   techniques to permit the reader to co-analyze with the author as the novel progresses, a progression not necessarily in time but in purpose.  The major question we are asked to solve is exactly what is Mr.  Franzen's purpose in writing the book; and this is not so simple to discover.  After-all, it has all been done before in varied ways by different writers and the degree of relationship among the characters is certainly not revelatory.    So, in essence, the author is allowing the reader to fill-in his or her background perceptions to make the experience somewhat personal, but even in this, we find ourselves wondering why.  And the answer to this duality may be found simply in the basic fact that Franzen is an exceptional writer with myriad gifts which he uses to the fullest in the novel, but unfortunately, unless the reader has some depth in older classical writers, the novel seems to leave quite a lot to be desired.  It is easy to feel that upon completion of the book the reader ( although he or she no doubt experience enjoyment in the reading ), may wonder if Mr.  Franzen has been artfully taking his reader on a journey of personal discovery, and there are as many answers to this as there are pages in the novel, no doubt.

B0040YFR1Y|4.0|First off, every Predator fan should see this movie.  Was it better than the original?  No, but I think it was better than Predator 2 and light years beyond AVP.      I'll talk about the cast first.  A lot of people have problems with Adrian Brody playing the lead and if you're one of those people (whether you've seen the movie or not) I will to try to convince you otherwise.  Arnold was badass in the first film and it would be a mistake to try to recreate his character through someone else.  Getting an Arnold-esque lead would have just been competing (quite lamely) with the original.  Casting buff dudes to fight Predators has already been done, it was done right the first time, and it just doesn't need to be done again.  That said, take a look at Poncho.  That's basically Adrian Brody right there and he was equally respected and just as bad as the rest of them.  He was also the last one to die.  You don't need to be ripped to pieces to be a badass.  Case in point...watch the famous UFC fight between Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock.  So, if you liked Poncho in the first movie, then I see no reason why you shouldn't like Brody in this one.    People have problems with Topher Grace too, but after seeing him in the first scene I knew he was going to be a win.    Alice Braga plays one of the strongest female characters I have ever seen.  She can whoop some ass.    I like the cast and I think it fits with the Predator mindset.  They want to hunt and they want a challenge.  They don't have a favorite body type, just favorite skulls and trophies.  You don't have to be ripped, you don't have to be male, you don't have to be good or bad, or have a certain personality, you can be anything as long as you have a weapon and some fight in you.    Bottom line is watch it.  If you're a fan you won't be disappointed.    [SPOILERS]    Some things I didn't like:  ------------------------------------------------  * Thought it wasn't quite believable that after they landed on the planet their first instinct would be to kill anyone they saw.  Royce didn't have that gut instinct, but I was wondering why Nikolai was going nuts with the chain gun.  He's supposed to be a hardened warrior, but it looks like he's panicking.  Seems like he would just try and figure out what was going on like Royce.  Just wasn't that believable for me.    * The scene where they're all firing into the jungle like in the first movie.  First movie did that, there was a good reason, and this time the scene just didn't carry as much weight.    * \\"Go on!!!  Do it!!!\\"  First movie did that and for a much better reason.  I know they're paying homage to the first, but there didn't seem like a good reason for him to say it at that point.    * Noland's arrival.  Ahhh no......reminds of that kid in Jurassic Park 3 who manages to find a way to survive with all the deadly dinosaurs...cheesy.  Arnold could barely survive a few days with one Pred and this guy manages to survive 10 years with many Preds, dog Preds, aliens, and who knows what?  Just not believable to me.  Not only that, but just like in JP3 how the kid's hair is way too nice and he just looks way too clean...Noland suffers the same thing.  His shirt and face are near spotless.  The only way they really salvaged his character was by making him crazy and wanting to kill all the others so he could take their stuff lol.  I started liking his character more at that point because after living on a planet like that for 10 years you probably would be a little crazy.    * Danny Trejo goes down way too easy.  I wanted to at least see him in a good fight.    Some things I liked:  --------------------------------------------  * Choice of cast.  Already stated, Alice Braga, perfect acting.  Don't see many females who can make badass look second nature, but Braga pulls it off flawlessly.  Adrian Brody, cool, new kind of hero for a Pred movie.  Walton Goggins (Inmate), funny as hell.  Topher Grace plays a good psychopath.  Overall the interaction between all the characters was better than I thought it would be.    * Stayed true to the original look of the Preds.      So, things I didn't like were kind of nitpicky, but there were a lot more things I did like about this movie.  Overall it's a good movie and worthy of the Predator franchise.

B003SWNRU2|4.0|I have to admit, I wasn't different from many others when I'd heard that Accept had regrouped with a new vocalist.  I kinda laughed it off in a way.  I mean, come on!  As solid a band as Accept is, Udo was just so unique a vocalist that you can't help associate him with the band's sound.  Not to mention when they tried a new vocalist before it was less than impressive.  I mean, it's like someone telling you that Mercyful Fate has regrouped without King Diamond and released a new album.  But then again I remember giving Iron Maiden a chance when Bruce left and Blaze stepped in(and God forbid I actually liked him!), and Judas Priest a chance when Rob left and Ripper joined(and I hated him).  Plus, Blood of the Nations had been getting remarkably good reviews across the board.  Hell, Accept deserved a chance too.<br />Well, with Blood of the Nations, Accept took all my skepticism and negative words and shoved them right down my throat!  They did record a good album!  A damn good one!  An....Acceptable one, if you will.  Granted, I don't feel it's quite as mind blowing as some reviewers have stated, but it far exceeds expectations.  Vocalist Mark Tornillo is very, very good and fitting to the band.  He's not simply trying to imitate Udo, which is good, but he does have that Udo-esque rasp with a touch of Jon Oliva and Eric Adams thrown in.  He's very welcome to my ears.<br />Musically, it's Accept alright...Accept of 2010.  This album wouldn't sound quite the same had it been recorded in the 80s, but there is no mistaking the Accept sound.  It's straight up, no B.S. heavy metal the way it should be.<br />If you too are skeptical about this one, have no worries.  In fact, check out the new video from the album, Teutonic Terror, and there you have it.<br />I should have never doubted Accept, they are indeed back.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|Great product very clean and detailed. shows nuances in vocals and instruments only downside its bass light
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I don't have much to add to what the other reviews have specified about the new BD version of RHPS, but I have to say the new 7.1 DTS HD audio track blows all of the other previous home video versions out of the water.  It always bugged me that the stereo mixes on the older versions dating back to VHS and laserdisc merely used the original soundtrack album recording dubbed over the movie soundtrack.  This was most notable during the \\"Time Warp\\" when Magenta would sing.  The vocals in the movie are completely different from the vocals on the album.  The movie has more of a \\"sung live\\" sound while the album is definitely a studio recording.  I'm so happy to be able to hear Patricia Quinn's vocals from the movie now on Blu-ray!  Also, the picture is so sharp that I saw numbers written on Tim Curry's thigh that I never noticed before and I've seen the movie well over 100 times.  My only concern is an odd little \\"beep\\" that happens during the \\"Time Warp\\" when the party-goers \\"bring their knees in tight.\\"  It's a very strange little sound that happens every time the knees come together.  I don't know if this is something only on the 7.1 track as I haven't listened to the other versions yet, but it was odd and I hope not a problem with the audio since it is superior to any other version to date.  The disk also includes the US and UK versions as well as the option to see the first part of the movie as it was originally intended - in black and white!  That was a hidden easter egg on the last DVD version, but it's much easier to access now.  Excellent job on this one and kudos to the team at Fox for putting together such an exceptional presentation of an exceptional movie!

B0021L8UPS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, the acting was great and the writing was good. The only thing I didn't like was the twist, I know it was supposed to be shocking but to someone who loves the horror genre more than thriller/suspense it was easy to see a twist coming, overall I'd say it was a decent movie with a twist that try's to hard to be shocking.
B002E2M5J6|4.0|I didn't see any other Jamiroquai recorded performance.  It's a great show, including almost all the best music from them. The image is good and also the sound.  It'a a great buy!
B002U0KHMY|5.0|If you enjoy a TV show that's well-written, well-acted, highly entertaining, and beautifully photographed, \\"White Collar\\" is unbeatable. Jeff Eastin has created a series that can be watched by all age ranges, because it's short on violence. It's funny and intelligent, and the actors are all terrific. The shots of New York City are nostalgic (I was raised there) and as an added attraction, the wardrobe worn on the show is amazing. What Matt Bomer does for a suit and tie is not to be believed.  If you buy the video, make sure you watch the PILOT first--it's an excellent introduction into a great series. The \\"extras\\" at the end of each disc are also great, from the gag reel to the voiceovers done by Eastin and the actors explaining how certain scenes were done, when ad libs were included, etc. There's nothing better on TV than this show. The Season One DVD will get you all caught up and ready for the second portion of Season Two, airing in January. Oh yeah, the show's been renewed for a third season, no surprise there.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|Great show, great performance, great sound, great image.  The best show that U2 ever recorded!
B000BNX4MC|5.0|No matter how many times we look at this movie, we find more things to laugh at.  Our family quotes lines from it many times.  Enjoy!
B0040YFR1Y|1.0|Unbelievably disappointed!  Not once, but several scenes show a 'predator' removing its cloak and simply standing there and growling all mean like instead of immediately slaughtering whoever it may be chasing.  There's a scene where Laurence Fishbourne's character is talking about how they've gotten 'smarter, and changed up their hunting tactics'.  These tactics include standing around, un-cloaked, and growling.  They've tried to turn it into a horror film.  The main actors fake voice reminds me of batman in 'the dark knight'...He 'growl-talks' and it makes me want to kick a hole in my TV.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|I am not a dye-hard fan of Bond. I just like Bond movies due to: the glamour, the Aston Martin, the bond girls, the secret agent´s gadgets, the luxury locations and the action scenes. That is what pays the ticket.  Regrettably there is little of all of the above elements in this movie. I don't know if it is due to the economic crisis, but this seemed to me a very cheap Bond movie. Two of the supposed locations were Haiti and Bolivia: two very poor countries. There are only two hot Bond girls in the movie, and they are not as glamorous as you should expect. In addition, the villain is not a bad ass character, and in fact, not as ambitious as former Bond Villains.   I had the hope that the title had to do something regarding quantum energy, a bomb of quantum energy, a nuke quantum reactor, a secret weapon of quantum, I don't know, something of high tech, as we are used to see in Bond movies, but the objective of the villain, Greene, is... the water of Bolivia.  How rich can you become by selling water to a bunch of poor inhabitants of a poor country?  Austin Power's Dr. Evil is more ambitious than this guy, or, at least, he has more imagination.  I hope that the screenwriters of the next Bond movies have more imagination.  I give three stars because of the action scenes. I can't complain about them. They are the best of the movie, specially, the chase scenes.

0312600844|5.0|This is Franzen's fourth novel, but only the second that I have read. I read The Corrections quite some time ago; however I picked up this novel not because of The Corrections (because, quite frankly, I don't remember too much about that novel) but because I've heard about this novel all over the place, from NPR to the Times.    Franzen begins by introducing us to his main characters - Walter and Patty Berglund - who are living in St. Paul, Minnesota in a run down part of town. They have purchased a home that can only be called a fixer upper. They seem to be a perfect couple - Walter works and is a sensitive husband to Patty, who stays at home, raises her children and makes staying at home her profession. And she does it well. The novel takes place in the years just following the September 11 attacks. Walter's son, Joey, is Patty's favorite and she becomes the classic helicopter parent to such an extent that she literally drives Joey away - he begins to sleep with the neighbor girl (Connie) and ends up living with her family because he can't stand to be in the same home as Patty.  Jessica is his sister. The story focusses on the questionable choices that each of Franzen's characters make.     I really enjoyed this book - it was a pleasure to read, even in my currently sleep deprived state. Franzen's prose makes it so easy to enjoy this book and to strive to read the entire 500 pages in one sitting.  The characters were well drawn and in depth.  It was a wonderful book to read.    Must add to your collection. I have an extra copy if anyone wants.  Please email me at mkowalewski[at]gmail[dot]com if you would like it. First one to respond gets it. Please include mailing address.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Since this show came on at odd hours and was not really advertised I didn't even know what I had been missing! Just recently got into watching the first season on Hulu.com and was hooked after the first episode. It took me less than 4 days to watch both season 1 and 2, I just couldn't get enough. Great fantasy show between good and evil, great actors and beautiful scenery from New Zealand. If you are a fanatic of the books and want to watch the show just remember the show is loosely based on the books. If you are expecting exactly what is in the books then you may be disappointed. If you are \\"open minded\\" then I believe you can love both the show and the books.<br /><br />So now that I have watched the show I still wanted to show my support by buying both seasons as well as the Terry Goodkind's 1st box set for the Sword of Truth. I usually stay away from reading unless needed but I really think I will enjoy it. Also if you are going to purchase the series or the books, please go through the SaveOurSeeker site so they can earn credit.

030758660X|3.0|This is one I'd buy in a brick and mortar. I see someone else has already run into the 'repeat pages' part.  Every single copy in a local bookstore I went to had that problem.  So there's a huge printing error.  Apparently it's only some printings and not all of them--most people reviewing here are A-ok!  But definitely check!<br /><br />As for patterns, they're cute but nothing really earthshattering to me.  They're nice, and run the range between kitschy and romantic froufrou.

1601252463|5.0|Over all great product, gives anyone in the game a lot more options for PCs and NPCs. Always nice to help avoid the cookie cutterism that you can run into. Although nothing here is required to play the game it does add to the already high fun factor. No complaints or issues on my part.
1405500751|5.0|I thought I knew the story of apartheid.  I believe everyone should read this book.  Amazing convictions and courage!  27 years in prison!  I remember being in college and signing petitions re: free Mandela.  Apartheid was bad, so I signed. If only I  had known the whole story back then!   I revisited this story, as I had read it once before.  Once \\"Mandela's Ways\\" came out, I wanted to refresh my memory.  Wow!  The 2 books go together so very well!
1601251505|5.0|Great product love the game. Includes everything a player will need, and everything a runner will need EXCEPT monsters. Very simple lay out, easy to find and use. Publisher gives great support, but I am worried the over the years the binding might not hold up to well.
030726999X|5.0|The story is fast moving and suspenseful right to the end.  This is the third of a series that should be read in order.  You will love the main character (the girl, Lisbeth) who is a person you normally would not want to even meet.
0525951652|5.0|For those who are like history, this book is outstanding.  I see the 1star reviews for high kindle price, I understand what the people are trying to say but the reviews are supposed to be about the BOOK, not about how much it costs.    Otherwise, the book is simply outstanding.  Detailed history of the biggest upheaval in the Western World -- WW1.  Empires fall, new powers emerge and the world map is realigned.
B001ANYDAO|1.0|It is hard to believe that people would, could and do pay the same for   an ebook as a hard cover edition.

I   will guarantee it will promote life, breath and happiness.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|It would be pretty easy to want every new Robert Plant album to sound like Zeppelin.  Then all the Zep fans would always be happy.  I would be easy to want every new Plant album to sound like his early blues.  Then all the blues fans would be happy.  It would be great if Plant would do just what metalheads want.  Then metalheads would be crazy happy.  Look at the 2-star reviews for this album - a lot of disappointed fans.  But at least they are fans.    I can't imagine how Robert Plant could have planned a better musical life than he has lived so far.  Every new album I listen to I scratch my head and wonder what the heck he was thinking when he put that together.  I play it again and think - \\"That's not right.  I'm not sure I like that.\\"  I play it again, and again -- pretty soon its my favorite.      Robert Plant is like a firecracker.  He goes off and you are alarmed!  But once you get your bearings you think \\"That was fun!\\"

B001I0T92Q|5.0|I have had a psp for a long time but never had a memory card (too expensive)that was more than 512 mb. But this is where this product comes in the photofast is a great idea.  Now i have a 16 gb psp(14gb really) i bought two 16 gb micro sd's but the other one has not shipped.  This product is very easy to use as well.  just insert your msd in slot one and format through a sony product.  THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE with this product is that it is very fragile.  Hold by the sides when handling. But other than me being scared its gonna break due to the fact that it has no weight  its a great product and i am probably gonna buy another one for my other sony products.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|In addition to the excellent re-mastering of Flynn's best film, this 2-disc set offers a truly valuable 2nd disc.  The documentary on how the film was made is superb, with great commentary, a good deal of information on the performers, writers, directors, composers, etc., and terrific off-camera stills.     Flynn as an actor was underrated in his own day, and his name still still evokes sneers from many critics.  But in the heyday of Hollywood, he did what all the actors were paid to do -- give fine performances in films that were meant to entertain.  This is his best work -- then and now, it still entertains.

Hawking has learned how to write 'for dummies' (finally!) although some of the concepts are still a bit complicated to grasp completely (but, hey, physics are an extremely abstract concept per se).     The book doesn't make them less abstract (if anything, I find them even more abstract), but I kind of feel that I can find now a logical sense in quantum physics and physic laws... something very strange, but so fascinating! While reading it, all my Philosophy lessons from high school came back again and again. There you go, I always knew there was something else.     More, please Sir Hawking!    @Ximenads  [...]
0525951652|5.0|Yes, the characters are somewhat stereotyped but no more then the characters in Pillars or World without end.  I loved this book for bringing to life the history of an era that is often overlooked not only in class but in fiction.  I have read reams of books based on WWII, but the fascinating polical and social developments of this era are fascinating and engrossing.      I have read others complain about the lack of strong villains in this story. I think that is actually one of its greatest strengths.  This is a book about flawed but mostly well meaning people struggling to find their places in a quickly changing world.  REad it.
B003YOMNCM|3.0|My title suggests a bit of uncertainty on my part about what I felt listening to this album.    The 2nd part - the Tchaikovsky was a real delight - how can one go wrong with this especially with Hilary involved.      The Higdons concerto... I do realize an award was received for this concerto - BUT my amateurish mind had the following thoughts:  1 - We already have a Mahler!  2 - the words - confusion, pandemonium, chaos come to mind.       I can feel as I sit here many of you being disappointed at my review - If you have any suggestions for me as to how to 'receive' these type of creations - I am all ears.     Be advised - I may have erred and have written this review prematurely as I listened to this album just a few minutes after watching the 2nd part of Real Housewives of Wash.DC - Reunion. It was the very first time in my whole life I EVER felt the overwhelming urge to SPIT ON TWO PEOPLE! The two 'inviting themselves' to the State dinner at the White House. So you may have to forgive me.

B00008CLOA|1.0|I can remember this album from many years ago, yes I/We liked it.  Now about half a lifetime later - I noticed it being widely purchased. Those giving this album 5 Stars need to stop burning your brains with your cell phones!    After thinking about having it again in my music life - I purchased it with much reservation. Upon receipt I loaded it into my SACD player expecting way too much from this album.   It is way overpriced for such little content.      This album is a lot of SOUND EFFECTS!!! A very great disappointment! I knew there was a reason this album was not worth buying - I should have secured it for free from Youtube!    Having entered into the CLASSICAL music world - was I unfair in receiving this album so poorly? Comparing the content to classical music albums? Maybe so - classical music has on the average more than an hour of extremely wonderful music.   Can not understand why this album deserved to be recorded in the SACD format. Days of Future Past - Moody Blues is much more worthy and others of course.     Even the bluesy Diana Kraul and Nora Jones albums FAR exceed the enjoyment levels than this album.    My only added comment....disregard the above IF you still smoke a lot of pot!

B003J27WFW|5.0|Rush is my favorite all time band. I've been a big fan since the early 80s (their peak if you ask me)...so if you are a Rush fan...you will probably enjoy this doc. Plenty of reviewers like me seemed to have...if you're a classic rock fan you might too...but its not automatic. I wish they'd been able to get some more classic concert footage of their early years...I hunger for that stuff. As a HUGE fan of their material from Caress of Steel to Signals...I want to see and hear footage of that period (i know technology was limited then). Thank goodness for Youtube Rush fans who post bootlegs! I loved the footage of a very young Alex and his parents talking about his life choices (school vs music)...I can imagine every kid has had that kind of conversation with his parents. In fact, there's lots of good stuff on the special features disc...    So my recommendation is...buy it. Even die hard Rush fans like me learned something new about their favorite band...and I love having this kind of stuff. I'm glad they let this get made.

0553805371|5.0|It seems that the reviews for this book are all over the landscape; so I figured that unless I gave it one or 5 stars no-one would notice. I'm giving it 5 because there is little, from my perspective, to fault herein.    If, like most people, you have little or no interest in Quantum Mechanics, Cosmology, String Theory, Inflationary Universe, The Big Bang, Multiverses, and so on, then this is just the book for you! The authors make the best quick and accurate summary I've ever encountered and for that alone it is worth your time and money.    That aside one of the issues with this book seems to be that some folks (some of whom posted reviews before the book was released) seem to think that Hawking and Mlodinow were saying, or going to say, that modern physics 'proved' there was no god involved in the universe. While that is one way of looking at it another is to think about the publication of [[ASIN:B00087QUH2 On the origin of species by means of natural selection,: Or, The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life]] by Charles Darwin. While this slim volume will not have anywhere near the the impact in my opinion, the 'punch line' is more or less the same: There is no need for recourse to a god to explain natural phenomenon, all you need to know to understand nature (including the universe) is explained, or will be explained, by science.    Now this conclusion has, predictably, generated a lot of heated comment from those who wanted to say that modern physics (especially Cosmology) somehow 'proved' the existence of a supernatural 'creator' or 'designer' or 'prime mover' or whatever. What Hawking and Mlodinow have done is shown that is an inappropriate conclusion.    Along the way they also dismiss the 'strong' interpretation of the so-called 'anthropic' principle.     One fly in the ointment here; the authors hook their star to M Theory. While that seems, at the moment, the best theory of EVERYTHING, there are detractors out there. When that get settled Hawking and Mlodinow will either have egg on their face or be crowing \\"I told you so!\\"     This is an easy read and even if your intent is to get peeved and disagree, it is worth you time.

0765348276|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could give this book one measly star.  The premise is fantastic, the writing style is reminiscent if later Heinlein (think Lazarus Long) and the aliens well thought out. The universe is not a friendly place, and man is on the bottom. We're everything from food to the galactic morons.  And very often dead.<br /><br />If you're a fan of military SciFi, you'll really enjoy this book - and it's sequels. I'm a fan of Hammer's Slammers, the Lt. Leary series, Honor Harrington, and of course RAH. If that's your taste in SF, do yourself a favor - read this series!
B004615WKM|5.0|I  purchased this album today from Amazon MP3 direct download. Unfortunately i was at work when i bought it and my work's firewall blocked me from getting any of the songs downloaded. Now i'm at home and amazon says i already downloaded and there's nothing they can do.    ***EDIT***  Amazon contacted me and reloaded my download, i now have this whole album and it's amazing!!
076535618X|4.0|OK, I'm ignoring Zoe's, but that' more of a parallel book - not a prequel or sequel. This was more of a \\"behind the scenes\\" of the politics, back-stabbing, interspecies version of Congress....  There was not as much action as the previous two books, but it was a good series wrap-up.<br /><br />It's not a good book to start the series with - that would be either of the first two. But if you have read the previous two books - read this one.
0393072231|3.0|Liars Poker is one of my favorite books of all time so I was very excited to see another book delving deep into the US financial services industry. We hear so much about all of the people who are hurt by the subprime lending crisis, but until this book I literally knew nothing about the rare few who actually benefited from the crisis. Lewis goes into detail on a few characters who had the foresight and intelligence to see this crisis coming. Where this book falls a little short of Liars Poker is that Lewis has to spend a lot of time explaining the theory and structure of mortgage trading. Lewis is a very talented writer and is actually able to pull of this feat, but the reader still has to suffer through many very dry pages with very technical financial terminology used.<br /><br />I felt that the characters portrayed in The Big Short were not nearly as vivid or interesting as the characters portrayed in Liars Poker. This is likely because Lewis was writing about himself in Liars Poker and thus the reader benefited from that first hand knowledge and insight. While I enjoyed The Big Short it definitely does not compare to Liars Poker and certainly is not for those who are not well versed in finance.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I was looking for a watch that looks elegant, but is light weight. I was also tired of arm bands getting broken at the ends. So I was shopping at the local mall when I saw this. I fell in love with it on the spot! I knew this is what I wanted. I found out that Amazon sold it for way less. I still get a lot of complements.     Now for the negative - the arm band is made out of a metallic (titanium?) mesh. I accidentally scratched my hand on a wall and broke one piece of the mesh. It is sticking out and scratches my hand every now and then. So, I went out and bought another Skagen (blue face). I use this one whenever I'm playing sports or doing some 'dirty' work. At the Bahamas I went scuba diving into the salty ocean water and took this baby down with me. For 45 minutes were submerged. I come up and have no problems with this watch. Several months later, no rust. No issues.
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|This is classic Satch at it's best! I was pleasantly surprised with the album. If I had to title this one based on elements from all of the songs I would call it Strange Beautiful Music from the Super Colossal Crystal Planet of Joe Satriani.
B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|For those who love all things Tinkerbell, you will be blinded to the mediocrity stored not just on a regualr DVD but also blu-ray. Thankfully this will keep your child (if they like this genre) occupied for about an hour so it can't be all that bad. My niece didn't complain but complaining is not in her nature so I probably didn't get an honest opinion but she did watch the whole thing. According to my brother, she has not since watched it however and when she really likes something she will read/watch it to death. This is not of one of those marvelous kids movies that even parents like however.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|Okay, the books were terrible and the other two movies were so poorly written I can't believe I actually sat through another one - but I did.  If it's at all possible, this one is even worse than the other two.  The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because the were-kid is pretty hot.
B0041OOJNU|3.0|For me the album is a miss. Shakira is on her never-ending quest to record music using influences from other countries of the world. This time she's turning to merengue. As a whole, the album sounds like it's been thrown together from unused songs from previous recording sessions and cover versions.     Hits:    Loca  Antes de las Seis  Rabiosa    Misses:    Gordita  Addicted to You  Islands    So now I have to wait another four to five years for yet another disappointing album...

B0045ZAQSM|5.0|If you're a fan of the German-born (of Turkish heritage) filmmaker, Fatih Akin, you will - like me - run not walk to see his latest creation, 'Soul Kitchen'.  Akin's masterpiece is, of course, the unsurpassed [[ASIN:B0009VND0E Head-On [Gegen die Wand]]] - one of the best five movies you'll ever see.  His [[ASIN:B001DB6J82 Edge of Heaven]] comes very close to repeating that magic.  Fans of Akin know that in those two works he delves deeply into Germany's rich and widening cultural and demographic ties with Turkey.  In fact, 'Edge of Heaven' starts in Turkey and takes us back and forth across the two countries.<br /><br />Here, Akin turns his storyline to another ethnic community deeply embedded into the fabric of German society: the Greeks.  Adam Bousdoukos (Akin's co-writer here - he had a bit role in 'Head-On') and Moritz Bleibtreu ([[ASIN:B0030Y1282 Baader Meinhof Complex (2pc) (Ws Sub)]]) play brothers Zinos and Illias Kazantsakis respectively.  Zinos is the entrepreneur in the process of re-inventing his erstwhile greasy spoon restaurant.  Illias is his ne'er-do-well brother who needs Zinos' support to make his terms of prison parole stick.<br /><br />Unlike his two previous films, Akin displays a flair for comedy here, though - Akin being Akin - even the laughs have an edge and manic verve that gives you a product a fair pace from light, breezy Rom-Com or Judd Apatow territory.  That fact is underscored when the inimitable Birol &Uuml;nel pops on to the screen as tempestuous chef, Shayn Weiss. &Uuml;nel's trademark intensity is seared into the eyeballs of anyone who's seen 'Head On.'  His portrayal of Cahit Tomruk in that film was nothing short of remarkable.  &Uuml;nel plays a supporting role here, but you can't take your eyes off of him any time he's on the screen.  In 'Soul Kitchen,' Chef Weiss' irascible nature hardly conceals his immense talents in the kitchen.<br /><br />Also good here are: Pheline Roggan as Zinos' long-time first girlfriend, Nadine; Anna Bederke as bartender/waitress/object of brothers' affection, Lucia; Wotan Wilke M&ouml;hring as over-the-top property developer/villain, Thomas Neumann; and - best of all - Catrin Striebeck as an imperious, exacting restaurant inspector.  She's a unique beauty who never holds anything back on-screen./object of brothers' affection, Lucia; Wotan Wilke Möhring as over-the-top property developer/villain, Thomas Neumann; and - best of all - Catrin Striebeck as an imperious, exacting restaurant inspector.

0439796636|5.0|I became intrigued about this story from a friend who had a stopover in London and saw the play.  He related the presentation of the horse on stage and how technical with various movements.  I was interested in the background where the story originated.  So I looked up Amazon.com website and queried the information.  As usual, Amazon had the book and other background information.  I ordered the book and it met my expectations.  When they (Spielberg) produces the full-length movie, I hope they don't hollywoodize too much.  Although the senselessness of World War I could be emphasized. Not many knew what they were fighting for and did not know they were sowing seeds for the Second World War. However, this is a great horse story within a historical setting. I think tagging it further would demean it.
030716327X|5.0|I always choose this book as a gift for a first time mother to be.  It's the most wonderful first book to read to a baby.  I've been purchasing it for many, many years.  It's a keeper!
B000000OSG|5.0|Geesh, I still remember that late summer night when UYI I and II went on sale at midnight.  We thought we were the stuff being some of the first in Little Rock to get our hands on these babies.  Never thought that 20 years later I'd be writing my review of this now classic CD.  If for no other reason, it is worth it just to be able to listen to \\"Estranged\\" at will.  This is my absolute favorite song of any genre of all time.  There is not one filler song on this disc.  \\"You Could Be Mine\\" (Terminator 2 Soundtrack) got all the airplay along with \\"Yesterdays\\".  An alternate (and better) version of \\"Don't Cry\\" is here.  And for those who didn't know \\"Knockin On Heaven's Door\\" before the Guns N Roses - \\"Live at the Ritz\\" concert, it's here in it's studio-recorded form.  I guess this wasn't a review after all, just some recollections and facts.  That was a really good investment that night in September 1991.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|In many ways \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" is the sequel to \\"Gimme Shelter\\", the classic Maysles brothers film document covering the Stones brilliant yet ill-fated 69 tour.  Here we are, less than 3 years later, the band roster still intact with Mick Taylor, and the Stones as dynamic as ever.  The music is flawless, the set-list is fresh and invigorating, and the added musical dimension, the horn section, launches the Stones down a new live-music direction that will last another 40 years and counting.    But something has changed in the 3 year span between Gimme Shelter and Ladies & Gentlemen.  Mick Jagger is still sneering, strutting and effortlessly controlling the vibe of the show, but he is now detached from the audience, no longer reacting with them or affected by them.  It is more of a \\"show\\" now than a communal experience, but it's still the greatest show on earth.    The camera work is a complete immersion into Mick Jagger, rarely cutting him out of a shot for more than a few seconds at a time.  The crowd is only there in sound, not a single audience shot can be found.  Jagger performs to a great black void interrupted only by the blinding cone-like spotlights following his every move.  The result is a feeling that we as viewers are sharing the stage with the greatest rock 'n roll band in the world.  We see every facial expression of each band member, we see the as yet unstrained rapport between Mick and Keith, and we even hear Mick's throaty moans underneath his harmonica playing.    The film is a combination of several shows, with several mysterious costume changes from Mick, and it ends too soon, leaving you wishing for more songs, but the end result is a perfect capture of the Stones at the end of their peak.  Within a few years Taylor would be gone and the Stones would evolve more and more into a shadowy parody of their glorious past.
B00007KQA3|3.0|Imagine a world where every aspect of your existence is dictated, and you are told to lie to give a better picture for whoever is running the government.  Imagine your vocabulary is being dumbed down for the sake of expediency, and that sexual pleasure is forbidden.    1984 is that depressing, and even though I thought it was an excellent film, I just couldn't get myself to watch it over and over again like I used to with a lot of films I really liked.  There's a bit of \\"hope\\" given at the end, but it's like the circumstances given to these people are really so deep in the grey that you ever wonder if anything will change at all.    Me, I prefer a comedy or an epic if I want to see drama.  This film is pretty sadistic, and I'll leave it to you as to whether you want to chance it or not.      Me?  I actually own a copy, but I'm thinking it would do better as a library donation.

0756404746|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've ever read.  It is so astounding how much happens within the front and back covers.  I have read books that flow well, but this is simply flawless.  It is descriptive without actually being too descriptive, just enough to let your imagination create what the book doesn't describe and pulls you in.  The only draw back has been the lull between books, but I am eagerly awaiting the second book.
B000069AT7|5.0|Product was exactly as described and arrived a couple of weeks before the expected delivery date.  Very satisfied with the product and the vendor
0887081770|5.0|Great book for any kid. My grandson loves the moon. Every night his parents have to take him outside to say goodnight to Mr. Moon. He became interested in \\"reaching/touching the moon.\\" I happened upon this book and the rest is history. Great experience for any parent or grandparent. I have found that, most of the time, a story works so much better than a long-winded explanation. Let the children use their imaginations. A joy for all concerned.
0385738757|5.0|This book is a sequel to The Maze Runner and it picked up right where The Maze Runner left off. They could be one continuous book. I liked that. I hate it when a book in a series gives lots of recap as if I would read the 2nd or 3rd book in a series without reading the previous book(s)first.    The direction the story took in The Scorch Trials was similar but also very different than its predecessor.    This book was more violent, and harsh than the first. I liked this and think it gave it more realism, especially when considering that the majority of the characters are teenage boys. The language while still very PG/PG13 was taken up a notch which I think made it more believable.    The story continued to grip me and I couldn't put the book down! There were some scenes that were so intense and real that I really felt some anxiety. I say this as a compliment. One scene in particular quite frankly, freaked me out a bit! It was AWESOME!    The plot twists, action and mystery continued in this book. I loved it.    If you haven't read the Maze Runner, then you should! If you have, then how is it possible that you haven't yet read The Scorch Trials? It is a must read!     I can't wait for the next book!
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|Wow, I am really shocked at how good this movie was, I knew it was the new re-boot to the predator franchise but I just didnt picture it being anything like this.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|Usually I have major problems with disaster movies because the characters and plot get lost in all the action packed special effects. Even most of the acting takes a backseat but with 2012 it's a little different. At times it can be very silly and over the top but to be honest this movie was so intense I didn't pay attention to the faults of this film. I just didn't care. 2012 honestly kept me on the edge of my seat most of the way through and let me tell you the special effects were mind blowing! Absolutely remarkable! It's worth watching just for the visuals alone, seriously. This is the real purpose of CGI. Everything nowadays is too much CGI and it's ruining films in my opinion because it's over-used in films that don't need it. For something like this that goes beyond anyone's imagination is just perfect and done correctly. Critics will find a lot of things wrong with this movie because it's not perfect, nor is any movie but this is just pure entertainment at its best. It's intense, sad, and quite sickening how selfish some people can be when the world has turned into complete chaos. Kick back and enjoy this jaw-dropping visual treat!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I think this movie is a true masterpiece of cinema. So beautifully woven together - the music, the cinematography, the screenplay, the performances, the art direction, the love story. It all works together on so many levels and this movie touches me more deeply than most of the movies I've seen in my life. I went to see it like five times in the movie theater and I felt as if I had traveled to another place without even leaving my seat! It's that much of a cinematic experience. A LOVELY PIECE OF WORK!
B00382S9N2|5.0|A true American Movie Classic.  I never tire of watching this movie and will continue to watch it again and again.

B000EWBKK8|4.0|I still enjoy the movie quite a bit, but I was disappointed that the blu ray version didn't deliver the full promise: the picture quality was rather good at times (e.g. bullet & cartridge scenes), but only average when shooting outside e.g. in the scenes in Africa which could have been amazing if shot properly. Audio was good, though.    Summary  + Movie, its characters and storyline  + Audio  - Picture quality should be better on Blu Ray
0545123283|3.0|I really enjoyed Shiver, and was glad to read the sequel... was looking for closure for Sam and Grace. But this book is not going to be the last. I really feel that the Shiver and Linger story line could have made a really good single book; instead they are ok (very wordy) two books.<br />The creative aspect of Sam loving poetry and constantly writing little lyrics in his head was great. I really liked Sams character.<br />I will say, if you have read her other books- Lament or Ballad... Shiver and Linger are better than those.

B002ZG99CM|5.0|After Jaden Smith completed his role in The Pursuit of Happyness along side his mega-hit father Will Smith, it was assured that Jaden had the chops to join the family business. Jaden's mother is actress Jada Pinkett Smith (currently starring in TNT's \\"Hawthorne\\"). Both parents wanted their son's next major role to fit his abilities and they decided to produce an updated version of The Karate Kid, the smash teen hit in 1984. According to the Smith's, the vision of the film was not complete without securing Jackie Chan to play the role of the boy's mentor and trainer.    The Karate Kid, known internationally as The Kung Fu Kid (and perhaps a better title for the film) was shot mostly in China. The plot is identical to the 1984 version: boy moves to strange new town, boy get's bullied, boy get's trained to fight by wise, older martial arts expert, boy seeks revenge and learns many lessons along the way.    The Karate Kid, released this weekend , is indeed a film worth viewing even if you are especially fond of the original. It is difficult to remake a film that was as popular as The Karate Kid, but this film accomplishes the task and brings more sophistication to the story than the earlier film. Both of the film's stars do not disappoint. Jaden, believable as the new kid in a strange land, portrays vulnerability when needed and obviously trained for the fighting scenes.     Jackie Chan is spot on as the kung fu master and it is a treat to see another side of the actor who normally plays in more comedic films. The Smiths secured an all access pass to China, including a look at the Forbidden City. The cinematography and the film's score were enjoyable and impressive for a film catering to younger viewers and it is nicely cast with Taraji P. Henson portraying the mother and Wenwen Han playing the boy's first love interest.     The kung fu scenes are well done but may be too much for smaller children. All in all, this was the perfect movie to be released as school breaks for the summer. It's a film that the target audience will certainly enjoy and their parents will be taken back in time to their first \\"Karate Kid\\" memories and be glad that their children now have a film of their own.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|Natalie Merchant takes a series of classic poems and creates a portfolio of different musical styles, from sea shanties to movie themesongs to nonsensical romps - beautifully.    I ordered this completely blind - no advance listening - so I really wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  However - I appreciate it more with each listen.  I have long been a fan of Merchant's voice, and am awed with admiration for her work on this particular offering.  Not just her voice - which is in fine form, indeed - but the Songs themselves, the arrangements, and the talented people who surround her all combine to make this a superior effort.    The ones I find myself listening to over and over:  The Peppery Man - I envision myself in a smoke-filled bar with this one  It Makes a Change - quirky and fun  Adventures of Isabel - zydeco goodness!  LOVE this.  Indian Names - melancholy  Griselda - another smoke-filled bar  The Land of Nod - dreamy movie theme song-worthy.     Buy this if your taste in music is eclectic.  Buy this if you like Natalie Merchant - even a little bit.  Buy this if you are well-read.  Buy this if you are interested in music that is far above the banal.  Buy this if you are tired of cookie-cutter anything.
B001UV4XX8|5.0|I hardly ever rate a film a perfect masterpiece, but this mysterious science fiction tale is destined to be a cult classic. Don't let the slow pace of the film tune you out, the character actors shine and the cinematography, set design, props, lighting, and costumes are breathtaking. The script is smooth and the plot is mind bending. The directing is just right.<br /><br />I won't give the story away. I could not give it justice in a review. This film is a must own on blue ray, and trust me you will want to view it again...
B001U9BRNE|5.0|This is a great blu-ray we have many and this one is in the top 5 music videos that we have to date.
B001AQR3IU|3.0|I had the DVD and was upgrading to blu ray.  I'll tell you there wasnt much of an upgrade.  CG parts are still fuzzy, and the rest of the movie didnt look much better.  totally black scenes and night scenes didnt have as much artifacting as the DVD, but there was still some where i expected total black.    my opinion:  If you have the DVD, stick with it.  The blu ray version isnt worth it.
B002GOAH1U|5.0|Firstly, I must say thank you for the quick response to my order. Not knowing anything about the movie, but liking everything Colin Firth has starred in, I was keen to see this one which I found on the net. It was most enjoyable and different from his other movies. He's such a versatile actor and am keen to add to my collection of his work.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|I saw this group performing a single song on Spinner.com.  I was taken back by the soulful performance by the lead singer and great backup and musical presence.  Now that I have the album, \\"Strange Arrangement\\", I think I've found a new favorite soul performer.  WOW, who would believe he used to be a DJ and had all this performing talent going to waste.  I highly recommend this group if you like soulful performances!

0385343248|3.0|This book was about 400 pages too long.    You would think that with everyone running around, drunk, with swords, there would be a fight every once in a while! Right?  WRONG!!!    It's a fine novel, well written, filled with subtle political manuvering, betrayal, love, lust etc... The only problem is that there is almost ZERO action in a novel that is going to take you 3 weeks or more (probably much more unless you have an hour train ride to-and-from work like I do) to read.  I don't know how many times I read something along the lines of, \\"He leapt to his feet in a blood-thirsty rage to cut down the samurai standing before him, but restrained himself, and apologized.\\"  If I had to guess, you will read a line similar to this about 20 times.  No joke.    I mean, this is a book about a flippin' SHIPWRECKED PIRATE who becomes a SAMURAI!!! Is it too much to ask for a little swordplay every now and then?    You will not care about a single character, aside from the protagonist and you will probably start skipping every other page once you get close to finishing this weighty tome so you can start reading something else.

B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I am attempting to avoid spoilers as I write this review. Prior to viewing the film I expected to see \\"Gladiator\\" set in Medieval England -- with Russell Crowe playing Russell Crowe. I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals are stunning  and I found the acting to be very good. I was particularly pleased with the portrayals of Queen Eleanor and William Marshal -- historical persons placed in an appropriate context. This latest screen version of the Robin Hood tale depicts a time period later than most of the films that preceded it. I was impressed with the manner in which the historical record has been maintained while allowing the fictional characters to be involved in the events portrayed. This is an excellent addition to the Robin Hood canon and should be viewed by anyone who enjoys the Medieval period. I look forward to the sequel.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I don't want to say a lot about this film other than to say that it is incredibly underrated right now, and I'm really sad to see it did so poorly in the box office. It took a funny, nerdy, action movie to places where no one else has been bold enough to go, and did so in a way that I guess isn't accessible to a larger audience, but if this film doesn't become any kind of cult classic, I'll be double-disappointed. It functions on the level of a big Hollywood picture without selling out or trying to go easy on the audience, and even if you don't outright get everything that's happening, it's incredibly entertaining if you're willing to meet it at the completely-not-serious level that it's purposefully functioning on.<br /><br />However, it's full of a lot of things that push people's sensitive buttons -- Michael Cera, things that are vaguely \\"hipster\\" (though it mocks all of them), and nerdy video game references. How everyone who ever sincerely enjoyed a Zelda, NES, or arcade game didn't go to this movie, I don't understand -- I suppose a lot of people deny that inner child part of them now because it's \\"uncool\\" to be a \\"nerd\\" (though the story isn't even about nerds, it's about absurd hipsters in a band).
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|Just had to start off by saying that there's probably one F bomb uttered every sixty seconds in this film, and that's hardly an exaggeration. It didn't bother me at all, just something to be aware of. Kids typically love films like this, but the course and grim reality of this is so true to life, you leave the film wondering about the possibility of survival -- and not the possibility of it being a reality.<br /><br />This rebooting is more like a a very serious homage to Schwazenegger's [[ASIN:B00005221L Predator]] by John McTiernan. The attention to detail with the genre, this very interesting species and the idea is very carefully drawn throughout and artfully executed. The production value and originality is so well done, it hearkens back to the first [[ASIN:B00000ILDD Alien]] film by master film-maker Ridley Scott. After reading all the reviews, including the most noted one from Chicago, ahem, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who thought this.<br /><br />The film is lush, noir and very disturbing. This film touches of Hemingway's [[ASIN:0684830485 For Whom the Bell Tolls]] and Richard Connell's [[ASIN:1604500298 The Most Dangerous Game]], which was the favourite reading material for the Zodiac Killer, who also looked at what he was doing as hunting.<br /><br />Adrien Brody is probably the biggest surprise of this, as one wonders if he could pull a role like this off. He does it so well, I wondered why hadn't he tried other similar action films before. He's incredibly convincing and has very good, but not campy, Batman voice that seems to nod directly at Christian Bale for emoting emotional darkness.<br /><br />Very glad that creative and intelligent minds are keeping this idea and franchisee alive. Well done. Can't wait for another.<br /><br />For the record, this was an idea that Robert Rodriguez came up with back in the  1980's after watching the original Predator film. This was also one of the first, of several, Screenplays that he wrote. His original screenplay was rewritten, adjusted and re-visioned however as the writing credit goes elsewhere. He talks about it in the special features and also the Director's commentary.<br /><br />...and re-visioned however as the writing credit goes elsewhere.

B000AGTPUK|3.0|The theme of this film - believing in the xmass spirit - didn't quite work with me.  I watched this with my kids and while they enjoyed it, they though a lot of it was rather strange.  First there is the spookiness of certain aspects of the train, like the bum who seems to live on the roof and appears at dangerous moments.  Then there are the sudden flights on huge hills or around the town at the N pole.  The kids are suddenly in an adventure that you know is destined to turn out OK, so they are there to use the special effects and maintain interest.  (The technical quality is also low, with wooden movements by the characters and gestures that don't look all that real, though perhaps we are now spoilt by Avatar.)  Finally, you get the xmass themes, but they are weirdly done, with creepy-looking elves you don't know you can trust.<br /><br />The best part of the film are the personalities of the kids, in particular the 3 principles.  There is a skeptical boy, a lonely black child, and an inhibited kid who probably comes from an unhappy or dysfunctional household.  They do interact well, even if they don't quite look alive.  You do feel some of the magic of xmass thru their eyes.<br /><br />I would recommend this tepidly.  It isn't awful, but I would never say it is great.
0385471378|5.0|I had been wanting to watch the movie for a long time and just hadnt. Then in one of my classes we were assigned this book (didnt know the movie was based on a book). Read the book, in spanish, and I LOVED IT. Growing up with a very strict Mexican culture, there were times I could identify with Tita. The movie follows the book exaclty,but a shorter version obviously. I usually dont read romance books, more into thrillers, but loved this one. HIGHLY RECOMEND.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|To start this off, I am 18 years old, so my views may differ from some of the other reviewers out there. With that being said, I love anything that has to do with World War 2. I first saw Band of Brothers a few months ago, and I loved it. It had great special effects, and it just made you feel like you were there with the soldiers, suffering, and fighting for your lives.         When The Pacific came out, I just had to get my hands on it. I don't know why a lot of you are saying that it is better than Band of Brothers because in my opinion, I thoroughly enjoyed The Pacific more. It seemed like it had more character development which got you really attached to the characters and made it devastating when you had to see one of them die. Not only that, but having to see how they had changed when they got back. In the case of Eugene Sledge, at the beginning of the series he is full of life and just wants to go to war. At the end of the series he is completely changed, and that just broke my heart how he no longer seemed to care about much.          One other thing that is just amazing about this series is that it doesn't just concentrate on the war parts (the parts that I was originally watching for), but it also shows the characters relationships outside of the Marines. A good example of this was Robert Leckie who found happiness in Australia only to have it taken away.          There is no shortage of bravery and loyalty in this series either. John Basilone who received the Medal of Honor was then sent home to help sell war bonds. He first liked the attention, but soon he no longer liked everyone knowing him, and realized he may have made a mistake leaving his comrades during the war.         So if it were up to me, I would have every high school showing this to their students. Its a very emotional and heart touching series that shows just how cruel war is. And believe it or not, it even got me to further research the characters involved in the story and find moreinformation on all of this. Now imagine that, a series that can get an 18 year old to study American History. Good job Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.

B0000E6XH3|5.0|The DVD came in a small box, well wrapped except for one flap that was partially open, but the DVD was in no risk of falling out.<br /><br />The movie itself is wonderful quality, and upscales on a Blu-ray player nicely in the movie. Menus with static pictures do not scale so well, but it was not as noticeable.<br /><br />Otherwise, the sound, and video are exactly as I imagined they would be. Spot on.
B0029JA32K|5.0|I have read/studies at least 20 chess tactics books and this one (with its companion book) is by far the best. The author not only give great examples of tactical motifs but he goes into incredible detail explaining the thought process one should follow when looking for the tactic in question. An example would be when he explains that anytime two of you opponent pieces and your knight are all on squares of the same color and in close proximity you should look for a fork. This seems self explanatory (after he tells you) but I just never approached looking for forks that way. Go to the authors website to practice your tactics and to find more info on these books.

B003Y8YXH6|1.0|I am apppalled by this whole thing. Hey, why not change the lyrics and arrangements while we are at it? Although John Lennon preferred to work quickly, part of his genius and gift was his intuitive sense of what worked and what didn't in the recording of his songs. Strawberry Fields, anyone? Tomorrow Never Knows, Revolution? The production surrounding the song was as crucial as the song itself - not an afterthought or a by-product. To strip away something away so vital and symbiotic to Lennon's art is not understand the artist at all. Would it be acceptable to erase a few strokes from a Picasso painting to make it simpler? Or edit a few lines out of Shakespeare to make it clearer? Hey, let's remove a few instruments from Mozart's scores while we are at it...

0439023513|3.0|First off, I would like to praise Suzanne Collins' first two books...\\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fires\\". These two books generates constant suspense and just kept me up at night to read til the very end. So I was very excited to read \\"Mockingjay\\", the final book of the series. But what a big disappointment this last book turn out to be!! My sisters are a fan of this series, too, and they were also very disappointed by the final book. The story was so slow paced. And many of the storylines in there are repetitive and irrelevant.. just in there to drag the story longer. I am so glad to finally get this book over with and move on to another more exciting and interesting book!!
1400052173|5.0|I have personally read this book and then, purchased same for my endocrinologist to read, whom was exposed and studied using  the HeLa cells. He was appreciative of this book which gave him a little more insight to the HeLa cell uses and abuses. I recommend all Lab Doctors and the regular Family doctors, as well as Research technician doctors, read this book. Part of the proceeds, of the purchase of this book, are  go to the remaining family members whom, by the way, never received a cent for the usage of the Henrietta Lacks cancer cell usage, which by the way, are still growing after 50 + years since the original harvesting of the cells. And the remaining family members have no medical insurance.  Eric Wolfe= Pennsylvania
0596101996|5.0|The author knows what he is saying.  Although JavaScript is loosely typed and flexible, if you don't know the intention of each of its object and \\"type\\", your code will be a mess, and debugging on messy JavaScript code is painful. David Flanagan guides you to avoid that mess.    If you want to know more about the exact inner working (i.e. specification) of the built-in functions of a JavaScript implementation, then ECMA-262: ECMAScript Language Specification would be an excellent friend of this book.    If you are confused sometimes by some design issues of JavaScript, then the book \\"JavaScript: The good parts\\" by Douglas Crockford and the tool JsLint of the same author will teach you to use JavaScript in a much cleaner way.    Douglas Crockford recommends only this book.
1569242739|5.0|Just recently have I found myself to be intolerant of eggs and dairy.  What a shock after 50 years....of eating and cooking with these basic ingredients?  This little gem of a cookbook has turned my kitchen into fun again.  My husband can't decide which cupcakes are the best, so I'm making them all!!  Precise cooking tips and information on where to find ingredients that I've not used/purchased before is so helpful.  Thanks, gals, also for your fun commentaries! I am already accustomed to high altitude changes that must be made for baking; these tips are not included in this cookbook.  You'll have to do that yourself! Great vegan cookbook!
B002NXPTDK|5.0|I am not sure what to classify his style as but I am sorry to say I dismissed him last year when his album came out, & the song, Night & Day came out, but, last night,  I took a chance thanks to the $5.99 deal Amazon advertised & stumbled onto this album.  I played it on the way to work, & those kicker subs I have in my 06 Mitsu Lancer, really got a workout.  Not only does most of the tracks hit hard, he has this sound, & effects which are outside of what we normally hear from rap artists, & his laid back vocals just sound as smooth as the other side of the pillow.  I wanted to kick myself for only discovering this amazing album by accident.  I say to anyone who loves hip hop, Tupac & Biggie are my favorite artists, but this is different, & just grabs you.  Let's be honest, most of the hip hop stuff we get now is crap, & we should appreciate artists like this, when they come along & others like B O B.  I love this album...

B003R7L1CE|4.0|I travel internationally a TON with work and at my age (45) staying relatively fit is a challenge.  The concepts and exercises Mark shares are sound.  It meshes well with my home gym Crossfit Norwest and has given me some new ways of staying fit on the road while keeping the workouts interesting.  It is a good book and a good read.  However, I personally see this book as more of a reference book and therefore would suggest getting a hard copy versus the Kindle edition.  I plan to do both now.  If you are looking for new and interesting ways to increase your fitness, or challenge yourself, regardless of your current fitness level this is a worthwhile purchase.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I've always loved Accept.  So many of these older bands are getting back together, for a quick paycheck, it seems.  Most of them have new albums, and most of them are a shadow of past glories.  Not Accept.  New singer, Mark Tornillo, sounds just enough like Udo to do the old songs justice and to sound 'Accept'y, while still having his own definite style.  The new songs are definitely the equal of their older material, and having seen them live, I can also report they sit nicely amongst the old stuff in a live setting.  The album is chock full of instance anthems like Teutonic Terror and Pandemic.  This is not the sound of people looking for a paycheck, but a hungry band setting out to please their fans, and themselves, with pure, authentic heavy metal.  You need this CD.
0312600844|5.0|4 1/2 stars, actually.    This book will get you thinking, and talking, and wanting shake everyone of these people (including the country as a whole at times) as we watch these characters navigate around their notions of loyalty, desire, and disappointment.  Think of Anne Tyler's \\"The Amateur Marriage\\" set against the political landscape of post 9/11 America.    This is book about loyalty.  Loyalty to friends, to ideology, to Country, to our troops, to our community, to our Earth, and mostly, to our family.  Of course, no book could be about loyalty without also exploring the notions of betrayal, which Franzen's characters do in spades.    If you've read other reviews, there have been many comments about characters being \\"likable\\".  I'd like to just make a case for reading the ENTIRE book (I actually listened to the audio but will be getting a hard-copy to keep) before dismissing these characters.  Many of the character's motivations aren't explored until well after Patty's initial autobiography.    Also, note that who you \\"like\\" and who you sympathize with will change throughout the course of the book.  In the beginning, we don't particularly \\"like\\" Patty.  But we have to remember, we get to know Patty through her autobiography, which we know from the beginning of the book is being written as a form of therapy to work through her depression.  WE don't like Patty because PATTY doesn't like Patty.      As the POV changes, following Joey and Richard and Walter, none of these characters are nearly as sympathetic in their own stories as they are in Patty's.  Indeed, just as her self-loathing makes her character \\"unlikeable\\", the men in her life are much more sympathetic in her biography than they are when we actually get into their heads.      Also, though each of these characters make questionable moral choices, Franzen doesn't let any of them off the hook.  Each is punished, some cruelly, for their mistakes.  One character's fate is even reminiscent of characters found in the morality tales of Greek tragedies and Victorian literature.  Surely, Franzen's choices for his characters have stirred discussion and even controversy, as we watch the story unfold and discover who was able to crawl from the abyss and who never returns.    One issue I had with Franzen's disjointed narrative is that at times the transitions between one story/POV and the next can be jarring.  Franzen will take you to a climax, only to interject a long section of backstory into one of the character's histories.  As a way of prolonging the tension, it's somewhat effective, though at times the interruption is so abrupt that Franzen makes it too simple for the easily-distracted reader to get pulled out of the story.  Allowing the audio book to pull me through these transitions was a welcome benefit.    I'd like to also comment on the onslaught of 1-star reviews.  Anyone who is rates this book a 1, but finds it well-written or thought provoking, has had the extraordinary privilege of never actually reading a 1-star book (unintelligible, pedestrian writing, plot holes, etc).  Franzen's story may not be for everyone, but for avid readers of women's fiction in particular, it's a great opportunity to read the familiar, personal themes (fidelity vs. betrayal, love vs. sex) intertwined with grander ideas of ecology, economy, and politics.  You don't have to agree with the characters choices or ideas to find value in reading them.    Stick with it (listen to it if you have to) and you'll be rewarded.

B00408MS5S|5.0|As a die-hard Supertramp fan I just had to have this deluxe edition of one of my all time favorite albums.  I really had to have it for the second disc of unreleased live tracks from 1979.  I do wish that they had a stand alone live disc release with of course more live music from my all time favorite band,  but I still have to give this 5 stars because its just great to have some more live stuff from them,  especially Goodbye Stranger and Oh Darling which we don't have any recorded stuff with them on it.  Of course I like it all.  I won't quibble about what it doesn't have,  but I'd really like to have another double live album like Paris and also for the price here a DVD would be nice to have as well.  Like I said though,  for die-hard fans it is a must.  I don't think the sound is any better than previous remasters for the studio album,  but it does sound really good though I am not really an audiophile.  Also,  for the rare chance there is someone on earth that doesn't have this album,  it would be a great version to get.
1439181780|5.0|\\"The Power\\" is a book that gives you insight into the law of attraction and provides you with hope that you can put your life back on track if it's not on track. I also enjoyed \\"[[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]]\\" which is much richer in terms of input from various experts. I really like it when the author does a good job in researching other schools of thought so you know that he/she really is knowledgeable on the subject. For this reason I extremely enjoyed \\"[[ASIN:1451594364 Read Me I Am Magical]]\\" - there is so much information included on happiness, personal empowerment and how to get there. Having read the three above mentioned I kind of have the feeling I won't need any other book for a long time. I really recommend getting this package, these books changed my life.

B003O2RQKI|5.0|Watching Lang Lang tackle Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata is like watching little David felling Goliath. Lang Lang's technique is eye-popping and his interpretation is from a youth with much feeling and strength. This is true of his whole program which includes the Beethoven C Major Sonata Op.2, No.3, Albeniz's Iberia Book 1, Prokofiev's Sonata No. 7, and three Chopin encores: the Aolian Harp Etude, the Heroic Polonaise, and the Grande Valse Brilliante. The picture and sound are excellent. You can't go wrong buying this DVD. It is much more valuable than the surprising low price for which it is selling.
0596805888|5.0|Cooking for Geeks is one of the most fun books I have read in a long time. I don't get lost in the kitchen, but I'm certainly no great chef either. What this book does that is different from typical cookbooks is that instead of presenting a list of recipes, it talks about the science behind combining foods to create tasty dishes.     The book starts with an introduction to the kitchen; to tools, equipment, organization, and a way of thinking about them that is clear and easy to understand in the geek mindset. What does that mean? Those of us who call ourselves \\"geeks\\" have a certain way of looking at the world. We like to break things down to their components. We are not satisfied with only knowing what things do, but we want to understand how and why things work the way they do. That is what this book excels in teaching.    Chapter topics include science-based discussions of flavors, ingredients, temperatures, cooking time, and more. These things are directly related in the text to results. The information is presented in a manner that is easily understood by people used to changing one parameter over iterations of a process to discover what effect that one parameter has on the outcome. I like it.    This is not a reference book, which is what I consider most cooking related books to be. You don't pick it up and say, \\"Let's look for a nice dessert to make for when Aunt Mardella comes to visit.\\" Instead, you get something more valuable; the ability to look in your cupboard to see what you have, understand how those things could fit together to make something wonderful, and pull something together based on your understanding of the ingredients, processes and interactions available. That rocks! For this reason, the book receives a very high recommendation from me for anyone interested in learning about the science behind cooking (and there are some very interesting recipes included as well, so if that is what you are looking for, you won't be disappointed either).
0380799006|5.0|My husband and I read this book in 1989 after the birth of our second child.  We have since had 2 more children, two young adults and two teenagers now.  I am convinced the advice we read in this book was directly responsible for the relative peace we have enjoyed in our home.  All siblings are going to experience conflict, they learn valuable lessons about human interaction from these conflicts.  While our children did argue with one another, we implemented the advice from this book and did not get involved.  They were allowed to resolve the conflict without our intervention and thus learned valuable lessons about conflict resolution.  Our kids are great friends and make plans to be together.  They support one another in their various activities and we see very little jealously.  Our youngest is academically advanced and was asked to take the SAT's (at 13) the same year his older brother was to take them in his junior year of HS.  The older one was happy for his brother and said he hoped his younger brother scored higher than him so he could brag to his friends.  While I would love to take the credit for creating young adults who support one another so unselfishly, I have to give credit to the authors of this book for teaching us how to make that happen.   Read it, implement it, and live it.  You will not regret it!
B002ISID10|5.0|I will not go too deep into it, but this band ROCKS.  I listen to A LOT of music in this genre, and I was incredibly impressed by this album.  The talent of this band is top notch.  Bringing everything from super super heavy drums, guitar and vocals; to great singing and outstanding guitar work.  Not to mention the keys and techno is an awesome addition that keeps it from getting anywhere near boring (even on the 30th listen!)  If your looking for fresh, outstanding, ground breaking new albums.. Look no further
0312600844|1.0|I bought this book retail( I NEVER do that). I usually like the Oprah Book Club Selections. I stuck with this book for 280 pages. Then, I realized I don't have to finish it. It is just a book after all. So, I skipped to the last 5 pages and I was done with that heavy albatross of a book. What is the big deal? I did not feel empathy for any of these characters except, the husband-father who married this whiny woman. Then he became \\"weird\\". This book seemed to drone on forever. Lots of the story line was borderline hustler forum material. I am glad so many people liked it but, I am not among them.

B0015DROBO|5.0|There is a great deal to like about Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" As a mystery author, I was particularly enamored with his restraint in using tension and violence sparingly. All too often authors ratchet up the tension to such a degree that the story loses its ability to shock and surprise.<br /><br />In this book of over 600 pages you can count on one hand the number of scenes where the protagonist, Michael Blomqvist, was in imminent danger. The same holds true for the girl with the dragon tattoo, Lisbeth Salander. Yet the novel is accurately described as mesmerizing, refreshing, and a dark-hearted thriller, by three major reviewers on the back cover.<br /><br />Larsson pairs a journalist and a security investigator, who works almost exclusively on a computer, to uncover a 40-year-old mystery. Instead of writing to the lowest common denominator, Larsson unveils a large cast of complex characters with engaging histories. The fact that this novel earned tremendous popularity is a testament to fiction readers' desire to cast aside the cookie cutter in favor of a truly unique perspective.<br /><br />RJ McDonnell<br />Rock & Roll Rip-Off<br />2010 Mystery/Thriller Novel of the Year - Premier Book Awards<br />[...].
B002ZG98LO|4.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />I was around to witness the first Predator in the movie theater, and I loved it, re-watching it many many times in my teen years.  Did not care for Part 2, and absolutely hated the AVP crossovers.  So along comes this movie, with a small dude in the lead role, and an almost identical setting as the first.  Why not just call it a remake with horribly bad casting?  I had no hope of liking this movie, but I thought I'd give it a chance anyway just to see \\"how much is this gonna suck?\\"<br /><br />Well, the answer is: not at all!  The original set the stage for this one, and I fully appreciate that, but this is a far better movie than any other in the franchise, including the first.<br /><br />Adrien Brody is spectacular in this, and was actually a perfect fit.  As far overboard as Arnold took his character, this is how grounded and real Royce feels.  He's the good guy, but even the good guy has his flaws, just like everyone else.  And, by the way, those flaws are totally understandable.  Amazing job.<br /><br />Mirrored scene: the way the Japanese dude stood up to the Predator, similar to the way Billy tried to hold his ground on the bridge in the original.  Different result though, and one of the coolest scenes in the movie, very similar to an old Kung Fu/Samurai flick.<br /><br />I loved the way the Classic Predator was smaller and weaker than the Black Super Predator, as if to say, \\"yeah remember that one that Arnold killed, weak.  This one is the real badass.\\"<br /><br />Another small touch that I really liked was the fact that the guy and girl both survive.  In the original, it was all about \\"I'm the tough guy, I survive on my own.\\"  Well, times have clearly changed: \\"We, as a couple, are stronger together.\\"  Huh.  Family values creeping into a gory action flick.  A nice touch, I thought.<br /><br />One reviewer said that he had to wait an hour for the action to start.  I have no idea what he was waiting for.  The opening scene shows the main character waking up in freefall onto a mysterious alien planet.  And from then on, the action is relentless.<br /><br />So, I went into this movie expecting a complete mess, and I ended up going on a wonderful ride.  The best action movie I've seen in a long while, and I expect many repeat viewings.  The bar has been set to a new high for the Predator franchise.ien planet.

0385732554|4.0|As every Newbery Medal winner, The Giver is a very well written children's book. Its deceptively simplistic language reveals a rather horrifying dystopian world. This is a world where people are not given freedom to decide anything for themselves - their spouses, children, careers, future, even clothes or haircuts are all pre-planned and pre-selected for them. They are not allowed to even own their feelings and dreams. Their sexuality is suppressed. Of course, it is done for common good - to preserve peace and serenity, to avoid any disturbance, be that war, hunger, over-population, or simply personal discomfort of pain. Only two people in this community are able to understand what people miss out on. The main character Jonas is one of these people.<br /><br />The Giver is a good book, but:<br /><br />- it is too young; experiences of a 12-year old are too simplistic and lack edge for my liking;<br /><br />- in terms of dystopian setting I found a couple of Lowry's aspects of the Community hard to accept. I believe that no matter how restrictive and oppressive a society is, feelings of love and attachment to one's children or parents remain intact, unlike in this book where family connections are very easily severed and forgotten. Secondly, this story claims that people do not experience a feeling of love, for instance, because they don't have a memory of what it is. IMO, feelings are not something we learn or recollect, this is something that we experience involuntarily.<br /><br />In spite of my complaints, I am interested in reading the sequels.

It is a refreshing approach and although I had to reread a few things to understand what he meant, I enjoyed the nice view of the world through the eyes of a 5yr old and the \\"word sandwiches\\" were great! I use to play that with my kids :-)     It had many twists and even though I tried to surmise, I was always wrong! Nice change from the predictable.

0060899220|3.0|If you are like me and love food, watching Top Chef and Food Channel, think that cooking is art, an outlet for creativity, consider chefs featured on such shows (including Anthony Bourdain) as super-sophisticated artists, you are up for a surprise with this book.<br /><br />Bourdain definitely crushes all preconceived notions we might have about the industry. You remember those foul-mouthed, unkempt, ever-fired-and-hired kitchen workers with shifty pasts you've come across at some points in your life? I thought I simply had a misfortune of working in crappy places, but, apparently, all cooks are exactly like that! There is no such thing as a sophisticated cook, according to Bourdain. In his book, cooks are a dysfunctional lot - drug-addicted, unable to hold a \\"normal\\" job, people from the fringes of the society. Actually, Bourdain is one of these people himself. He supports this statement by numerous stories of his drug-, crime- and sex-infused culinary career. As for artistry in cooking, there is none. Cooking is all about mindless, unvarying repetition. Only a few executive chefs in high-end restaurants have a luxury of being creative with the food they make.<br /><br />Besides the anecdotes about dysfunctional kitchen workers, Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly is a sort of biographical account of Bourdain's cooking career. He talks about how his love for food came about. He takes us on his life journey - from a dishwasher in a seaside joint to an executive chef position in a swanky NYC restaurant. He describes his experiences in failed and successful businesses. Offers practical advice about the industry and food. The morsels of wisdom I am taking away from this book are: don't order specials and don't attend brunch buffets (apparently, both are dumping grounds for old leftovers); don't eat at places with dirty bathrooms; vegetarians are crazy and sickly people who can't be trusted.<br /><br />As a narrator, Bourdain is very entertaining. He is a no-nonsense, no-holding-back kind of writer, sarcastic and witty and, I assume, quite honest about his exploits. One does start to wonder however if he is laying the bad boy thing a little too thick. It is interesting that in spite of his years-long heroine, cocaine, and alcohol addictions and his bad behavior at work, he not only managed to line one chef job after another in decent places (no McDonald's and Shoney's on his resume) but maintained a marriage as well.<br /><br />While I thought the book was entertaining, I finished reading it thinking it needed some editing help. First, it is not very well structured, the narration is not cohesive in any shape or form, it reads like a bunch of anecdotes thrown together in no apparent order. The stories of debauchery become repetitive and redundant by the end where I started skipping chapters because none of it was new. Finally, seeing some pictures of people and places Bourdain talks about would have been great too.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to all food lovers and especially people who are toying with the idea of becoming restaurateurs or cooks. The author's advice and warnings about the business are sound. I, personally, am convinced not to ever get involved in this business, in any capacity, and will try to continue enjoying food knowing what actually goes on behind the kitchen doors..

1439102937|4.0|Fans of Lauren Weisberger's The Devil Wears Prada and Everyone Worth Knowing will find her third novel, Chasing Harry Winston an enjoyable addition to their bookshelves.  As with her other books, Chasing Harry Winston revolves around women who are shells of themselves until a specific defining moment makes them reevaluate their lives and come out supposedly stronger and more empowered, regardless of the often stupid mistakes they have made along the way.  Chasing Harry Winston is unique in that we have three main characters- each with their own set of issues- one who feels trapped in her life, another who desperately wants to hold onto her life, wealth, and beauty as long as possible, and another who, well, desperately needs to become more \\"experienced.\\" The three girls, all best friends from college, make a pact to change their lives in some way within a year.  The book follows the escapes of each women over the course of the year, making the reader laugh and cringe while taking the reader to places like Paris, swanky parties in New York, awkward social events, glamorous Hollywood, and the lazy Hamptons.  Most of the plot development and the conclusion is quite predictable but that doesn't mean you aren't satisfied with the book when you finish.  For those of us who like to have an easy, breezy, carefree book to read while unwinding before bed, passing the time on a long flight, or lounging on the beach, this is a definite read.  For those of us who are into complex, sophisticated plot lines, advanced literary techniques, and gut wrenching drama, this probably is book that will not hold your interest for very long and will have you rolling your eyes by the first page.  In comparison to Weisberger's other two books, I would have to say it definitely ranks third in terms of enjoyability, plot, and character development.
B0032JTV74|4.0|Glee is the zeitgeist of our times tackling issues like teen pregnancy, gay bullying, and divorce with humor and wit.  The musical numbers are also amazing and has produced a version of \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" that is even better than the original.      The minus one star is because the blu ray dvd gave me some issues, taking many tries to play despite my having the latest firmware.  Likewise some scenes appeared very grainy, almost in SD.  I think I would have gotten the same quality with SD and an upconverting dvd player.

1401223176|5.0|This is the comic book that got me into comic books. Jim Lee's beautiful artwork caught my eye right from the start, and the story features a veritable who's who of Batman's friends and foes. It's not an earth-shattering, genre-redifining story, and I wouldn't want it to be. It's an entertaining, gorgeously drawn detective story that reintroduced me to the most awesome fictional character in history: Batman.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Once is, quite possibly, the most epic symphonic metal album ever made. Without a doubt it's Nightwish's crowning achievement, album of the year in 2004, the quintessential female-front metal/symphonic metal album, and, in my humble opinion, the best symphonic metal album released thus far. Yeah, I know, really hard to follow up those statements with a review, but I'll give it a shot.    First, let's talk about the most popular song on Once: \\"Wish I Had An Angel,\\" which is also the most popular Nightwish song to date. This song is also one of the band's heaviest songs, with heavy guitar riffs, drum beats and heavy use of Marco Hietala's growing vocals that take \\"Wish I Had An Angel\\" to a darker, more metal place than Nightwish has been before...not to mention the more explicit lyrics and highly suggestive bridge, which is not exactly typical for Nightwish, but it all just works here.    Some of my other favorites on Once include the haunting \\"Nemo,\\" which begins with a simple piano tune before growing into a powerful metal tune led by singer Tarja Turunen's opera vocals. \\"Planet Hell\\" is also another highlight, especially how it utilizes choir vocals and Tarja's emotional vocal range, combined with the rocking guitar riffs and the epic bridge that takes the music here to another level of awesome. \\"The Siren\\" is another groundbreaking tune, stretching Tarja's vocal abilities in ways the band hasn't gone before. \\"Ghost Love Score\\" is perhaps the biggest progression for the band's sound, since it completely utilizes a complete orchestra and effortlessly weaves the orchestra together with the metal, the choir and Tarja into a harmonic symphonic of power. My personal favorite on this album, and my favorite Nightwish song of all time, is \\"Dark Chest of Wonders,\\" a pulse-pounding symphonic of high octane metal and soaring vocals that gets me all hyped up every time I listen to it.    The most unexpected song on Once is \\"Creek Mary's Blood,\\" which features the voice and musical talents of John Two-Hawks, and tells of Native American struggles. Between Two-Hawks' Native American pipes, the full orchestra section, the epic choir vocals, Tarja's operatic voice and the amazing array of hardcore metal, Once touches on an unheard-of range of music in just one album, and includes some of the most innovative music out there.    Once is perfect for fans of female-fronted metal, symphonic metal and Nightwish. Even if you're new to the genre, Once is a great album to start out with. Just be careful, you may get hooked.
B000V5TV22|5.0|I bought this GPS antenna to go with an ALK Co-Pilot GPS program that I installed on my laptop.  It works great, was easy to install, and cost less than half what ALK (or any GPS vendor) was asking for the ALK version.  I have used it extensively between the East Coast and the Rocky Mountains without any problems.
1400063515|1.0|Do not buy this book, although it is cheap.     I have scanned through the first two chapters, another Wharton graduated wall street lunatics who feels superior with regard to science and philosophy. It's full of repeated message, jargons, which should really be two paragraphs.     Is this why he is blindly proud of himself? You could be smart, but talking down others only proves your prowess deeply within.    I will keep reading and see if my impression will change.
B0044430H8|5.0|\\"That was an awesome movie.\\"<br />\\"Yeah it was.\\"<br />\\"I wonder if the soundtrack is available for sale yet...\\"<br />\\"Haha, really babe?  Really?\\"<br />\\"Yeah, really.  I wonder if--oh snap, five dollars?  Really?  SOLD.\\"<br /><br />That right there should sum it up for any of you teetering on the edge after watching the film.  I'd just gotten done seeing it with my girlfriend and couldn't get \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" outta my head.  Coming home and hopping on Amazon, I was more than surprised that it was already available for download, and for such a ridiculously low price.<br /><br />But back to the review at hand...<br /><br />Trent Reznor did a beautiful job with the scoring of this film.  From the very opening sequence, the music lets you know, in no small way, that there is something distinctly wrong in the world of Mark Zuckerberg.  Such dark tones I'd actually more readily associate with films like \\"The Dark Knight\\" or even \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", but in the end, they fit well within the world of \\"The Social Network\\".  The electronic aspect of the music is a given, given the subject matter of the film, but the way it jives with everything that's happening onscreen is just phenomenal.<br /><br />I concur with other posters: If you're reading this, you're clearly needing the extra push to make the decision.<br /><br />Consider yourself shoved.<br /><br />BUY IT NOW.
1400031524|2.0|Perhaps it is unfortunate that this is the only Henning Mankell book I have read, because I would never read another of his \\"mysteries\\" after this.  Having been rather disappointed by the PBS renderings of his works, I now commend them on making them as interesting as they can.      What a dull book this is. Perhaps if written as a very short story, it would have been OK.  But the characters and situations are dull,  the plot almost non-existent, and little or no suspense for the reader.  I finished this book only because I wanted to see if in the ending there would be something which made it worthy of publication.  Sadly, there was none.  Save you money and time, if you like tightly constructed and well written mysteries.
0763617105|5.0|I am especially fond of this book because I am a Small Family Daycare Provider. The sentiment of Owl Babies is sweet and engaging It's hopeful for little ones who understand mommy leaves sometimes, but always comes back. The pure joy of the reunion is blissfully illustrated. I've been reading this book to 2-3 year olds for years and I still get excited by the ending :) Also, because it's a favorite, I give a copy to each child when he/she graduates.
B0000A118M|5.0|Words fail. Inspiration overflows.<br /><br />There is a reason that so many musicians - and non-musicians - hold this album in awe to this day.<br /><br />In my own humble opinion, this is the greatest recording I have ever heard. The sheer power of this music overwhelms all who can hear something of what it says. It is from the soul, but not sloppily, not \\"free\\", not randomly. It is music by absolute masters at the absolute peak of their powers. They have been assembled by their musical and spiritual leader to give thanks directly to God - whatever form that may take - with nothing between them and that \\"audience.\\" What they create, what they unleash, are 4 movements of overwhelming candor, of unrivaled expressiveness. The minor blues forms are deceptively simple, hypnotic at times, but these four are masters of the blues, and the Tower of Babel they assemble on that unshakable foundation succeeds in reaching the heavens.<br /><br />It almost trivializes the accomplishment of this recording to praise the stunning technical mastery on display by Coltrane, Tyner, Garrison, and Jones. Rhythms fly on and off the mainline, but remain unfailingly - and at times astonishingly - true to the time. Listen to Elvin's rim shots in the first movement, amid the blurring polyrhythmic overlays.<br /><br />This is primal scream, prayer, and devotion by geniuses. It is Picasso's Guernica, Michelangelo's David. It is my first and only nominee for greatest American contribution to world culture.<br /><br />For those who can't hear it, don't blame the album. Try to listen and learn the language. If it continues to make you uncomfortable, then consider the possibility that things that reach your soul hit too close to home.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|A superlative documentary and probably the best Michael Moore has produced so far which should be compulsory material in school and university curriculi not only in the States but also in Europe; alas the major media owned by Murdoch and his fellow oligarchs in the US and Europe continue to ignore this outrageous master piece! Capitalism  describes vividly and funnily at times through eloquent images of decent hardworking Americans and authoritative testimonies by academic, political and church representatives how predatory and immoral financial capitalism has replaced productive capitalism , ruining millions of families in the process and the real economy.    All this happened  whilst scores of Wall Street crooks and criminals became rich beyond belief thanks to the banking/financial deregulation they and their accomplices in Washington pushed through the White House particularly under Clinton's presidency. The same people who orchestrated and benefited from this financial looting have been appointed by Obama to resolve the problem they created!! So much for a President who promised change but is obviously in the service of his oligarch friends/supporters instead of serving the interests of the American people including the millions who trusted him! Except for Madoff no criminal prosecution has been initiated by Obama's Justice Department against any of the dishonest banksters and regulators who benefited from this latest financial bubble.    Particularly compelling are the testimonies (Special features of the DVD) of Harvard Prof. E.Warren, Prof. W. Black  and Journalist/Writer C. Hedges  3 honourable and distinguished Americans who dare to condemn in no uncertain terms the arrogant and criminal nature of this parasitic type of capitalism which robs with impunity the wealth created by others .    Capitalism a Love story is an ideal and intelligent gift to make and  should be shown on all the oligarch controlled mainstream media (wishful thinking of course) in order to hopefully  stop and punish the criminal oligarch parasites who are responsible for the economic devastation and financial misery we are witnessing today in the US and Europe.
0545123275|5.0|Short and sweet version?  I recommend this book to anyone looking for a star-crossed love story that almost reaches in, physically, and tugs your heart along with it.  How I'd describe this book is \\"quiet\\"; quiet, like the first heavy winter snow on a mountain, where no one's around for miles and miles, and the snow shines more silver than a lake under the moonrise.  It's poetic, and brings out quiet feeling, feeling that the lovers, Grace and Sam, feel so deeply, it's like one of his songs running through your head.  I can't describe it any better than this.  Suffice to say, if you are looking for a true romance, that just happens to feature humans that turn into wolves, and a story that COULD actually be, somewhere, happening right now, do not pick up the hyped book-rags you see pushed in bookstores and theatres everywhere now.  Read this book... and fall in love.
6305291446|4.0|After Halloween The Curse Of Michael Myers Jamie Lloyd being killed Donald Plesance passing away. He carried 1, 2, 4, 5 & 6 he really helped make those movies great & gave it continuity. Halloween H20 came out 1998 big hit directed by Steve Miner starring Jamie Lee Curtis who came back as Laurie Strode she really carried this movie. Josh Hartnett as John Tate Michell Williams as Molly Jodi Lyn O'Keffe as Sara Adam Arkin as Will Brennan LL Cool J is in it he wasn't bad he's better than a lot of other rapper's that act  Chris Durand I liked as Michael Myers  & Jamie Lee's Mom Janet Leigh makes an apperance. Some hate H20 for ignoring 4-6 that was a problem I had cause they are movies that are out there to buy or rent. But I like 1-H20 some  more than others. Ok you start off with Marion Chambers from the 1st 2 movies she was Dr. Loomis's nurse. Her house has been broken into Michael Myers has went her office looking for the file I believe he was originally looking for his then 3 year old grand nephew Stephen but he found something better a file that says Laurie Strode. Michael quickly desposes of these 2 teenagers kills Marion he's going to Califonia. Laurie now under the name Keri Tate has lived in fear that her brother will come come for her. She has a son he doesn't like her rules. Michael arrives at Summer Glen & quickly gets a great kill on Sara & Charlie. Laurie & notices her son didn't go to Yosmite & Laurie & Will go find him Michael is after John & Molly they are saved just in time. Will is killed Laurie tells John & Molly \\"Get the F  **k  out of here!\\" This is a great moment & this is how you do paranoid Laurie. She's not emo push over that you don't root for  like Sçøüt T?ÿlør Cømptøñ. Battle all through the school but there 1 scene I like oh they think Michael's dead but Laurie doesn't & she does the smart thing. She  takes a van he's in drives out of town Michael gets up she hits the break Michael goes out head 1st Laurie rams him the van goes down a cliff & Michael's sandwiched in between a tree & the van she show's no mercy at all everythings been put right end of series ownage! Way to to end the series JLC thumbs up. No Akkad had to go & make Gød dæ** HR not. This should've been the last Halloween. Steve Miner hit a home run with film. Out of the 4 Halloween's Jamie Lee Curtis were in this was my favorite Laurie Strode. Josh Hartnett was ok not a favorite but he's hit or miss. Michelle Willams was ok. I also have the workprint & it has longer interviews that weren't on the DVD. I really want a true special edition.Just going to throw this in this was on FX just now & it has scenes that weren't in the theatrical version  I'm sure everyone knows about the TV version It has some extended & deleted scenes the scene with Will mentioning his past should've stayed in. It makes me wounder how much footage  was cut out. Halloween Resurrection will be next.
0743454537|1.0|Plot Spoilers Below!  I'd like to preface this review by saying: 1.   I have NEVER in my life written a book review, let alone posted one on the internet.  2.  I finished the book several weeks ago and it took me that long to even be able to write about it.      I chose the book because I'd heard so many good things about the author (maybe that was my first big mistake).  I was engaged enough with the various characters and interested enough in the plot to want to continue reading the story.  That said, I found Sara unredeemable.  The pain of dealing with one child's fatal illness was the only real part of the novel--it is truly a mother's worst nightmare and a heartache I hope to never encounter.  The idea that your other children should suffer pain, fear, abandonment and absolute neglect is criminal.  While Sara was plotting ways to save Kate's life, Jesse was developing a sociopathic personality.  And guess what?  Nobody noticed or even cared.  I could not get past this nor could I forgive Sara.    Next, on to Anna--the genetically engineered donor.  In my opinion, the purpose of the plot/story was to explore the idea of creating a child expressly for the purpose of serving as a blood/organ donor to the sick sister.  As Anna grows older, she wants to have a voice and make the decision to help Kate her own (gee...what a concept...).  Again (this is just my opinion), Anna's purpose in the story is to find a voice; to make her own choices.  Clearly, once she reaches teenage-hood, she should be given the right to choose what to do and hers is an all out fight for independence.  Well, Anna finally gains her much deserved independence only to have the author rip the rug right out from underneath her feet.  Her cheap plot device which is meant to pull on heart strings and induce tears from the reader's eyes (I can really see no other purpose) completely takes away Anna's voice and any hope of freedom.  The WHOLE story was about Anna searching for the right to make her own decisions and Picoult takes that away from her at the end of the story by permanently silencing her.  And who makes the decision to save Kate's life by donating Anna's organs?  Her attorney/legal guardian of all people!  How disgusting!  How could Picoult have possibly undermined Anna any further?    So what was to be learned?  One's independence is not worth fighting for because fate can intervene at any given moment?  I have this to say about author Picoult:  She didn't have the nerve to go where she tried to take her novel.  I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if Anna had truly succeeded.  Kate would have died.  Clearly that would not have been an ending Picoult could live with.  Why even go there with this book then?  I will NEVER read another one of her novels.    Enough said!

0061997811|5.0|This is the MOST amazing book I have ever seen. $40 seemed expensive, but after seeing this book...it is a steal! The book alone is worth more than 40 dollars. THe information, pictures, interviews are all a dream come true to a Harry Potter fanantic.

142311339X|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I feel that this series has the potential to surpass the Percy Jackson series. Perhaps due to the fact that each of the three main characters narrates different chapters, the character development is excellent. In fact, I kept realizing as I read the book that these characters are much better developed and in many ways even more likeable than Percy. Leo, in particular, comes across as very true-to-life, and some of his scenes are quietly hilarious. The humor in this book -- with Leo, the Coach, and even some monsters - far surpasses that of the books in the PJ series. It's a very intelligent book, and I kept thinking how wonderful it is that kids will be learning so much as they immerse themselves in reading. (Okay, not just kids -- many of us adults are also learning a whole lot of things about mythology that we probably should have learned long ago!) The only thing I was wishing for was a bit more time spent at Camp Halfblood with the 'old' characters. Overall, an excellent book! These should definitely become classics.
B00008EY7H|5.0|I can never get enough of the Cirque du Soleil shows. This review, however,  is more of a review of Amazon.com and their procedures to correct a problem.    The DVD that I received had one bad sector in the middle of the show. It would start to stutter and continued for several minutes. I contacted Amazon, gave them the information and a new DVD was immediately on the way. Packing and return instructions were added and the entire process was made pain free with no unpleasant incidents.    Way to go, Amazon. Not a lot of you out there.    Ron Nelson

0316017922|2.0|\\"Outliers\\" is an incredibly condescending book, actually offensive to most of his questioning readers; in fact his 'groundbreaking work' is simply an entertaining book of anecdotes.      I have to admit that I was psyched to read this book, having much enjoyed \\"Tipping Point\\" and finding much insight into the past few decades' analyses of such trends and of how people succeed, especially those of \\"innate leaders.\\"  However, this book is a disappointment in most ways, and I found myself arguing with him in the margins constantly while reading.    For one, the basic premise seems to be that all Americans (perhaps all people?!) are enamored with the success of the \\"self-made man\\" (this book completely leaves out one of the most important factors of all: one's gender).    He bases his argument from the start upon the assumption  that we (Americans) view all success as being from talent.  This is so painful to anyone who has lived during the past century.  the \\"self-made person\\" is so riveting to us BECAUSE IT IS SO RARE!  His arguments, backed up with very little data and some truly bizarre anecdotes might have been news in 1900, but he idea that  \\"NURTURE\\" (environment, connections, opportunities) can be just as important as \\"NATURE\\" (or genes, talent, ambition, etc.) is simply a no- brainer from the start.  Well, yes, he is right: Environment is important (along with the languages one speaks, the background culture, one's family life, etc.) in creating so-called Outliers.      WE KNOW THAT!    why do parents hold back a young kid in kindergarten...  why do parents try to get their kids into the best elementary and high schools, into the best music and athletic programs, overschedule their time, move into 'good neighborhoods', and struggle financially to get their children into 'Big Name' schools where the kids may have netwoorking, mentoring, and other opportunities that might lead them to success.   No news here.      Also, what is success?  This may seem simplistic,but one cannot write an entire book about it without being clear of its parameters.  Gldawell certainly does not seem to equate success with \\"happiness\\" or a productful, useful life - one factor of success that Americans moreso than other nations have in their Bill of Rights as a valid goal to reach for.    Is it just $$?  It is still not clear to me.    Then, I was disappointed at Gladwell's bizarre  examples (often using only ONE statistic or data point!) to support some of his theories.  E.g., sorry, but I don't believe he even scratched the surface when looking at \\"Asian\\" talent in mathematics by discussing Chinese work hours in rice paddies - especially when he bases his comparison upon one (controversial, b/c non-historical) book that discusses the life of farmers in one area of Flanders in 1844.  That is NUTS!  You have to be kidding us...there must be something more here...      In high school, I would have been sent back to the drawing board with an order to gather more research and revise my conclusions-- by any teacher who read such an argument...  Where are the documenting sources?  and in what way are you comparing these 2 very small samples?  It's comparing monkeys to oranges.  His arguments simply do not stand up to any sort of analytical analysis...    And the BIGGEST disappointment for me was that Gladwell HAS uncovered some interesting trends and examples and theories that are worth exploring.  But \\"Outliers\\" seems like a band-aid applied to a problem when the author decided that real research, and re-thinking, and revising theories, and all that time-consuming data an real scientific analysis just wasn't worth his time.    I am concerned that this book is garners so many positive reviews among various online reviewers (and even among some professional book reviewers).  Very concerning for a bestselling book that is a font of specious arguments, mass disinformation, and which advocates an incredibly easy and non-reflective way of looking at our world and trying to find the \\"causes\\" behind the \\"effects.\\"   Yikes.     Its only value that I see is in the questions he brings up about WHY such trends seem to happen... which indeed, are worth studying.  But in a real, thorough, and non-biased way.  Alas, poor Gladwell... Another sloppy (self-help?) book centered on key questions that lack real, believable, actionable, or proven answers.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|If you likes the first two as I did , you will like this one. You could never replace Arnold , but this is back to the original formula . My favorite science fiction movie of 2010. It is much better than the last one. Just don't expect the 1st one...you could never match it.....you already know the premise now....so don't expect surprises as you had in the 1st one. If you watch the details of this one , there is a lot of subtle info that you are probably missing. I went to the Predators website and it gave a lot more background info that you may not realize unless you are extremely attentive in the movie. Like there are 2 different types of predator in this movie and they have different weapons. One is more advanced in a lot of ways and bigger. A lot of people missed this , but it is obvious if you pay attention.
B000J103N4|5.0|I discovered this album by way of the Neil Young Archives Vol. 1... the 'Music is Love' track is included in the Archives in 192/24 resolution (which is great by the way). Based on that single song, I decided to track down the album this track was originally on... and in the end, picked up this DVD-A/CD combo from Amazon. Wow- this is *really* a good listen in my opinion... very nice audio quality- even in straight dts 3/2 (I don't have a DVD-A player, only a SACD deck)... very nice flow to the songs, and very nice use of the surrounds (I'd rate the surround mix a 10- it's that good)... and some really great guest artists to boot!    Drop the lights down, get comfortable in your sweet spot, get your DVD-A player ready to go (or use legacy dts 3/2 if you really have to), turn the sound up a bit... and enjoy the musical trip. Truly the road less traveled (for me anyway)... and definitely worth checking out.
0739334085|5.0|I am generally not someone to favor audio-books over a regular hard-cover or paperback. Reading I reasoned, required effort on ones part to have some meaning. I tried the audio-book by Obama just by chance; it had been right there in front of me on a recent trip to a public library and remained intrigued by the audio-book \\"read by the author\\". So I immediately checked it out and proceeded to give it a try in my car's CD player while driving around.     Obama's mastery of language, his powers of analysis of the current economic, environmental and security situations in the United States and abroad, his superior powers of persuasion, his studious and rigorous policy descriptions, all are unmatched by his wit and ability to tell stories. Hearing the audio-book is a delight! Put simply, he reaches out to his audience and touches them...    Substituting the regular programing on my car's stereo - conservative radio talk shows - for Obama's audio-book for about a week reminded me of St. Augustine's description of the seven step in the ascent of the soul. He said that \\"the good angel touches the soul sweetly, lightly and gently like a drop of water which enters into a sponge\\". Obama's words on his audio-book are like water entering that proverbial sponge. I wish the man well

0439023491|5.0|The beginning of Suzanne Collins' second book in the Hunger Game trilogy was slower than I expected and definitely slower in comparison to the first installment in the series. Nevertheless, the action quickly picked up as our beloved characters were once back thrown back into the Hunger Games. Even though I wanted to shake up Katniss and wished her to make up her mind about her feelings and her future often times, the author did a fantastic job building up the characters, emotions and their relationships even further.<br />This was a very satisfying read and I absolutely CAN'T wait to get my hands on the last book of the series.<br />These books have definitely been one of the best I've read for a while.

0316069485|4.0|Mickey Haller, high-wattage  defense attorney and central character in several Michael Connelly books, changes his spots in \\"The Reversal.\\" Haller is persuaded to be a prosecutor in the retrial of a 24-year-old murder case, reversed due to new DNA evidence in the New York Times Number 1 best seller.<br /><br /> Haller agrees to take the case on two conditions: Haller can use LAPD Detective Harry Bosch as his investigator; and Los Angeles District Attorney Gabriel Williams must let him make all the necessary decisions.<br /><br /> \\"This isn't a campaign stop and it's not about money,\\" Haller tells Williams after a press conference. \\"You want me to get a conviction, then get out of my way.\\"<br /><br /> The two men are assigned to build a case against Jason Jessup, convicted of a brutal child murder. Jessup now walks free, but Haller and Bosch know the man is guilty. Proving it, however, will be problematic.<br /><br /> Heller has lawyered up with Clive \\"The Barrister\\" Royce, a slick defense attorney who \\"still carried an English accent even though he had lived more than half of his fifty years in the United States.\\"<br /><br /> In addition to Bosch as his investigator, Haller has an ace up his sleeve. Assistant District Attorney Maggie McPherson, a/k/a Maggie McFierce, will sit second chair in the retrial.<br /><br /> Connelly mastered the genre of crime fiction a long time ago. While some critics have panned \\"The Reversal,\\" it has a plausible plot, and the author does a good job expressing the frustrations Haller and Bosch feel as they do their best to build a case against a clever, deceptive, vindictive criminal and his win-at-all-costs defense attorney.<br /><br /> Where Connelly falls short is in his handling of the story's resolution. It feels rushed, a little implausible, just a hair too clever. However, from the ending, it's obvious Connelly plans a sequel, so a few loose ends are to be expected.
044654759X|4.0|The usual good love story from Sparks with a great plot and unusual ending. I did feel some of it as predictable and forced at times, but otherwise excellent in every other way.
B002ZG981E|2.0|I wanted to like this film but I just couldn't.  Interesting premise, I'll admit.  But not a very good movie.  Nolan has made some movies with interesting premises but he's not terribly skilled at the craft of movie-making or storytelling.  Others, including some established film critics, have summed up this movie's numerous failings (and Nolan's shortcomings) far more eloquently than I will here.  I have listed a few of them below, and some of them make for quite entertaining reading, especially the ones by Edelstein and Wachtel.<br /><br />Had another filmmaker without Nolan's current/recent standing made this film, I believe it would have been more universally dismissed as the flawed film it is.  But Nolan seems to be getting a free pass lately, and it is not deserved.  Is the love for this film based on the film itself, or is it based on the excitement of simply getting to see another Chris Nolan film?  Think carefully before you answer.  Be honest with yourself.<br /><br />There's really not that much to invest in emotionally.  Leo's Dom Cobb has his motivations for barreling through all this mess, but largely I didn't care.  The special effects sure were nifty, and the concept was somewhat interesting, but I felt like the whole thing was \\"forced\\" and the effects and the conceit WERE the story rather than being there to serve it.  The story seems reverse-engineered, as if he had certain action setpieces and spiffy sequences he wanted to put on film and he constructed a storyline around them as padding just to have a vehicle to carry them.<br /><br />The primary goal of the movie's merry band of brain hackers is to implant an idea into a corporate executive's head that, if acted on, will benefit his competitor.  Thrilling, no?  Problem is, the target of the \\"inception\\" is a thinly-developed character who from all appearances is a decent enough fellow, so why is the audience supposed to root for the hackers to succeed against a nice guy for whom we harbor no real animosity?  There's no clear villain here, no one to root against. The only sense of urgency is a race against the clock.  It might as well be a game show.  Yep, those are the stakes in this film -- all this trouble and expense and danger just to give a Japanese businessman a competitive advantage.  Not very compelling.  The stakes are not much different than your boss telling you to \\"have the report on my desk by five o'clock!\\"<br /><br />I don't dislike Nolan or his films just on principle.  I think we can all agree that \\"Memento\\" was a very, very good film.  But I think many of his films suffer from poor editing and poorly executed story points.  More to the point, however, I think many of Nolan's films, \\"Inception\\" included, aspire to the grandiose at the expense of coherence and sensible narrative flow.  Again, it is the craft of good storytelling that is the hallmark of a great director.  Nolan has shown he is capable of it, but he doesn't demonstrate it here.<br /><br />Is \\"Inception\\" multi-layered and occasionally complex?  Sure.  But layering and complexity do not make a film great.  Is it complicated and challenging in spots?  Yes, but so what?  I think it is also lazily-written in many places.  The script wiggles around and maneuvers to meet the needs of the ingredients Nolan wished to show off in the film, and it often comes at the expense of narrative sense.<br /><br />The immense amount of praise showered on Nolan after \\"The Dark Knight\\", a movie that was elevated to \\"event\\" status in no small part due to the untimely death and riveting performance of Heath Ledger and not necessarily because of any genius on Nolan's part, has almost made it a sacrilege to say anything less than overwhelmingly flattering about him and to almost completely insulate him from criticism, lest the critic be reviled.  Saying anything derogatory about a Nolan film is now considered \\"bad manners\\".  Think about that for a minute.  Are we all meant to toss objectivity out the window?  Even Roger Ebert, who liked the film, wonders if we are even allowed to dislike it in today's \\"we love Nolan\\" environment.<br /><br />I encourage you to read the following reviews of the film:<br /><br />David Edelstein's review for \\"New York Magazine\\" called \\"Dream a Little Dream -- Awakening to the leaden reality of Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION\\".  (*** MY FAVORITE ***)<br /><br />Charlie Wachtel of FilmCrusade.com  (***** MY SECOND FAVORITE *****)<br /><br />Stephanie Zacherek's review for MovieLine called \\"Is INCEPTION This Year's Masterpiece?

Truth is, I just didn't care for this film, and I suspect that a lot of love for this film stems from the public's recent showering of praise on Nolan for his previous films, which have NOTHING to do with this film.  Thanks to Nolan's recent successes, this film had a built-in audience predisposed to liking anything with Nolan's name on it, and for that reason perhaps they lost a bit of objectivity.  You must admit, though -- the advance trailers for the film were very well done and probably got a lot of people stoked for it.  But I don't think the film lived up to the promise.  It is layered and complex but not well-executed.<br /><br />I mean no disrespect to those who liked or loved the film.  If you liked it and will buy the DVD to watch over and over, then god bless ya.  Enjoy it.  I can attest that my love of certain films sometimes mystifies others.

0152164154|5.0|This beautiful French version of Le Petit Prince was a present for a couple who speak the language fluently. I gave it to them for their new baby. It's really a story for young adults but the whimsical storyline make it suitable for younger children. I think it's lovely to have it in French, as it was written.
B00008XEOI|5.0|I ordered this movie for my 1 and 2 year old granddaughters to make sure they had their own copies as they grew older and become really able to appreciate the many concepts that are presented in this beautiful movie.  It is a work of art and well worth having the collector's set.    The changes that were mentioned by some of the negative reviewers in no way affected the beauty of the movie itself.  I'm sure the girls will enjoy this movie for many years to come along with the games and virtual tours that are part of the collector's edition. Great family movie.   My daughter has hung the 'pictures' that come in the collector's packet on the walls in the girls' playroom.  Nice addition!

6304584598|5.0|This is, undoubtedly  the Ballet of the Ballets. Sumptuously orchestrated, admirable scented, filled of enraptured sequences in which the world of reality and illusion are so closely blended, impregnated of spell that encloses the maxim splendor, charm, and incorporeal dances the ballet had known before or after it. The story has a powerful mythic significance, it's both romantic and lyrical where the classical elegance and the sinister tragedy shake hands.<br /><br />The duo Nureyev-Fonteyn is legendary. The well known portrait of the Prince fallen in love and then deceived by the perversity of evilness will mean for him the nemesis of a great love, swallowed by the swirling waters of the lake to condemn this love and lead it to an irreversible end.<br /><br />The emotion throughout the work is simply indescribable. Maybe I'm wrong my dear reader, but there were many episodes all the way through which impelled me to recall the famous allusive pictures of the great Degas.<br /><br />It's absolutely imprescindible for you to acquire this legendary and overwhelming version. One of the most arresting moments of the ballet ever made.

0786955570|5.0|Many might confuse this as an RPG, but that would be a mistake. This board games borrows heavily from the D&D 4e mechanics and might be set in the same \\"world\\" but that's where the similarities end. You won't get a long drawn out story or campaign. There isn't much in the ways of character development or item gathering (that matters from game to game at least). But there is a lot of fun to be had if you're looking for a short (30-60 minute) run through a randomly created dungeon.    You get A LOT of stuff for the price too! Some great miniatures, an excellent dungeon tile set, and tokens.     This game is meant to be played with others although you can play by yourself. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a board game that's a little deeper than some of the \\"normal\\" board games.
0307473473|4.0|This was a book selection of my reading club which, to be honest, I resisted... since I had no interest in reading about a girl with tattoos.  But, the story line really grabbed me.  I have to read the other two books in this trilogy.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|A movie titled Iron-man but the villain steals the show. Growing up I never was that big a fan of Iron Man I always a fan of Batman and this movie made me realize why. Tony Stark is a superhero that enjoys his fortune lives lavishly and he's not afraid to let the world know it. Batman puts up the front of living lavishly and enjoying his life while underneath it all he's tormented and if he can't find peace for himself he'll find peace for someone else by becoming \\"Batman\\" and help keep the people safe in his city. The two Billionaires are complete opposites of each other. Even their corporations are complete opposites. Wayne industries focuses on improving the world while Stark industries focuses on how to destroy it. It's a very interesting way to look at the two successful comic book characters. Matter of fact the only thing that they have in common is that they are both just normal men with no true superpowers of their own (well maybe a huge bank account is a super power).<br /><br />About the movie now...<br /><br />Iron Man 2 reversed the roles. This movie actually make Iron Man look like the a-hole because of how he acts in the movie. He treats Iron man as though it's a symbol of just how big his ego is and just another reason why the world should bow down and kiss his feet. Tony Stark in this movie is not exactly the character you want to root for. It's basically 2 hours of a rich man's ego trip. \\"I can do what I want because I'm rich and you should be thanking me\\". That is pretty much all I get from these Iron man movies especially this one.<br /><br />The Iron man scenes are just as great as the first one. The suit of armor never looked better and the scenes are intense. I was however disappointed with WarMachine. He was a character that they could have done a lot more with and perhaps given more spot light too than just a sub plot to further advance the story line. I also had a problem with the actor they casted as Warmachine. He couldn't be further off from being Warmachine, and he never sold me on him. I know they were originally supposed to have Terrance Howard and they should have got him for the role. He's an A-list actor and they should have paid his A-list salary. Because Don Cheadle is no WarMachine.<br /><br />The one who made this movie worth watching for me was Mickey Rourke. His character is the one the movie makes you root for and to be honest he brought up valid points that no one seemed to answer and a question that Tony Starks pretended was never asked. Tony Starks deals in weapons...those weapons fall in the hands of solders...his weapons take lives and destroy countries, and Mickey Rourke's character was the ending result of that. Tony Starks weapons destroy his homeland, and Tony Starks father ruined his father personally. Ivan Vanko didn't seem so bent on getting revenge out of personal hatred as he seemed to want to make Tony Starks suffer for all the pain his weapons have caused... actually it was a pretty valid point.. but the movie just skipped over all that and made him the bad guy.<br /><br />Overall Iron Man 2 was a good action flick if you liked Iron Man 1 You'll enjoy Iron Man 2. 4/5 for a sequel since there hasn't been a good sequel since T2 and Batman The Darknight. It's good but it's also forgettable just like Fantastic 4 and The Incredible Hulk movies.ne, and he never sold me on him.

B000PDYVVG|3.0|The first \\"book\\" Italy is entertaining and leaves the reader wanting more. The rest of the book was incredibly boring and depressing as the author takes you on a series of emotional highs and lows. You are left wondering if anyone else reading this thinks the author is a controlling, self pitying, cry baby nut job. It is almost too tedious to read at times despite her literary talents she is a trainwreck. For once i thought the movie was better.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|It seems that many amazonians are reacting (badly) to the hype around Franzen's new book and eager to disagree with the professional reviewers who have generally loved and fawned over this book. Forget about the hype--just read it and love it. Immerse yourself in this strange and yet familiar family of ordinary, screwed up people. Yeah, a lot like our own families and the people we come into contact with every day--only sharper and more interesting. The prose is good (Franzen can really write). A phrase describing one character's descent into an overindulgence of drink as she tries to survive her own choices: \\"It wasn't alcoholism, it was self-defence.\\" The words ring true and caused this reader at least to dive deeply and totally into Franzen's world. I read this book on two cross country plane rides and was mildly depressed when I finished it. I both loved these people and wanted to slap them at the same time. Franzen's frustration with self-created drama and the ennui of post 9/11 20-somethings is (in my experience) dead on and hilarious. The first 20 pages are a virtuoso piece of writing and worth the entire book.  Don't be scared off by the \\"literary fiction\\" tag. This is entertaining stuff--the pages fly as the years go by in this arresting novel.

B003XMUFGQ|3.0|Eric Clapton says that he is pleased with this cd and if we (the fans), really want to understand in what place he is or feels when he was recording it, we have to give the album a chance and a little time. To me the album has a relaxed feeling, as he and his band and guest were just playing songs he choose to play cause he like them. The album is what it is.....a couple of tunes sound like Clapton in the 70 s'. Some other songs, feel like New Orleans \\"blues\\". Eric Clapton seem to be right now at a near and similar place that Elton John ..(check out his latest album)

B003TML0VO|4.0|I was afraid to hear this cd, cause i though it was goin to be similar to their lastest offerings. A Santanta just playing along some of today s' singers and just that.....But here, i can not denied that there is some of the old fire in most of the songs. I do like his aproach on the sacred \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", a song also covered by a great guitar player as Peter Frampton is and many others.<br />Most of the songs follow the originals, Frankly, i consider some songs, not really adecuate for Santana to play, specially the Van Halen cover, since they have better songs. He should, instead for example, cover a Ten Years After song like \\"Standing at the Station\\" or Jefferson Starship \\"Save Your Love\\" or the Rolling Stones \\"Time Waits for No One\\", or he Beatles \\"I Want You\\"....or Journey s' Kohoutec, songs that he can strech out long solos.........<br /><br />Hope next time, it his mentor Clive Davies, wants him to record a follow up to this album, he chooses better songs for Carlos Santana to play.
B0000509C4|4.0|Creepshow 2 is almost a very good sequel except for the awful animation that looks totally out of place here, making the film look cheap and shoddy.

Zombieland is an adventure-comedy that just happens to take place in a post-zom-pocalyptic world that is very witty and humorous in all the right places. The cast, direction and screenplay are fantastic and well deserving of winning Best Ensemble, Best Horror Movie and Best Cameo at the 2010 Scream Awards.<br /><br />As a zombie enthusiast, I applaud the writers for creating a story that is both believeable, well-researched, and for bringing characters that you can actually relate to.

0393316041|5.0|The title is a take-off on Freeman Dyson's characterization of Richard Feynman as 50% genius, 50% buffoon. I loved this book when I first read it in the 80s, and I've read it several times since without changing my opinion. Of course the reader has to make some allowances for the raconteur: any really good story has generally been remade by retelling,with minor alterations and exaggerations here and there, but we're looking to be entertained, not just taught. So it is with this book. We meet Feynman the free spirit, enemy of pomposity, self-deception, and mindless rules. He amuses us by poking fun at and sometimes defying the military, polite social conventions, and sexual hypocrisy, while at the same time delighting us with his childlike pleasure in discovering new things, like how to crack safes, find hidden items by smell, and get ants to walk in a circle. And naturally what makes it all so much more interesting is that this incorrigible bad-boy is also a scientist of the first rank, a genuine genius who reinvented quantum mechanics and rescued it from the plague of infinities, for which he \\"won a prize\\", as he liked to call his Nobel.     Whether it was telling Bohr or Fermi that their ideas wouldn't work, or testifying on behalf of a strip-club owner threatened with the loss of his livelihood, Feynman was unafraid to live honestly and according to his own rules. It helps in such a situation to be able to do things that no one else can do, like calculate finite quantities in quantum electrodynamics, or explain superfluidity. Many of us would like to live that way too if we could, and there is considerable satisfaction in following the adventures of someone who does.     Feynman can be a little creepy at times, as when he spends days on end incognito in Las Vegas insinuating himself into other people's lives for fun. (Of course as he points out, all scientists with the possible exception of Einstein, (and nowadays Stephen Hawking) would be incognito in Las Vegas). But he's never boring, obtuse, or mean-spirited. He subjects himself to the same clear-eyed analysis as others, and cheerily admits his own shortcomings and failures.     It all boils down to two rules to live by: have fun, and don't fool yourself.     Thank you, Richard Feynman. We love you.

1416550534|4.0|Kate Morton fills her novel with vivid descriptions, allowing the reader walk right into the 20's England downstairs servant hall, yet effortlessly march out to present day to spend time with an older, wiser Grace. There is no doubt that this author has done her research on early 20th  century England and can write of it in an informative yet utterly captivating manner. To read this novel is to time travel. It's a little vacation that one doesn't wish to end.    Yet, like all good things, the story must come to a halt and a rather abrupt halt this was. I loved this story dearly. Yet the closing pages failed to quite meet my expectations. The author certainly gave an unpredictable and memorable close to her story, yet it felt slightly incomplete to me.    That being said this is still a book that I would highly, highly recommend. If you liked The Thirteenth Tale, you must not let this book pass you by. It you enjoyed A Countess Below Stairs, pick this novel up immediately. Or if you are just in need of a well written story with a bit of suspense and mystery, this is the book for you. It's a beautifully written novel that leaves me yearning for more of Morton's writings.

In the opening scene the Huns have just stormed the Great Wall of China and the Emperor of China has conscription notices sent out to each household informing them that one male from each household must join the army. Fa Zhou, who is in poor health, accepts the conscription on behalf of his household.

1416550550|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is another stunning work from Kate Morton that leaves one longing for more of her skilled writing. This is Nell's story. The story of a strong, quiet lady in her sixties who sets out on a quest to solve the mystery of her past. A past that was lost when she was found abandoned on a ship at the tender age of four. However it it not a quest that she is able to complete in her lifetime. After her death Nell's granddaughter, Cassandra, picks up where her grandmother has left off, embarking on her own adventure to solve the mystery surrounding her grandmother's identity.    Vividly detailed scenes instantly draw the reader into this puzzle. The past is effortlessly weaved into the present, taking the reader on a journey which begins in the early 1900's, jumping to Nell's story in the 1970's and leaping forward to present day 2005 to travel with Cassandra, only to leap back and forward again and again. Each story becomes intertwined with the next, yet with visible distinctions. The impact of each generations choices is obviously seen in the next generation. All the while the magic of fairy tales is weaved throughout.    While this mystery can be solved by the reader within the first two-thirds of the book the suspense continues as the characters begin to unravel the past. It is only within the last few pages that one is able to catch a breathe again. This is an absolutely mesmerizing tale filled with twists and turns and plenty of knots along the way. It is heartbreaking to see the story come to an end as the time spent within these pages is so utterly delightful. I'm unsure that any review could do this book justice. You will just have to read it for yourself to discover the magic within.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Great movie, though the plot seemed a little thin. From a comic book reader / individual that loves fictional movies that have a flair for a lot of action, this movie didn't disappoint.
0316098337|5.0|Upon opening this book you are thrust into the world of a five-year-old. Jack narrates this story through the eyes of an innocent child. At first it is a struggle to get into character but within a few pages the transport from adulthood back to childhood is complete. It must be quite a challenge to write from this perspective, yet Donoghue masters it flawlessly.    Jack is an energetic, inquisitive and creative five-year-old. Other than being particularly bright, he is the average child. Yet his surroundings are anything but typical. Jack and his mother live locked within a 12 by 12 foot room. Knowing no different, Jack is quite content in his singular world with his mother, a small television, his snake friend made from egg shells and his Sunday treats. His mother, however, knows Room to be a life-draining prison, one they must escape before it smothers them both.    This powerful novel is at once absolutely appalling and undeniably beautiful. This is an all-consuming book which begs to be read in a single sitting. Jack's innocence is presented with bits of humor and heartache. His mother's battle between doing right by her son and her need for freedom will capture the hearts of readers. Her struggle to remain courageous while being absolutely powerless perfectly displays the undeniable bond between a mother and her child. Book clubs take note this is a story that demands to be discussed.

B001AQO3QA|2.0|BUMMER on the price because ALIENS is my all-time favorite movie and I have to get this set eventually.    While it's not uncommon to see NEW Blu-Ray movies offered at a $35srp per movie I would think 4 OLD movies regardless of the bells & whistles would be bundled together at no more than $100 or even $120srp. $140srp is too much regardless of Amazon's discounts.    I have been upgrading my standard DVDs to Blu-Rays but have been patiently (and rather quickly) doing it at $10-15 each then trading in my DVDs for credit or selling them for $2-5 each bringing down my price even more.    Before seeing this my GUESS was I could've bought it the week it came out for $50-60.....WRONG!    Black Friday deal perhaps???
B003W5C0VW|4.0|I will start by saying I have waited for this to be officially released for many years. I have had the bootleg versions from early vhs through the latest dvd (most of you know where I'm coming from).  While this is a cut above the vhs boots, I was immediately surprised to find it is not a whole lot better audio/visual-wise than the 4reel bootleg dvd.  That being said...they are still and always will be THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND IN THE WORLD...BUY THIS DVD!    Upon reading the comments to this review, let me add I am not in any way saying this is not a MUST HAVE for any Stones fan. I believe the quality to be exceptional as an historic document from an historic band at the pinnacle of their career and nothing less.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I have no idea how this book reached the best seller list.  I loaded it onto my Kindle to have for a trip and read it because I was without other books.  Otherwise, I would not have bothered finishing it.  It is was predictable and trite and not worth my time.  There are too many good books in the world to bother with books like this one.
0312600844|1.0|One should wonder about the literary value of a book which has almost as many one-star reviews as 4-star. Love it or hate it, I guess. In my case, it was hate. I suppose it didn't help that I was fighting a terrible cold while trying to read the book, but the utterly depressing and dysfunctional characters and their stories of woe finally got to me and I could not continue. I also felt even sicker with every reference to sexual prowess and function, and there were far too many of those. Pain I had plenty of from my illness; I didn't need an extra dose from my reading.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Product arrived as advertised and on time!!! What more can you ask for?   Would buy from again!!!
B003EVFHYG|5.0|I think this soundtrack is breathtaking. I have not found a score by John Powell, or any other composer for that matter, that I have not liked. Every song on this album is amazing. My favorites so far include, \\"This is Berk\\", and \\"Forbidden Friendships\\". I'm sure I'll grow to love every single song!<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|I think half the movies Hollywood and Critics rate highly are about 70% crap and the rest good. Also on that note i think half of the movies critics rate as being horrible turn out being great, its all in personal preference. I for one really liked this film, mainly because of Josh Brolin who is great in films like No Country For Old Men, and W. He makes a go of this comic book western and i think he does a good job, for what he's given to work with. Honestly i'm not a Meagan Foxx fan at all, is she pretty, yeah she's decent, can she act, no not really. John Malkovich as a bad guy is a good idea, and he at least fits his \\"small\\" but evil role as the sinister bad man. I don't wanna give spoilers but this movie is really easy to follow anyways.    Its just all about Jonah Hex getting revenge for his wife and kids after there death. He basically rides around looking for the men who did so, but there are some very interesting twist on how he does this. He has the power to raise the dead and ask questions, and the way this is executed is very cool, to me. I guess people were just really wanting another X-men, Sin City type comic deal but you don't get that here, not from a story perspective anyways. Josh Brolin to me could definitely be the next Eastwood, he just does the silent, low tone, southern i'm going to gun you down type voice, with the attitude like he just doesnt give a #%#t. So this is just simple film, and actually pretty damn violent for PG-13, just without all the blood. So its a simple comic book western with some good acting, and over the top effects, nothing more, nothing less. And i like it more, than most, i see.:)
B0028MBKVG|5.0|In the hands of a less skilled author, this book could have read as an overly saccharine self-help story.  Instead, it achieves the right mix of inspiration, entertainment and instruction. I   had been running with the Vibram Five Finger shoes before reading this book, and its interesting research confirms the comfort and joy I feel from running unemcumbered by over-priced cushiony shoes.  I would suggest this book to anyone who prizes travel and invigoration.
1401302378|4.0|When I first heard about this book, I really wasn't sure what to think. After all, I'm not too fond of economics. But I must admit, Chris Anderson did not let me down!! Whether you have a Masters in Economics or you are a self taught businessman, this book is great.    The things I liked:    1) Well Organized - Chris wrote the book in way that introduces economics very nonthreatingly. Then he leads into the transformation of business into what it is today.    2) Great Examples - He stays on point with some of the big names throughout the books, including Rhapsody and Amazon. This made it much easier to relate the information to real life.    3) Solid Credibility - With a background as the Editor of Wired Magazine, it is clear that much of the points Chris brings up are backed with years of expertise in the field.    Bottom Line:    Get the book. Great read for anyone looking to expand their horizons and get a new perspective of the global economy.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I wish RUSH would have come out with documentaries years ago. They are such a private band with a sole focus on the music. Long time fans have a right to feel cheated that nearing the end of their career they release dvd's recapping their career.     I am still a huge fan having seen them eight times since mid-1980's. Would love to take my kids to see them but they skipped Indianapolis on this tour.     See them while you can, folks. There aren't many more tours on their schedules.

B003LAH7MU|5.0|After I saw Sting perform these pieces at Lincoln Center this past summer, and then again up front and personal on the streets of New York for the CBS morning show, I decided I must have something to remember these events by!

I cannot elaborate technically on the instrumentality and the arrangements of the songs, but I know when something sounds great and touches my heart, or is just mediocre.  Sting has always been the former.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|The first time I saw the trailer for \\"The Social Network, I was intrigued. The haunting music over images of the Facebook experience bleeding into a pixilated image of Jesse Eisenberg may have hooked me instantly, causing me to mentally add the film to my \\"to-see\\" list. Then I learned the film was directed by David Fincher (\\"Seven\\", \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\") from a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (\\"The West Wing\\"), causing the film to shoot up to the top of the list.<br /><br />I honestly don't think there is a project that David Fincher could work on, especially when he has a screenplay from Sorkin that could be bad. They should make a film of an actor reading the phone book. I bet it would work.<br /><br />\\"Social\\" documents the creation of Facebook. Using a number of legal proceedings as the framework, we hear various stories about the creation of the wildly popular website. In 2003, a Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) decides to take out his frustration at being dumped by his girlfriend and creates a website allowing students to rate female students. His friend Eduardo Savarin (Andrew Garfield, \\"Red Riding: 1974\\", \\"Never Let Me Go\\") sees the potential in the site and they try to move forward. The Winkelvoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer) approach Mark about helping them develop a social network site of their own. Soon, Mark and Eduardo have created a new website called The Facebook, designed to be used on college campuses by students. Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the creator of Napster, becomes interested in the site and tries pushing Mark to expand the site and his horizons. Eduardo doesn't like the new influence and steps back. Meanwhile, Facebook begins to take off and everyone starts to get greedy.<br /><br />I was surprised about how much I actually liked this film. I was always going to like or appreciate it, but it turns out the film is almost great.<br /><br />When you think about film, a visual medium, the idea of watching a bunch of computer geeks programming their computers sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry. But it is a testament to the director and writer that this film is pretty exciting, very interesting and always holds your interest.<br /><br />After breaking up with his girlfriend (phenomenal writing, Mr. Sorkin), Mark retreats to his dorm room and takes out his revenge in a way only he knows how; he begins to hack into various sorority and school websites and uploads pictures of their female students. He then sets up a program allowing other students to rate each of the girls. The website takes off and eventually shuts down the Harvard computer network. At one point, a lawyer (Rashida Jones, TV's \\"Parks and Recreation\\") asks \\"The site got twenty-two hundred hits within two hours?\\" Mark corrects her and says \\"Thousand\\". The lawyer is impressed and Fincher creates a fast paced montage depicting the creation of the site and the ensuing fervor.<br /><br />As the film progresses, Sorkin and Fincher anchor us by using the various legal proceedings, everyone sues everyone else, as the framework for the story. At one point, the Winkelvoss twins' are giving a deposition, leading to a particular part of the story, which blends into the next part of the story, leading us to Eduardos' deposition in his own trial, leading to another moment in the story. This may sound a bit confusing, or a bit of a mishmash, but it works and helps us follow this complicated story.<br /><br />Eisenberg creates a portrait of Zuckerberg as a lonely, petulant, emotionally under-developed young man. Everything he does seems to be the result of jealousy or a perceived slight. Eisenberg's portrayal is not very emotional, but this seems true to the character; he doesn't know how to express his emotions which is why he creates a website rating girls. Of course, as he becomes richer and richer, he only seems to become more and more petulant and difficult to reach.<br /><br />Andrew Garfield, who must be \\"The Next Big Thing\\" given how many films he has coming out this year, is good as Eduardo Savarin, Zuckerberg's close friend and investor. Savarin experiences the most emotional upheaval throughout the story allowing Garfield to give us a showier, more interesting performance.<br /><br />But that isn't really fair. Zuckerberg is portrayed as emotionally stunted, for the most part. Because of this, Eisenberg appears more reserved, more distanced. It is a testament to the film and the actor's portrayal that we feel anything for him at all.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is good as Sean Parker. Timberlake has turned in some better than average film performances setting him apart from most of the other pop stars who think they can act. In \\"The Social Network\\", his portrayal of Sean Parker makes him seem like Svengali. As soon as he meets Zuckerberg, there is a glint in his eye as he quickly accesses everything he can do for the fledgling entrepreneur and everything his new associate can do for him. He wants to help Zuckerberg make money, but Parker also wants respectability.<br /><br />\\"The Social Network\\" is the most straightforward of any of Fincher's films. This is also a compliment to the director's skills, he can dial back the special effects and unique graphic treatments he has used so successfully in his previous films demonstrating to us that he is more interested in creating a memorable film. If the film doesn't warrant the special effects or treatments, it isn't necessary and he doesn't need it.<br /><br />\\"The Social Network\\" is a very good film, and especially prescient as Facebook grows even larger and more influential.t this year, is good as Eduardo Savarin, Zuckerberg's close friend and investor.

0316069485|3.0|This book starts with an interesting premise, Haller changes sides and becomes a prosecutor. All the drama getting ready for the trial and watching him reorient his thinking is quite interesting. But after that, the book just falls flat. The story just ends. There is no resolution in any of the story lines. I wouldn't recommend buying it or investing too much time in it.

B003UYUQZW|4.0|Special Effects are the real stars of this disney movie. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a strong enough performance but this is not one of his best in his long resume.Action packed is not quite enough to describe the scenes that take you from one to the next with hardly time to catch your breath. An FX junkie will be in heaven with this movie, the storyline/character driven fan, not so much. All in all, its an enjoyable watch and one an entire family can spend an evening together with a bowl of popcorn.
B003EYVY04|1.0|As stated, this does not include the extended version. I went back and looked at the promo for the Ultimate Versions( I saved it ) and it definitely says that all the Ultimate Editions will included extended versions. Warner Bros. seems to want another opportunity to make even more off the fans when it does release the extended versions. They have a general phone number, where people that want to complain about this, can call. It is long distance and you need to tell the receptionist what you want to complain about and you will be forwarded to at least a voice mail. ( 818 954-6000 ) I think if everyone that detests these sort of practices called and voiced their objections, maybe they would get the message that people will not stand for anything less than what was advertised as to what the Ultimate Editions would contain.To those of you who opened their videos only to be disappointed and disgusted that they could not be returned once opened, I believe that is what WB washoping for. People being so excited ,thinking that they were receiving exactly the same delightful product that was contained in the Ultimate Editions 1 & 2 , that they overlooked the fine print. I for one would like to at least see WB give us an apology and offer to refund any that were opened under the mistaken impression that what they were getting was identical to the first two Ultimate Editions that were released last year.

The song selections are great, arrangements perfect, musicianship superb, what can you say but he gets it right every time.    A great mix on this album. I never thought I would like some of the country, blue grass etc after being heavy metal orientated but he has won me over.    Many of the songs do not grab you immediately, but after couple of playings you are hooked.    As long as he keeps playing and recording I will be buying.

They've taken their considerable talents and blazed new territory for the band by reaching into the three previous decades and finding inspiration for an exciting new direction.  I'm proud of these guys for refusing to settle for their old sound, preferring instead to find new contexts for each consecutive album.  \\"Night Train\\", to me, is the fulfillment of some of the processes begun on \\"Perfect Symmetry\\".  The melodies are still catchy, the beats are still strong, the synth is still out front; they've just totally left the college dorm room of \\"Hope and Fears\\" and through two albums have arrived a sound that's totally fresh and still totally Keane.

076790592X|3.0|For the sole purpose of making this review worth something as a stand-alone essay, I'll assume that you, the reader, like me, are one of the few people who didn't know what TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE was all about.<br /><br />Twenty years before the actual events of the book, Mitch Albom had the privilege of struggling through a university sociology course under the tutelage of a special and very talented teacher, Morrie Schwartz. Despite progressing well beyond a mere student/professor relationship into a deep friendship, despite bestowing on Morrie the endearment \\"Coach\\", and despite his promise to stay in close contact after graduation, Morrie, like so many other self-centered graduates, went his own way in the world. He lost track of someone who had been very special to him and it was only a television news interview that let him know his past friend was now dying of ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease.<br /><br />TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE depicts the 14 Tuesday afternoon visits that Albom made to his dying mentor and relates the substance of the conversations that they had about the vicissitudes of life and death before Morrie's death at the unrelenting hands of the implacable neurological disease that stole his mobility and even his very ability to breathe.<br /><br />I wanted to like TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE ... I really did! But, while I was moved and often deeply touched as I read it, I also knew that there was something nagging at me that left me unsatisfied with the book! It took me quite a while before I figured out what it was.<br /><br />Insofar as Morrie's ability to deal with his own ill health and his inevitable death was concerned, I was profoundly moved and singularly impressed. His ability to look at the silver lining of every cloud, to constantly perceive every glass as half full instead of half empty, to always find a reason to celebrate the entirety of his life as opposed to decrying the pain and the miserably small amount of time left to him was truly inspiring.<br /><br />But I found Albom's ability to pass along the nuggets of wisdom in a fashion that would allow a reader to apply them to their own life looking forward (a life, that is, not looking down the barrel of a shotgun of death sawed-off virtually to the shoulder) was distinctly lacking. Platitudes and aphorisms were plentiful but I found them maudlin and distinctly lacking in meaning or method that could be applied. \\"Be at peace with yourself\\" ... well, yes, of course, but HOW does one do that? He would tell us that \\"love\\" is the answer! Well, for goodness sake, the Beatles told me that over 40 years ago! Well, you get the idea!<br /><br />So, how do we find this particular glass half full? Let's say I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Morrie's pluck and courage in the face of his own slow death but found little to constructively apply to my own life.<br /><br />Paul Weissass along the nuggets of wisdom in a fashion that would allow a reader to apply them to their own life looking forward (a life, that is, not looking down the barrel of a shotgun of death sawed-off virtually to the shoulder) was distinctly lacking.

0198326769|4.0|THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is an allegory or a fable told in strong yet austere and achingly simple prose through the eyes of a naïve nine year old boy who wants nothing more than to find a friend to talk to.<br /><br />When Adolf Hitler promotes Bruno's father, a senior Wehrmacht officer, to the position of commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, Bruno and his entire family find themselves moved from their pleasant, gentrified life and social circle of friends in Berlin to a lonely and isolated home in Poland just outside the barbed wire of the camp itself. Bruno, despite any real knowledge of what his father does for a living has unquestioning faith in his father's good intentions and respect for the authority of his orders. So, for some time, Bruno quietly goes about his business and undertakes his schooling with his sister from a private tutor. But a nine year old boy needs friends and company and, in lonely frustration, Bruno finally decides to explore the countryside outside of the fence surrounding the camp.<br /><br />When Bruno meets Shmuel, a young boy wearing blue and white striped pajamas and cap sitting cross-legged on the other side of the fence, they introduce themselves with the hesitant but completely charming simplicity that is the hallmark of young boys at this age. Knowing that this exploration is against his father's explicit orders, Bruno decides to tell nobody, not even his twelve year old sister, about his new friend. But each day that he can, he returns to the same spot outside the fence so that he and Shmuel can trade stories and confidences and talk as all young boys have done throughout time.<br /><br />Despite Bruno's painfully slow, hesitant and quite immature growth into awareness of the starvation, beatings and privations that the thousands of people on the other side of the camp are enduring, he still expresses the outlandishly ironic sentiment that he is jealous of Shmuel being inside the camp. Obviously Shmuel has hundreds of boys that he might befriend whereas Bruno, on the outside, is all by himself.<br /><br />The heart-breaking ending of the story, while it suffers from easy predictability, is no less powerful in its impact and the delivery of its ultimate message - that prejudice is never inherent in the young; that hatred, bigotry and cruelty must be taught and learned; that all mankind's races are, after all, the same and that any perceived differences are as cosmetic, as insubstantial and, ultimately, as meaningless, as being dressed in a pair of striped pajamas and a cap or being marked with a tattoo.<br /><br />THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS, never explicit or graphic in its depiction of the violent brutalities of the Holocaust, is a powerful book with an important message suitable for young readers. Although Hitler's Final Solution was not the context in which this phrase was coined, \\"Lest we forget\\" somehow seems appropriate. If I had young children, I would want them to learn this lesson from such an extraordinary source.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissght befriend whereas Bruno, on the outside, is all by himself.     The heart-breaking ending of the story, while it suffers from easy predictability, is no less powerful in its impact and the delivery of its ultimate message - that prejudice is never inherent in the young; that hatred, bigotry and cruelty must be taught and learned; that all mankind's races are, after all, the same and that any perceived differences are as cosmetic, as insubstantial and, ultimately, as meaningless, as being dressed in a pair of striped pajamas and a cap or being marked with a tattoo.    THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS, never explicit or graphic in its depiction of the violent brutalities of the Holocaust, is a powerful book with an important message suitable for young readers. Although Hitler's Final Solution was not the context in which this phrase was coined, \\"Lest we forget\\" somehow seems appropriate. If I had young children, I would want them to learn this lesson from such an extraordinary source.    Highly recommended.    Paul Weiss
142311339X|5.0|I have never taken the time to write a review before, but I have to say this new series is such a delightful surprise.  For fans of Percy Jackson we knew Rick was going to write a new series from Camp Half-blood, but I think I expected it to be a whole new group many years later or something.  What a great surprise to find that it picks up just after the first series ends and little spoiler here, Perc, though absent in this first book, is going to be involved.  Haven't we all had that disappointment when an incredible series ends and you are left bereft wanting to know more about your fave characters.  Don't we all crave another great series with those amazing characters?  Well thank you Mr. Riordan.  You have given us the MORE your fans are all desperately wanting.  With three great new heroes to love, Rick has opened up a whole new Roman concept that brings back that same sense of excitement as the first series.  I wolfed the book in two days on a car trip, partially ignoring my two year old and husband (but he understood as he's read the last series too) to end it feeling like a kid again.  However my euphoria didn't last long as I realized....dang, now I have to wait a year for the next book!  Final fyi, if you have not read the first series, you need to read it first as this book would spoil the other one.  I'm not reading it to my fifth graders for that reason...much to their groaning dismay.
0525951652|4.0|I love Follett's historical fiction.  \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World\\" were real page-turners, and for me \\"Fall of Giants\\" was no exception.      Reading \\"Fall\\" got me into reading more about WWI, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the period but cannot decide what to read first.  \\"Fall\\" provides the variety of perspectives and experiences that made me want to read more about the events, political struggles and movements that began then and continue today.  Next I'll turn to Barbara Tuchman's \\"Guns of August\\" for a \\"non-fiction\\" treatment and look forward to John Reed's \\"Ten Days that Shook the World,\\" as I look forward to the sequels to \\"Fall of Giants.\\"    Anyone have more recommendations for good reads about WWI and this period in world history?  More, please!!
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Maroon 5 has done it again! This cd shows what an incredible band they are because of their ability to grow ... and retain the same integrity with lyrics, music and fans. This cd has been on repeat since the day it was released. It's not so much \\"Songs About Jane\\", but it's more of a grown up band. Not so much angst (that we loved, right?). Get it - it's genius. Adam Levine is hot hot hot.

Written from a first-person perspective, Jack is 5 years old and has lived in Room his whole life with only one other person, Ma.  It takes a while to figure out why Jack is in Room with Rocker, Rug, and Door as some of his only friends...but when you figure it out...you will be shocked.  I don't want to give it away, but the suspense and effects of this psychological thriller will keep you reading into the night.

0307474712|4.0|British author David Nicholls' novel One Day begins on July 15, 1988 with two university students in Edinburgh, Dexter and Emma, sharing an evening of drink and sex. Dex is from a wealthy family, Emma is not. Dex is handsome, but not overly ambitious, and Emma, not the type of girl who captures men's attention when she walks in the room, is, as Dex says, \\"is one of those girls who used 'bourgeois' as a term of abuse\\".    The novel follows Dex and Emma for the next twenty years on the date of July 15th. We watch as they become good friends, but not more than that, although at certain points in time each fancies the other romantically- just not, it seems, at the same time.    Dex becomes a successful television presenter, making good money, dating lots of hot women, drinking way too much, but it's a shallow life. Emma is less successful personally and professionally. The one constant in their lives is their friendship. When they are together, they become more than the sum of their parts, if only they realized it.    As Dex gets older, his looks fade and he is no longer the 'golden boy'. He marries a wealthy woman, but is he happy? Emma's life gets better after she ends a relationship that is not suited to her. She gets a job as a teacher and works on writing a novel.    Nicholls brilliantly captures these two people, and their relationship is one that will be recognizable to many people. He is not afraid to make Dex downright unlikeable much of time, yet he gets us to root for Dex to be a better man. Our heart breaks for Emma, and we just want to see her get the life and love she deserves.    One Day is the kind of book you don't fall in love with right away; it slowly seduces you until you realize by the end how deeply you have fallen in love with it. Dex and Emma will at times infuriate you, make you laugh and break your heart, but you will not forget them, nor will you forget the heartrending end of this near perfect novel.
B001HN697M|5.0|I enjoyed watching it.  It wasn't as intense as the first two but still good to watch.
0765326353|5.0|Okay, the first 30% of the book was a little boring. I was constantly peeking ahead, wondering when Kaladin's and Dalinar's storyline would return (got a little tired of Shallan in the beginning there, and Szeth had too much explanation of the magic going on...yes, I understand what a Lashing is the first time you say it...), and getting a little wary of the flashbacks.<br /><br />But the last two-thirds? Amazing. I literally could not stop reading until I finished it. It sucked me in. Granted, at times, the characters could be a little one-dimensional (particularly a good percentage of the Bridge 4 crew; I felt like he was attempting to develop them more than what actually came across in the reading). Still, I was never dissatisfied.<br /><br />I am getting a little tired of Brandon's method of making a female character: start with a sharp tongue, strong intellect and add in some fanciful, mysterious trait, and bam. Seems like the only women that weren't like this were mentioned fleetingly (like Dalinar's wife). All others were always vixens of some sort...pretty, witty and dangerous. I got more than my share of that in Elantris and Mistborn. Also, I kind of feel like he struggles with romance...but I appreciate the fact that he doesn't make sex and lust a huge part of his stories.<br /><br />But ah! Don't take that as criticism on this book. It was a minor annoyance. I rarely get sucked into fantasy, because I find it so tedious, but Brandon's plain prose is oddly refreshing. It's nice to turn off my brain and let him show me the story and immerse myself completely.<br /><br />Please, please try this book. It's not for everyone, but if you are remotely a fan of the genre, you should check it out. His worlds, magic systems and mysteries are fabulous. I am hooked. I'll be buying the next one when it comes out, as soon as it comes out.
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|I can't add anything that hasn't been already stated. The scene where the Ironman suit gets stolen by somebody who has never stepped inside of one before made me cringe.     The scenario is so typical now...sequels to blockbuster's are just half-assed thrown together because they know theye are gonna make money regardless. At least it was only wasted NF rental for me.

B003UYUR10|5.0|I love all of the Prince of Persia games, and I think that this movie was a very good adaption. The writers created a good storyline around the basic ideas of the game, which was enjoyable to watch and fun to follow. I love the bluray features and would encourage other people to buy it too!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|First book I read on the Kindle. As usual with D Brown novels, the set up is well done and the suspense builds quickly.    However, the climax was such a letdown and the ending was extremely long and boring.  I actually skipped the last few chapters and moved on to a new novel for my kindle.

He was so happy to get a new copy, as this was one of his favorite movies when he was growing up.  When he mentioned it to me recently, I searched at Amazon to see if I could find it for him, and there it was. It's a classic for children who love fairy tales.  This DVD arrived from a private seller quickly and in excellent condition. It contains, in addition to the movie itself, all sorts of extras like little games to play and video about how the movie was made, including interviews with some of the stars and the creators.
030726999X|4.0|What a wonderful book and an adventure.  I will miss Lisbeth Salendar, but I am happy for some consistency for her in her life. I hear that someone may write up her sister's story. I may try that as well if it ever comes to pass. Her passion, bravery, brilliance and creativity are examples to us all.  My purchase of The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was the very first book that I had ordered that was this kind of book. But I just hoped that more like this were written.

B003XKAZK4|4.0|Presenting Robbie Williams' radio hits in reverse chronological order, this collection shows how his music has evolved from Oasis-lite to world-class pop, and also reveals the remarkable variety in his work.<br /><br />Many of these songs are among the best of the late 90's and early 2000s, and offer a summation of both Britpop and good songcraft.<br /><br />Of course all the classics are here (mostly on disc 2), while the first disc highlights his more recent work since his break with Guy Chambers. Of note is the new \\"makeup\\" duet with Gary Barlow, along with another excellent new song co-written with Barlow (\\"Heart and I\\"), a vintage Take That song, and his first solo single 'Freedom'. Recent fine singles from his current studio album 'Reality Killed the Video Star' (\\"Morning Sun\\", \\"You Know Me\\", \\"Bodies\\") are also included, as well as several tracks from his uber-flop album 'Rudebox' and his mid-career transitional album 'Intensive Care'.<br /><br />Being a singles collection, of course some necessary album tracks are absent, and also the censored radio versions of Rudebox and Come Undone are presented. (As if most Robbie fans would be offended or surprised by his use of language). Since the bleeped lyrics are actually a distraction and don't really fool anyone, the proper album versions should have been included in this case.<br /><br />A 3rd disc includes many otherwise hard-to-find b-sides (which are sometimes better than his singles). Although Robbie has released many more b-sides than are presented here, this disc offers a good overview of their variety and quality (including one superb new track).<br /><br />There is also a deluxe 6-disc edition of this collection available, which includes 2 DVDs (playable only on PAL equipment, or a PC) containing all his music videos thus far (including the uncensored \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"Rudebox\\"), as well as a previously-unreleased Berlin concert film, also in PAL. The larger-format booklet for this edition includes additional photos and song lyrics.<br /><br />Overall then this is an excellent and comprehensive summary of Robbie's career thus far, effectively obliterating his previous Greatest Hits collection.verall then this is an excellent and comprehensive summary of Robbie's career thus far, effectively obliterating his previous Greatest Hits collection.

You get introduced to the Roman side of the demigods and you learn that the difference is deadly.<br /><br />It was a GREAT read.  It flows well and keeps you guessing with Jason as he rediscovers who he is.  It brings to life several more Greek stories and makes you live the life of a demigod.<br /><br />Definitely worth the read!

0385342047|4.0|I am a mom and a teacher who just wants to unwind and read something that doesn't involve a lot of thinking, but is well written and fun. I was so happy to see that there was another Shopaholic book out, and despite some of the negative reviews, I downloaded it to my Kindle anyway, and I am glad I did! Is it deep? No. Is it a piece of prolific writing? No. But it is a good read that will give you a laugh, and entertain you for a few days. After reading other novels like \\"What is the What\\" and other heavier reads, this is a welcome break. Thanks Kinsella!
B000000OAN|5.0|This isn't my favorite Queen album but it's their most interesting imo . Up till this point they were , to me , a hard rock band ..with a bit of a penchant for the unusual . A Night At The Opera to me is as close to the Beatles white album as anyone's ever come . All the songs are really good and all the songs are different .<br />The album opens with Death On Two Legs so you figure you're in for another hard rock treat ...then Queen does a 360 on the second track Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon , a song reminiscent of Beatles Honey Pie ...so now you know you're either in for a real treat if your open minded or a disappointment if your taste is limited to hard rock . After this each song is more different then the previous track ..I'm In Love With My Car ..hard rock , You're My Best Friend - pop ,39 -Brian My's acoustic thingy . Sweet Lady - back to hard rock .Seaside Rendezvous - another song with 20's flavor .the Prophet's Song -back to hard rock. Love of My Life - a ballad .Good Company -a Brian May track featuring the ukulele that also has an old fashioned flavor . Then Bohemian Rhapsody - a song that's all over the place ..in a good way . Then finally May's traditional instrumental version of God Save The Queen .<br />It's all great stuff and when you put it all together they wind up doing something that only the Beatles could do ...by throwing caution to the wind , not sticking to any formula and trying to be as as diverse as possible Queen winds up with one of the great albums in music history . It's good to be different .
B000002UDD|5.0|Flawed album to be sure, but probably my favorite-what is good is Megadeth at it's angriest best.   what is bad is...so what?
B000FC2FVA|5.0|I bought this album the day after seeing a Phoenix concert I did not pay for (friends bought the tickets), so I did not know any of the material and had no expectations. And it has been on repeat airplay at my house since! One of the few albums that I can listen to without skipping a song -- there is not a bad tune on this. And the tunes! Pure perfect pop crafstmanship, whatever the band's label might be these days ('indie'? electronica? new wave disco? whateva) I prefer: anthemic, fun, addictive, funky, quirky, joyous, full of possibility -- like a vast blue sky on a clear sunny day.<br />Then there is Thomas Mars' teenage boy voice, belting out the lullaby of the boy that got away, imbued with both knock-kneed innocence and wet-palm longing. I love his little 'hmph's interspersed between the verses. The boy's got charisma. Lucky Sofia Coppola!<br />And the guitars! Swirling, dense, rich, and warm like a freshly-baked cinnamon bun! The instrumental 'North' is just gorgeous. Other favorites: 'Rally', 'Second to None', 'Lost and Found', 'Consolation Prizes', 'One Time Too Many'. All of them! My only regret is not discovering this album earlier (it came out in 2006 and I bought it in summer 2009). Instead of the usual dour rock or oversexed pop/hip-hop, I could have instead had this happy music in my life . Thank you, Phoenix!
B001KVZ6LQ|2.0|I was greatly looking forward to the blu-ray disc of the original KING KONG<br />since Warner Bros. Home Video had done superb blu-ray discs of other classic<br />films. But talk about how too much anticipation can lead to a disappointing<br />viewing experience.<br /><br />Part of the problem is is that no original camera negatives exist for many<br />classics from the often pined for \\"Golden Age Of Hollywood\\" KING KONG being<br />one of many such films. Its still a highly enjoyable film and the visual<br />effects are amazing for 1933 but and this is a big BUT. with all of the<br />advanced digital technology available today and considering Warner Bros.<br />Home Video's A+ track record with their previous blu-ray discs of classic<br />films the picture image of the KK blu-ray disc should have been much crisper<br />and sharper etc... than it is. it is *barely* better than the special edition<br />restored dvd of KK that WBH Video released Dec. of 2005.<br /><br />Since no original camera negatives exist for the 1933 KK WBH Video should have<br />done a complete and i mean a ***COMPLETE*** restoration/remastering etc... of<br />whatever print of the film they used. Again the most disappointing blu-ray<br />disc i have yet come across.
B0021L9MJG|4.0|I love Horror anthologies and i have since before creepshow ever came out, I remember watching the old Ones with Vincent price Like Twice told tales & Tales of terror or the Amicus anthologies, House that dripped blood & Torture Garden ect.. So id like to think that i know a good anthology when i see it, & Creepshow is brilliant, i love the comic book wrap around story with the creeper, & all the films within the movie are amazing, Ive noticed that recently anthology films in the horror genre are coming back For anyone looking for something fresh id love to suggest Nightmare alley 2010 (Brain damage films) which is another anthology with a comic book wrap around and its totaly inspired By Creepshow, which is what makes it so classic, that it has inspired other great films to be made. I reccoemend to anyone and the Blu-ray looks amazing.

184456035X|5.0|Amanda Root played the heroine, Anne Elliot, in a great film version, and she is the reader of this audiobook.  Her diction is very fine, she is a joy to listen to, and the sensitivity and perceptiveness of a Jane Austen heroine comes across in the narration.    This version is abridged.  About 40% of the words are retained and 60% discarded.  The plot comes across intact, but much of what makes the novel great (the asides, reflections, commentary) is discarded.  If you don't mind sitting for a 9-hour version instead of this 4-hour version, check out the unabridged \\"Persuasion\\" audiobook read by Juliet Stevenson.  Ms. Stevenson comes across as more of a neutral observer, but she changes her voice more for the various characters.    That's not to take away from Amanda Root's uniquely fine reading.  If you're big on \\"Persuasion\\", get both.  That's what I did.
0312370849|3.0|First let me say, like many people, I knew nothing about the Vel d'hiv, the round-up of thousands of Jews - mostly women and children - in the heart of Paris, France.  I knew nothing of how the French police themselves orchestrated the round-up, held the parents and children in the Vel d'hiv for days, shipped them to camps in the Parisian suburbs, separated the parents from the children, sent the parents to their deaths and left the children to wither and die before eventually shpping them to their deaths.  I don't frankly know whether to be embarrassed or outraged by this glaring knowledge gap - this certainly wasn't taught when I was in school, the French were on \\"our side\\", after all.  For this reason alone, this book is well worth reading.<br /><br />Had I reviewed this book when I was only about half-way through it, I would unhesitatingly have given it five stars.  I was riveted and horrified; I could hardly stand to put the book down.  The alternating stories - Julia's discovery and research on the history of her family's apartment and Sarah's story of the round-up and its aftermath - intertwine seemlessly.  Unlike some reviewers, I didn't feel that Julia's story was merely a frame for Sarah's story.  Both stories are important in their own right.  The events from sixty years ago have a profound impact on Julia's life, but only in the confluence of events in her own life - the past illuminates her present.  When the two stories come together, it is disappointing to lose Sarah's thread of the story, but Julia's voice is still strong enough to carry the story alone.  For a while, anyway.  Had the story ended soon after that point, it would still deserve five stars.<br /><br />However, the longer the book goes on after that, and the farther we get away from Sarah's story while getting deeper into Julia's story, the worse the book gets.  Ms. de Rosnay apparently felt the need to wrap the book into a tidy package for us, but the more she tries to do so, the more contrived it feels.  Many of the events are just too easy, too predictable.  Not that there are any big surprises in the book at all.  In the first half of the book, we know largely what's going to happen in Sarah's story because we know the history of the Vel d'hiv and we know Julia's present knowledge.  We also know much of what's going to happen in Julia's story because we know Sarah's story.  The suspense comes not from finding out what happens, but from the drama and horror of watching it play out.  It's much like watching a train wreck.  Even though you might see it coming well in advance, you still can't tear your eyes away from watching how it plays out, even hoping against hope that somehow things will be all right.<br /><br />But the second half of the book is predictable in a much more trite way.  There were so many times I found myself thinking, \\"Wouldn't it be convenient if....\\" or \\"I bet....\\" and, voila, I was right.  Wrapping up the book in such a predictable, tidy package stole so much of the thunder of the first half of the book that I was left feeling so disappointed I almost threw the book away.<br /><br />Julia's character, in my opinion, also becomes less sympathetic as the second half of the book progresses.  At the beginning of the book she is largely unsympathetic in the way that many abused wives are.  While we understand her husband's charm and the hold he has over her, we might find ourselves annoyed that, despite everyone pointing out to her how arrogant and unfeeling he is toward her, she is immediately drawn back in every time he is attentive and \\"loving\\" to her.  His bedroom behavior is clearly more important than his day-to-day treatment of her.  But our opinion starts to improve as Julia, drawn in by Sarah's story, begins to make her own decisions and stand up to Bertrand, first in little ways, then much bigger ways.  Bertand, ever the narcissist, having belittled and dismissed her interests and concerns all along, now crumples and accuses her of not loving him, not seeing his pain, poor baby.  Julia, always easily manipluated by him, is crushed by his \\"pain\\", but nevertheless, she stands up to him and we begin to feel that she has some genuine depth to her self.  However, as the second half of the book progresses, Julia herself becomes more shallow and narcissitic.  She's obsessed with her need to follow Sarah's story, and she plunges on without much thought for the feelings and needs of others, including her own daughter (who is, perhaps precocious precisely because she's had to take care of her mother?) and the other person most affected by Sarah's story.  I felt that she started the book as a flat caricature, gained a lot of depth as the book went on, but then ended again as a flat caricature (albeit a different kind of caricature).<br /><br />I had a hard time deciding how to rate this book.  As I've said, the first half deserves five stars, but after the second half, I didn't really want to give it any stars.  But the subject matter and Sarah's story make the book compelling enough to recommend it, so I decided on the rather wimpy compromise of three stars.  I don't believe I will be reading any of Ms. de Rosnay's other books, but I'm glad I read this one.<br /><br />[Side note, and not really important to the book, but Ms. de Rosnay needs to spend more time with small children before attempting to write about them.  The child she depicts at the end is not two years old.  Two-year-olds don't \\"coo\\", they talk.  Perhaps not entirely understandably, but more or less fluently.  It's also unlikely that a two-year-old would fall asleep in the stroller in a busy cafe, especially after having just gotten up from a nap, nor would a two-year-old need her sister's help to stay on a tricycle.]seeing his pain, poor baby.

B000MVN8G0|5.0|I have been following \\"Supernatural\\" since the middle or Season 4, and caught up with previous seasons through netflix.  This episode immediately struck me as particularly good.  (Others that stand out on a similar vein are \\"Bloody Mary\\" from season 1 and \\"Malleus Maleficarum\\" from season 3.) It has a story grounded in human relationships, with a villainess who is alternately charming and sinister.  I think a particularly effective point is that the nature of the undead woman is never really resolved. Was she an evil spirit in a human form, or just the soul of the deceased dragged where she didn't belong?    Also, the UNbox download is excellent quality, much better than netflix (which doesn't offer the \\"instant\\" option for the show in any case).  The atmospheric night scenes in this episode would hardly be worth watching at the resolution I have seen from netflix.    David N. Brown  Mesa, Arizona

At first they think they are in a jungle, but that jungle idea falls through when they find they cannot get an accuate bearing on their location, the sun doesn't move, and some other - odder - things. Eight people in the woods, on a walk that might well kill them.<br />Fun.<br /><br />I personally like Predators because it held the mystery that the first movie had. There is a lot of ground and there are lots of guns, and the people being hunted are not the nicest people that you might meet. A merc, an assassin, yakuza, and other round out the group. also doing this group justice is the caliber of the actor. They make a lot of things believeable that would otherwise be hard to buy.<br /><br />The one oddity here is L. fishburn who does something I would not have expected. Still, that makes for a good movie because, really, you shouldn't be able to predict things so easily. He's actually funny an this is an odd departure for him.<br />I liked.<br /><br />The Predators here also are different in some ways, keeping the goods we know but adapting to their playground. Other things are here as well, and those things make the place interesting. There are some gimmicks (chaingun, some of the traps you see here and there) are not new, but they are not overwhelming in the plot. What is nice to note is that this is a new movie for fans and people who just want to try the series on once more.<br /><br />Nice stuff - 4.5 stars or more.

B003XRDYX2|5.0|I received this soon to be legendary box set from my wife today as a present for my birthday and I couldn't be happier.  Obviously, it's the mono sound that makes this release special, especially for those of us that lived through the era.  As others have said, the sound is very full and powerful. While it's appropriate that the packaging presents each CD as a miniature replica of the original packaging, that's less important to me than the sound.  That said, my box came with the what appear to be replicas of the sleeves for the first 2 albums.  The sleeve for the first album has color advertising for other Columbia albums of the time (Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Ray Conniff, etc. - not exactly well-targeted advertising for the purchaser of a Bob Dylan album!)  \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" came in a generic-looking Columbia sleeve of the era.  The rest of the sleeves are plain white paper.  Each cardboard CD case really does appear to be a faithful replica of the original LP packaging, as do the labels printed on each CD.  While I would be interested in knowing if other purchasers received more of the authentic replicas of the sleeves, for right now, I'm just going to enjoy the pristine sound of the most important musical voice of my generation.
B002VPE1XE|3.0|The AmazonBasics Universal Camera Case is about as basic as you can get for a camera case. It has a long Velcro flap in front, a Velcro belt loop on the back, and a very thin strap above the belt loop. Under the main flap in front, there is a zippered pocket which is very narrow. Can't hold much more than a memory card or two, and the flap doesn't feel super secure.    The main compartment can hold a decent-sized camera. This is overkill if you have a Canon ELPH or other slim model. Fits my old Canon A540 with room to spare, but disappointed that the front pocket won't hold spare batteries (the Canon A540 uses AA batteries).    It would be nice if there was a thicker shoulder strap which connects to the sides of the case. The flimsy strap it comes with (it's like the ones that you put on your actual point-and-shoot... kind of like a Wiimote strap) doesn't give you a sense of security when dangling from your wrist.    Remember the old saying... you get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend this case if you plan on carrying it around a lot. If you're using it to store a camera in a drawer, then it's a good deal.

7885142450|5.0|I think these movies are an improvement and refinement of the original series. The first movie, You Are (Not) Alone, really just mirrors the beginning of the series with much better graphics. The second movie, You Can (Not) Advance, is obviously adding to the story in significant ways.     I happen to love these movies and are superior to the series, which was not very well planned, but a great series despite it's lack of thoughtful execution. The brilliance of Evangelion is in its characters and in the psychological exploration of Shinji. In fact, I think Evangelion can be viewed as an archetypal dream and the dreamer is Shinji.    Much better than the series so far. I highly recommend it.    And, oh yea, this bootleg is of great quality.

0345509617|1.0|PLEASE READ!<br />It is with a heavy heart that I write this -  Let this be a WARNING to everyone who has purchased or thinking of purchasing this book.<br /><br />For Starters - I pre-ordered this book several months ago.  When it finally arrived I set it down on my coffee table, opened it up and to my HORROR discovered that the binding had ripped away from the spine at page 3!  I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement and that worked out very easily.  Before shipping the book back I looked through it and was amazed at the photos, 75% of which I have never seen before!  I tried to read the text, but my aging eyes prevented me from reading without assistance.  Like most 1st Generation Star Wars Fans who are in their 40's my eyesight isn't what it used to be.  The font is too small and the print too light.  They could have at least used `Black' as the Color font and not some silver-grey! So, I shipped the book back.<br /><br />Less than 4 days later; I received my replacement book.  I opened it and to my dismay and horror discovered the exact same problem!  The Binding had torn from the pages on Page 3!  At first I thought it was the exact same book I had sent back.  (It wasn't)  So, once again I went through the steps and returned the book via UPS in a very easy procedure (Kudos to Amazon for making that part easy)  I also sent an email to customer service and received a kind, but frustrating response saying that they would not replace the book, but rather refund my credit card for the order.  They are also going to investigate to see if it is indeed a manufacturing defect.<br /><br />So, with that said I say to everyone who has purchased this book to examine the binding at the Spine especially around Page 3.  If you have an issue contact Amazon.  Hopefully the Manufacturer will fix this problem (and change the Font Color).  I still plan on buying this book as it is that good.  I will also look forward to the inevitable Making of Return of the Jedi edition that more than likely will be published in the next few years (Probably around 2013 to coincide with the 30th Anniversary of Jedi.)<br /><br />So I give the books content  5 Stars -<br />The Binding/Manufacture/Quality of the construction of the book itself 0 Stars<br />and Amazon 5 Stars for service.ished in the next few years (Probably around 2013 to coincide with the 30th Anniversary of Jedi.)

B003VS0CWO|3.0|I appreciate the Blu-ray's packaging, booklet, and special features, but I have to say that I prefer to watch the 25th Anniversary DVD rather than the new Blu-ray. I am using a Sony HD LCD TV and a Sony Blu-ray 570 player and the video on the new RHPS blu-ray disc has a \\"digital graininess\\" that is very distracting.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, even if the premise of aliens crash landing in Viking Scandinavia sounds strange, it is well executed, has decent special effects, and the action and plot move us quickly through the film. If you know the basic plot to Beowulf, you may enjoy the movie even more; considering that the writer provides believable explanations to how the story could have formed from the events in the film.
B000069HKH|5.0|In late 2001 Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band went into the studio and put down 15 great tracks that made \\"The Rising\\" #1.  Recorded after the 9-11 events that shook NYC and the rest of America, Bruce and the boys tried and succeeded with what they were going through and also trying to uplift the spirits of the people after the tragedy.  This would be the first E-Street Band in 18 years, since \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\", and the fans were ready!  This is no \\"Born To Run\\", but after a few spins \\"The Rising\\", is top notch Bruce.      Here are some of the highlights:    \\"Lonesome Day\\"- \\"Hell's brewin', dark sun's on the rise\\".  #36 adult top 40.  An uplifting message, Soozie's violin steers this song.    \\"Into The Fire\\"- \\"May your strengh, give us strengh\\".  About the NYC firefighters that many lost there lives. good glockenspiel by Brendan O'brien.    \\"Waitin' On A Sunny Day\\"- \\"Hard times, baby well they came to us all\\".  A very joyful song, a concert favorite for years, the Big Man's first sax solo on album.    \\"Nothing Man\\"- \\"Darlin' give me your kiss\\". Very touching ballad, would of fit perfectly on \\"Tunnel Of Love\\".    \\"Countin' On A Miracle\\"- \\"There ain't no storybook story\\".  A slice of upbeat Bruce, with some fine guitar licks.    \\"Empty Sky\\"- \\"I woke up this morning I could barely breathe\\".  Another heart felt song about 9-11, beautiful harmonicaby Bruce, good hurdy gurdy guitar by Brendan.    \\"World's Apart\\"- \\"\\"I taste the seed upon your lips, lay my tongue upon your scars\\".  Modern world sounding Springsteen, good rock piece, nice back ground vocals by Ali Khan and group.    \\"Lets Be Friends(Skin To Skin)\\"- \\"Don't know when this chance might come again\\".  Good vocals with Bruce by wife Patti, very pop friendly, Clarence joins in with a slick sax.    \\"Further On (Up The Road)\\" - \\"Searching through the dust, looking for a sign\\".  A good rock 'n roll song, with some good pounding drums by Max Weinberg.    \\"The Fuse\\"- \\"Trees on fire with the first fall's fruit\\".  Another modern sounding song with chord changes.  \\"The Fuse\\" can go in many different ways.    \\"Mary's Place\\"- \\"Let it Rain, let it rain\\".  A true uplifting tune, Soozie's violin and Steve's mandolin sound good, 50's sounding rock song, Clarence does a mean sax here.    \\"You're Missing\\" -  \\"I got dust on my shoes, nothing but teardrops\\".  About a family that's missing that certain person, good cello's hold this together, and Danny's B3 organ.    \\"The Rising\\"- \\"Sky of mercy, sky of fear\\".  #52 hot 100, #24 mainstream rock, A true Springsteen classic, A concert favorite, 9/11 started, Nils guitar rules.    \\"Paradise\\"- \\"The Virginia hills have gone to brown\\".  A more solemn tune here, great acoustic instruments, a strong song nothingless.    \\"My City Of Ruins\\"- \\"Now the sweet bells of mercy, drift through the ending trees\\".  The album ends with this great personal message song. Ends with Bruce givin' everybody some hope that things will get better.    This album won 3 grammys,  Best rock album  Best song The Rising  and Best Male Vocal Bruce.

B0043RGY9W|4.0|Bridge, noun, \\"In songwriting, a bridge is an interlude that connects two parts of a song, and which creates a harmonic connection between those parts.\\" (Source, wikipedia).  The bridge to nowhere describes much of Metallic Spheres perfectly.  It is all bridge.  Two great artists in a jam session going nowhere.  The music is fine, and with the anchor of David Gilmour's guitar, mixed with Alex Patterson's electronics, it does reach some relative peaks that seem to want to move beyond transitional playing, but for the most part, never do.  The Metallic movements of this album are much more melodic than the Sphere movements. For fans of either Orb or Gilmour, the Metallic side is going to be more familiar, especially in the 3 and 4th movements, where Dave starts up with some great country fried playing.  The Sphere side is pure electronic jam that goes almost nowhere fast.<br /><br />When you have the Orb or Gilmour association, expectations are high.  Both artists can produce highly melodic dopamine releasing songs.  Gilmour, with the absolutely stellar \\"On an Island\\" for comparison, comes up short with this current album; not because he is not playing well, just because his playing really goes nowhere.  Like other reviewers, I would love to see these two get together and produce a planned out album together.<br /><br />If you were sitting on the lawn, and listening to Gilmour doodle and finger his guitar with no expectations, this would be great recording.  As it stands, expectations are too high for such a collaboration between The Orb and David Gilmour.  Lower the bar a bit and everything will sound great.<br /><br />File under: music for slow days where nothing really matters anyway.
B0036D7Y1Q|5.0|Verdi: Otello (2 CD/CD-ROM)is a recording under the direction of the one and only Herbert Von Karajan who leads the Berlin Philharmoniker on this EMI Records Ltd recording from 1974. Charles Osborne has written a very well-written essay entitled \\"Othello: an Introduction\\" and also written a very informative synopsis. The lyrics are only available in Italian and the booklet is 79 pages. Jon Vickers is amazing in his role as Otello and it is truly a pleasure to such a fine tenor. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B00284BNKC|5.0|The first thing that needs to be said is that REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is honest and raw.  Nothing is held back here.  It is not a story told to lightly touch on the subject of addiction.  Instead the entire film is living in the life of an addict with nothing held back.  Being in recovery I see how true to life this film is.  It starts right off with our main characters using.  We have Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly all giving the performances of a lifetime.  The characters are likable and shown in enough of a perspective that we can care for them but the downward spiral that will continue throughout the fim begins right at the start.  Jared and Jennifer are boyfriend and girlfriend shooting up to escape, get a high or just relax.  Ellen Burstyn is the mother who goes to the doctor to get pills to help loose weight.  All starts innocent enough but the film quickly turns into the never ending descent into hell that is the life of an addict.  It realistically shows how what one thinks is a chosen act for escape becomes a psychological and physical addiction for which the user will do anything.  The hell they endure is self inflicted but they cannot stop due to the addiction.  This movie is scarier than any thriller or stalker film for it is about real life.  Many don't want to see or even imagine the life of a true drug addict and the ends to which our characters go to get their drug gets more and more horrific as the film goes on.  The scariest part of it is that it is all a realistic portrayal of the life of an addict.  There is no joy here.  The film is a descent into hell and it ends with a wallop.  For most one viewing will be enough for this film.  It is a masterpiece but how often does one choose to go to hell.<br /><br />On the other side, this film truly is a masterpiece.  Even though it is 10 years old it is the most honest, realistic depiction of drug addiction ever on film.  The reason to view this film again is the amazing performances by the main three and the superb directing by Darren Aronofsky.  The blu ray transfer is amazing.  You would never guess that the film is 10 years old and the transfer makes all the colors crisper and video more vivid.  The audio is amazing.  Bottom line, the blu ray transfer holds strong to the integrity of the film. It is grainy where need be and the clarity to the rest brings the message and horror of this film that much stronger.  I highly recommend this film.  Be prepared and aware of what you will be viewing.  This is a tough fim to watch - bottom line.  But it is an amazing film and when a film  so honestly and truthfully tackles such a difficult subject you must view it.  And as I said, you will be so awe struck by the performances that you may want to view it again.  The blu ray version is superb.  The film is hardcore and an experience you will never forget.

B003YK42LQ|1.0|I was very disappointed by this album, I was really looking for some 'new' sounding KOL.  This band USED to challenge themselves into making music that sounded different.  The vocals didn't always match what you'd expect to hear with the music.  The distortion on their guitars was so gritty I could taste sand in my mouth.    Now, the lyrics and the the music just kinda flow, in a \\"yep I heard this song on the last album\\" type of way. Caleb doesn't sound like he's challenging the sounds. Same goes for the guitar and the overall sound.  Instead of pushing the limits of what sounds they can put together and make work, I feel like they've slouched down in a comfy couch and said \\"Let's just do what we know and make some more money\\".    The band REALLY has to ditch this idea that they're 'Arena Rock'.  I keep reading interviews where they say this is what they're tying to do.  I don't know if they think they're the next U2, or Cold Play, but that sorta sounds like the direction they're TRYING to take their music, and it's failing miserably.  Both Cold Play & U2 know how to take a somewhat 'normal' song, and push sounds into it that elevate the music to the next level. KOL is lacking this 'push'.    KOL needs to get back to their roots.    Lets take \\"Immortals\\" for example.  I felt like this song was a start of a classic KOL song, but the vocals here just fall WAY WAY flat.  They're very repetitive, with little to no stretching... put some more MEAT into the vocals of this song, a scream, or screetch, or even some fluctuation in tone... I want songs I can barely sign along with b/c the vocals are so crazy.  I doubt the band will be getting ANY props from Dylan for any songs on this album.    I'd like to take KOL, and Eagles of Death Metal, and have them do a collaborative project in the HOPES that KOL would remember what it's like to make creative rock.  They should go play some small venue's to remember what it's like to combine bad acoustics, with gritty guitars and seemingly hapless vocals that just meld into an elegant symphony of chaos... and then go back to the studio and say \\"how do we make an album that sounds like THAT!\\"    Sorry boys, this one doesn't do it for me AT ALL!!!     I'll still be rocking out to your old stuff, and wishing you'd ditch the idea of an 'arena rock' band, and concentrate on making NEW music again.
B003XKAZK4|4.0|I am very confused about some of the reviews here for this item is a 3 disc set - 2 cds of hits and 1 cd of rarities.  There are no additional discs that are dvds.  So please, look at what Amazon says you are receiving and the song track listing for each disc.  Perhaps the others are talking of an International release.  This is what you receive in a harbound cd size book with a 20 page insert.  I am a huge Robbie Williams fan and was very excited for this release.  His Greatest Hits collection from 2004 was amazing and to anticipate a release encompassing his entire career was thrilling.  But the total package here leaves me a little listless.  Robbie Williams is a great singer, song interpreter, song writer and born entertainer.  His career has encompassed many styles of music and each decade seems to show a new Robbie Williams.  This package for all its extravagance actually provides very little.  The hardback booklet is great but the 20 pages inside are all Robbie Williams pictures and only at the back are the tracks for each cd listed in small print with the writers of each song.  There is no info on what album the songs are from or if they were even hits or just solid album tracks.  Die hard fans will realize that the set starts from brand new material and works backwards to his early work.  The rarities and b-side cd is great but again, no info on when these songs were recorded or what part they played in his career.  I believe loyal fans deserved extensive liner notes in this booklet on the career of Robbie Williams and a full explanation of the musical journey this whole set would privide.<br /><br />There is great music here.  It is Robbie Williams of course but I would have liked a disc of more comprehensive hits and then another cd with new material.  Hearing the hits I love appear far into the listening experience made me run and play the cds they were from.  The set up here lacks a cohesiveness or at least an explanation to the listener.  For me all Robbie Williams cds have had an emotional depth and a continuity.  It is lacking here.  There was such a great opportunity here to mark the milestone of Robbie's 20 years in music.  Usually casual listeners who want an intro to an artist go for the hit collections and this will be a very confusing listen for them.  It shows an experimental Robbie Williams but lacks in showing the magic and emotional essence all his strong hits provided.  Luckily the first review here on Amazon goes into great detail and provides all the info I feel should have been in the liner notes of the collection.  For die hard fans this is a must.  It is remastered perfectly and has lots of new Robbie music.  But for a true greatest hits set it misses the mark.liams cds have had an emotional depth and a continuity.  It is lacking here.

0439023521|5.0|I honestly can say I loved every single page of this book, my only complaint being that I finished it so quickly.  For two days I drove everyone at my work and my husband crazy talking about every little detail in this book.  I have recommended it to everyone and find myself reading it a second time after only a week of having finished it.  The storyline is uniquely disturbing and I honestly can not wait until I have the chance to read the rest of this Trilogy.

B000FC11A6|5.0|I have read Cryptonomicon twice. The first time was an enjoyable, sublime and yet difficult experience. (The math was tricky for me!) I loved the characters and the story line and could not put it down. And I was drawn back to it. I read it again about a year later, and for whatever reasons, the second reading was way better. (Yeah, I know, 1000+ pages!)    Even if you are not the type of person that has the patience to read a 1000+ page novel, the two chapters that will make it worthwhile are the 'Captain Crunch', and the 'Wisdom' chapters. As dire, brutal, and heart wrenching as some of this book is, these two chapters will make you want to laugh out loud. If you like Vonnegut or even Clavell, you will love this book!     As another reviewer said, you can skip over the math and still follow the story without losing anything. So don't get bogged down with the crypto-details. Skip over what you cannot comprehend, it's okay. You will be rewarded.

B004132HZS|5.0|Holmes is a British icon, much like Doctor Who, or James Bond. And like those two, he cannot, and must not, be tied down to any specific time. He gets reinterpreted again and again for the current era. This 2010 series is an excellent retelling of the Sherlock mythos, which is respectful of the Arthur Conan Doyle source material. Holmes is played wonderfully by Benedict Cumberbatch as a sociopathic, highly intelligent, eccentric. His take is most different to the recent film starring Robert Downey Jr (also a great performance), but is one of the most fascinating depictions of Holmes I have ever seen.     I was admittedly sceptical when I heard they were making a contemporary version of Holmes. But I relaxed as soon as I heard the excellent Steven Moffat (Coupling, Jekyll, Dr Who) and Mark Gatiss (League of Gentlemen, Dr Who) were involved in the writing. And it didn't disappoint. Great series. Highly recommended.

B00005AXKM|4.0|My 10-year high school reunion is coming up in a few weeks.  I had no idea -going by the description of this movie- that it would be focusing on a 10-year reunion.  Just pretty weird timing.    Anyway the film is about two young women who are approaching 30 years of age, and find out their high school reunion is coming up.  They really want to impress their classmates, in particular a group of ignorant and sassy young ladies who the two girls *despised* while going through high school.    So the girls find a way to impress their old classmates until the big day arrives, and of course, there's relationship segments involving a certain boy that one of the girls likes.    It's a very likeable style of humor.  The jokes aren't necessarily one-liners, but the humor comes more in the way in how the storyline develops.  It's not for everyone though.  Don't expect immediately, jaw-droppingly amazing jokes.  Just expect a few smiles here and there.    It's also a very respectable movie (despite the \\"f\\" word being thrown around occasionally of course!) and there's nothing particularly dirty about the storyline either.      Overall, it's a pretty good movie that has enough laughs to recommend watching.
B003KGBISY|4.0|Great Movie. Quality of picture and sound is super, However, the only caveat is the subtitles disappear at the bottom of the screen. Partially alleviated it by drastically reducing the size of the picture.  However, the second line of the subtitles are partially blocked even at the greatly reduced size. Do not know if it is due to a bad disc or a general problem with the edition. Has anyone else experienced this problem? If not for this problem it would be five stars.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|Don't bother producing Ultimate Edition 5 and 6 if you don't produce them with extended versions of the films.  That is why I we are buying them.  If you had any morals and/or common sense you would produce an extended version of 3 and 4 in which fans who bought the Ultimate Edition could trade them in.  This is no way to treat loyal fans that are paying good money for a less than an \\"Ultimate\\" product.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Great price and my purchase arrived quickly without problem, which was great because I love this movie. Thanks!
0545123283|5.0|I didn't expect a second edition to the first so I am doubly surprized.  All I can say is: You won't be able to get your hands on this book fast enough.  The story is progressive and well developed, the characters are all believable and strong.  The resolution is incredible, leaving me wondering when the next addition will be out...
B002SQKQHQ|2.0|I recently purchased this book at a used book store in the Thamel area of Kathmandu on March 25, 2010.  Some years ago a friend of mine in Alaska had told me about the book and how great it was and so when I saw it and needing something to read, I bought it.     I began reading the book with the believe that it was true and wanted to believe that; but, due to the fact that I spent 24 years in Alaska and 13 of those years were spent above the arctic circle, I find it difficult to believe that survival after the train ride in frigid conditions would have been possible without severe frost bite at the least. I have made the trans-Siberian train ride from Moscow to Ulan Ude and on to Ullan Battar and then on to Beijing.  Getting to this point, to the railroad, from far north of the railroad would have been a difficult task but doable because once one gets south of Lake Baikal it would not have been too difficult traveling.  I have never been on the Gobi desert but to have crossed it as ill provisioned as these people claim to be would have been a miracle and it is unbelievable that during this amount of time they wouldn't have come up with more necessary provisions.    In 2006 I took, what was new that year, the train from Beijing to Lhasa and it is a real experience and one I would not to want to do on foot, but it is doable for sure.  We flew from Lhasa to Guilin China and the Li River and to this point, other than the Gobi with no water, it is plausible that these people could have done all of this.    The point where I began to really wonder about the validity of this story was when they climb up and over the Himalayan Mountains after leaving Tibet and I really wonder why they would do so when there are passes such as the Kora La at 15,072 ft elevation on the Nepal-Tibet border at the upper end of Mustang that then would allow one to go down the Kali Gandaki Gorge, the deepest gorge in the world, plus the Arniko Rajmarg/Friendship Highway route from  Tibet into Nepal.     I had just returned from the Annapurna Trek that on March 16, 2010 that took us over highest trekking pass in the world,  Thorung La pass, that is 17,765' and maybe, do to my age and various other things, that was about all that I needed but I wasn't starved down, lacking proper clothing and totally fatigued. In 2008 I made the hike to Everest Base camp and that requires one to be fairly fit; therefore, going most places in these mountains requires a great deal of effort.    I really wanted to believe this story but due to personal experience as an elk hunting guide in The Teton Wilderness of WY. plus having seen the area where the long walk would have taken place, I find it hard to do so.
0545123267|5.0|That is the only way to describe this book, it's just great.  The characters are well developed and believeable.  The story line is just as good, just as believeable, even if it is a paranormal.  The second book in this series, Linger, exceeded my expectations.  I didn't expect a second book, I'm still not sure if there will be more, but this is one that is definatly worth starting.
B003F29D44|2.0|While this is a terrific movie, I'm finding the digital video rental to be painful to watch. The image is muddy and the colors are muted.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun and Ed are inseparable best friends that share the same hobbies: playing video games, listening to electro, and frequently drinking at the Winchester Tavern. Shaun's girlfriend Liz is tired of being held back by Shaun and his slacker ways, so she breaks up with him. When he wakes up after trying to drink his sorrow away, he finds the world populated with the walking dead. After resolving to turn his life around, Shaun takes advantage of the apocalypse to take charge and win Liz back. Armed with a cricket bat and a shovel, he and Ed round up their friends and Shaun's parents and seek shelter at the only safe, secure place they know: the Winchester. With everyone depending in Shaun, will he prove to be a hero or just a washed up loser?    Shaun of the Dead is the classic story of a slacker turning his life around and becoming a hero during the zombie apocalypse. It's one of my favorite movies of all time because of its perfect balance of horror and comedy with a little splash of romance. I never would have thought that these elements could work so well together, but Edgar Wright's masterpiece of a zombie film proved me wrong. The buildup to the zombie outbreak is simply perfect. It starts off as a typical romantic comedy with a look into a normal day in Shaun's life where no one respects him and he lets his girlfriend down time and time again. The next day, he goes through close to the same routine, except for the people he usually sees on his route to the nearby convenience store are all dead, zombies, or gone. One of the things that makes this film great is the repetition. From the first normal day to the apocalypse day, many of the same things are done and said, but mean wildly different things on the second day than on the first. For example, someone commenting \\"You've got red on you\\" the first day means a red pen exploded in your pocket, but the second day means your shirt is splattered with blood from bludgeoning zombies to death with a cricket bat. Thereare quite a few things like this (way too many to write about) that provide many laughs and are also a sign of great writing.    Simon Pegg as Shaun and Nick Frost as Ed are a hilarious comedic duo. Shaun is the meek, kind of quiet slacker who lets others push him around. On Z-day, he turns his entire life around and does all the things he has always wanted to do. Ed is the foul mouthed, obnoxious under achiever who makes pretty much everyone uncomfortable around him. He's still annoying and kind of a jerk on Z-day, but he really comes through for his best friend when it matters. They are definitely an unlikely duo to become leaders during the zombie apocalypse, but at the same time are realistic characters.    Their friendship is exhibited throughout the film, even when they are in the direst of situations. I know people who would go out of their way to kill zombies as if they were in a video game and pick a random location to hide out that might not work out as well as first thought. Although much of the film is funny, there are a few very emotional and touching scenes that brought me to tears. These moments show that the characters have dimensions deeper than their slacker facades. The ability for such a funny movie to succeed in having heartbreaking, tear inducing scenes is amazing and shows a culmination of writing, acting, and directing.    Many zombie films are used as an allegory for social commentary and this one is no different. The opening credits, surprisingly, is where this is most evident, but only on the second viewing. The scene shows many of the people who turn into zombies later in the movie going through their everyday routing: working at mindless, repetitive jobs and doing the same things day after day. Are these people really any different after they become zombies? It challenges the viewer to look at their own lives and judge if they are just good little mindless zombies themselves.    Shaun of the Dead has it all: zombies, humor, romance, loss, video games, and electro. Everyone could find something they like in this film, but it's required viewing for all zombie fans.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Continuing the series. One of the funniest series on tv. Best price in market with delivery within a week of release date.
B00006LPER|4.0|I was taken aback by Isabelle Huppert's performance in this film. She plays a pianist instructor named Erika Kohut. Her self mutilation scenes made me cringe. Her mannerisms were so rigid and sharp.  I came to wonder how she was able to play music with such finesse. Benoît Magimel as Walter Klemmer was excellent. He was just the total opposite of Erika. I'm not quite sure if it is realistic to have that kind of young man be attracted to such a repressive woman. From the start I could not help but feel that the relationship would fail, as it did. Most will be fooled by the cover of the DVD box. The film is not sensual at all. It is incredibly awkward due to Erika's inability to express love and affection. This realization of Erika's unhealthy psychological problems does not doom upon her until Erika goes into a fit of rage. Erika hits her elderly mother as well as attempts to make out with her. Erika is so confused in how to express her feelings. She had been anti-social for a long time. I wasn't surprised about her revealed fetishes. I always thought strict instructors had hidden eccentric oddities about themselves. Poor Walter couldn't hack it. Erika is impious anyway. I cannot believe what Erika did to her poor student. The way in which the opening credits were displayed is creative.  Some scenes were rather long, but the music in the background makes for good diversion. \\"La Pianiste\\" is certainly emotive. My only regret is that I have not read the book before watching the movie.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|A shame to see 1300+ reviews with almost all of them glowing when almost none of them reference the Ultimate edition.  The Ultimate edition of this movie is NOT extended as 1 & 2 were.  If that's why you bought earlier Ultimate editions then stay away from everything after that!
0307463745|5.0|I was very impressed by this book.  If you are planning on starting your own business this is a must read.  It will be a huge help!
B003Q6D25U|5.0|Last year, the horror phenomenon Paranormal Activity was released. The film was probably one of the most polarizing films of the year: Some thought it was scary as hell, others thought it was boring and like home videos. I, personally, side with the \\"scary as hell\\" side and loved it enough to file it under my \\"Best Movies of 2009\\" list. It reminded me of WHY we watch horror films: to feel fear and dread, to be scared and not watch people get killed in gory ways or having crap jump out at you. There were a few jumps but the film was tension fueled, which made it brilliant.<br /><br />Now a year later, and a sequel is released. And thankfully, it manages to be just as great, and maybe even more terrifying!!! I swear with these movies, the horror genre has some hope left. In a world of crap like My Soul To Take (I didn't want to waste a long amount of time ranting so I wrote a review of MSTT in poem format), jump fueled PG-13 horror and gore/torture porn, for once we're getting horror movies that are not only ACTUALLY scary, but follow the rule that Hitchcock set up when he was making movies: the scariest aspect is what we don't see.<br /><br />This film takes place 62 days before Micah Sloat died. A new family is the focus, and the mother, Kristy, is Katie's sister. They seem happy, as they have a beautiful daugher Ali, and a CUTE baby boy Hunter. The family has been experiencing a series of what could be called break-ins. We see ONE aftermath of them- and the house looks like a tornado blew through it- broken beer bottles, stuff broken, things scattered everywhere, etc. The family then resorts to hiring a surveillance team to install a series of cameras around the house, in case any suspicious activity happens.<br /><br />However, these clearly are no break-ins. Martin, the Spanish maid, has a spooky experience one night when a giant thump reverberates through the kitchen. Things get even spookier when Ali gets locked out of the house, and some even creepier stuff happens too, one involving the baby. And then, from there... things go from creepy to downright TERRIFYING. The same demon that haunted Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston is haunting them. But DOUBLE as scary, and to the point where you can't take the scariness anymore.<br /><br />I was worried this film would not live up to its predecessor, but thank God that worry proved useless. I loved it just as much as Paranormal Activity the first one. Sure the scares are recycled, but they did that for a reason- the same demon is haunting them. That means the household the demon haunted is off to do his tricks to the next household, which, if you ask me, makes it all the more scary to think about. Like the first, this one follows the Hitchock rule. But from the \\"Kitchen\\" scene, the terror level increases. the film thereon becomes disturbing as hell and just downright terrifying.<br /><br />Another thing I must praise is that this movie manages to bring a new element to the series- the feeling of being alone, and experiencing a terrifying moment not just at night but at all times of the day. The \\"kitchen\\" scene is a good example of this- in fact that scene alone made the movie more effective than the first. Ever had those moments where you have been alone in your home, and somehow knew you weren't alone? That an unseen presence is with you? That something can happen at any time? This movie focuses on that in the same fashion the first movie focused on what happens when you sleep.<br /><br />In short, Paranormal 2 is a success, and proof there is still hope for the horror genre. If you liked this one, give it a chance, and even if you didn't like the first, still give it your best shot. I certainly loved it as much as the first, and it also must be seen on the big screen- whereas the first worked better at home, this must be seen at the theatre with a packed crowd like I saw it tonight. Recommended for sure, and be prepared to be scared out of your mind!!!g the baby. And then, from there... things go from creepy to downright TERRIFYING.

B000N6TYLW|2.0|I have loved this show since it came out. I was one who saw it from the beginning and tuned in every week to watch. Over the years I have seen so much light and happiness come from the show. So much so that I actually found myself laughing at some of the jokes that was said way after the show was over. One of my favorite episodes of the past was A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving. This is an episode that has slid easily into the Thanksgiving playlist while I cook dinner.     Over the years we have seen Chris come and go. He left Lorelai when she was a young girl to raise a daughter on her own. In the first season he came unexpectedly to visit. After that, he came back and brought Sherri, his live-in girlfriend, to town to meet Rori and not so much Lorelai. As the time marched on he decided he was going to leave Sherri and make things work with Lorelai. He made Rori a promise that he was not going to just up and leave again. A few minutes later he decided to go home to be with his girlfriend because she was pregnant. Let's not forget about Emily and Richards's vowel renewal, when he showed up and broke up Lorelai and Luke. He has a track record for being careless, self-centered, and vapid. That was where his involvement with Lorelai should have been left. Imagine my shock and dismay at the end of Season 6 when Lorelai, understandable irritated that Luke would not commit to marry her, decided to jump in bed with Chris. I was hoping that the first three episodes of season 7 were going to deal with playing out this mini-romance and get Lorelai back on the road to Luke. I was wrong. Instead they had most of the season be all about Chris and his hang-ups. Richard got sick and Chris was not even there. When he got to the hospital he had an attitude because Luke was there taking the place of what Chris should have been doing. Then he gets mad because Lorelai was holding Liz's baby and then threw a hissy fit that she did not want to have kids right away with him. Lorelai's character was written to be smart. When it came to matters of the heart, we knew that she could be dense but she was never stupid. I found it unbelievable that her character was supposed to be made to stand by Chris while he acted like a petulant child. Even when he bailed on her for what looks like the third time she still was trying to keep him in the marriage. What happened to the Lorelai personality that would have kicked him to the curb the same way she did Luke when he would not commit to a wedding date? I did not like the Chris character being developed because he was not really moved along and matured; he continued to act like a stupid child over EVERYTHING!!    Rori's character was moved backwards. She was a strong, mature individual who always knew what she wanted. She always made lists and pros and con's to make decisions and that was something that made her character soar. What I saw go out the window was the fact that she was too sensitive and unhappy all the time. She complained and she was moody and was all together not a fun character to watch. She lobbied for Logan and their relationship. She wanted to marry him and, in fact, was the first to use the \\"L\\" word in season 6. Imagine my shock to see that she turned down his marriage proposal. She wanted to marry him, fancied being with him so much that she decided to move in with him when she had nowhere to go. She stole a boat with him and alienated her mother over their relationship. Why did she turn down the proposal? What was the actions and thought processes that led up to that? Did she make a pro-con list or did she only get her advice from Paris who, lets face it, had the same issue she had and kept her boyfriend while telling Rori the relationship may not have been right for her because of the distance. I did not like the fact that she listened to Paris when it came to matters of the heart because Paris was never one who would allow her feelings to influence what she said. Her character was irrational, blunt, and not always correct but made to be correct because she was louder than everyone else. I find it very unbelievable that this decision looks like it was based on a one time conversation with her. I also found it unbelievable that Lorelai, the one who always have something to say, had no real opinion on the matter. Her reaction was stale and not really true to the way the real character would have reacted.    All in all, I think with Amy not being at the helm there were a lot of issues as far as trying to capture the essence of the characters. I truly think that this season was the worst one to date. Luke and Lorelai should have gotten married. I would hope that they would put out a movie to set everything right. Luke and Lorelai married and Rori and Logan getting engaged and married, showcasing the Huntsburgers reaction. The spark was gone and down went the show. I just saw this season a few days ago and I cannot remember much of the dialogue because it was not meaningful, heartfelt, or realistic. Shame. Real shame.
0307454541|2.0|I wanted to see what the hype was about so I thought I would give it a try.  The book is extremely detailed, to the point of boredom.  The book has a very slow pace.  I did not enjoy the book until the very last part.  It took me to about page 300 to get hooked and actually care about what was going on.  However, the author did take great pains in creating a family history (complete with a family tree) and a well thought-out setting.  All in all, I was bored and did not understand the hype.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|Ok i will admit i own more than one copy of this film but its just because i love it ! this sp edition is great it has some great extras and interviews !
B002JVWR4A|5.0|The story, the actors, the settings, and especially the chemisty between the stars combine to make this a series I hope lasts a very long time. The only improvement would be to let Booth and Bones relationship mature into marriage and a whole host of possibilies.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|I really did enjoy this movie. It was suspenseful and relatable. The only problem I had was if there were that many wolves just waiting to attack humans at a ski resort, wouldn't it be an all you can eat buffet for the wolves when the ski resort is open? As someone else posted, maybe if there was some foreshadowing in the beginning of the movie about there being a wolf problem in the area...although at one point when the threesome is in the lodge there is a poster of a missing person hanging up, maybe that's what that was for.  Other than that, an excellent movie.

1439133948|5.0|This is the latest installment of the Vorkosigan saga, stretching back across three generations, easing up on a fourth. For those who've never met Miles Vorkosigan, he's one of the more memorable characters from an author who is no mean slouch at crafting them. Several years have passed since his last appearance in a book. Miles has achieved a measure of success in his life in a fashion he could never have imagined. With a wife, a family, and a career as one of the most trusted and important officials of his foster brother Gregor, the Emperor of Barrayar, Miles has come a long way from the damaged, stunted youth determined to prove to all his worth against all odds. Not that he is entirely grown up yet......<br /><br />Now as an Imperial Auditor, Miles is forever and anon dispatched by Gregor to deal with the vexing, intricate, confounding matters that come up in the course of running a three planet empire. His latest assignment has taken him to Kibou-daini, a world which has made cryofreezing technology into a cultural obsession. Accidents, incurable disease, old age - the population of the world lives as best it can and when it can't, they get frozen until some kind of cure becomes available. As a survivor of cryofreezing himself, Miles is just the man for the job of checking out the technology and the corporations that control it as they seek to expand into the Barrayarran sphere of influence.<br /><br />The story begins with Miles scrambling through the darkness of an underground maze after escaping a botched attempt by terrorists to kidnap visiting galactics who've all been invited to a conference about the cryofreezing services offered on Kibou-daini. Dazed, suffering aftereffects of what was meant to be a sedative, Miles finds himself seeking sanctuary in the underbelly of Kibou-daini - and that's when he begins to unravel the darker truths behind the smooth facades and the sales pitches. From there on the story takes off as Miles shows that neither marriage or high office has lessened his ability to generate chaos around him as he proceeds relentlessly towards his goal - even if he can't be sure quite what it is from moment to moment.<br /><br />If \\"A Civil Campaign\\" was about sex, marriage, and manners and \\"Diplomatic Immunity\\" was about children, parenting, and the chain of life from generation to generation, \\"Cryoburn\\" is about death. What does it mean when the dead... aren't dead but frozen? Who speaks for them? What happens when people live their lives expecting to die... and then be revived again someday? What happens to a society when its members are strung out across time in disconnected fashion? What happens as other technologies come along to extend life?<br /><br />Bujold weaves it all together in a tale that invents one of the more subtle forms of galactic conquest as a subplot, while devising a nastier main story about greed, scandal, and treachery. There are no exploding spaceships, no superweapons, no invading armies, but the tale is entertaining none the less. And then in Aftermaths, Bujold presents five drabbles - five stories of exactly one hundred words - of masterful craftsmanship and devastating impact. This is a must-read for any fan of the Vorkosigan saga.<br /><br />Extra Bonus: A CD-ROM bundled with the book contains much bonus material, including other books from the Vorkosigan saga in electronic form, artwork, interviews, and more.as lessened his ability to generate chaos around him as he proceeds relentlessly towards his goal - even if he can't be sure quite what it is from moment to moment.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I had been renting this series during months of going through chemotherapy to keep my spirits high. This material was a wonderful choice! In addition to being an entertaining focus for an hour or two each day, they were topical and heartwarming. I so highly recommend this series! And while the DVD quality is certainly not equal to what must have been the original broadcast quality, it is close enough to provide everything this treasure of a series delivers.
0393068382|4.0|A superbly researched, page-turning read. The author systematically debunks research that has supposedly proven innate, \\"hard-wired\\" differences between the brains of males and females which account for differences in their intelligence, behaviors, academic abilities, and career choices. Studies that society has recently taken as fact (i.e. that newborn males prefer staring at mobiles and newborn females, faces) are shown to be fallible in countless ways. Whether it's researcher bias, inadequate sample size, lack of repeatability, finding causality in mere connection, or just out-and-out fabrication, Fine neatly debunks the studies that many of today's experts are citing in defense of separate-sex public education and gender-specific child-rearing philosophies. Other studies that find no connection between gender and performance on traditionally male-mastered topics (i.e. object rotation, math, etc) are dismissed by the media and society as a whole. They don't fit into our preconceived notions about gender.<br /><br />As the mother of a daughter, I struggle with ensuring a gender-neutral environment for her - something Fine makes me realize is absolutely impossible (unless we live in a bubble). Even if I don't send subtle and often unconscious messages to her about her gender and what's expected of her as a result of it, society will take care of that for me. Indeed, from the moment we knew she was a girl (in utero), we began treating her differently (unknowingly of course). After she was born, it is likely that we held her more, smiled at her more frequently, and talked to her more than if she had been a boy. Studies also show that even egalitarian mothers unwittingly talked to their daughters about emotion more often and in more detail than their sons; thereby reinforcing the stereotype that women are \\"feelers.\\" A lot of what researchers believe to be innate, hard-wired differences are merely cultural, self-fulfilling prophecies.<br /><br />I would have given this book 5 stars, except that her sarcasm can be so sharp that it often detracts from her message. I understand her frustration, I do; especially as a mother trying to raise a little girl to believe that she really CAN be anything she wants to be. These studies which aim to prove male intellectual superiority (in a thinly veiled way) are flawed in such a maddening way, yet they have such a hold on society. But if she had taken the snarkiness down just a notch, I believe she would have written the perfect book.except that her sarcasm can be so sharp that it often detracts from her message.

B002EEP3NO|5.0|I hardly ever write reviews but I felt that I should for this AMAZING set from Lego.  I purchased this set in Sept 2009 for my 2 children (10 and 5) and my adult husband child.  :)  They spent 3-4 months building the set.  Both girls and my DH worked on it day after day for an hour or two.  It was sooooo much fun for us all to see it all come together.  My 5 year old was able to help as well as the instructions (in giant size spiral bound color foldover books) were very easy to understand.  The drawings are as clear as they are in other, smaller LEGO sets.  The family bonding over this set was priceless.    What surprised me the most is that it captured the imagination of my 5 year old little girl and to this day (October 2010), she still plays with the Death Star pretty much every day!  She makes up stories and characters and combines them with other Lego sets (like the Lego Castle Mideaval Market -- another great set!).  The deathstar sits to this day on our breakfast nook table and the kids run up to it at random moments and play for 30 minutes to an hour just like that.  Priceless!  No other toy has EVER captured my daughters' imagination like this kit!  I cannot recommend it enough.    By the way, yes there are some missing pieces here and there (maybe about 5-10 pieces total) so we either worked around it or went online to lego.com and Lego sent us replacement pieces for free within 3-4 days.  No problem!  A set with this many little pieces will have a few missing but trust me, you won't be able to tell!  I purchased my set on Amazon.com for $399 with free shipping and no tax, which was a better deal than the Lego.com website.  It arrived brand new in a HUGE box and the pieces were separated into small plastic bags that were sealed and easy to find for each part of the Death Star.  Very organized!  You will need a BIG table to keep the project going though so be prepared to donate about 1/2 of a dining room table worth of space to this huge set!
B0044AEBXY|4.0|It has been 30 years since Genesis made their transition to having commercial success from cult favorites in the 70's. After the departure of Peter Gabriel, and the turnover with Phil Collins as the lead, Genesis really made their mark into new territory as musicians and performers. They've not only brought in their style of the beginnings of \\"synth pop,\\" but an album that really proved that they were becoming the men of their times. Honestly, Genesis made that transition from the 70's to having greater success in the 80's well, and lead to Phil's solo status mark to even greater expectations. Now, it is 30 years since they've made the album that made them the men of their times, and it is still just as enjoyable now, as it was then.<br /><br />The 2007 re-release of Duke, Genesis' 80's breakthrough album really still is just as driven today, as it was released 30 years ago. The songs here have been digitally remastered and restored strongly, and remain a key pleasure into what lead into the innovation of why Genesis was a group that was meant to be heard. The songs here include the epic Behind The Lines, to the intimate Duchess, all the way to Phil's beginnings as a solo songwriter on songs like Please Don't Ask (which was originally intended for Phil's Face Value record but chosen for Duke) and Misunderstanding, to the innovative Man Of Our Times, to the somber Alone Tonight. Every song feels like a breath of fresh air, and the MP3 album version also includes the behind the scenes from Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford & Tony Banks on the makings of Duke.<br /><br />All in all, if you've never heard Genesis in the 80's, you'd have to own Duke. It really lead to why Genesis was so special in the music scene during that time. This was the album that lead to their success with records like Abacab and the domiant Invisible Touch. I absolutely recommend Duke, not only as a great guilty pleasure record, but one of the few well-developed records Genesis made that proved they were shown to be men of their times.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+e men of their times.

0446567337|3.0|I have to admit that I am a sucker for sad love stories: Forbidden love, couples torn apart by circumstance, tragic love stories, stories of loss. I much prefer these to happy endings because, in Romeo and Juliet style, they are just much more profound and moving and have the ability to effect you on a much deeper level.     Such was the case with the plot in this story. Savannah & John are a couple torn apart by circumstance. I think it is incorrect of the reader to judge the characters or place blame, that is not what the book is about. Instead, I felt like this was couple torn apart by circumstances in their lives, seemingly by some force beyond their control. And it is a story about having unconditional love for another, sacrificing oneself and one's own happiness for another.     I enoyed the book and the ending (which by the way hinted at many things whereby one may come to their own conclusions about the fate of the characters). I thought it was a fantastic plot that unfolded well, but I felt the way the story was told was lacking. I was not convinced of the intense love the characters shared in their brief encounter which served as the basis of their entire relationship. There was nothing particularly magical, mesmerizing, or extraordinary about the way the couple met or the moments they shared (in fact many of those moments were filled with flaws). I did not find myself moved, and often wondered what it was that carried their relationship for so long. The intensity was not there for me and I found the rest of the story to be a bit contrived.    On a side note, the book focuses quite a bit on Autism and its symptoms. Having a sibling with autism and being a professional in the field, I was glad to see this, but was dissappointed by the portrayal of Alan. People with autism lack the emotional connection to others, and Alan's intense loyalty and concern for his brother and awareness of the seriousness of his condition was not something characteristic of the disorder.
0307266303|5.0|In the seedy lobby of an old hotel in the Sierra Madre, an American journalist finds the legendary Caballo Blanco, and it will change his life forever.<br /><br />No, this isn't a tale of the old west, a spy thriller, or an advertisement for Mexican distilled spirits. It's not fiction, genre or otherwise, though many of the characters are larger-than-life and their exploits are, by any measure, superhuman.<br /><br />Born to Run is a story about running. Surprise.<br /><br />Christopher McDougall is a former Associated Press reporter, sometime freelance writer, and past-his-prime athlete who is launched on a remarkable odyssey by a rather mundane problem. He's out of shape and trying to get himself back into condition, but he invariably injures himself just as he's beginning to make progress. After a few less-than-helpful trips to the doctor, he begins to wonder how anybody can run without hurting themselves, and why anybody would want to run if it's the fast track to crippling injury.<br /><br />These questions lead him into the world of extreme long-distance running, where races of 50 to 100 miles or more across torturous terrain are the norm. He encounters some incredible athletes and unique personalities, discovers a few odd things about human performance in situations where endurance trumps speed, and begins to hear whispers of a tribe of extraordinary running savants in the mountains of Mexico-the Tarahumara, the \\"Running People.\\" They eat 100-mile runs for breakfast, continue running well into their geriatric years, and are almost supernaturally immune to both injury and illness. Some say they hunt deer by running them to death.<br /><br />Before long, McDougall is trekking through the Copper Canyons, pondering his motives and chances of survival in a desert maze of  sheer, rocky precipices-the lair of historical outlaws Geronimo and Pancho Villa, and the home turf of modern drug runners. In his search for the Tarahumara, he hears rumors of the ghostly Caballo Blanco, the White Horse, a crazy gringo with a connection to the reclusive Running People. It turns out Caballo Blanco is much more than a campfire story, and he becomes the link between the Tarahumara and an assortment of American ultradistance runners who long to know their secrets and test their skills against the legendary tribe.<br /><br />Along the way from the U.S. to Mexico and from the Rocky Mountains to Death Valley, McDougall learns a lot about the physiology of running, why humans are better adapted for long distance running than any other creature on Earth, what the Tarahumara do right that we do wrong, and the compelling stories of a host of people who run ridiculously long distances under ridiculous conditions for the sheer joy of it. He also discovers a connection between running and community, and why, for the long-distance runner, compassion might be just as important as conditioning.<br /><br />The story wraps up with a dream-team throwdown race through the Copper Canyons between the Tarahumara and the Americans, and a bittersweet ending that acknowledges the twilight of a culture slowly eroding beneath the advance of civilization and the encroachment of Mexican drug gangs-a world in which the Tarahumara may no longer be fast enough to outrun their enemies.<br /><br />This was a good read. A colleague tossed this in front of me during a work trip in the middle of the night shift, and I chewed through it in about three hours of nonstop racing, er, reading. It kept me awake and alert at 3 am, and that's no small achievement.<br /><br />McDougall tells an engaging story with plenty of humor and heart, leavened with enough science and investigative journalism to make this much more than a love letter to mountain trails and the people who run them. If you've got a runner or any other flavor of athlete on your Christmas list, get them a copy of this book. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />There are a few bits of coarse language sprinkled through the narrative, and these extreme athletes also enjoy extreme partying, giving some passages a sort of college frat vibe. So, I don't recommend this book for kids. They're not the target audience anyhow. Mid 20's and up will probably like it just fine.<br /><br />There's some advocacy of minimalist running footwear and a variety of vegan-ish performance diet recommendations that are controversial at least and faddish at worst. The scientific court is out on a lot of this stuff, so though a lot of the incidental advice in Born to Run makes sense, I wouldn't use it as a model for any sudden adjustments to your workout patterns, running stride, or daily menu without professional advice.

B003VOUGV0|3.0|I don't write reviews for products very often, but I felt compelled to for Best Coast's debut album after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. While I enjoy their upbeat, easygoing surf-pop sound, I can't possibly give a high rating to an album that sounds like one repetitive 31-minute-long song. I have never listened to an album where I couldn't distinguish one song from the next. If I had to rank the songs, I would fail miserably. Adding on to that is the formulaic repetitiveness of their lyrics. I'm pretty sure every single song consists of choruses or hooks that repeat the same one or two lines at least four consecutive times before moving on to the next set of repeating lyrics. So overall, it's a fun summer record to play, but be prepared to zone out after the second song.

B003TVMIDO|1.0|Wow, I have to agree with the reviews here commenting on the poor sound quality.  How did they let this out of the studio, the Japanese remasters from 2007 are beautiful and this is a muddy disappointing mess through the first few discs.  That nasty guitar in \\"I Found Out\\" has no punch and so buried in the mix it sucks the life out of the song, again, the Japanese remaster is a punch to the gut on that particular song.  \\"Working Class Hero\\" is thin as can be and is even better on some of the hits collections...I know they went back to the original audio mix to remaster which in theory is the right thing to do but where's the punch!

B000VS6R26|3.0|Of all the movies made about the fabled and tragic sinking of the Titanic, this one is definitely the most entertaining. The attention toward costume and set detail is impressive, except women did not wear nearly that much makeup in 1912. Lipstick was fairly new and didn't really become mainstream until the later part of the decade. On the other hand, I sat next to a couple of teenage girls while watching Titanic in the theatre. Upon the scene of Rose's entrance on Titanic, one girl said to the other, \\"My mother said they never would have worn that color back then.\\" Her mother was wrong. Lavender was an extremely popular color at this time and often found in young ladies attire. Rose was supposed to have just come from a shopping trip in Paris and the costume designer took great pains to give her the most cutting edge wardrobe any girl could have in 1912.   Aside from the asthetic trivial, this movie does its fair share of \\"keeping the mystic alive\\". There has always been considerable mystery shrouding the sinking of the Titanic. This is largely due to the media's inability (or refusal) to ever really set the story straight. Why, if the mystery is taken away, movies may not sell tickets, books may not sell off shelves, this is a long fabled tragedy that can make some people some money...if they tell the story in a way that sells.  It is interesting in the movie Titanic, Rose tells Cal, \\"It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania.\\" Whereupon Call responds, \\"Titanic is bigger and far more luxurious..\\"  A myth buster would have been had the scene played more like: Rose says, \\"It doesn't look any bigger than the Olympic.\\" Cal could not have responded as he did in his answer regarding the comparison to Cunard's Mauretania. The Olympic was the Titanic's sister ship. The first of 3 new luxury liners from White Star, the Olympic was the first one built, the first one launched, the last to survive, and was every bit as big as it's little sister Titanic. The Titanic was heavier than the Olympic, concentrated on a few more luxury suites with private promenades, more restaurants, and smaller luxurious details such as a clock on the landing of the forward grand staircase (yes, there were 2, the forward grand staircase is the one that gets all the publicity, but the aft grand staircase was nearly identical). In fact, the Olympic and the Titanic were so identical in construction and design, the only way you could tell them apart from the outside was from such details as the forward portion of the promenade deck being glassed in on the Titanic, whereas on the Olympic it was not. So much for \\"the biggest ship in the world\\". Olympic had been sailing for nearly a year before the Titanic and was every bit as big-just not as heavy. The Britannic, the 3rd of the White Star line's sister ships, was even more luxurious than Titanic and was being built as the Titanic sunk. This ship, sadly saw only war time activity, being converted into a hospital ship for World War I, then sunk. Besides, it would only be a couple of more years until another ship came along that was bigger than the Olympic, Titanic, and last built Britannic. Do you know which ship that was?  Another thing this movie does to sell tickets but really dates the movie was the most unfortunate decision to make fools and/or villains out of all the rich folk on board. This is perhaps the most blatant misrepresentation this film has to offer. If it were not for this wealthy class of people, the Titanic would never have been built! Not to mention the immense number of jobs many of these wealthy people created for others. The way this movie demonizes the rich and the defined classes between the people is a crime. Right or wrong, that is simply the way it was. It was so strongly entrenched for such a long period of time, we still see traces of this today. Airlines still have a \\"first class\\" to this very day, although, the accommodations these days for first class anything are nothing compared to what they were on board a luxury ocean liner in 1912. Captain Smith was made a martyr in the film. In real life, Captain Smith had quite a string of maritime mishaps..........the man just wasn't great at seamanship to say the least. Although, Captain Smith was not on the bridge when the Titanic struck the iceberg. He had gone to bed. He left orders to wake him if anything looked doubtful regarding the many ice warnings received by Titanic that day. The movie so demonizes, or flat out ignores the real actions of the first class passengers while filming most of the action around 1srt class! Poor 2nd class is NEVER covered. It will be always first or 3rd class passages that get the most publicity. To site a couple of instances with 1st class passengers who come off extremely underrated are: The Countess of Rothes. In the movie, the Countess of Rothes may only utter no more than 2 words, and the actress hired to play her was not nearly as beautiful as the real Countess was. The movie fails to mention that the Countess of Rothes handled the tiller of lifeboat 8 because none of the men knew how to do it! Furthermore, when rescued by the Carpathia, the Countess of Rothes helped out on deck to make sure other survivors had blankets and were comfortable, etc. When a Titanic officer present in lifeboat 8 was asked at the inquisition just how it came about that her ladyship, the Countess of Rothes, ended up handling the tiller of the life boat, the officer said so very tactfully, \\"Well, the lady had quite a bit to say about the matter.\\" For someone who wasn't given more than 2 lines to say in the movie, and in actuality played an important and heroic part in manning one of the lifeboats, I'd say the Countess was severely misrepresented to suit the current times of 1997.   Rose herself stands in the dining room criticizing them all. While she herself and her mother are traveling under the disguise as being well to do and staying in the most luxurious suites Titanic has tooffer payed for by her fiancé! This would have been completely unacceptable etiquette in 1912.   Molly Brown is the only 1st class passenger who comes off remotely well. Alas, she is from a poor class working people and has run into money with her husband. Separate movies and plays will be done about this woman and her actions on in the lifeboat, but not on word toward someone who did the same thing, the Countess of Rothes, in a life boat that was hoisted up by the Carpathia the same as Molly Brown's.  The fact is it was actually far more unusual for someone like a Countess to handle the tiller of a lifeboat than someone like Molly Brown to handle the rowing in her life boat. Nobody ever in the entire world gets that. They were both hero's. But, I'd wager to say the Countess did more than Mrs. Brown that night and was far more out of her element in doing so.   They make fun of the builder of the Titanic. As if he didn't have a clue as to who Sigmund Freud really was. It is very unlikely that J. Bruce Ismay would not have conveyed the meaning of Rose's callus remark.  Another myth buster is the amount of well known wealthy passengers in first class. Many people confuse super natural irony with the natural course of the wealthy set of the day. The truth is, it was not at all unusual for there to be so many well known wealthy passengers in first class. It would have been more unusual had there not been. In fact, there were fewer well to do sailing on the Titanic's maiden voyage than would be expected. In this day and age, the gilded age, the wealthy were treated the way our movie stars are today. Their lives were followed and read about at every turn. If there was some big world event taking place, it was not at all unusual for them to see one another there. It was expected for many to be at such events, and the maiden voyage of the most luxurious ocean liner in the world would qualify as such an event. And so, there they were.   There are a number of other equally qualifying issues I could continue with, but I think you get my drift, so to speak. The movie Titanic is very entertaining. I love to watch it. Just don't look too much into it for serious fact.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I love automatic watches. It's something about the way they work off of mechanical movement to gets it energy that appeals to me. Not only does this watch have that, but it has a very classic style.       Sadly I can't recommend this item due to it's inability to last more than four or five months before having to adjust it so that it keeps time instead of freezing up at random moments. I found this extremely irritating because at one of my work sites I was in charge of keeping time at meetings and had to fall back on my cell phone due to the watch freezing up.    Also the plastic/glass window scratches easily.       So I've learned my lesson and I'm saving up for a watch that has an automatic movement that doe    +Price is good  +Look is classic    -Window scratches easily  --Doesn't keep time without a quarterly adjustment
B000002LRX|5.0|First, I still like the following 3 songs the most on this album: Midlife crisis, Everything's Ruined, & A Small Victory.  Not only are those just three excellent songs; but they are three songs that everyone should at least listen to once.    As for the rest of the album, like a previous reviewer said, it has taken me over 15 years to even go back to the remainder of the album to give it another chance.  I am very surprised by how much I like the ENTIRE album.  RV, a song which I thought would constantly skip over, is a tune I play often due to the attitude and actual voice acting done by Patton.  Be Aggressive has really grown on me as well.  Malpractice is brilliant, Crack Hitler & Jizzlobber are placed perfectly together on this album, & Kindergarten while the most tame song on the album, still holds its own in terms of listening to.      Which leads me to the remaining songs: Land of Sunshine - this is the hardest song for me to get into to, I do like it but I need more time with it - the same exact feelings apply to Caffeine.  Smaller & Smaller - another tough one for me to warm up to but again, I just need more time with it.  Midnight Cowboy is the ultimate \\"chill\\" track - I love it and feel they put a lot of TLC into it.    I'm really glad I ended up buying this one - It really does force you to listen to music in a different way...thought I was just playing tricks with my brain (i.e. forcing myself to like it) because music today is so bad but I really wasn't - the album first comes off as so crazy and weird that you first dismiss it only to find out later how many deep layers there really are to it.    All of my above comments lead to one strong conclusion - this album is worthy of the highest ratings possible whether you like it, love it, or hate it.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|The \\"Alien Anthology\\" may have taken some time to come to Blu-ray Disc, but it has been worth the wait.  We received the set directly from Fox so are able to give readers an early sneak peek.  The films themselves are presented in both their theatrical versions and extended \\"special edition\\" versions, Even Alien3 comes in a half-hour longer version here, and they've gone to the trouble of re-recording bits of dialog and sound effects to clean up the audio from the restored portion to match the rest of the film.  It is nice to have the choice to watch either cut of all four movies, and the SE version of the second film really adds depth to the story and the characters making a great film even better.<br /><br />Each film gets the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 treatment (the first two films' theatrical cuts are also available in Dolby Digital 2.0 and 4.1 channel mixes).  Sound is excellent overall, though perhaps not quite as bombastic as one might expect from such action-heavy titles.  It seems like more should be coming from behind us at times, and the low bass rumble of the weapon fire and explosions is lacking ever so slightly in deep extended bass.  But these are fairly minor criticisms as the sound is clean, imaging is precise, and dialog is clear and articulate throughout.  The video transfers are clearly superior to the DVDs that came before them with rich detail, nicely saturated colors and deep blacks.  H.R. Geiger's creepy organic art on the derelict alien ship in the first film has never looked so detailed and powerful and you can practically count the pores on young Sigourney Weaver's face.  There are still minor instances of murky blacks, some ringing and softness here and there due to mild use of noise reduction, but overall, the transfers are pristine, considering the age of the films.  The first two films, though the earliest, look the most improved here - no surprise considering they have been painstakingly remastered at 4K resolution for this release.  Only \\"Aliens\\" is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 - nearly filling a standard 16:9 screen with thin black lines at the top and bottom.  The rest of the films are presented in a CinemaScope 2.35:1 aspect.<br /><br />The extras are extensive, to say the least (be prepared to spend some time here), with special features available on each disc, plus two entire Blu-ray Discs packed full of additional extras: one with \\"Making Of\\" documentaries, interview segments and behind-the-scenes footage, and one disc featuring the \\"Archives,\\" chock full of seemingly every last piece of material -- text, still photos and video -- supporting the films and their back story.  A helpful \\"MU-TH-UR\\" mode (with its own tutorial) is included to help you navigate through the massive amount of supplements - even allowing us to go directly to specific chapters on other discs: just eject one and insert the other, and it will take you directly to the requested material.  Pop the original disc back in and the player will remember where you left off, asking if you'd like to resume.  A nice feature made possible via BD-Java.<br /><br />At least one commentary track is available for each film (\\"Alien\\" has two), with every director but David Fincher (Alien3) participating in the commentary fun.  All four films also have isolated score tracks (in Dolby Digital 5.1), so you can appreciate the nuances of the film's scores without any distracting dialog or sound effects. Although much of the supplementary materials used here are re-purposed from earlier home video releases (DVD and laserdisc), we found many new and extended interview segments and snippets we'd never seen before.  I'm sure die-hard fans will find hours of enjoyment in the set, and the audio and video quality alone is worth the upgrade.  I know I can never go back to the DVDs.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />UPDATE (10/24): Some early purchasers and reviewers have noted some compatibility issues with the set and certain hardware.  We've tested the disc with twelve players so far (OPPO, Panasonic, Samsung, LG, Philips, Toshiba and Sony), with mostly minor compatibility issues noted.  On the OPPO BDP-83, the \\"Director's Cut\\" of \\"Alien\\" begins playing zoomed in with only the top left corner of the image visible.  Hitting \\"Menu\\" then \\"Play\\" restores the image to its proper size.  Also a Samsung BC-C6900 plays Ridley Scott's intro video to the Director's Cut of \\"Alien\\" squished to 4:3 (should be 16:9).  Similarly a Philips BD-P7200 played the Ridley intro in a tiny window at the top of the screen, but the film itself played fine in both versions.  But otherwise every player we've tested seems to play the set without issues.  Some players are extremely slow to load the disc (particularly older players), but this is to be expected from such a BD-Java-heavy title.  BD-Java can use quite a bit of on-board memory and processing power once you get fancy (and boy are these discs fancy!).

We've tested the set on the following players: Panasonic DMP-BDT350, DMP-BD85, DMP-BD60, DMP-BD70V and DMP-BD35, Samsung BD-C6900, LG BD390, OPPO BDP-83, Sony PS3, Sony BDP-S350, Philips BD-P7200 and Toshiba BDX3000.    Please note: a more extensive review is available on our web site at BigPictureBigSound dot com, and a discussion of the compatibility issues is available on our forum.
0812973992|5.0|Ok, some of the chapters do not need to be included in the book, but just a few.<br />The author has done an incredible job in the book, relating characters, their thoughts, their goals (religious, making connections, finding love), to the tight rope walker. Does anyone have the answer to \\"why we are here on earth,\\" or \\"what is the goal of a human being or group of humans on earth\\"? Addressed also,was the NYC milieu: how do some many people with such diverse backgrouns manage to create a life in the city? Yet, this book has universal appeal  Also, ask yourself how the author imagined such a way of connecting so many diverse people.<br />Our discussion group had a terrific time discussing the book. You can enter a discussion about this book from 1) talking about the chacters; 2) talking about the weaving of real life, symbols, stated and unstated goals in the book, and more. And, you will find pleasure in reading the book. I had to start the book twice, but once I saw what the author was doing, I just sat back and enjoyed the read. THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL BOOK.

B001V7UXG2|4.0|Well worth the price for Wodehouse fans.  A must for Jeeves and Wooster fans who have exhausted the selection of books and would like more.  The series ventures out on its own in places, but Fry and Laurie have an excellent chemistry that makes their additions fit quite well, for the most part.
1577311523|4.0|This book hit the spot!  Perhaps the serendipity of timing, but the outstanding focus on NOW, along with multiple perspectives of staying in the window...and why one might stray, was just what I needed to get me one small step of additional enlightenment,   Highly recommend this as standard reading for anyone whom is even slightingly interested in better understanding ourselves and others.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Spartacus was awesome every aspect was there & it kept u on the edge till the last episode which went out like a Bang!!!!!!
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|Becky is a delightful character that any female can relate to, she's sweet, a good friend, and desperately wants to fit in. She's trying to beat her shopping addiction, but charmingly irresponsible in the process. Her excuses and rationalizations are laugh out loud funny.    Even though I found some parts of the plot slow and predictable I was still drawn in by Becky. A fantastic character who has hooked me, I'll be reading the next in the series to see what sort of trouble she gets in this time and to watch her try to wiggle her way out.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|In Rainbows overjoyed me. Radiohead have found a way of maturing their music. They have found a new and exquisite sound to develop. That sound is hard to describe. It's warm, interesting and super-catchy. The instrumentation varies a lot and can be sophisticated or raw, depending on what's needed. Notable is the track \\"Nude\\", a ten-year old track that spawned from their OK Computer tour but first fully formed here. The end result is nothing like the one fans heard on \\"Meeting People is Easy\\". It demonstrates Thom Yorke's immense control over and emotion in his voice. The setlist is some 10 tracks, and all are wonderful.<br /><br />By this point, Radiohead's contract with Parlophone had expired, so In Rainbows was first available for download through their website, offering their fans to pay the price they wished, from 0 and up. In Rainbows lived a long life before XL Recordings picked it up at the end of 2007 (the band even allowed fans to follow up on its progress through their YouTube channel), and by then it had established itself as another album to reach its justified status by means of the internet rather than the industry. Kid A had done this to some degree, but In Rainbows completed the circle.<br /><br />The music on In Rainbows is a delightful listen, so sophisticated and pleasant, so characteristic and full of heart. Bravo.
B003PIUC02|4.0|Exactly what I was expecting and more less detail than the HBO series Rome but it has it's moments
0375851569|5.0|It's a set of Dr. Seuss books. Pretty self explanatory. Can't really screw that up. It arrived when it was supposed to and is good quality.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Absolutely awesome!!!!!!!! Songs are unique and typically \\"ZAC BROWN\\" style. Catchy, country-beachy-reggae sound that is so typical of this band. Songs you will sing every day in your head and take with you all through the day!!
0061537969|1.0|This book could have been a wonderful book, great story - however was ruined by profanity and several  uses of the \\"f\\" word in it.
1931559317|4.0|Jon Bosley has it exactly right.  This is a great atlas, but I wish they'd used the same scale, symbols, and etc but divided the sky into fewer, larger charts and made the atlas full book-sized, like the Norton's and Cambridge atlases.  The Pocket Atlas is far superior to those old standards in many ways, but the charts are a little too small to get a sense of many constellations.  Yet, it's still too large to be truly \\"pocket sized.\\"    As it is, probably still the best choice available if you don't want to carry around Sky Atlas 2000.0.  If you're not very familiar with the constellations get yourself a planisphere also, to show the whole sky and make constellation patterns recognizable.    Sky Publishing, if you read these reviews - please give us a 9x12\\" atlas at this scale!
B003Y8YXH6|1.0|Why Why Why?  Was this release really necessary?  What was wrong with John's original mix?  Wasn't it good enough?  It was what most of us grew up listening to.  I've read that some people find the original difficult or even impossible to listen to.  That seems to be, to me, an individual's struggle.  Was it REALLY necessary to \\"strip down\\" this great record to capture the \\"essence\\" of it?  All of the same elements are there.  There is nothing terribly creative about this mix and certainly nothing new for our ears.  The record was perfect just as it was.  I am of the opinion that remixing this classic recording was just a blatant attempt at generating record sales and offers no creative alternative to the original.  In closing, my question to Yoko is:  Why Why Why?
0553385461|4.0|It is one of the simplest and better-explained accounts that I have read on the subject.[[ASIN:0553380168 A Brief History of Time]][[ASIN:0553103741 The Illustrated Brief History of Time, Updated and Expanded Edition]]
B003EYVXSW|1.0|You know those \\"good touch, bad touch\\" talks and dramatic presentations you saw when you were in elementary school.  I have never felt so uncomfortable watching anything since this moment.  This movie is full of Bad Touch.  Its just that simple.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I for one am a great fan of the Predator genre. I was looking forward to completing it with this purchase.  Excellent price for a pre-order, came right on time. The box looks awesome, dvd plays like a dream. Couldn't be happier.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|The products arrive in perfect condition. arrival of this product is earlier than the expected time arrival.
0439023521|5.0|Do not pick up this book and read the first page if you have any activities planned for the next four hours or so. Dates, school, shopping, sleeping, eating- any activity- for if you turn the page to begin reading  page two you will not put this book down until you reach it's amazing and wonderful ending. This is the first book in a trilogy. I am so thankful  Amazon has all three books. I ordered the first one thinking I'd see if I like it. I am re-reading it waiting for the second book. Every reviewer will tell you about the story- but this is about an incredible heroic 16 year old girl. She is real- I know her, I just read about her and I love her.  One of the best girl empowerment books I have ever read.
0307454541|3.0|I don't know why this book is so popular.  Yes, it is entertaining and suspenseful, but it's not very well-written.  The main character is difficult to like at times.  I haven't read his other books, and I don't think I would after reading this.
0525951652|1.0|I don't usually read novels but I selected this because it is an \\"historical\\" novel. It was heavy with the novel but light about history. The many characters, as in many novels, end up crossing paths in very improbable ways. I was glad to finish it.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Being able to identify with Dave on the many levels he visits during this journey was humbling and introspective into an ongoing struggle many of us face.
B0021L8V1Q|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Loved the first one. This one I turned off twice and never finished. What a disappointment. Are movies done?
