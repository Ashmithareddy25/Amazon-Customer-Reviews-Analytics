0307931803|1.0|This board book makes no sense! While the original Fox in Socks follows two characters as they tackle more and more tongue twisters, this board book just eliminates about half of their dialog and a few of the harder twisters.  Where's Luke Luck and his Duck that lick lakes? Where is old Joe Crow? Why only half of the poodle noodle battle? What about Bim and Bin's Big Pig Broom Bands? Don't get this book. Pick up the beginner's library version if you are pressed for cash, but DO NOT BUY the board book.

I have to admit that at one point I was accusing the book of being predictable (yet I still did not put it down) & by the end my accusation was proven wrong. This story is slightly different than others I've read by sparks, but he never disappoints me. I read this in one day intrigued by the characters. I loved the writing style, as well.

0439023513|1.0|The Hunger Games was, in my opinion, one of the most brilliant books written in this generation. Catching Fire seemed a bit redundant, but was still a solid four star book. Mockingjay? I'd give it less than a star if I could. Since I cannot, I'd like to illustrate a few of the ways it fell short of readers expectations. Of my expectations.<br /><br />1) Collins was trying so hard to portray the concept that nothing about war is good, and, I believe her, but she completely failed to bring the concept home in a way humans can relate to. War is terrible, but even in the middle of it there are stolen moments of humor, acts of kindness, genuine friendship, and....despite what Collins seems to believe....even a few shreds of happiness. I believe if she'd have gotten off her soap box long enough to take one step back, she could have written a book that was all the more saddening and poignant because it caught a few of the truths of humanity. Generations of soldiers have returned from war and found some semblance of happiness in real life. Real soldiers with real war wounds. The fact that Katniss remained permanently scarred right up until the bitter end makes it impossible to accept the message Collins wanted to portray, and, I think, makes the sad ending far less sad than it could have been.<br /><br />2) The book was rushed, disjointed, and hard to follow. I read one of the one star reviews that suggested Collins sat a little kid down on a stool, hyped him up with sugar, and then started asking: &#34;ok what happened next?&#34; The review was brilliant. I'd suggest finding it and reading it if you can. The entire ending of the book felt exactly like that. Like a kid on sugar was directing the scenes. I skimmed a tremendous amount of this book because it was boring, ridiculous, or annoying.<br /><br />3) The characters fell completely flat. Katniss turned into a zombie, Gale turned out to be bloodthirsty, Peeta was never around.....there wasn't a single character in the book you really felt like rallying behind. Yes. War is ugly. People do fall into depression and sadness and find it hard to get out of bed. But that makes for a pretty boring story....don't you think? Better to follow someone that doesn't want to, but still finds a way to carry on.<br /><br />4) Collins forced the entire book SO hard in order to make sure all of the characters were at one exact place at one exact time so she could *spoiler alert* blast away Prim, the last icon of innocence. Every single decision, every single scene in the book, was written so that that final ending could take place. So she wanted to kill Prim? Fine. But surely she could have made the rest of the book flow naturally, gradually making its way toward a reality that should have been sad and could have hit home with amazing force had she taken the time to write it. Remember Rue? Everyone remembers Rue. And how many of us can claim we didn't cry? A few of us, but most of us would be lying. Prim deserved a death at least as powerful as that. What she got was a little scene that most readers had to read multiple times to make sure they'd understood correctly. Like I said. The book was forced because Collins couldn't step off her war soap box<br /><br />I'm a little ashamed of how bitter this review sounds, but the book was so poorly written it even ruined The Hunger Games for me. Who on earth isn't now going to get to the end of the first chapter where Katniss volunteers and think: Well honey, that's sweet, but a fine lot of good it will do you.<br /><br />The book should have been realistically sad, and should have had a solid message about war. I don't believe it accomplished either of those things.ook you really felt like rallying behind. Yes. War is ugly. People do fall into depression and sadness and find it hard to get out of bed.

1609611543|5.0|I lost a little over 20 pounds in 8 months.  I know this doesn't seem like a spectacular achievement, but I would rather go slowly and let my body adjust.  I think losing a lot of weight in a short amount of time is a shock to the body.  No scientific evidence to support my assertion, just my own opinion.<br />My father died a few months ago, and I started eating all the &#34;bad stuff.&#34;  I gained about five pounds.  I am now back on this eating plan and the weight I gained during this time is slowly coming off.  I don't consider this a temporary diet, but a permanent change in my eating habits.  Once in a while, there will be times when I will indulge in a &#34;real&#34; pizza or pasta dish.  The only disagreement that I have with the author is the use of artificial sweeteners.  In my opinion, they are all bad.  I use sugar, honey, or stevia. All in all, I think this book will be very helpful for most people who give the advice inside a try.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|There are lots of twists and turns in this suspenseful drama. Denzel Washington's usual awesome movie. Couple of nudie scenes so not a true family movie
0307950654|4.0|PD James,of whom one doesn't hear much of these days (I think she is around 90) has written a novel with a complicated plot which takes a bit of sorting out but is a good read. Needless to say all the Pemberley charcters are there Elizabeth has two children and Darcy has to tread a fine line as the local squire who cannot be seen to be involved The other problem is that rereading the list of other books she has written reminds one that there are lots of books still to recover from Amazon!

I have seen a small bit of wear an tear around the edges but that is expected when you use something every day for a year. The blank lined page is very useful. I use it to make shopping lists, to do lists, or just to write down things I need to remember that might not be related to a specific day. I highly recommend this planner.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|As a mother who still tries to screen everything her almost-14-year-old tries to get her hands on, I've found that books that are overtly spiritual are a major turn off for middle-schoolers. Said daughter is not the only almost-14-year-old I know who prefers to read about One Direction than the Right Way to live ...!! I tried very hard, then, to suppress my glee, when I came across \\"The Time Keeper: A Novel\\" by Mitch Albom. I had come across his writing before, of course, in \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", but the structure of \\"The Time Keeper\\" was more in, er, keeping with the types of books said daughter is currently enjoying - and I thought it would be an interesting way to get her to think about, not just time-travel and alternate universes, but our role in it (them). I was really pleased said daughter enjoyed the book thoroughly, and in fact, asked to read more of Mr Albom's works - even if, I suspect, she took away one star because of the religious overtones. Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\"'The Time Keeper: A Novel' by Mitch Albom is a sad, bittersweet, yet meaningful book.<br /><br />\\"Dor was always different from all his other friends. While they were content to grow their crops and conquer kingdoms, all Dor seemed to do was try to figure out God's greatest gift: Time.<br /><br />\\"But when he goes too far, and ends up losing his wife and family, all because of his obsession with time, God decides he must do penance.<br /><br />\\"So, Dor becomes Father Time, destined, it seems, to spend the rest of his long, immortal life listening to people ask for more time and less time. Constantly, until the human pleas become simply a background noise to Dor, like the rain pounding against a roof.<br /><br />\\"One day, though, God visits Dor again, and tells him that he will be set free, if he can save two people. One of them is an old man, a millionaire dying from cancer, and who doesn't seem to care much for anything else other than money. Another is a teenage girl, bullied for being a chubby genius, whose dad left and whose mom might as well have: a teenage girl who wants to take her own life.<br /><br />\\"How is it that these two people must be saved? Out of all the people in the whole entire world...these two.<br /><br />\\"I really liked this book, especially the ending, which was so happy, compared to the rest of the story, which was so sad. I would definitely give the book four stars: two stars for the plot, and two stars for the characters.\\"
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|Wonderful story. More children should be taught about this in school especially during black history month. Parts of the movie are disturbing regarding racism..it seems like so long ago yet civil rights was in my life time. The stories of what became of these black youths were also wonderful to read,google it after the movie. I live about an hour from Marshall Texas where this college still exists and so real interesting to learn about history so close to home. Denzel never lets you down wonderful acting.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Another very good Harry Bosch novel. As always, well written, fast paced, with an interesting story line. Definitely worth the money.
B000FA675C|1.0|I read this from a library loan.  It was not worth the time.  This is a good example of how not to write a historical novel.  He represents it as \\"fact\\" but doesn't do even the simplist fact checks.  The worst thing is how predictable the story actually is, with no real suspense.

B003Y059EK|5.0|I enjoy The Return to Oz more than the old one(The Wizard of Oz)  and definitely more than the new one (The Great and Powerful Oz).  The music, costumes, character design & sets are beautiful.  The stop motion animation & animatronics (which i enjoy more than CGI special effects) are wonderfully convincing.  The main characters are almost as memorable as the scarecrow, lion & tin-woodsmen.<br />The story is darker than the others as well but that's another reason that I enjoy it more than the others.  If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favor and rent it.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|When you think of teenage problems, what typically comes to mind? Passing a big exam, who to ask to prom, college applications, getting a driver's license --- ya know, things of the mundane sort. But Lena Duchannes isn't your average teenager and driving is the least of her problems. What the good people of Gatlin don't know is that Lena's a castor, a witch who will be claimed for either the light or the dark upon her sixteenth birthay. This claiming has the power to irrevocably change her life and the lives of all humans, because unbeknownst to her, she will be the strongest castor of all. Ethan had no idea what was in store for him when he befriended the mysterious outcast, Lena. Now he's caught up in a mystical battle between good and evil as he struggles to protect the girl he loves. Fates will forever be changed, secrets uncovered and choices made as a dark power takes hold on Lena and the town.<br /><br />I think most of us are aware that Beautiful Creatures was a book first and movie second. I haven't yet read the novelisation but with the recent YA book to movie boom, it's no surprise why they chose to adapt it for the silver screen. There's romance, magic, intrigue and a bevy of young, beautiful people and a setting that's to-die-for. Beautiful Creatures is a coming of age story, only what sets it apart is the tinge of paranormal romance. Think Twilight only with stronger characters and so much more substance. What more could you want? Well, some coherency for one thing. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, but I've gotta admit, at times it was a little hard to follow.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Beautiful Creatures is that it's difficult to discern how much time has passed between scenes and timing is sort of, um, critical considering Lena's predicament. Also, it felt like huge chunks of ctitical information were missing in places though I am aware this could be because I haven't read the book. I'm just glad I went with my BFF who read the series to fill in the gaps where I was floundering. And even then, she too, had some issues with following along. So in regards to reading the book and watching the movie, I'd say you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. Other than that though, the movie has a ton of potential and I was able to overlook many of it's smaller flaws.<br /><br />The strength of this movie lay in its amazing cast. Alden Ehrenreich (as Ethan) exudes this warm goofiness that endeared him to my heart. He's believable as the small-town guy with big dreams and the chemistry he shared with Englert was palpable. Alice Englert (as Lena) played the tempramental teen to perfection which is fitting for both the character's age and her precarious situation. She is, simply put, stunning. I also thought Jeremy Iron's (as Macon Ravenwood) performance was as equally powerful as his eccentric character. The only surprising performance that fell a bit flat for me was Emma Thompson's. As incredibly talented as she is, I thought she was a bit too over-the-top for my liking and it felt too theatrical for the grim nature of her character. All in all, the cast shined and played off eachother so well.<br /><br />If the actors don't appease you in Beautiful Creatures, the setting sure will. LaGravenese painted a perfect picture of the lazy Southern small town. Ethan described it best, \\"My momma says there's two types of people that live in Gatlin, the people too stupid to leave and the ones too stuck to move,\\" and I thought it was spot-on. The cinematography is haunting and ominous and magical and it plays well to the overall tone of the movie. I think it's interesting how LaGravenese tried hard not to rely too much on CGI SFX, instead, forgoing the green screen in favour of more traditional methods --- it is well noted and much appreciated! Overall, I did enjoy the movie despite being hard to follow and I'm eager to read the book series. It's a good one, just not perfect.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Ifyou're looking for another Twilight, Beautiful Creatures is it --- only it's so much better. While not exactly the greatest movie-going experience, I liked it enough to hope for a sequel. Ehrenreich is charismatic and Englert stuns as the leading duo. And if the characters don't sweep you away, the charming setting will. With a bit more clarity this one would have most certainly been a winner!you're looking for another Twilight, Beautiful Creatures is it --- only it's so much better.

0060762241|5.0|For my grandson's first birthday, everyone bought him wonderful cardboard books, some with sound and others without.  He quickly destroyed most of them by standing on them and trying to eat them.  And since I work in a library it was painful to witness.  I found Good Night Moon in the cloth edition on Amazon.com and immediately bought him a copy.  It is indestructible and is still a wonderful story after all these years.  I have since bought some more cloth books and highly recommend them for babies and toddlers.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|this was a great movie..Not alot of sex thank goodness..I also loved the sound track..I recommend this movie for all adults.
B006RXQ800|2.0|With a cast and director like this I was actually very excited to watch this film (which I had to view for a paper), but when I realized the film was nearly three hours long that excitement dimmed a bit. I love watching all kinds of movies from indies to actions, so the time on movies is never really a big deal except in this case. The movie had a decent plot and truly showed how terrible five points was during this period, however it seemed to just drag on and on. I'm giving it two stars because of its casting, set design, and costumes but it was a rough watch.
B0034G4P1W|4.0|THE PIRATES BAND OF MISFITS is a genial often hilarious tale of a motley crew of not so swashbuckling pirates.

B009VMN3RA|3.0|I bought this book expecting something different. I did not see Sachi on any of the talk shows so I had no idea as to what to expect.<br />I knew Shirley MacLaine was a kook, but i didn't know she was to the left of crazy.<br />This is a good argument as to why some people should not be allowed to have children.<br />I just have some difficulty believing some of the things that Sachi did or didn't do blaming it on her Japanese upbringing. Common sense should have played into her decisions one would think.<br />Hopefully, Sachi has taken her sad and bizarre upbringing into account when raising her own children and hopefully she is doing a stable and healthy job.<br />If I were her I would cut all ties with their Grandmother!
0307887448|5.0|This is one of those rare books that I didn't want to end.  I'm not a big video game player, but I simply loved this book.  I immediately bought a second copy to share with my 19 and 20-year-old children, and they both loved it also.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A quick read from start to finish.  Not only an inside look at the SEAL operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but deals with the personal decisions and struggles of the author.  No false bravado, just tells it like it was.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is not worth the 9.99 the author is charging for it. The language is immature, and awkward in places. I started hating the main character before I even had finished page two, and I am not at all impressed with this book. This reminds me of Twilight for some reason, and that is not a good thing at all for something that is supposed to be erotica. I see no reason to read the sequels.
B002ZG997M|5.0|I just loved this movie. Didn't see the end coming really, plus Denzel is superb as always. You must pick this one up for the collection.
B000MDDSB8|4.0|This is what it is, a movie about witchcraft featuring about half a dozen good looking young men who practice the craft. If you like movies like the Craft, and Underworld and Tv shows like Charmed, Buffy, the Secret Circle, and Supernatural you should like this.<br /><br />This wouldn't be appropriate for young children or preteens in my opinion, its more of an older teen and young adult movie.<br /><br />This movie reminded me of an evening playing White Wolf World of Darkness' Mage the Ascension, and actually got me into the Card game Magic the Gathering. All and all, this is probably one of the best movies out there in this genre.

B0095P29EG|3.0|This was a decent action movie that was much better than I expected, but not as good as I hoped it would be.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of Marvel Comic remakes or Video Game Adaptions so already, I went in with high expectations that I knew were not going to be met. This was not as bad as some movies, such as Mortal Kombat, House of the Dead, or In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. But it just didn't capture the magic I would have liked to see in a film like this. Am I a tough critic? Sure. But I am the one buying the tickets. I have the right to be.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is great in whatever she is in, though nothing tops her Star Wars roles. Hemsworth was more memorable in this one for me though. Nat's character seemed a bit like a cliche girl in trouble who was only there to stand in the background and shudder whenever things got hairy. It was not her best role.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Not the biggest star wars fan, but I will agree that the original movies were better. They are still a fun set of movies to watch, but they just don't feel the same as the original three. Not a bad buy for me as I picked these up used from Amazon Warehouse deals.

1400069807|3.0|The author wrote an excellent book, then made it obese with repeated instances, going back and forth, starting with a particular year/event, then jumping back once again to show how it happened. The end, the end; how shall I say it? Excellent, but tacked-on and far too short. Perhaps the author was leaving the readers to draw their own conclusions, but it could have had a knock-em, rock-em, sock-em ending that would have made it unforgettable.<br /><br />The most notable parts were the descriptions of how the government agencies and the corporations interacted (or, if you like, rolled over and played dead). And that the head honchos themselves in many cases would not eat or drink their own products.<br /><br />Still, though, worth reading, if you can be patient and tolerant with the same information repeated over and over. Kind of like this review.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I got this for my 8 year old son.  He loves playing it.  It is time for piggie pay back.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|It is a movie of PURE ACTION< LAFFS< AND A FUN ROLLERCOASTERV RIDE. Bulk of movie was shot near where I live. Neighbors signed up as extras but landed on the cuttting room floor. Anyway, the jail break, the Corvettte, the preparation in town for the forthcoming crap coming their way. Arnold, the supporting cast Peter Stormare(Fargo), Johnny Knoxville, etc Everyone was a good ,credible actor. Movie was just plain fun....divides up your attention to action, to drama, to humor...The mix of these elements are pure genius. Go too far with one aspect could have ruined this gem. But it is 5 STARS the whole way.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|My book club chose this book without even hearing of it previously, an oddity for us, but we decided the premise of the book sounded promising.  We have not yet met to discuss this book, but I for one found it very informative about the language of flowers.  I knew some of the history behind the Victorian meanings of flowers, and I found this book gave lots of information about that.  I was not prepared for the neediness of the main character.  Victoria sabotaged most every opportunity she was given to get out of her desperate life.  This made the book depressing to me.
B000FIMG68|5.0|It was in perfect condition and I loved watching it without commercials.I have now bout all six seasons from Amazon.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was really great and inspiring for those whom feel uninspired. Maybe to appreciate the simple things in life cause that's what makes life what it is.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was sucked in from the first episode. Can't wait to watch Season 3 on my iPad when it comes out!!!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Love the graphics. Great game to pass the time, made me want to try out the other interesting games. Have fun
B001N3OJEG|1.0|Paid for it but never got to see it.  Am I missing something???  Also cannot find out how to cancel the order and get my money back.
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|Don't get me wrong but I thought I was enjoying this movie until it just cut off. It was a half movie and there was no second disk. We just looked at each other and then said WHAT??????
0062197266|5.0|I spent the entire day yesterday on the sofa immersed in this book.  So few books engross me to that extent anymore, but with this book, there was no way I was going to do anything else until I finished it.  I loved the literary device of switching back and forth between time periods, so that you could see how Catherine/Cathy's OCD developed.  Gripping book--highly recommended.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Enjoyed spending the day working through the puzzles and chapters. Will be excited to try other G5 games in the near future!<br />You will need to spend money to get through chapter 2.
B0074EIQUG|3.0|I suppose with contracts and such, artists need to produce albums. If this was an attempt to find new fans, it was not a good effort.
086571701X|4.0|The book is a good overview of aquaponics for beginners,  but also contains salient points to consider for those leaning toward larger systems.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Riveting, keeps you reading, love it! One of the best series I have ever read. Can't wait for the next book!
B009OINFH4|5.0|Anyone in business ought to have this book on their must read list. Dan Pink's insights are invaluable, teaching the science and strategies behind new economy sales.<br /><br />My only complaint is in an effort to create new sales acronyms, he has unnecessarily complicated a relatively simple concept.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Fate brought them together and fate tore them apart.<br />This story was quite moving, but it took me through have the book before I really got into it.<br />Loved it in the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's cute and fun if you're an animal lover. I just started it today but I still think it's awesome.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|just a great fun game. problem solving at its best. addictive as well. I recommend. this to anyone who wants a thinking game that is original and fun
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very well constructed with each chapter from a different view point. Keeps you guessing till the end and your alliances with the characters rise and fall as the story progresses.
141659521X|4.0|I feel like Mitch Rapp, the protagonist in Vince Flynn's thrillers, is an old friend.  I've been with him for quite a few novels like The Last Man.  I was a reader of thrillers and their like for decades before I became a writer. Mitch Rapp is one of the best characters in thriller writing today; Vince Flynn makes sure of that.<br /><br />The Last Man is a fun, yet thrilling story of what happens when the irreplaceable CIA guy that nobody likes vanishes.  There were reasons no one liked him and they are coming out in droves.  It turns out that Mitch Rapp has to sort things out, no surprise.<br /><br />The story bounces around the likely and the unlikely, then weaves it all together.<br /><br />Good job!<br /><br />Robert Cook, author of [...]
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love playing this game. it is so much fun. the competition part is my favorite. almost like having a real horse.. but right on my tablet.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a huge fan of Vince Flynn and have been for years.  What is interesting is that with the rise of terrorism and radical Islam, his books have taken on a new relevance that I really wish they hadn't!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Fun but too many items buried under top tool bar. Also, many objects are so obscure in background it is almost impossible to find them without using hints. Overall, I enjoy the game.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Every now and then, a film comes along that unexpectedly blows you away!  This is one of those films.  With nearly 370 reviews already posted, I won't repeat the plot, but instead simply state this is a MUST SEE film.  If you were a fan of those great 80's films such as [[ASIN:B00005Q799 St. Elmo's Fire]] and [[ASIN:B001AEF6BI The Breakfast Club]], you'll see the resemblance.  I was immediately moved to a time and a place in that decade of the 80's.<br /><br />Leading the ensemble are Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller. Their characters will encapsulate you. Set in a time long before the Internet and cell phones (thankfully), the soundtrack ([[ASIN:B00956UOI8 The Perks Of Being A Wallflower]]) is stellar - with tracks from David Bowie '[[ASIN:B00001OH7V Heroes]]', The Smiths 'Asleep' (from their album [[ASIN:B000002LBH Louder Than Bombs]]), New Order, Dexy's Midnight Runners, Air Supply (and more) all intertwined magically into the film.<br /><br />I couldn't help but jump to the 1 star reviews - wondering, did the review rate the wrong film?  One reviewer seems to think this is a sad film about sexual abuse, suicide and other dark elements.  Ironically, those are 'pieces' of the film, but the overall theme is one of belonging, strength and overcoming weakness. You'll be moved by the hope, by the dreams and by the belief we ALL have a place in society.<br /><br />Ironically, this movie should also be on the top ten (gay) coming of age films for the character of Patrick is played out gracefully.  Although the focus is clearly on Charlie, the friendship between the two is another joyful triumph in the film.  If ever you were the wallflower (and if you think about it, most of us were), see this gem of a film, and triumph with the characters - all while feeling their pain, and their joy!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love this game. They have good graphics and gets more challenging.  It is worth the price if not sure try the free one first.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting book.  Clearly there is something to this and the experience he had.  I am glad to see that a man a science finally realizes that there might be spmething much bigger then us humans here on earth.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|Bought this for my wife and she has been watching it almost nonstop.  looked for this elsewhere (brick & mortar) and could not find it... but found it here at a decent price.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Game had a decent story line.  Not as challenging as other games from G5.  Some of the hidden objects were difficult to find on a Kindle screen.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Great movie at a great price..... much cheaper than at Wal-Mart or Kmart... glad that I found it here as my wife now has all three
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Saw it in the theaters,and couldn't wait till it came out on video.Excellent!We can't wait for the last two parts!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best at home workout DVD I have ever used. It helped me loose 50 pounds three years ago, and I'm using it again now to help me loose the last 15 pounds of baby weight!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is a fantastic show. It teaches you what to do (or not do)in the event of a zombie apocalypse. My only complaint is that Andrea is SO annoying. I just wish she would get eaten already.<br />By the way, you can stream the first 2 seasons of the show on Netflix. No other provider is licensed to stream it right now. In other words you can't see the show on Hulu. Those wishing to stream episodes on AMC's website should note that it only has the synopsis for each episode. There are no full length episodes available on amc's website.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Fun challenging.  Like others have posted looks like it might be another angry birds at first but it really is quite different.  Worth a look!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is so much better than the regular temple run.I love it. its sooo much fun.(: love it (:
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I had a lot of different emotions while reading this series. This girl is so young, actually most of the characters are. This was the hardest book I have read in a long time. I just have not read any story like the Hunger Games where there was so much death to children. Well there was lots of death period. The books were all good reads however, I think the first book was the best, and probably should have been the only one.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|This is for someone learning how to knit on circular needles. Is very informative and explains clearly how to knit on circular needles. Also has several patterns you can start with.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|This season dvd set...is enough to pee your pants laughing! Language can offend ..if u r sensitive...I loved it! My family and friends have all borrowed it...and died laughing!
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|If you are looking for something scary this is not the movie for you. Decent story just not executed too well. Wait for it to come on Pay-TV.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|The remastered copy definitely improved the color. Most of the bonus material is in the two discs that say Bonus. The other three disks are really just the movie, the trailer and two of them have deleted scenes included.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend he seams to like it played with it after the birthday party really makes you think and holding it just right.  Others wanted a turn also.
B005R32L66|3.0|The app is not stable on my Ematic tablet. I think it needs to be made compatible with such android devices. However the voice chat works fine.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual City Playground is a very fun city builder that takes a lot from the mother of all city builders SimCity. This game focuses on the business aspect of cities. You must control the flow of all good and needs suchas Garbage service, Buses, and getting things like sugar to the cake factory, then get the cake from the factory to the mall. Its more complex than most City Builders, and that's where this one shines. If your tired of the same city builders I would defiantly recommend this one.
B00785P2QC|3.0|So many things cost too much. The buildings don't show cost to upgrade. Expansion spaces need to be larger, too. Just fix a few little things and it will be a great game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just like the first book i found myself hooked from the start.I enjoyed every moment of it it was amazing.i recomend this book to everyone and anyone i love it.......read it
B002XXUWMI|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in a while and heard a song that was in the movie so I had to go back and watch it again. It has such an unusual story even for scifi....
B005LAII80|2.0|I was curious about this film, considering the hints at how interesting the universe in which it takes place, post-Appocolyptic Earth in the only remaining mega-city appeared to be as presented in the original version which starred Sylvester Stallone. Unfortunately that version approached the material with a thick coating of \\"camp\\", perhaps an attempt to make it feel like a comic book and slough off some of the excessive violence that are a basic part of that future dystopia.<br /><br />That film was based on the premise of Judge Dredd being pulled into a conspiracy to take over all remaining fragments of the law by your typical psychopathic ex-Judge escaped from prison and bent on revenge against the whole world.<br /><br />The current film chose to take a more realistic tack, giving the entire world a hard coating of grit, grime and decay and discarded the attempts a humor the first film found itself relying on to make it paletable.<br /><br />But as I sat through it, I realized why it had been released and instantly crashed at the box office.<br /><br />This is simply a terribly unpleasant thing to watch.<br /><br />Not that its poorly produced or shot. It isn't. The production values are first rate and the effects are amazing.<br /><br />What makes it difficult to endure is a combination of the bland storyline and an overload of meaningless violence.<br /><br />While the Stallone film had a moderately interesting storyline, this one feels more like an episode of \\"Cops\\" from the distant future. It's basically nothing more than a drug bust in a really, REALLY bad neighborhood gone wrong, winding up in a massive seige and hostage situation. The fact that the nieghborhood is a single massive high rise that can seal itself with massive blast doors, thus trapping the Judges and the perpetrators inside is the only reason this film exists.<br /><br />Actually, the true only reason is so the producers could set up the bloodiest, most grusome, most distasteful collectionof violence ever filmed. It's nothing more than a \\"first person shooter\\" game that you can only observe, not play. \\"Innocent civilians\\" are there only to be killed in horrific ways and by the dozen.<br /><br />The fact that the effects are so detailed and realistic only makes it all the more difficult to watch. I found it producing the same vague, disquieting feelings I get when I observe the heaps of bodies recorded in old Nazi Holocaust footage.<br /><br />In short, this is one of the most heartless, cold and disturbing films I've seen in quite some time, primarily because there is no transcendant or uplifting point needing to be made. It is just grusome violence for its own sake to the point of being marginally pornographic.<br /><br />The very fact that so many people find it exciting or entertaining is, in itself, very disturbing. The fact that I also was impressed by the precision and realism of the violence makes me feel a little guilty.<br /><br />My thoughts are, if you do watch this film and don't find yourself at least thinking \\"enough already\\" long before it ends, you should perhaps worry about your own store of human empathy not being quite as strong as it should be.<br /><br />If you think it's great and you want to watch it again and again, I pray you never get your hands on a firearm. It's that disturbing. Trust me.
6305696071|5.0|One of Julia Roberts best roles.  I real &#34;Rags to Riches&#34; story.<br />If you like happy endings, this movie is for you...
B008VBYN80|5.0|extremely good graphics, easy to play without having to use any real money!!! and the best strategy game on amazon. add me Blake the warrior
B000003CMC|5.0|I still have this on vinyl, but can't play that in my car.  For Allman Brothers fans this is a must own!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|With the gravitas and execution of accuracy added to it marketing expose' on a conflict(s) that miraculously marketer this most important cinematic endeavor. Like her Oscar-winning, &#34;  , this is a work of focused determination and device.
B000002KK2|5.0|I had this cd in the past, but was unable to find it.<br />This an excellent collection of music, and generally underrated.<br />I am going to see her play this Thursday and am really looking forward to seeing her live for the first time :)<br />I would say that anyone who has only heard &#34;Chuck E.'s In Love&#34; should listen to the whole cd!
0061714372|5.0|This is one of the easiest reads, and hardest books to put down, that I have encountered in a long time.  I admit, I have the bias of being a Megadeth fan from way back, but Dave's book is written so conversationally, you will be dozens of pages in before you realize it, and won't want to put it down.  I actually started the book one evening and read it straight though until I finished it in one sitting.  I'm not recommending this method, it was a marathon, but my point being that you will not lose interest in what he's trying to say.<br />I've always liked the band, I could not put the book down!
B000002J03|5.0|There is not much that I can say about Led Zeppelin I and II.<br />Truely one of the best first and second albums ever made!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is awesome! you should download it now. it wont be a waste of time. promise. you will not regret downloading it.
B0000669JL|5.0|This is one of the greatest collections of all time, I also have this on vinyl, but misplaced my cd - this new release has added material.  Everyone should add this to their collection!!!
0316017922|3.0|interesting with a different perspective on why certain people can thrive and be successful yet others seem to miss the boat
B00B2V66VS|1.0|So I played ot for a while and it was gun. Now it wouldn't open. I ting that stupid. Its a game that a lot of people will bye so it should open.
B002N8A14M|4.0|does what it is made to do - seems a little flimsy but with the ipod inside it is solid, & I can adjust volume and select music very easily
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely love this show!  Had to get all the eposides as soon as I saw one of the shows.  Easy to download and watch on my tablet.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great movie. Fast paced with a good story line.<br />You get a beeter perspective of what Bond is really like.<br />Much better than Quantum of Solace
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely love this show!  Had to get all the eposides as soon as I saw one of the shows.  Easy to download and watch on my tablet.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Interesting story.  Though I knew the outcome, was interesting to see it happen. Thank-you for telling us the story Ben!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The story and the movie were a very special surprise. This movie captivating and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|After coming off from reading the Divergent series this had a fairly slow start. Towards the end it was hard to put down. I am looking forward to begin the second book after I finish posting this.
B009Z5BPZK|4.0|When I received the Roswell CD it was broken.  I returned it, but it couldn't be replaced by cargolargo.  They apparently were out of stock.  I'm still looking for a copy.
B0018O51LU|1.0|This is an awesome movie, but unfortunately I cannot watch it on this DVD as I live in the United States and this is a Region 2 DVD, which only works on Region 2 DVD players, which are only operable in European and Asian countries. Unfortunately, I assumed that this was a region 1 DVD, so shame on me for assuming. But shame on the seller for not stating that it was a Region 2 DVD in the title.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Ever since i received the cd it has been in my cd player (vehicle). I listen to it anytime I am in the car!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book to be both scientifically and spiritually based.  It reinforced my belief in eternal life.  It was interesting seeing how a scientifically based physician was given a chance to experience the after life that completely changed his outlook on this earthly life.  Thanks for your insight Dr. Alexander
B005LAIH2M|4.0|The title of the film will most likely turn 3/4 of people away without even giving it a chance. DO NOT go by that alone. I understand this was not taken well by reviewers but did you honestly expect an oscar winner from a Fantasy/Action/Horror film? It is extremely entertaining and if you love gory movies it's even better. They could've cut it down to a \\"PG-13\\" movie to be more profitable to a younger audience but I'm so glad they didn't. It is def worth while to give it a watch. I'll be buying the blu-ray combo pack when it comes out! Just know that when a film comes out with an odd title like \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" and this, it will usually turn out alot better then you might expect!
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Say what you want about Jaquin  Phoenix; he's still a tremendous actor. This film stops just shy of calling itself early Scientology, but if you've read any about the religion's founder L. Ron Hubbard, then Hoffman's character is a more than subtle reference.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Read the first book while working at an Indie bookstore as a pre-release, couldn't wait for this book and the others! Was not disappointed AT ALL!
B003P2WJ6S|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was fun to read and very informative. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for more than a story - it is a good piece of journalistic inquiry as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have a fire, hated diving through menus to know my battery percentage, now I get the info in notification area. Much more precise then looking at battery Icon.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|He tells a good story, entertaining, but not nearly as well developed as many of the earlier books.  Still worth the read.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I Love this cover because it's not bulky and is easy to handle.  It protects my kindle fire with class!
B000SEGTI0|5.0|There's no one better at discussing God and the question of humanity, wrapped up in what seems to be a simple science fiction narrative, than PKD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have very much enjoyed this series and can't wait for season 4.  Mr and Mrs Bates are my favorites!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Super movie when you see it on t.v. but even funnier when you see it with special effects and in this special edition.  All National Lampoon lovers have to have this movie!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching this season and have become very attached to the characters.  They pull you in, even the villains, you can't wait to see what they are up to next!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This is a feel good and realistic view of what producers go through behind the scenes of a show. Loved Harrison Ford's character. Cantankerous! Diane Keaton - diva. If you want a light-hearted movie - here you go! Oh and the back plot of the love story of the main character is - not typical of this type of movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The workouts are hard but doable and like any of Jillian's workouts if you stick to it you will see results!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Enjoyable movie for kids & adults alike!  You do not have to be a video game aficionado to enjoy this movie.
B0000DK4PO|5.0|I don't know why I, a musical lover refused to seee this but a decade after its orginal release I went over to a freinds who was watching it and knew I had to order it. A mix of multiple genres with a twist.<br />Wonderful film!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the characters! I highly recommend reading this trilogy. I couldn't put these books down when I first read them, and still can't as I read them for the 3rd time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game right in Rome there is this board that is so cool and I love the characters
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I LOVED the Hunger Games.  I hated Mockingjay.  I felt the Author became tired and just wanted to finish up the series.  The ending was horrible and depressing.  I do not need a fairy tale finish but geez leave your readers with some sense of satisfaction for purchasing and reading all of your books. Peeta and Katniss do not even seem like they want to be together in the end.  Now Katniss has to worry if Petta is gonna knock her off while she is sleeping at night.  Thanks for nothing Collins.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have been following this show since it started. I love the characters, the story line, the script. It's just an overall great show.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|On the edge of my seat the WHOLE TIME! Never boring Always exciting wether its the Action or just talking. I LOVE IT!
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Weak movie.  Storyline not well developed.  Ending is anticlimactic.  Tommy lee Jones is a much better actor than what he shows here.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Not much of suspense as we used to in MI series, not even that much of an auction, racing cars or powerful weapons!! Non!
B001O1O71C|5.0|I thought this book was amazing having it through the eyes of a young boy. I would definitively read this again later in my life. All in all, amazing.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I'll make this mercifully short. A story needs to have an arc where characters invoke interest in their plight. None of these characters were even modestly sympathetic and were interesting only in their evident insanity so I really couldn't develop an interest in what happened to them. That would be fine if the story teller let us viewers in on the underpinnings of their goofiness. Back in the '60s hippy parties often ended up like most of the scenes in this movie. Again, Phillip Seymour Hoffmann and Joaquin Phoenix are splendid actors and for that matter so seemed the others mired down in this stinker. Nominating Hoffmann and Phoenix for Oscars was like nominating Adele for a Grammy for singing a beautiful tune in \\"tongues\\". I'd slam the director but for me I didn't see that the director had much to work with.<br /><br />Compare to 2007's \\"There Will Be Blood\\". An equally dark yet infinitely superior movie WITH A STORY LINE.
030758836X|5.0|As a mystery book afficiando, I found this to be one of the most perfect works of fiction ever written.  Just when you think you have it figured out, everything changes.........and changes again..........and changes again. I would encourage readers of any type of fiction to give this book a try.  They won't be sorry.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie when I got it a few weeks ago and watch it almost everyday since. I highly-recommend every Bond fan to purchase this Bond flick because it is truly incredible.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|We all know the story - if you don't - watch the amazing documentary about Rodriguez &#34;Searching For Sugarman&#34; - I love this album, just as much as his first release although this one feels more personal and less experimental, but just as sugary delicious!
B004X4QW42|5.0|Perhaps Danni's best film but certainly one of his best anyhow. If you like martial arts films at their best then this is for you. I wish they'd do more of these because this is truly entertaining and has great fight scenes in it. Keeping with the \\"use only for good\\" ethics is a beautiful thing portrayed in this film. Just a great movie.
B00AYL7OAY|5.0|Love these guys - I pretty much own all their music and you can never go wrong.  This album is fantastic - feels like the old stuff, the music I fell in love with that made me an early fan of this extremely talented threesome.  Great stuff - buy now.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This is exactly why I like to go see movies myself, there is no reason to give this movie anything under 4 stars at least, this was just as good as the first one
B001KR9AP8|5.0|I couldn't resist purchasing this album during the 1.99 sale. She's got at least 4 instant classics on here. The quality is very good.
B000KIPD5E|5.0|Any time a person buys an A/B box their only real expectation is to have it switch quietly, this unit is as quiet as them come.  For the price it can't really be beat.
1401322786|3.0|I just finished reading [[ASIN:1401322786 The Time Keeper]] by Mitch Albom and I'm not exactly sure how I feel about it.  I am a fan of Albom's because of writing style.  I love his short staccato sentences.  He has clear clean writing.  Great use of visual descriptors.  I love that his novels make you think.  Think about the role you play in the universe and how it affects others.  The one thing I don't care for about Albom is that sometimes he can be rather heavy handed on dosing out his brand of morality and that's what I felt happened in The Time Keeper.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is definitely a morality tale and can be summed up with the following:<br /><br />\\"There's a reason God limits our days.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"To make each one precious.\\" (TK 206)<br /><br />Albom's Time Keeper follows the lives of three main characters Dor (Father Time), Sarah (a 'stereotypical' teenager), and Victor (a wealthy old man).<br /><br />Chapter 2 opens with, \\"This is a story about the meaning of time.\\" Throughout the novel the narrator tries to impress upon the reader how much we have let time control and dictate our lives and how often we ask for more time or take it away.  The narrator also tries to impress upon the reader how much we don't appreciate the time we are given and that we don't make the most of it.  And I felt that this was really quite heavy handed and if I got another \\"bad timing\\" or \\"more time\\" or \\"time flies\\" or any other such cliche, I just might scream.<br /><br />Speaking of cliche's there were a lot of them.  There is also the stereotype of a teenage girl.  She's super smart, has few friends, is overweight, and is in love (with a boy who doesn't reciprocate).  She doesn't get along with her mother -- okay, I don't know a 17 year -old girl in America that does.  She's self-conscious -- again I don't know a teenage girl who isn't.  She thinks she's in love with the first boy that shows her any real attention -- umm, I don't know of teenage girl that hasn't fallen head over heals in love.  She get's teased in school -- that is part of high school.  And she has a mental meltdown when the boy blasts her on Facebook.<br /><br />Victor is a self made man and the 14th wealthiest person in the world.  He spent his time making money.  He's now an old dying man.  He has cancer and kidney failure and goes to dialysis three times a week.  He's used to getting what he wants and won't accept no for an answer and when the doctor tells him he doesn't have much time left, Victor begins to look for ways to beat time -- to beat death --to cheat time.<br /><br />I enjoyed how Albom wove the stories together.  Every other chapter was about one of the main characters.  I read some reviews in which people felt as though the characters were not developed enough.  I didn't feel like any of the characters were flat or one-dimensional.  Albom gives his characters background, a middle and a \\"potential\\" end.  He alternates between the characters stories, which I loved and it kept me engaged. He didn't give to much away about the characters and each time they appeared Albom gave the reader another tidbit of information about them<br /><br />I was disappointed when Father Time (Dor) brought Sarah and Victor together to show them their future.  It was very Christmas Carol-like.  And Victor even questions whether or not he is a ghost.  Father Time shows what the future has in store them should they continue on their current path. Dor is the ghost of Christmas future (without the sickle), Victor is Scrooge, and Sarah (loosely based on Tiny Tim).<br /><br />The ending felt rushed and incomplete.  It's as though he ran out of time (to use a time cliche).
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This game is very good, the only flaws is the car physics, and the police should be harder to get through.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It was fun playing for awhile until you run out of coins and have to wait 24 hours for it to refill back up. I give it 4 stars because it is fun and it is free. Unless like everything else in the World if you want more coins to play you gotta pay. Not paying, period.
B0083GQVXI|4.0|Tilda Swinton looks like Eddie Furlong.<br /><br />Okay.  Now that that's out of the way, &#34;Kevin&#34; is a great movie.  It takes a while to get going, but you get hooked.  Well shot, well acted.  Just enough character development to understand the roles.  It's definitely a dark film with sinister overtones.  If you like movies like &#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&#34; and &#34;Black Swan,&#34; you should check this out.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We got this set for our son for his birthday. He already owns season one. These shows are very well done and become addicting!
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|Loved the movie and that it is in black and white.  Claissic Tim Burton!  Two thumbs up!  Great family fun.
1616550414|5.0|loved it. it was great reading how all the games came together and seeing all the concept art for how things could have been different. its a great buy and cheap for how much you get.
B0026SCMNM|2.0|The ending was very prompt and left us empty. The beginning is not worth the flimsy ending. Not worth the read.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|It definitely encouraged me to read more about art, since I am an artist but I think this is a great book for anyone.
B000FBJG04|5.0|If you're a fan of the &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; miniseries on HBO, you will still enjoy this book. Ambrose goes into much more detail and you actually find out much more about E Company than the narrow scope of the TV show,<br /><br />The sacrifices these men made to keep the world free are chronicled in detail here. No bones about it, this book is one you'll want to read over and over.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A believeable near death experience - a story revealed by a neurosurgeon  which confirms there is existence beyond our physical bodies. If you have lost a loved one or fear death itself - this book will reassure you there is much more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great Game!! Very Addictive! You will not be disappointed. Great to challenge your friends and family. Won't be able to tear yourself away.
B00338QENI|5.0|Well written, easy to read, as it was told in a story format - yet it was a  learning experience for me as well.<br /> It offered info re:<br />  The useage of human cells utilized from biopsies for scientic discoveries and all it's ethical issues and how close family members deal with these ethical issues.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Casting is superb, story line is compelling, costumes are striking.  Historical references and setting - up to and including World War I - are realistic and imaginative.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|very cute. Love the hair. The guy looks a little like Aladdin. Children and adults will enjoy the story line.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|similar to other books on those who have been privileged to glimpse the wonders of Heaven.  Validates those who claim to have visited the Heavenly realm, and encourages believers to introduce others to the faith, that they too might be saved.

B009MFKO3M|4.0|Love this album. Can't stop listening to it. Cross between syd Barrett, flaming lips, and John Lennon . A few songs aren't that great . But awesome overall !
B004S3MB2U|5.0|A well designed calculator app, that is simple to use, and does what it's supposed to.<br />I will look for more from this developer.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I don't know why I never read this book as a child.  I found writing from a dogs perspective oddly engaging.  This is a must-read book but I only wish I had read it years earlier.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|This is a great DVD set plus the digital copy. Very happy I got it for such a good price.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I got call of Atlantis as a faotd and loved playing it till it disappeared from my apps. This one is just as fun. Hope it doesn't disappear as well. None of my other faotd have done this.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love the book just like the rest of the series it leaves major cliffhanger.  Ready for the Winds of Winter
1846556007|3.0|The first Jo Nesbo. I didn't think great - as compared to his other books. Was glad to finally finish it !
1616550414|5.0|This is the book that every serious Zelda fans should get. This book covers everything you need to know about the Zelda universe. It ties the storyline of the different games together, it explains everything you wanted to know about the series. Incredible artwork and drawing of characters that never made it into the games and so forth. This is a must buy for every Zelda fan out there.
1400052181|5.0|This is a really important book.  I basically knew about Henrietta Lacks and the fact that her cells were used in research without her knowledge or consent, so I didn't think I needed to read a whole book about it.  How wrong I was.  The story is compelling, fascinating, and sheds light on a range of ethical and medical issues.  It paints a sympathetic but honest and realistic picture of the people affected by the way Lacks was treated, intertwined with the equally interesting and dramatic narrative of how the reporter (author) was able to get the story.  I am a researcher who deals with human subjects, and I feel I have a much deeper understanding of the whole ethical review/informed consent process that is now required for such research.  But this book should appeal to a much broader audience than just researchers: it is a terrific story, as engaging as any novel, and better because it is true.
0670022705|5.0|I first learned about this book from listening to NPR. This last summer they went into all 100 items in a short blurb at lunch time. I have a friend who studies history and gave her a copy for Christmas. Good reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|8 year old daughter says it is even more fun that the first one. Loves the big gorilla chase part.
B0011E9LBI|4.0|fun to watch again & again<br /><br />book Dale Gladstone, the world's best best caricaturist for your trade show, wedding or party
B006FE83UE|5.0|High school daughter had to read the book for school.  We let her watch the movie after she finished reading the book.  Really great movie!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My family and I enjoyed this film.  At times it moved a bit slowly, but overall, it was fantastic!  I was pleasantly surprised at the Christian theme the movie has.  The visual effects were outstanding!
B005VPRETE|4.0|My daughter picked it as a gift to her friend. It arrived in time and in perfect condition. It was a gift so that was implortant
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Entertaining movie.  From previews I thought there were going to be tons of special effects, but there was not.  Don't get me wrong, those that they did have regarding the tiger and fish were really cool. I would recommend seeing this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome!!! You have to try it if you haven't already. It's kind of like temple run but with a twist... so cool a must have app.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love this  book it is a awesome book but  no pictures of the book oops I mean no pictures in the book
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This is a very interesting and complex story.  Please don't expect simplicity.  The author gives very detail account about hills and the slightest details.  That makes for a long read but aside that the main story gets your heart thumping.  I loved the book.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|The movie has a slower first half but the second half more than makes up for it!  Sugar Rush Sugar Rush!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I have followed all the James Bond movies since they first came out.  Daniel Craig is, as far as I'm concerned, the best Bond.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|bruno mars is my new addiction.  i love the entire album, very jazzy, blues throughout the whole album.  can't go wrong with this.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|One of my favorite movie.  Love all the actors, the story line etc.  I love British movies as most of them deal with relationships and not all the people are beautiful.  Love it Love it Love it.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Bought it for my grandson who is 2.  He loves it and watches it over and over.  He got to see Belle and the Beast at Walt Disneyworld and was so thrilled about seeing characters in person that he saw on his tv.  It was supposed to stay at Grandma's house but he took it home and won't bring it back.  It's all good.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I never heard of this movie until the Oscars and decided I should see it.  A really great movie I was really impress with the whole thing.  Ben Affleck did a great job all around.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This is a nice app my friend introduced me to. It helps me calm down quite a bit when my mind is traveling at mach speed.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Great little game, funny concept, enjoyable to play, easy to pick up.  Amazon is requiring eight more words for this review, but basically it is just a fun, simple game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm addicted to all of the versions of these games. With a busy lifestyle, it's nice to play a game that is challenging and creative yet just monotonous enough for me to &#34;zone out&#34; if I want. :)
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Pretty good movie.I can't wait for the next one to come out. I hate writing so this will be it.
B0011ZVTEO|5.0|This music puts me in such a good mood! Very talented group with a wonderful, authentic sound. It's my summer time playlist. :)
0425263916|2.0|This has too many similarities between Fifty Shades of Grey.  I thought it would be a little bit more to the story. Just didn't keep my attention.
0399230033|5.0|I bought this for my daughter to replace the one my son had. We love this book. It's fun to make up the story yourself because there are so few words in the book. We always look for the red balloon in each picture. Love it!
0425263908|2.0|I thought this would keep my attention like Fifty Shades but it didn't.  I did read the entire book, but would not recommend.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study data shows there is an 80 times increase in the incident of breast cancer comparing regions in China that eat a plant based diet to a regions that eat an animal based (Western Country diet). We in the US consume roughly 10 times more animal protein than the regions of China that eat a plant based diet.<br /><br />There are 500,000 bypass operations performed in the US every year. The China study data supports the assertion that almost all of the atherosclerosis disease in the US can be prevented by a change from an animal based diet to plant based diet.<br /><br />Colin Campbell states in the film Forks over Knives that 70 to 80% of US medical costs can be eliminated by a change from an animal based diet to plant based diet.<br /><br />The film Forks over Knifes documents the stories of hundreds of people who have solved their health problems by changing from an animal based to plant based diet.<br />Based on the data presented in Campbell's book and the film Forks over Knives I changed from an animal based diet to plant based diet, eliminating dairy, cheese, chicken, fish, and steak from my diet. After the change my high blood pressure problems were resolved and I no longer had problems with arthritis. I sleep better and feel great.<br /><br />I unhesitatingly recommend reading the China Study and watching the film Forks over Knifes to my friends and love ones.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Ok, this I use often, and it has certainly worth having available on my kindle.<br />Get it, try it, see if you agree.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I enjoy this app as it allows me to check in and check things out when I'm out and about and not at home. Waiting for an appointment?? Good time to do a little Pinterest surfing!

B0097L29KM|3.0|Reminiscent of Americana, when Neil is hot, he's hot and then there's the other.  This has its BRILLIANT moments off set by that NEVER ending WAAY overlooped Driftin' Back.  The SOUND is fanTAStic (but then again over CDs that doesn't take much) however with all this production perfection WHY lyrics that you need a magnifying glass to read???  Again....that's Neil.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Having tried several of the Mahjong games available, this one fast became my favorite!!. I like the size of the tiles and the graphics, and I also like the timer for the games.
B0087HT36U|3.0|i really enjoy the game but there are times you cannot win the game b/c of the delay from the time you can throw a bomb and the time a cart runs over a princess. There are also program problems were a stone or board should fall but you can see where it does not register. i do enjoy the game but I had to give it 3 out of 5 stars b/c of these problems, if they would fix the problems I would be happy to give them 5 out of 5 stars but based on the other reviews I don't think they will.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|While I loved several of Nicholas Sparks' books, this one seemed to be padded with filler to make it longer. Too many details, too much rehashing of the rejected husband's motives. I won't buy a Sparks book again.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love Supernatural, got hooked. I can't wait for next season to begin. GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME MORE!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't for the life of me understand why these books are so popular. Sex sells, I guess, but the writing is atrocious. I made it about halfway and then had to quit.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book!  I read it in 3 sittings.  Couldn't put it down.  I will definitely look for more books by this author.

B009JBZH54|5.0|The box is beautiful, material and design captures the movie sense, and although is a standard set, is just that you need for enjoy the entire trilogy again and learn about the production. Really comes with 5.1 spanish audio track, that means you don't need to buy another versions made and sold from latin markets that commonly comes with less extras. The book included is simple but is a good value add for the package and its excellent price. Is my first Blu-ray box set, and I am impressed.
B000FA675C|5.0|I enjoyed this book from cover to cover!  It was hard for me to put this book down, because I couldn't stop reading \\"one more page\\", to see what would happen next.  One of my all time favorite books.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well worth the read. So many unanswered questions, I couldn't put it down. Thankful they were answered in a timely manner it never got frustrating. Very imaginative story. Highly recommend it
B000002WU9|5.0|Raekwon's debut changed the rap game when it was released back in '95. After it was released, albums such as Reasonable Doubt, Life After Death, and countless others followed the same formula that Rae did. Although Rae wasn't the first to do Mafioso rap, Kool G Rap did. Such an amazing album filled with a lot of great tracks one by another. I hardly skip any track because each track plays throughout like a movie. Raekwon and company did such an amazing job and feels like it was the Wu-Tang's own take on The Godfather. Rae and partner in rhyme Ghost both narrate details on subject matters that they rap about and takes listeners on a wild journey about a life of crime, mobsters, and high speed chases.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A very real film as far as films go.  Gritty, honest, fun but not flippant about addiction and tragedy.  Very entertaining and at the same time a learning experience to watch.
B009RWRIKM|5.0|Dance is notoriously difficult to film well and Wim Wenders has done an absolutely masterful job in both the dance sections and the talking sections.  The film is heartfelt, moving, thrilling and brings to life a great master of dance.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Ranks up there with the best Bond (Sean Connery). Daniel Craig does a great job as bond. The movie was also great.
B00BHWG0EK|1.0|This is 100% garbage,why? Why re-release the DVDs again? Pointless. If you we're going to re-release them, at least make them 20 dollars seasons to try and get new fans to check it out.<br /><br />Episodes are excellent, this is just lining the pockets of some studio execs.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I usually don't write reviews but I had to for this one. It's so easy to download things and it doesn't take a long time.

B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My kids (3 boys and 1 girl) enjoyed this movie.  The hub's also enjoyed it.  Personally, it wasn't my favorite Disney flick....but that is probably because I am not a video game fan.  Cute movie.  Would reccommend it to a family with boys.

1423113462|5.0|The reason why I started reading this book is my brother liked it a lot. He begged dad for the next book which is \\"the son of Neptune.\\" It grabbed my attention right away. I liked it so much I stayed up night. My favorite character is Piper because she can charmspeek. I wish I could charmspeek my dad to buy me ice cream. Piper is also pretty and she can talk nice. She is really brave and she does not betray her friends. She has another friend name Leo. He is funny, rely funny to me. He is the son of Hephaestus, the god of black smiths and fire, not exactly a god son a demigod. A demigod is borne when regular people marry god. The baby is the demigod. So as I was saying Leo is funny and I feel sorry for him for losing his mother he accidentally killed his mother with fire. And there is Jason, a son of Zeus (a demigod). He is mostly the main character. He can fly.<br /><br />The story is Jason wake up without a memory. There is this thing called a mist. It can mess with you mind. So they made a fake memory of Jason of Leo and Piper. They go to camp half-blood. Half-blood is another name for demigod. So at camp half-blood they find out the truth about the fake memory. And they have a vision about freeing Hera. So they travel for a quest and meet enemy and stuff. The book actually does not really end in a happy ending. So I am eager to read the next book.<br /><br />And I will tell you something. Read it twice! I understand it better and better every time I read it again. So if you are looking for a book that is really fun and adventurous, \\"The Lost Hero\\" is the perfect book!

B004HXIZVC|5.0|This app is perfection for amateur artists looking for a place to publicize their music. A few of my friends are amateur rap artists and they've gotten many gigs from the music theyve put up on SoundCloud. It gives a nice clear sound and easy operating system. The only issue is that sometimes the amazon app store screws up and causes you to have to redownload the app which is what I find myself doing right now! Otherwise , its a fantastic app
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Great, we love the show,,,did not know about David Foster...so this provide a good summary of him and his many accomplishments....great line too.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed this book but found he repeated alot of the medical jargon which was not important to me. Loved his description of his visit to heaven. Takes a lot of the fear of death away.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This Game Is Fun Exciting And Just Pulls You In..It Makes U Want To Play Over And Over Again Even When U Know U Should Be Doing Something Else Like Chores I Absolutely Love it.!
B006HL9G10|5.0|I like this app very much and find it helpful in meditation. I also appreciate know that other are meditating too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it it is coll so cool<br />Cheerleading the lyric this crazy how cool it is so amazed<br />It makes happy so amazed that it is really beautiful
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Delightfully quirky Swedish version of a Forrest Gump kind of story. Good story, well-told, and as unusual as its title
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I liked Argo.  I remember the Iran contraband.  It was very worrying times.  But to see the other escape.  I thought it was a good movie.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Dear John was a very good book from Nicolas Sparks. Nicolas Sparks is a great author because he is good at romance novels.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a great game love it about to about to play again .......I have a lot of hidden game's thus was almost better then heaven harvest.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because the Walking Dead has kept me interested and wanting to see more for all 3 seasons so far. I was wary about watching this show cause I thought it was just another show/movie about zombies, and we all know there are too many.. BUT I have been pleasantly surprised and I am so glad I started because now I am HOOKED!!!!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Big holes in the plot. People killed without any of that Bond finesse. Suspense carried by another character (M). But impressive big effects. I'm an American. Give me effects. I don't care that much about the others.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are so captivating I couldn't stop reading. It renewed my interest in books. Definitely on my favorites list.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was sceptical about pintrest when told about it, but now you it to glean all kinds of information and find ideas for my cards.  I am a Stampin' Up demonstrators and can find any idea, pattern, technique, and know how on pintrest.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|I would recommend this book it was funny and well wrote. Sedaris never disappoints with his quirky and enjoyable writing.
B001GRTPKM|5.0|Not only is the content greatness!, but the production quality is flawless!  This is a must for Police fans and Audio/Videophiles alike. I would use this concert/disk to demonstrate what Blu-ray can do!
B004UID2LC|1.0|when i downloaded the video or music file it erases all the downloads  and its useless!!!! &gt;:( not satisfied at all
B003O86FMW|5.0|Honestly I am flying through these books! The storyline, plot, and characters grab him of you and you can't put the book down! Catching Fire was a great follow-up to the 1st installment and I can't wait to read the 3rd.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie but after the intro, it seemed to fall apart.  The villian was forgettable and the plot evolved to be all about M.  Bond seemed to be a bit player in his own movie.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|The book was filled with action and romance. Though there were a few things lacking. 1) the team relied to much on frank and almost required him to do their bidding and turn into the animal of their choice. 2) the scenes in the book depicting a fight, were not as graphic as Riorden's previous work. 3) the giants were to easy to take down.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|It's fun but you only have 15  to plan. The bulls are super annoying and when you try to jump they get mad.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app. So much fun. Very addictive! I got it for my niece but I started playing it and now I love it. The graphics are amazing!!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Florence and the Machine are simply the best!  Highly recommend this album, and already looking forward for the next album.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm a fan of myst and 7th guest and this was a beautiful blend of the two.. fun.. great time killer...<br />only thing is its HUGE. almost filled my kindle.
B00005JPCF|5.0|My two year old loves this show. With all the singing and dancing penguins he is bouncing up and down the whole time.  I have to say I'm not really into dissecting plots on kids animated shows :). We have been able to teach him about the different kinds of penguins and about zoos from this show.
B002YCVWXQ|2.0|Great movie,...but Amazon's performance was poor. The download didn't work correctly and didn't complete,...so I ended up having to purchase wi-fi on my flight to complete the viewing of the movie prior to the rental expiring. It was an expensive pain in the ***!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This wonderfully referenced thorough guide to healthier living has been a real revelation for me.  Started gluten-free living with immediate results. With much appreciation to Dr. Davis.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|love it!! I think that it is very addictive...:) Cant put it down...reminds me of Candy Crush Saga...and I love that game as well.
B007HO392S|4.0|For such a huge super-star, she has managed to stay true to herself and sing songs that obviously have meaning to her. The production and vocals are beautiful in this recording.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|The journalist interviewing Pi's journey learns the importance of telling a better story.  A story we can all learn from.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|I loved it in theaters, and it's just as good at home.  3D works great, just as well as at the theaters.
0307895475|4.0|I love this guide, this is the second one I have ordered since the new DLC content has come out.  But it does not have information about Dragonborn, I wish they had waiting just a little bit and added that too.  Oh well, there is always Wiki.
0345525558|5.0|The story openned my eyes, and I'm sure many other readers as well, on what REALLY happends AFTER child is out of foster care. It is written in well, realistic-like setting. Vanessa Diffenbaugh definitely captured my heart with her book as much as Victoria Johnson with her life's adventure. I coudn't read without tears. Thank you for beatiful book!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|For 50 years thinkers have carried well worn paperback copies of one classic or another, now we can carry them all on one simple device. Ayn would love knowing that the creators of the future had produced an even more convenient way for readers to access her great works.
B003KUSUN6|5.0|A great disc, beautiful in Blu-Ray, and a great band. Hank Marvin is astounding. I love Theme From Local Hero. Better than Mark Knopfler's, I hate to say.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel keeps you attention from cover to cover, guessing whether or not Jacob was guilty, the faith and questions parents go through when children are in trouble, and all the emotions that those situations entail.  It brought plenty of discussion in our book club.
0062238868|3.0|I read the book over the course of a week, so here's how I view it.<br />It's a good, entertaining read. Is it deep? No. Is it well written? No.<br />It's kind of like watching a good action B movie, entertaining, but that's about it.<br /><br />Chris spends a lot of time talking about himself and fellow SEALs - understandable, it's a book about a Navy SEAL.<br />However, his view of the whole war is very simplistic and one sided. He's quick to bad mouth other service members, but will waste no time about talking what a badass he is.<br />By his account, allegedly the SEALs win, or turn the tide, just about every battle single handedly.<br /><br />Quiet professional? Hardly.<br /><br />Thank you for your service & RIP.
B0083JCCX8|5.0|The Hunger games is addicting, I have to read the rest of the series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I admit that book was violent but, epic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00030DEQE|5.0|I bought this product to enable me to take advantage of increased internet speed from my ISP.  The product was easy to install and the results so far have met my expectations.  I would recommend this product to others.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought this book was cute. This book entertained me. I look forward to other books by this author.  GOOD BOOK!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|A fun game to pass the time. Worth downloading and checking out.<br />A game everyone will enjoy. Get it now.
1847670350|5.0|To have a book of this magnitude, from the first African American president, it's priceless. Good reading for my grandchildren.  What i don't appreciate, the request for a review, and then the annoying amount of words that only would be accepted. If i wanted to say GREAT that should do. I want be buying anything else from AMAZON.  I hope you have all those words.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I did not see this in theaters but everyone that saw it gave it rave reviews.  I liked all of the comic movies and here you get to have all of them working together.  This was very well done, glad I own it.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Does anyone know when this season will be available? I've always loved the show. And I am waiting for more-
B0058YPL66|5.0|This series is amazing on how it takes many different fairy tales and then adds slight twist to them so that they are all related in some way. It is a fairy tale for adults :)
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love the ability to see exactly how much battery I have left at any time in a very graphic way.  I also like that it tells me how much time I have left for all of the various activities (reading, watching videos, etc) and tells me how long it will take to charge the battery fully with whatever method I am using.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Couldn't make it through chapter 2. The writing/story is just too corny/juvenile. If you're past you're teens I'd adivse you to try the sample before buying.
B00APKIN1I|4.0|Real music, real recordings. No auto-tune. No drum reconstruction through triggers. This is the real deal. It's an appropriate title, Real to Reel. They take real music and wrap it up on the take up reel. Being a child of the analog world but living and working in the digital world, I appreciate the effort they've so obviously put into these recordings / songs.<br /><br />That all being said, they do lose one star for the loudness war.<br /><br />Dave, you stood up, shook your fist in the air and had a great idea: Make a rock record with some of the most influential people in music and do it on tape.<br />Then you stepped off the soap box and allowed the mastering engineers to have free reign over your mixes rather than demanding the dynamics be kept at their best.<br /><br />As much as I love this album, I would have a hard time turning it off if the dynamics were anything like I imagine them to be in the studio. Everything has been squashed to within 6db or so of actual range. That can be fatiguing.
0345803507|1.0|I was asked to read the trilogy for a book club. I couldn't make it past the first couple pages of Book One and decided to not bother with the last two. The writing was horrible, as if a high schooler wrote it. I don't judge those who loved it but the series wasn't for me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Price is cheaper then ITunes...great quality in the video. Ditched cable and this is a great way to keep up with just the shows I watch
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me love me so much more. I couldn't put it down after I began. Chbosky has a classic on his hand, one that is relevant across generations.What wallflower didn't love this book?
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I stumbled on this show by accident, but was truly glad that I did.  The acting and writing on this show are phenomenal, and you really don't come by quality shows like this much anymore.  I highly encourage anyone with the free Prime membership to take the time and watch it.  Fantastic!
0345803493|1.0|I was asked to read the trilogy for a book club. I couldn't make it past the first couple pages of Book One and decided to not bother with the last two. The writing was horrible, as if a high schooler wrote it. I don't judge those who loved it but the series wasn't for me.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I only jumped on the GoT bandwagon this year... but I am glad I did!!!  The character chapters really draw you in.  A book that will keep you up all night.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Helpful, but could use more examples. Have used Linux in the past so was familiar with the general layout. Thanks
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I loved the first three books, but now I am falling off the GoT bandwagon a little... I'm still excited for the series to start back up!  But with many of my favorite characters dead, the books just aren't appealing to me as much anymore : (
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|very good app and widget for less powerful tablet. if you have a less powerful tablet then this will work for you.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I only jumped on the GoT bandwagon this year... but I am glad I did!!!  The character chapters really draw you in.  A book that will keep you up all night.
B00003CXV4|5.0|Great service.<br />Fast and in great shape.  I loved the movie, so did my granddaughter. Now my friend is going to watch it.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I'm going to stick to using Pinterest on an actual computer.  App for kindle is not an functional.  Dont bother
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I tried this game on our WII and I loved it so much I had to get it for our kindle.  Makes you think.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Book made me tear up a couple times, but was still a book I recommend to everyone.  Loved it, will probably read again
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this book. So dramatic and touching. Also romantic. This is the best Book in history. Please im beging you to write another one. Im still singing the hanging tree and seeing prim dead and gale with another girl.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|The plot was weak, but the price was cheap. It's a good &#34;time killing&#34; movie, not too particularly interesting but something to do on a friday/saturday night at home.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its awesome I love horses I love this game I love the people who made this game and I'm doing it for the gems
B00AWD4KFQ|4.0|It was a good &#34;saturday night, popcorn on the couch&#34; movie. The ending felt a little &#34;rushed&#34; like maybe the producers ran out of money? It could've been a little better for the build up, all in all it was an entertaining movie for a great price and I didn't have to get dressed and go out.
B00881VLCE|4.0|it is sometime hard to see dark puzzle pieces, need to be able to change background color other than that it is a great game
B009VB97EY|5.0|This movie is exactly what you expect...FEMALE EYE CANDY! Channing Tatum yum yum yum! The plot....who cares....the story.....who cares....the ending...who cares....the price Totally Worth It!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great book for free. My mother and I read this book together when I was a child. Have re-read it many time.Read it with a child of your choice.
B009LGO88E|5.0|I decided to import the CPP from Japan to go with my US 3DS XL and I'm glad I did. It works perfectly with the domestic 3DS XL and really makes playing MGS3 so much better. The CPP is surprisingly light, and while it does add a lot of bulk to the already large XL it feels great in hand. I wish more games supported this accessory.
B004LX0D36|5.0|Great Jane Austen. Wonderful to have this book for free. The story is timeless and the theme is as vital today as it was in the 18th Century
0762777931|5.0|I adore Kris Carr! She is such an inspiration to me. I purchased a juicer in December of 2012 and I have been making her green juice twice a day everyday since January lost 20 lbs and still going. I had previously lost 65 lbs but with juicing and more exercise I am getting closer to my goal!
B005IQZB14|4.0|good writing, a little repetitious, I like adventure& testing myself, but reading this I knew I would never undertake a challenge such as this
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The Two Graves was everything I expected and much more, I am hopeful and anxious to read the next in the \\"Pendergast\\" series. It can't end here.  Thank you Amazon.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|A new twist on an old theme.  A white girl in slavery, a lot of stereotypes, entertaining reading for the most part
B0012FHGCW|5.0|This was a great movie. We're going to Alaska this May and decided to watch a movie involving AK. It did not disappoint. &#34;Happiness only real when shared.&#34;
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy has the exceptional ability, through great research to have an almost exceptional perception of the near future. I will read everything he writes and have read nearly all he has written.  Super read.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I enjoyed the story but it didn't really leave me with any strong feelings about the characters or their situations.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Just love this app. Great to kill time if you can get someone to play with you. The only thing is if you cannot use your bonus roll when it's offered to you, you lose it for that game.
B007712XAU|5.0|So glad I was able to buy the first two seasons on DVD.  I not always able to turn in to watch when it is on and don't like watching on line.  so glad I could buy them.  I watch them over and over.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Despite more than 1000 pages you will get so much interesting reding that you will try to read your book any time you have acces to it. I really love it even more than Plillars on Earh
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved this season.  I love all the characters and their development.<br />Can't wait to see what happens in the next season.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This just like Jewel quest. Love it<br />keeps me occupied when I am waiting to go somewhere on the train,
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is the very best Bond film ever - with an Oscar winning song to boot.  Daniel Craig is fabulous!!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have loved pac-man since it came out on Atari.<br />Cant get enough of it.<br />Like to try and beat those monsters but they are quick.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved it, got so involved with the characters, they were very human and with faults and all.  The best thing I can say is that I looked forward to the next episode.  I took a whole day off when sick and lived in the work of Lark Rise and Candleford.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I have seen this movie a number of times and I still think it's entertaining to watch. Not only that, I found it to be quite a food for thoughts on the idea of \\"seeing\\" what's next (seeing only two minutes ahead), and this film was slightly based on Philip K. Dick's short story \\"The Golden Man.\\"<br /><br />It sure does have a good plot with a lot of action scenes involved. I often find FBI agent Ferris (played by Julianne Moore) to be really too eager about Cage's character Cris Johnson's ability and I wasn't really sure about this character.<br /><br />Regardless, this film is entertaining and I've enjoyed seeing Nicolas Cage in action.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|My wife and I were curious about this movie having watched the original series back in the sixties.  The stellar cast was not enough to raise this above just okay.  Ads on TV lead you to believe it is more comedic than it is.  As with most movies, you need to see it for yourself and make your own decision.
1608955702|5.0|Once again, Neil writes an awesome book!  From beginner to advanced professional, EVERY wedding and portrait photographer should have this book.  He covers SO MANY different styles of lighting techniques and explains them with his signature no-nonsense approach.  He also consistently illustrates which equipment he is using so the reader is never unsure of how his examples were photographed.<br /><br />Neil has a way of teaching that is second to none and he WILL change your lighting for the better.  If you ever feel like you aren't in control of your lighting situation, can't get the looks you want, or just want some new lighting ideas, then this is the book for you.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Although it can be a bit slow developing show, the advantage of watching it on demand is fast forwarding through the slow parts.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|i didn't find it scary just kinda dragged on, it wasn't bad it's just one i wouldn't wanna see again
1451695195|5.0|Fabulous to read, especially from the viewpoint of a man of science. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I am in the free trial period of Prime and watched this on my PC.  I was a Great movie, but not sure if it will be enough to make me buy in to Prime,
B00328R21C|5.0|It came quicker than I thought it would, was in perfect condition, and the recipient had a smile as big as a 10-year old boy, even though he is an adult. Would definitely purchase Legos on here again.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and want to read it again.  I have it on my Kindle fire and have a trip planned and will read it again while traveling
B000VHMF0A|5.0|All the best of the best in this cd. Perfect compilation of Bob Marley, there are a lot of song...i love it!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This is what I was looking for when I downloaded Magic Piano.  I wish I could ask for songs I would like to play.  I would like to see printed music.
006117758X|4.0|This adolescent coming-of age is more memoir than novel.  However, Bukowski's writing style and voice is so resonant, defined and clear, that it is impossible to put down.  The ugliness of the body, the endless fights and friendships and family, the bloody noses and dirty cheap rental rooms filled with empty wine bottles, all make for an amazing narrative that stays with you and you continue to hear in your head.  Trans-formative, those beautiful lies.  A must read for any literature nut.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I cannot get my email.  I do not know what this is.  I might like it if I knew I had it or even what it is, or how to use it.  I am not computer savy.
B00APJLX8E|3.0|The movie was kind of cheesy and shallow due to &#34;modern teenage lingo&#34; in my opinion. Entertaining enough for my boys ages 7,6,4 though. Definitely not a classic but good enough for Friday movie night.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Great game. Awesome visuals and a lot of fun. It's definitely worth playing. I do wish it were longer though. The game had a great story.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I am very pleased with this item. It is well made and attractive. The red is a fun pop of color. Highly recommended!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Nonstop action amazing how well Rick Riordan mixed Greek and ROMAN  mythology with some of his own characters.<br />Such a great book
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't quite know what to expect from this based on what I had heard in the media.  Glad I gave it a try!  I ended up reading not just Fifty Shades of Grey but Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed all within one week.  I did not want to put the book(s) down because I had to know what was going to happen next!!  After finishing the trilogy, I decided to reread all 3 books again at a slower pace to pick up on small details that I had skimmed past during the first read.  Final thoughts:  The story, as a whole, was not what I had heard from people who obviously focus too much on things that are outside their comfort zone.  You will have to read the books for yourself because I don't want to ruin anything!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|A very fun and interesting piece of science fiction. A fun adventure yarn in the style of Starship Troopers, and also an interesting thought piece about mortality and aging.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I do not really know what I expected, but I found it boring. I never did finish the book. It really was not written in layman's terms and I found it far-fetched. I do believe in an afterlife, but this was not proof enough for me.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|I was sooo tired when we started this movie I couldn't keep my eyes open and started nodding off (not due to the movie) - however, about 5-10 min later I woke for a few moments (could've totally knocked right back out) and the movie held my attention.  I managed to make myself stay awake for the rest of the movie because I thought it was good and wanted to see it through.  Considering how exhausted I was (and on Benadryl) that must mean it was a good movie.  (I conked out again about 5 min. after the movie ended).<br /><br />TWICE, our lead character's life is treated as worthless and put in jeopardy by our government.  That's his reward for being a patriotic American serving his country.  And if you don't have your head in the sand and watch the news, we're bombarded daily with hearing about dirty/evil politicians screwing people over and playing with their lives without a care just because they can get away with it, you probably don't want to watch movies about it too - BUT the lead character was smart and skilled and worth watching - and YOU'LL LIKE THE END.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|I was not impressed by the highlights CD. The movie cut down the songs but the soundtrack left out huge chucks of music in the movie. Now I understand it is the highlights but even stage highlights have the whole song. The only part I really enjoyed was the new song \\"Suddenly.\\" Also not the be too condescending but Amanda Seyfired a little weak on the part of Cosette and her vibrato is out of control. Also the high C in \\"One Day More\\" is not in the soundtrack which kind of plays down that spectacular end of the first part of the movie. I was just disappointed after all fabulous cast recordings in the musical over the years it was a big let down. The complete cast recording may be better but this recording has convinced not to pay anymore money for something so medicore. I would not recommend buying this as a fan of Les Miserables. If you want a wonderful cast recording I would suggest the Original Broadway Cast, The Dream Cast 10th Anniversary or The Complete Symphonic Recording of Les Mis which has every bit of music the musical contains. Hugh Jackman was wonderful but he is no Colm Wilkinson who actually is on the soundtrack as the Bishop of Digne. Anne Hataway redition of \\"I Dremed a Dream\\" is wonderful in the movie but since she is crying throughout it sounds drab and a far cry from the big belting number as sung by Patti LuPone, Ruthie Henshall, and other stage Fantines. Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Aaron Tviet as Enjolras, and Samantha Barks as Eponine are the best part of the soundtrack, but again their parts on cut down because of the merciless buthering of the songs.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is a Great choice of movie . We enjoyed watching it a lot. Plot is awesome and so is the director. Based on a true story!
B0082SU98U|4.0|A beautiful little gem of feel good literature with an important message of how one person's attitude can improve an entire community.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Saw the original movie and loved it even though some parts were horrific. HAd to read the books and all three were excellent.
B00A88NZXS|1.0|Looks like would mention in Chinese , would have been nice to know<br />So if looking for English version do not recommend
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I really enjoyed finding out about the origins of the Spartan II program and John 117. I never really thought about how futile the war with the covenant really was until I read this book. The fight scenes are done so well that I feel like I am actually watching it happen. This book is a great buy if you love the Halo series or if you just love space fiction.
B000000OMP|4.0|Released in 1984, \\"Slide It In\\" was Whitesnake's breakthrough album here in the states. They had been recording and touring throughout England and the rest of the world regularly, but this put them on the map in the U.S.<br /><br />Even though these guys aren't technically considered a hair metal band, they sure looked and sounded the part. Whitesnake of course followed the Led Zeppelin path of \\"Bringin' Home The Blues,\\" more than partying like it was going out of style. Although it was their follow-up album that blew them up, \\"Slide It In\\" is a terrific piece of blues-rock music. Songs like \\"Slide It In,\\" \\"Slow N' Easy\\" \\"Love Ain't No Stranger,\\" are easily the highlights from the record, but the rest aren't terrible either.<br /><br />I can't say this essential or anything, but it is definitely worth checking out. I recommend starting with their 1987 self-titled album, but hey, whatever floats your ferry.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was a very good book, and well written. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. I will be reading more from this author.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|oldie but goodie. Lots of great recording on this cd. Brings back lots of memories. Glad I bought it and for 1.99!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really recommend this app because it never gets old or boring. It is a good game and I rate it five stars. I also recommend it because it is free and fun. Most apps that are good cost money but this is free. I really love animals and I like horses. This is the perfect app for me.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Nice story with a good feel to it, but disappointed in the real life outcome.  Recommend it for a good watery eye feeling.
0062014536|4.0|Requiem was a fine third installment to the trilogy.<br />The book was engaging and fast paced.<br />If you enjoyed the first two, you will enjoy (at least) most of this book<br /><br />NO SPOILERS<br />About the ending:<br />Many of the low reviews are because of the ending<br />Most of the book is very good<br />I was actually glad to hear that the ending wasn't any good before I finished it<br />While you read the book BE AWARE you may not like the ending<br />But don't let that spoil the rest of the book for you<br />It won't be such a big let down if you know it in advance<br />While the ending was EH for me<br />I didn't think it warranted pulling down the rating of the book for the most part<br /><br />Narrator was the same in all 3 books and did an excellent job
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Wish that I had gotten interested in this while it was still airing.  But the hype was true.  Great show.
B006O6F4O6|4.0|en calidad si esperaba un poco mayor en calidad en la moto, el muñeco muy durable y de calidad excelente solo la moto dejo un poco que desear
B002EXAB5K|5.0|Great movie, just simply amazing in hd. Highly recommended. The sorry line is great. Jack Black was excellent. Greatly satisfied
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This is definitely one of the most unique games I've ever played on a phone, being both simple to understand and charming in execution.  It would be a much better value at a lower price point, because there's really not much to it. Therein lies the beauty, of course, but it'd be nice if it were retailing for a more competitive price.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|i enjoy this game, but it also is wonderful to share with my kids.  They love the threeD artistry and finding the matching pieces. Their favorite thing to do is find one in front and one way in the back that match. =)
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Ever since I upgraded from a Galaxy S variant to a shiny new Droid DNA, I've been struggling to find a good match-3 style game that actually works properly.  A lot of them -- a lot of games in general -- simply don't work right on the massive 1080p screen.  This one does, sort of.<br /><br />Gameplay is fine, but the cutaways between levels don't play correctly.  The text appears to be completely masked, with only snippets of the right side of the screen partially visible. It's impossible to read whatever it is the characters are saying or follow the story.  Not that this is a dealbreaker, as the main appeal is the game, which works just fine.  The gameplay on this app is much better than the previous Playrix FAotD, Call of Atlantis.  Here, you can continue to manipulate the jewels/stones while others are being cleared off the screen.  It's a welcome change from the previous game's behavior.<br /><br />The graphics both in the cut scenes and in game play are very well done, as is the background music.  It seems Playrix takes pride in the way their games look and sound, and that's to be commended, even if it does take up 70 MB or more a pop while not being flawless in execution.  It's worth it for the quality, IMHO, and I can heartily recommend this if you're looking for a match-3 game with some pizazz.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I couldn't wait for this game to make it over to the Droid side! So far it has been worth the wait and the $2! Great game!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is so full of life lessons, i hope i can remember them all. It is so well written and tugs at your heart strings. A great read
0399160450|4.0|This book is as current as the headlines on your daily newspaper, where it seems there is a constant occurrence of this or that bank, business, or federal agency announcing that they have been subjected to some form of computer hacking. And not just by some precocious, unbalanced teenager, but as part of a coordinated, concerted effort by a quasi-military arm of the Chinese government. It is this basic idea that is at the heart of this new installment in the Jack Ryan (Sr. and Jr.) saga.<br /><br />Why a government would support such activities, given the obvious potential backlash, is, as usual for Clancy, given a very plausible background and reason. In this area this novel approaches the best of earlier Ryan novels, as the divisions and politics within the Chinese government are laid out with some excellent characterization of the major movers within that government, though they probably have no relationship to the real people and power structure that exists in the real world. This starting scenario does take a little while to be developed at the beginning of the book, making this early portion read a little slowly. But when the real action begins, it is near non-stop, all developing very logically from that starting position.<br /><br />The damage that can be caused by such attacks on a country's computer infrastructure are well detailed, and these items should be paid close attention to, as this threat is very real. How Jack Jr. and his team go about defusing this situation is, unlike some of the other later volumes in this series, full of real suspense, things that don't go off according to plan, and with a little more complex characterization of the major players, with a little more soul-searching and possible faults than has been typical of earlier volumes. As others have mentioned, there are a couple of continuity errors in names and family relationships from what has been presented earlier, but I don't think these harm the book to any large degree.<br /><br />A much better book than some of the other later volumes in this series, done well enough to once again make me happily anticipate whatever the next installment will bring.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)r />A much better book than some of the other later volumes in this series, done well enough to once again make me happily anticipate whatever the next installment will bring.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I had many interesting discussions with my spouse.  We don't have children yet, but the book inspired many ideas.  I recommend it.
B0065AVS0K|5.0|I first saw this movie several years ago. I expected to be mildly entertained. I ended up loving it. So, I rented it from Amazon.<br /><br />The dialogue is fun and dark at the same time. The visuals are interesting, disturbing and actually contribute to the feel of the movie. I will watch this several more times and, hopefully, enjoy it as much as I did today!!
B009VB97EY|3.0|Movie was entertaining,but not worth paying the regular ticket price at<br />the theater. I could have waited until it's showin HBO or Netflix.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|It takes a little while to get into, but once it gets going you won't want to put it down. Almost as crazy and twisted as Gone Girl.
B009IKKYOK|5.0|It is mellow, diversified, lovely. Just what I was looking for. I use it on my 2 year old's &#34;sleep playlist&#34; and it works great.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A great story and a great book, I am writing more words because you cannot get away with stating the obvious, this book was free even better
B0044C3RB4|3.0|i enjoyed the plot, but would not watch it over and over. I liked the twist at the end. it was enjoyable
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Very entertaining.  I really enjoyed the story and the characters.  The settings were amazing and really got the imagination going.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a very well made show with great characters and wonderful special affects.  I am a big fan of the books and the series...I am hooked!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun and real. the horses don't look fake and you actually get to twin them yourself love this game!!!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Since it was cartoon characters, I was expecting less, but was very impressed with the way the movie was put forth. I did not want to pause at all. I wanted to see what happened. Very refreshing way for entertainment.
B0013FNC38|4.0|Whether listening to escape, walk, write, search for meaning in the lyrics, &#34;We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things&#34; provides entertainment by way of Jason Mraz's soothing voice. We all listen to his music for our own reasons and he somehow provides for each of us just what we need.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved it, couldn't stop watching until the last scene was over, then I wanted Season 4.  A great program and very easy to get hooked.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I am not a fan of science fiction, however, The Night Circus uses a sort of soft science fiction, leaving the reader to figure out the characteristics of the &#34;circus&#34;. This is much more than just a novel about a circus, however, and as the story unravels, the reader finds himself drawn into the stories being told and wanting to find out what will be the outcome of each of the characters.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Great APP, My sons parents and outlaws love this game. challenging and fun for all ages. This APP is definately a steal at $1.99 !!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|New doctor has a lot of spunk. Special effects much better than old series. Miss K-9 though, he always added something to the story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit I am very hesitant about reading series, they generally start off with a bang and slowly burn themselves out. I bought just the first Wool book thinking that it wouldn't amount to much....boy was I wrong....After finishing book 1<br />I immediately bought the rest of the series and I am IMPATIENTLY (yes I said impatiently) waiting on Dust to release this year! Congratulations to Mr. Howey with all his success .....you definitely deserve it..<br />And let's keep our fingers crossed that the movie does the books justice ;)
B0042OZDQG|3.0|This CD is okay.  Especially for only 30 songs from the guitar virtuoso Satch.  I have started to develop bigger taste in Joe Satriani and it turns out that the songs listed as well as the mastering is better on the anthology set over this one.  I still do not regret buying this though, I am always willing to pay supports to this awesome dude.  lol
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater and I knew as soon as it was  released on DVD I was going to purchase it...well I decided it was time to start my collection of digital movies ...yea I know I am starting a little late.....but I have to say I am very pleased....so anyway back to the movie...Disney does it again...this is a wonderful family movie...
B000000WFU|5.0|Each song is worth listening to and I will get every CD this group put out. Songs are great for exercising, dancing, singing and is my constant companion on a long drive.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I personally enjoy chick flick/romance novels. Safe Haven definitely fits the bill. It's a quick and easy read. I would recommend for a rainy day or relaxing in the sun.
B004YXE438|5.0|Just one more. That is what you will find yourself thinking. It is great fun and the pictures are gorgeous. There are some that are difficult and some that are easy no matter what level you select. Well worth the money.
B009FZFONO|5.0|What can I say except that it gets more interesting and the writers seem willing to take some serious broad strokes with the story and cast. Keep it up!<br /><br />CJ
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This movie was thrilling.  Even though I knew how it ended,  I was on the edge of my seat as they were leaving town.  Another great Ben Affleck movie.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|Searching capabilities seem to be missing.  Cannot set location for planning advance trips.  Look forward to next version. Maybe they will add those later.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Best scene in this movie is the parade scene.  Ferris Bueller your my hero.  It is a classic 80's movie.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Why aren't you watching it already? It's a great great show. The actors are believable and the overall adaptation is stelar. Watch them all. now.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Not since Dave Mathews has such a fresh talent come along, hopefully he'll keep crank out music for many years
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This company has a real grasp on what users need when inputting text. Powerful,  intuitive, responsive and accurate. It feels smooth and fast. I am entering text faster than ever and with  far fewer mistakes.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book was very helpful. I didn't realize it was that easy to get a book on sell. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a book out there!
B007THA4FI|3.0|This was a good read once you get into it. It took the first third until you knew who all the characters are. Once into it, you must finish to know how everyone's story turns out, but it's a sad premise around a death of a man and how those around him live. Also, the middle class vs the lower class and the struggles that puts upon children. Tough basis, but overall good book. I never reed any Harry Potter, but this must be a totally different genre!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|DragonVale is an awesome game but their are many problems. Firstly prices are outrages most dragons cost gems which are extremely expensive ; most dragons cost 50 gems which costs 1.99$ U.S dollars .Secondly time limits are 10 hours to 24 hours depending on the dragon being hatched or habitat being built. And thirdly leveling up is very hard, first 6 levels are easy but after that it gets harder. So if you are filthy rich than this game is for you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After seeing a review of this series in the Washington Post last week, I was happy to see it listed in the Kindle store; actually it's cheaper now than when I bought it seven days ago! I read it in every spare moment I could find and finished it today. While the basic premise will be familiar to any science fiction fan, the quality and detail of Howey's writing and the believability of his characters make this a truly exceptional work. I hope he is busy on the sequel, since I want to know what happens next!<br /><br />Any reader who likes \\"real\\" sci-fi, as opposed to the \\"Lords, Ladies, and Dragons\\" fantasy world genre often mislabeled these days as Science Fiction, should read this book.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|A decent futuristic picture, and at least as good as the original from the 90s.  Colin Farrell is good in his role, as his Kate Beckinsale (who is married to the director).  Jessica Biel did not have much to work with in the script.  Not a waste of money at 3-4 bucks, but definitely would not recommend that you purchase your own copy.
B007PFDJH4|1.0|This book really has no redeeming features and is not worth reading. The story line is weak and it is not particularly well written
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Nice series. Streaming is smooth. I did not watch while it was airing on TV, so I am glad to be able to do so this. Seeing how Star Fleet came into being is interesting and add to the mythos.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is by far the best album I have bought in years. I have become an instant fan. and its even cooler that I used to live 2 blocks from him in Seattle and never heard of him.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Very cute game, and addicting.  I'm 26 and even I enjoy it. Recommend this to anyone, all ages. At least download it and give it a try.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|Great movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone  it reminds me of all my friends in college. How close we were and how we depended on each other for everything. Hoe close we were
B002JODPSO|5.0|Lots of action and thought provoking. The stunts are a little unrealistic since the bad and good guys survive without injuries, but did not take away from the fun factor
B00797MB0O|2.0|This movie was another one that was touted highly in the previews upon release, and failed to deliver upon viewing. Put simply: It looked funny in the previews and turned out to suck terribly. I only gave the extra star because I like Charlize Theron.
1439170916|5.0|Just an amazing understanding of our journey and battle with Cancer.......<br />So much none of us really knew until now.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have not used other alarm apps but I will not try others out now because I have this one. It is very customizable and can save multiple alarms to use when needed. It is very easily used also.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|This was one of his finest movies and his character &#34;Sam&#34; was intense but very funny....and of course sexy in the &#34;clay scene.&#34; Demi and Whoopie bounced off each delightfully, and almost had me wanting to yell, &#34;Believe her!&#34; When Oda Mae was outside her door. This is one of the all-time top &#34;Classics&#34; and never gets old. Patrick, how we miss you, but thank you for leaving us with so many brilliant movies to remember you by. Demi & Whoopie were excellent choices for the roles they played as well.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|fun game. you can play for as long or as short as you wish. simple easy to play and addicting.
0375714839|5.0|If you don't know nothing about Iran and their religion you should read this book.<br />It's great not just because you can understand the importance of the culture on the way a society lives, but to see how is difficult for teenagers to grow up.<br />It's not only a book about Iran or the religion, it's a book of a common girl with the same problems any teenager has when  growing up.<br />Terrific!<br />I really love it. And I'm going to by the movie now.<br />Enjoy
B003Q6D1YW|1.0|If you want to waste 87 minutes of your life that you can never get back, by all means watch Catfish. There's so much not to like, starting with the fact that the movie/documentary is NOTHING like the trailer. I'm still waiting for something interesting to happen, as promised in the trailer. Also, someone made a mistake with the description they used on the DVD package: I believe the words they meant to use are \\"boring\\", \\"pointless\\", \\"foolish,\\" and \\"annoying.\\" Unless of course you want to watch filmmaker and lead \\"actor\\" Yaniv Schulman spend an hour and a half mugging for his own camera. How arrogant! Forget Catfish - it's less thrilling than watching them change the prices at your local Wal-Mart.
B00006AW63|1.0|I purchased this movie for my daughter as a surprise gift while my husband and I were on vacation.  I was extremely disappointed when I got home to find out the dvd wouldn't play because of &#34;regional errors&#34; ~ my daughter was so sad.  I believe this seller is extremely rude to sell to USA customers without coming clean about this.....they know exactly what they are doing.  Dishonest people SUCK!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Fair read.  Detailes infinite.  Dominoes slowly but surely.  Not the best Grisham I've read and I've read them all.  Could put this one down for a while and read in bits.  Others read in one sitting.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|A super app.  Found and automatically connected to an open router at an out of town hotel within about 30 seconds..
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|***I was provided a free copy of this work in exchange for an honest review.***<br /><br />Everville is incredibly unique in every way, so if you're growing bored with the thousands of stories we've all read in a thousand forms, I recommend you give this a read for a refreshing change of pace. A somewhat sheltered group of college freshmen (their maturity level seems more like pre-teens) is unexpectly drawn to a magical world where a battle between good and evil rages: Everville. If evil wins in this other world, it's only a matter of time before it consumes our world as well. Meet the completely original races of beings inhabiting Everville; they're like nothing we've ever seen!  Only the humans can protect them and defeat the darkness, but do today's kids have what it takes?  The only way to find out is to read!<br /><br />It's not an easy feat to combine the modern world with the fantasy world of magic.  Most others prefer to set their stories in one place or the other, so I admire the courage it took to attempt this particular story. I did find certain aspects a bit awkward and clumsy, as if the author couldn't come up with a logical way to integrate things and instead just stuck them in with no transition or explanation as to how. One example of this is the oblivion of many people of our world who are close to and even involved in magical events. It's unreasonable that they would not notice or question these experiences.<br /><br />My thanks to the author for releasing a revised edition, and SHAME on the \\"editing\\" company that charged him an insane price for their services - yet neglected to correct Hundreds of errors and typos! Now that these errors are corrected, I can say I believe Everville has the potential to become one of the greatest YA sagas in recent decades.<br /><br />It's difficult to assign just one genre to the story. There's an innocence which suggests its target audience is YA/children, so I'm going with that. What I mean by \\"innocence\\" is there is no sexual content, no foul language, nothing explicit. Even during war, violence is kept to a minimum, focusing on the hero's emotions rather than describing any brutality. Everville is an adventure even preschoolers could enjoy.e is no sexual content, no foul language, nothing explicit.

B0094K1QR8|4.0|The movie was laugh out loud funny and I enjoyed it. Just when I thought I knew what would come next it was surprisingly different.
0439023513|4.0|My thoughts while reading this final installment in the much-lauded trilogy were mixed. On the one hand, it's much less focused than its predecessors, Katniss is much less personally dynamic, and the relationships are much less satisfying. As I neared the end, I was desperately pulling for a happy ending, but when I actually closed the book, I realized it couldn't have been more perfect.<br /><br />On the surface, this is yet another YA story about an angsty teen triangle: female heroine is thrust into trying events that help her choose between her two hunky suitors. So right up to the end, there was a part of me that was expecting the ending to be classic YA romance. But that's not what this trilogy is about at all.<br /><br />Although I love that the YA slant makes these stories so accessible, it's also something of a shame that they have to be YA. Because, really, they're not. Katniss's story isn't about being an angsty teen. It isn't about the traumas and trials of somehow falling in love with two guys at once. This is a story about war, and Collins consistently refuses to allow her characters to fall into stereotypes.<br /><br />Nowhere is this more evident than in this final book. At this point, we might expect Katniss to start acting like the standard hero. She's the Mockingjay, she's the superhero, she takes charge, plans the battles, fights the battles, and just generally wins the war singlehandedly. That's what we see all the time in the movies, so that's naturally what we expect.<br /><br />But what Collins gives us is a starker reality: a seventeen-year-old girl scarred by violence, death, and manipulation. She's not a hero. She's not going to take charge. She's a pawn from start to finish, and all she can do is try to survive and stay sane. The events that take place in these stories aren't the kind that build young love; they're the kind that tear relationships apart. And that's what we see. They're not the kind that lead to happy endings, even after they end the way we want them too. And that's what we see.<br /><br />I cruised through this book pretty blithely. I was totally unprepared for the shattered feeling at the end when I closed the back cover. It's not a perfect book and not a perfect trilogy. But I take my hat off to Collins for her guts, her honesty, and her refusal to bow to stereotypes and expectations.hey end the way we want them too.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just finished the Triology and now understand what \\" all the fuss \\" was about.  What a great heroine Katniss  is .. fierce yet true to the fragile being in all of us.  Five stars for Suzanne Collins and her \\" cast \\".
B00BHMF578|5.0|The Academy got it right on best picture this year.<br />They missed on Ben Affleck's efforts both as a director and actor.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Just what I wanted for my Kindle Fire!  Very cool to wake to my music. Love the blue digital numbers and all the options.
B008O037RG|2.0|I fell in love with The Boxer and I was disappointed that they didn't include it on the vinyl. The rest of the album is okay but my heart was really excited over a song that wasn't delivered :(
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Movie was fantastic. Yes is it dramatized but it is still a fantastic movie with real historical footage included. Definitely a must see.
B002YVAT72|4.0|Nice to play the old vinyl's once in a while. Not sure about the computer interface, have not tried it.  Looks complicated though with a PC.  Haven't tried it because who wants recordings with static.
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|Sinister is another cookie cutter horror movie with a couple of original ideas in between a boatload of clich&eacute;s. The original ideas are pretty entertaining and the ideas for murder are pretty neat but all in all it's pretty much the same stuff we've seen before.<br /><br />You have a true crime writer who moves into a house once owned by a family that was slaughtered by a killer and, of course, now crazy things begin to happen. The reason the family doesn't move immediately is because the writer is more obsessed about his book than the well-being of his family. More things happen and couple predictable twists happen and I won't give anything away but the building suspense leads to exactly where you'd think it'd be an hour into it.<br /><br />I watched this alone at night and it wasn't very scary. The scenes that were supposed to make you jump didn't and the gruesome scenes that were supposed to make you cringe only made you slightly uncomfortable.<br /><br />The soundtrack was amazing though and I'll look into buying that cause it very unsettling and entertaining. The acting was as good as it needed to be and the cinematography was also well done.<br />If you're not used to horror movies it'd probably be a lot of fun but seasoned film watchers aren't going to be too impressed.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Was interesting that this story was told.  A lot of good  men have sacrificed for our country and the warriors are not recognized.  Was glad Chris shed some light  on  our service men.
B005LAIHCM|3.0|This fairly unoriginal movie had some great acting, some great twists but was forgettable. Jennifer Lawrence is, of course, amazing and top notch and truly saves the movie, without her I'm fairly certain this movie would have fell flat on its face.<br /><br />I was expecting to hate this movie, it looked awful from the previews, no one had said anything good about it and it just didn't sound that interesting. However, I redboxed it to give it a try and found myself a little surprised by how good it turned out to be. The plot starts out standard enough but becomes more original as it goes on and even has a few things that happen that I didn't see coming but beyond the few twists and great acting from Lawrence the rest of the movie is pretty forgettable. the main reason to watch this movie is for Lawrence  because of her acting as well as her character who refreshingly is more than just female fodder for a deranged screenwriter.<br /><br /> I watched it two days ago and am having trouble remembering anything else that is significant but if you set the bar low and rent it for a dollar like I did then it's pretty good for a one time watch. I would have been displeased if I paid more or bought it.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I would have preferred a book written by professional writer. This book included way too many accounts of how amazingly superhuman the author is! I certainly admire and respect what he and his colleagues have done, but it got quite tiresome to have him continually pat himself on the back. Again, job well done but not well written.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great Game, My Wifes Addicted!!! She got Mad When she couldnt beat Flow Free. So I downloaded the Sequel, Bridges LOL
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|Movie was not very exciting.  The story needed to be developed more.<br />In fact the movie was boring.  Too much time spent in the academy.  Waiting for cadets to be assigned to the other planets.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I love the price of this item instead of paying for the stroller brand drink holder.  I'm not sure that it is perfect for my CS Double stroller, but it works and can be adjusted based on what I need to use it for.

This is definitely a great Disney classic to own and share with your family.<br /><br />That said, wow, the quality of the picture on the blu-ray disc is amazing. I love that Disney has gone through and done a really thorough job of remastering these older classics, rescanning the original film and cleaning up the picture. I'm really glad that I decided to get the Blu-ray/dvd combo instead of just the dvd set.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|i love it.  I was able to down load all my contact to the Iphone in few seconds. Thanks .

B000FCKC4C|5.0|I need to read this book for English and thought it was going to be a total drag. Then I started reading it. I absolutely fell in love. This book was well worth reading and I see myself reading this again.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I bought this book to continue the series, but frankly I am beginning to find the lack of confidence and poor mes a bit boring. Steamy scenes still nice, but hard to read in between. An ok book.
B005KELQEU|4.0|Use it all the time, when I carry my kindle around. Great protection for kindle. However, has not space for carrying kindle cable or chargers.,Also, would have preferred something like a band to hold the kindle, so it doesn't just fall out, or even a sleeve so i can read in the case.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|I was excited to try this game, I live match 3 games. I saw the review about the size of the file but didn't think much for it since I move them to my SD card.  But since this one doesn't give the option of moving to my card, I had to uninstall it...  If the option to move to SD card becomes available i will reinstall.
B009L32R5I|5.0|Many of the original Genesis songs, from the final studio releases to the live recordings are very close cousins. This collection of music is fresh and feels more re-imagined than re-visited. After listening a few times, then going back and listening to the old Genesis recordings, it's now fun to have a choice!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Its what I wanted and it meets all my expections that I expected it would. I love it very much.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loves the book so much. I read this one faster than all of the other ones. It was really good to read about the characters that were left out of the last book. Can't wait for the new to come out
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Book 2 just as good as the first. I can't wait to read the 3rd to see what happens next.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|This book got me back to where I needed to be but didn't know how-to get there.<br /><br />I will share this with my husband, son and  my friends.  I just pray they utilize it to its fullest potential.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and for all those people out there who love horse's then this is the game for them. What do you think?
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Case is really nice.  I like that the case is stable when open and does not slip.  Auto sleep is also a nice feature.
B0042VJSVU|5.0|I love this flash. The TTL is awesome. Great for manual off camera flash too. Great range from 1/1 -&#62; 1/128 w/ 1/3 stops all the way through. Its made by Nikon, comes with a difuser, and two gels, a stand and a nice case. This is a brilliant flash. I only have a d3200 so I cant quite use all the options this flash offers yet. But I would definitely recommend this flash
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I remember my third grade teacher Mr. Steve Cooper from Pick Elementary school in Ft. Leonard Wood read the book to the class.  I became a life long Fantasy fan that year.  More awesome than that was the animated version of The Hobbit and Return of the King.  I was like WOW this is amazing.  When I found out that Peter Jackson was going to make a live action Lord of the Rings I was kind of apprehensive.  How could he do the source material justice?  I was really surprised by how INSANELY AWESOME that trilogy was and I couldn't WAIT for him to get his hands on The Hobbit.  Well it turned out even better than I could have hoped.  The movie was awesome...the special effects were amazing.  It wasn't just like I pictured it in my head while listening to my teacher read....IT WAS BETTER.  Thanks Mr. Jackson...and thank you Mr. Cooper.
1451627297|5.0|I like Stephen King novels..<br />Not finished but love it so far.<br />Bought as a gift but had to read it first.!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Jumped around a bit, often to its detriment. Detail oriented origin, but style becomes more existential..not sure if it was necessary
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love it when the monkey jumps on your back. I hope other people like this game. Oh I almost forgot! It is not a scary game and it is fun<br />:)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book. Very inspiring. Loved how this book used real life scenarios versus over dramatic made up high school drama. Learned a lot about myself while reading this.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Exciting book. The story had vivid descriptions of the hero in many different adventures. Fast paced settings which kept me interested the entire book.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|costs money to do anything that needs to be done. play is very slow. even my five year old got impatient.
034580404X|5.0|i loved the books<br />they were easy to get into and finish quickly<br />i have been recommending them to everyone i speak to
B004I744AS|4.0|I chose this rating because it is great to have any dictionary! I haven't used it much yet, but it looks good so far.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Stephen Chbosky directed and adopted the screenplay from his own novel.  Like many first time writing/directing efforts this one is no doubt a labor of love, years in the making.  And well worth the wait.  The high school outsider coming of age film has been done hundreds of times, but probably never quite as well.  There's plenty of humor, pathos, heartbreak, redemption and sadness.  My concern was that it would become too sentimental and over-the-top sappy considering the problems and emotional situations the characters go through.  Thanks to clever writing and excellent acting, it's not a problem.  Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, and especially Ezra Miller are terrific.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I must have purchased close to $100 worth of various styluses for my 3rd generation iPad, and this is hands down the best one I've come across. Believe me, I've tried just about all the big-name popular ones out there, and this is the best. I purchased mine last June (2012), and in the last month the rubber coating on the shaft has started deteriorating. When using the stylus for writing or drawing, I notice black rubber on my finger nail and on my finger, and sometimes I see it rubbed in areas on my desk or iPad. That rubber must come with a very thin coating of some sort, and it's obviously broken down but isn't visibly noticeable so you wouldn't know it was a problem without the evidence it leaves behind. I'm thinking about buying plastidip or some other product to give it new life, but because it leaves such a mess on my hands that I've been forced to not use it anymore. Such a shame, because this is the best stylus available.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is very useful app especially for advanced user likes to deal with files directly. The user interface design is as good as any other file app available on Android.
B0038QN2AS|5.0|If you have any interest in technology or the connected Web this is the book for you! What starts out as an interesting hacker thriller quickly turns into an action orientated technology packed adventure novel.<br /><br />Treats the reader as an intelligent computer literate audience & doesn't hold back on describing the technology at play.<br /><br />Give me my HUD classes I'm joining the darknet!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have not had time to use this app much, but so far it has been a reliable, well-designed calculator.
B004GWW5HE|1.0|There's a difference between being funny and being stupid.  This movie was merely 'stupid.'  I suppose if you were intoxicated enough you might have thought it was funny, but if you're sober I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch it.  It wasn't funny.  It was a complete waste of time.  I would have given it zero stars if that were an option.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Truly inspiring! Helps you find Faith in life again and in people and learn to follow your heart for it will always lead you right
1616612096|3.0|An average expansion with a couple of decent cards (Winter Festival Drowned Prophet and Palace Spy spring to mind). I am just not all that into these packs and would probably suggest those on a limited budget to skip the series and go for the Brotherhood, Raven's, King's Landing or Beyond the Narrow Sea...
1250006341|4.0|A very well-done job of text, information, pictures. Only unavoidable negative: covers only part of the story. We await the next stage with excitement.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an excellent series. I love the story lines. Maggie Smith is a classic. She deserves all the awards that she wins for this role.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is another version on a match three/four game similar to Bejeweled and Candy Crush.  It has just enough story to make things interesting.  I finished the game within a few days; my son found it a bit longer-lived.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|This movie was very good!  Well worth watching<br />Great acting and good story - entertaining and makes you fell good!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I adore Johnny Depp. Most of his characters are really strange. He makes a film interesting or funny.<br />This film is no different. I might not have seen this had it not been for Mr. Depp.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book started off really slow at first for me.  As I read on, I couldn't put it down.  I didn't expect the twist and it kept me going!  Great read!
B00APUQJLO|2.0|Although I like david I did not like the story. It didn't keep my interest.  I would never recommend this to anyone.
B001O80G60|5.0|its pantera, I mean does it really need a review.  I love that albums are usually sooo much cheaper than on iTunes but still compatible.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I liked the rest of the batman movies but this was disappointing. The acting was good but the story line<br />was not. It didn't keep my interest at all. I would not recommend this.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|its smashing pumpkins so is it really going to be bad. I like to actually touch my music when it comes to the good stuff.  its the 90s in me I suppose.  buy it buy it buy it
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This was sooo funny. I've always love the characters. It was a joy to watch and knowing the characters helps<br />to really enjoy it.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|great album.  nice to hear real rock n roll after all the bulls*** that has come out of the 2000's
1475972350|5.0|If you love murder mysteries, I highly recommend reading this one.  It is well-written, fast-paced and exciting.  It's a hard book to put down!  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to the next one!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Once I figured out how to use it - i &#34;PIN&#34; things to my boards very often, sometimes daily! LOVE IT!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved it. Was so into this book I was unable to put it down. Definitely a must read for everyone.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Great game,I recommend it for others to buy, my son loves this game,he plays it often I have to te
B00589BMF0|5.0|I got my wife to watch the first one, and she loved it (and does not like horror), this one was equally well recieved, and she marvelled at the difference between them.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I am not very happy with the Weather Channel on my Kindle Fire. Unable to move the map around, expand, or shrink the display to include more or less area or zoom in on a section.
B002S45V32|4.0|I love this movie, as a matter of fact I love all the cheesy 80's movies! This is a good movie if you are familiar with it , however if you aren't into these type of movies I think you may find it boring.
B007IK44CK|4.0|the franchise still trying to recover for how bad mi2 was is back to originality this round.  The costume designer dressed TC perfectly and gave us all a lot to look at
B009POCG2C|5.0|Well worth the wait. I am a big Clint fan and almost every movie he does is to my liking.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I don't review many of the books that I read but I definitely couldn't put this one down. Couldn't wait to read what was going to happen next. Excellent story about a true American hero and his sacrifices for his country... Must Read!
B00355L2TU|4.0|Very good work out.  Even if i only do 10-15min because that is all i can do) of the routine i still feel it.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Absolutely love this cd. Bruno is an amazing artist. I love all types of older kinds of music. He has everything from old funk type of songs such as Money Make Her Smile to 50s inspired songs like If I Knew and he infuses it with his own twist. I can't really describe it. It is so different from music that is out today. My favorite song is Gorilla & of course Locked Out of Heaven. Get this cd!!!!!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome game. It keeps my daughter busy for hours.  At last peace and quiet. It also inspires her creativity which is wonderful.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|I think this may be only my third cd I own from Rhianna, but this is by far my favorite. I love Pour it up, Loveee Song, Stay, Get it over with, & No Love Allowed but I can listen to the entire album and not skip any songs. I find that hard to do with music today. Love this cd very much.
0788859544|5.0|The movie was delivered on time, brand new quality, my daughter loves it! Classic disney princess, much better color and quality then the old vhs we had.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Hands down, this is THE best debut CD from an AI winner (sorry, Kelly). In fact, it's so cohesive, I'd swear it's a promising new artist hitting the airwaves, not the latest from 19 Entertainment. I guess there was a need for just one more WGWG.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This movie came quickly, my daughter is in love, she always wants to watch &#34;belle&#34;. This was my favorite movie as a child, it's nice to pass that down to my daughter ;)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is really fun and very addicting.  Many hours have been wasted playing this game.  I enjoy it :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is awesome ! I don't regret downloading it one bit .. Now I have everything needed in my kindle it is now like my bible I don't leave home without it , lol...
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I didnt like the Facebook app.  I would rather just access it through the web on the Kindle.  It works better.
B004SDEP38|5.0|This app is awesome ! I don't regret downloading it one bit .. Now I have everything needed in my kindle it is now like my bible I don't leave home without it , lol...
B005HSL626|3.0|When I use this app most of the time it freezes.  But playing the game is a lot of fun!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|You have so many choices here. One choice has 5 or 6 set-ups that you play at the same time, using matches from any board.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|When I use the app it freezes most of the time or doesnt connect to the Kindle app store.  But playing it is a lot of fun!
B00942X8PY|4.0|This looks easy, but it is a bit deceiving!  Fun to try get on the first try, but you do get more chances.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|This game is over 80MB, and is not movable to the SD card.  There's no good excuse for ANY game to not be movable, but in this game's case, I can't dedicate 20% of my phone's storage to a single app.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great service and selections, the cherry on the top... multiple devices!<br />Can't get any better than that.  Also,  the choice to stream or download on your device...
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game to pass the time. Levels can be short so easy to stop anytime if interupted or on the go. Free flow bridges slightly more challenging.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|I have to be logged in to the Amazon Appstore to play music stored on my phone??<br />I don't think so.  Back to WinAmp for me.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've been using Facebook for a few years now on my Kindle,phone and home computer so you can obviously see that it's a favorite of mine.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I really liked this movie it has a lot of action some good fights and most of the movies that have Jeremy Renner in it are always great and this one was also so watch this video and more with Jeremy Renner
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I cannot play it on my Kindle Fire HD. Game goes through loading screen but stops running when the intro begins to play.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Have loved the batman movies Christopher Nolan has directed. Story is intense and not predictable. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the violence.
B00BA5H3TU|5.0|Lighter on the metal side than their previous work, if I had to describe Shrine of New Gen Slaves in one word it would be: groovy.<br /><br />Riverside has always had a jazzier, smoother aspect within their prog rock/metal style, but now it's more focuses and refined. They just keep slightly altering and improving their style in each release<br /><br />The result is another unique and amazing album from the prolific Polish proggers, a must buy for the music enthusiast.
B007SGM084|4.0|Although the main characters are addicted to each other at an unhealthy level the love/sex story is great! Something you can read over and over.
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|Really well done.  I have seen them all, all the versions.  This one not only looks great, but the artistic styling, the movement, the dancing like a stage show is lovely and romantic. The story really draws you in after 30 minutes and then it's quite wonderful.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Even though I ordered the &#34;Sunshine Kids&#34;, got the &#34;Diono&#34; instead, I am ok with the product. It is very easy to use and helps me a lot when using the stroller. I can fit one bottle for my baby and one for me, plus my cell phone and probably one more toy... that's about it.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|I have no idea how this ended up getting nominated for an Oscar.  Denzel was good however the story was very unsavory for me. They should have just named this &#34;Addict&#34; and left the pilot storyline and anything to do with an airline out of it.  All the sex, the dumb drug dealer character - all very lame and unsatisfying.
B009YX02T8|5.0|This soundtrack is great love every single song on it!!! :) I recommend this album.Love the piano song it's beautiful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that mine craft was the best known game for me. I play it every day that I am aloud
B008YW5RH2|4.0|My father is addicted to this tennis game. Playing it with a tiny screen is boring but when you get something worth playing it on, it becomes a much, much better experience!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I had really been looking forward to seeing this movie.  I am always impressed with Denzel Washington's performances.  This one didn't fail to impress.  It is not the feel good movie of the year, but it is a riveting story with excellent acting.  Definitely worth watching!
B007SGM084|4.0|Loved the book's, kept me wanting to read more. Although I must say it kinda dragged towards the end but great overall.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|We rented this just as a cute family movie night movie.  I had wanted to see it but didn't have high expectations.  The movie starts off slow, but then really draws you in.  The music and graphics are great and the integration of old video game characters is very creative.  In the end the story pulled me in and I felt moved by the movie.  A great movie to share with the family!
B00101ZOTA|5.0|I have repurchased the Blue ray copy. This is one of my choice as one of the best movies ever.
0446547573|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a bestselling romance author with a dedicated following. Safe Haven is not his latest publication as it was released in 2010, but it has had a resurgence of interest since the book was made into a movie this year.<br /><br />After suffering years of physical and emotional abuse from her husband, Katie Feldman has managed to escape the marriage with the hope of starting a new life. After bouncing from state to state, she decides to stay awhile along the coast of North Carolina in Southport.<br /><br />However, Katie is all too aware her stay may only be temporary as she must hide from her unstable police detective husband. Kevin. Although she lives in constant fear of being found, Katie manages to find a job as a waitress and she finds a place to call her own, a small cottage nestled in a secluded part of the town where she can maintain her privacy and heal from her physical and emotional scars.<br /><br />Katie isn't looking to make friends or to become a part of the community. Her goal in Southport is to remain as inconspicuous as possible and save money in case she needs to run again. Her isolation is short-lived when Jo moves in next door and slowly eases her way into Katie's life. Through her caring and supportive nature, she coaxes Katie into revealing bits about her past.<br /><br />Another Southport resident, Alex, also seems determined to become a part of Katie's life. Alex is a widower with two small children who owns a country store on the outskirts of town. He cannot help but notice the lovely Katie whenever she stops by the store to shop. Alex is curious about Katie's skittish nature and evasiveness when he tries to engage her in conversation. He senses Katie wants to be friendly but is too scared to do so. During one of her visits, Katie intervenes when Alex's son becomes endangered. Her involvement during this crisis causes Alex and his children to reach out to Katie, to encourage her to become a part of their lives.<br /><br />This is a big step for Alex, since he is only now beginning to consider getting involved with another woman since his wife died. But Alex sees something in Katie, and although he knows she has secrets, he still wants to take a chance with her to see where the relationship will take them.<br /><br />The pacing of the novel is slow in order to show the development of Katie's relationship with Alex and his children. As they get to know each other, their mutual attraction grows, and Alex's children are accepting of Katie, and she comes to care for both them.  Yet, Katie is still afraid to become too involved with this family because of the dangers from her past. Early in the relationship, she tells Alex, \\"...I do want to see you and it scares me because I know deep in my heart that you deserve someone better. You deserve someone you can count on. Someone your kids can count on. Like I said, there are things you don't know about me.\\"  Katie doesn't think Alex will want to continue their relationship once he knows the truth, but she believes that Alex deserves to know about her past. The flashbacks to significant episodes in Katie's marriage describe a vibrant woman who eventually crumbles under the control of a selfish husband who uses criticism and violence to keep his wife submissive. Although, she has been traumatized from the marriage, Katie is a survivor, a strong character who refuses to succumb to a life of pain and loneliness.<br /><br />To Katie's surprise, Alex is understanding and even accepting of her situation and vows to keep her secrets in order to keep her safe. Alex is an admirable man who isn't afraid to put his heart out there for the woman he has grown to love. He is open and honest about his feelings for Katie, which is refreshing.<br /><br />As predicted, Kevin eventually tracks Katie to Southport, and even as he searches for her specific location, he remains in a perpetual state of drunkenness. His extreme mood swings leave readers wondering whether hewill kidnap Katie and bring her home or kill her since she has betrayed him by leaving and being with another man. Throughout, the novel, we get Kevin's point of view about his marriage to Katie whose birth name is really Erin until she obtains her new identity.  Although at times Kevin becomes mournful and cries about losing Erin, it is hard to feel much sympathy for a man who is bullies and physically assaults a woman without accepting responsibility for his actions.<br /><br />Kevin's arrival in town builds towards a suspenseful and dramatic climax that impacts the future of Katie and Alex. Just when you think you have the ending figured out Sparks throws you for a loop with neighbor Jo's role in the story. The ending leaves you reaching for the Kleenex, yet feeling optimistic about rare second chances we may be fortunate to be given in our lifetime.will kidnap Katie and bring her home or kill her since she has betrayed him by leaving and being with another man.

B00A0SICYI|2.0|I remembered watching this as a kid and liking it.  I decided to read the book with my six year old son and we both enjoyed the story.  Unfortunately, they totally changed the story for the movie and made it worse.  And they made it into a musical which really ruined it.  I recommend just sticking with the book and letting your imagination run wild.  Don't ruin a good book with this horrible version.  (Sorry Dick Van Dyke.  I still love you so. Especially on the Dick Van Dyke show.)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have been waiting years to watch this and it did not disappoint!  I enjoyed the added lore--history--from the appendices of Tolkien's work.  It was fun and exciting.  I can watch this movie with my kids without fear of anything truly upsetting popping up.  :-D
B0041D843M|5.0|Nutrition is very important.  More important are the enzymes that can only be gotten from live foods, such as sprouted plants. Meats in a small quantity are to be considered when one thinks of how well the Eskimos thrived.  I believe it is the gluttony of too much food that is our bigger problem.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|This was a cute movie and we enjoyed it. If it were not for word count required for leaving reviews, I'd leave it at that.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|If you are a big fan of sex in the city this is a must have! I watch this when I a snowed in with a glass of wine and there is nothing bettter!
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|We watched this movie with our two boys (6 and 8). I enjoyed it far more than I expected, and the boys loved it. We will watch it again, for certain. Entertaining and heartwarming.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|If you want a good game for your choice on this kindle fire I am now on you can't get much better than around the world. It's made very tightly, no annoying ads and even throws in a decent story. Five freaking stars. Basically the bejeweled style of game with a bunch of goodies here and there.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Rented it. Watched it. Loved it. And, I will do it all over again, until I actually purchase the movie.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Great action, great sound, great visual effects For me that's enough said on the good, as for the bad the story needs some work. Bay and team seems to be making it up as they go along.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Works great on my Macbook Pro 17'' early 2011. I have Mountain Lion Running. No Problems at all. It is actually screaming fast because it is express card rather than USB. Love it!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This one is really a page turner...<br />I can't wait for the next Theo Boone to find out what happens!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am certainly glad I took the chance on this SF/post-apocalyptic tale by Hugh Howey.  It was one of the most gripping stories I've read recently.  What is there to say?  It's really well written and virtually flawlessly executed.  More than that, it made me THINK.  At times I didn't know exactly where my sympathies should lie, and that is, for me, the mark of a really well thought out scenario.  I want more, and fortunately for me, it appears that there IS in fact more to this story with Howey's follow-up omnibus edition and another to come.<br /><br />I've seen others say that this ranks right up there with many of the classic dystopian SF works, and I cannot disagree with that assessment.  Everything about this tale hits the right notes, and I'm pleased to have found an excellent new author.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Wow! This should be made available to youngsters everywhere...<br />What an inspiring series for young people... a Kid Lawyer!<br />Equally captivating for adults.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|well paced, absolutely suspenseful and freaky movie. storyline itself isn't so amazing - a bit predictable and relies on the paranormal which i don't love (i hope i'm not spoiling - the trailer mentions the paranormal aspect). the 8mm films are the best/worst part. was a bit doubtful of watching it because i hated paranormal activity (couldn't make it through) and this is produced by the same people i believe but this one had me wide eyed till the end.
B005USZML4|5.0|I love the Theo Boone series...probably more for younger readers than most of Mr. Grisham's works... but this adult loves it!<br />Would love to see this young hero brought to life on the big screen.
B002N4MNVK|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and it never gets old. The lighting and sound is good. Just a great movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|We watched this movie as a family with our 8 year old. We were pleasantly surprised to find it creative and entertaining.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved how it revealed small bits of storyline as it progressed, leaving you feeling like you were growing with the characters. It was an excellently balanced story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this very quick.  It was an easy read with a good story line.  I went to see the movie and was somewhat disappointed in that compared to the book.<br />I would recommend this.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Love it! Tenth Doctor is outstanding this season and Donna Noble is surprising at every turn. I chose this season because I had watched the episodes many times and wanted to make it a permanent part f my collection.

B005LAII6C|1.0|Last night we rented this flick after reading mixed reviews and all 4 of us adults feel as if we wasted a few hours our movie night. All of us had trouble keeping awake and concluded this was tearfully boring. We expected to be a least somewhat dazzled by the 3d. This was only the 7th 3d movie on our new 50\\" 3d plasma. There were only 2 out of screen effects that came out 30 and 50% into the room and only a few more that came out to 10%, I personally kept lowering my 3d glasses to see if there was a blur on the screen because it didnt look 3d to me. The great depth found in other 3d movies was missing<br />Too scary for young children<br /> FACT -  the opening scene Normans dad is raising his voice hatefully to Normas mother about Norman being a limp wristed weirdo and more ! and at the end when his friends (hunk)brother is propositioned for a date by Normans sister, he announces he already has a male lover!<br />Poor taste for a cartoon movie

B001I45UFC|4.0|Having already seen the movie, I found the book a bit different. The book doesn't give a great of detail for some of the creatures whereas the movie does. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the book and can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've never  read King before because horror isn't my favorite subject.  This 600+ pager (non horror) is very well written & has some very romantic and suspenseful moments.  Worth the read on a long plane ride.  Interesting philosophical take on &#34;what if's&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game whole family loves it!!!! Very addictive and pass time while travelling which is awesome for all of us!
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Way too many &#34;one liners&#34; in an effort to propel a plot that doesn't go anywhere until the last 50 pages.  DeMille has dumbed this book down to a level for idiots.  Nothing is left to the brain power of the reader.  Every lumbering plot twist is explained by the author.  Constant reference to his past books is very annoying.  Don't waste your time on this slogging elephant.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|The only critique I have is that when the &#34;bad guys&#34; meeting is first shown, the pulling out of the heart from the zombie and squeezing it and the comments about crushing the skull between his thighs were excessive and unnecessary for a predominantly targeted movie for children.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Love this movie - so very quirky.  Bought it as a gift for my hubby, and now we don't have to hope that it's scheduled on television.
1594203334|5.0|I really enjoyed this very well researched book. Did a lot of the French way of bringing up our own children but would have liked to have known all of what she wrote in this book. Should be a great help to all of the American mothers and Fathers. A must read!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|This album is simply amazing...not a lot more to say....I bought the new Eric clapton , Bon Jovie and Boz Scaggs along with this CD in this order...this is by far hands down the best of the 4....Kenny Loggins is amazing...but this band is the sum of it's parts....without Robert Burr and Georgia Middelton this album would just be good...with all three it's AMAZING!!!
0451209338|5.0|Daniel Silva sets a new standard for a thriller.  His characters are well-conceived and as a reader of the series you are drawn not only to the story but also to Gabriel Allon and his many family members and associates.  Mr. Silva does not disappoint when comes to intrigue, empathy and emotion.
B00AYHK7RU|2.0|after hearing  this  album and the mini hype, i had to hear this album and see if David Bowie had anything in the tank in 2013  and the results were  at best  3rd tier material which never quite gets  anything into gear and  his voice is just  kinda there and he was never  that deep to me as a singer anyway.for  Bowie  he has to bring it on the stage, because the studio stuff ain't  hitting no more.
1451678193|3.0|I'd heard virtually my entire life that THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES was a great book.  After a buildup like that, it's not surprising that I was disappointed.  I was expecting a novel, but it's really a lot of vignettes that are loosely related in that they take place on Mars in the early 21st Century.  Time has not been kind to THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES.  It may have seemed fresh and original when it was written, but after hundreds of viewings of The Twilight Zone episodes, most of it looks pretty hackneyed today.  There is more than a little whimsy and a considerable amount of preaching.  What may have seemed like cutting edge technology in the 1950s is laughably clunky today.  (Watches still tick on 21st Century Mars.)  The setting may be the Twenty-first Century Mars, but the sensibilities are 1950s American.  These characters never experienced the sexual revolution, womens' liberation, the civil rights movement, or 9/11.  They seem so naïve, like Howdy Doody and Jack Paar.  It has a certain charm, and one of the episodes, about the last man on the planet meeting the last woman on the planet, I found truly hilarious.  Nostalgia fans will probably like it more than science fiction fans.  Three stars.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I liked the movie. Original concept for a movie.  Like all time travel movies it suffers from the same, traveling to the past changes the future.  If your future self travels to the past to eliminate you, how do you exist in the future?  Etc.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Skyfall and believe it deserves all kudos received.  Having seen all Bond films, most in theater, I believe Skyfall has the panache and action directly related to the early Sean Connery films. Post Connery Bonds left me wanting more from the main character and scripts. Skyfall sets a mark future Bond films are challenged to exceed.
0143119680|1.0|I've never, ever, stopped reading a book half way through. EVER.  I guess congratulations are in order for this book then, because it did it, I just couldn't bring myself to keep going.  It was soooooo bad.  Not even bad good, just bad. Bad and boring. I held out for as long as I could, hoping that all the good reviews would somehow gain justification along the way.  Nope.  Finally, I decided to cut my losses and just stop.  Seriously, I can't imagine anyone thinking this was a \\"good\\" book.  If you actually respect literature stay very clear of this. Put it like this, have you ever had a friend who asked you to read her/his manuscript, screenplay, poetry, whatever? So you do, and it's pretty horrible, but you want to be nice and everything so you politely tell them you enjoyed it? Well, stop it, otherwise stuff like this will keep coming out.

B008VVT51U|5.0|I loved the story---upbeat and positive for widows and retirees in general.  The acting is superb--the best of the British with Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy for starters.  Who wouldn't want to spend time in their company!  Also the setting is colorful and exotic India.

B007PFD90G|4.0|No question that Rushdie is a talented writer. I was very curious as to how a prominent, well-known person could successfully hide from the death threats of the Ayatolla-- for years. The poor man just wrote a book of fiction, for goodness sake!  Fortunately, he had help from the Brits and a wonderful group of friends & family. Rushdie doesn't hold back on the toll it took on his family, and the reader can truly feel his frustration and boredom with his situation. Finally, he says, &#34;enough!&#34; and just gets on with his life... Bravo!
0547848412|4.0|Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a tiger by the toe. If he hollers, let him go, Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. For some reason that children's rhyme popped into my mind as I started to read this tale of survival. It  involves a 16 year old Indian boy, and a 3 year old, 450 pound Bengal Tiger marooned together on a lifeboat for 227 days in the Pacific Ocean. Wow, what a tale spun by the Man Booker Prize winner, Yann Martel. Oh, I forgot to mention that initially there was also a zebra, a rat, a hyena, and a orangutan on board. You can imagine how long they lasted with a furious tiger aboard. Did I like this novel? Yes, but I'm not sure it was worthy of the \\"Booker\\" award. It has the strength of an unusual story, but lacks the strong finish to knock the reader out. I did like Martel's easy to understand prose, and I also enjoyed the font changes that let the reader know who was narrating the story. It's a difficult novel to rate because of the long and sometimes tedious middle, and then the seemingly abrupt ending. Yet it was so entertaining. Do you see my dilemma? I must recommend this novel by virtue of it's original and exhilarating story, even though some say that it was similar to Moacyr Scliar's 'Max and the Cats'.<br /><br />The first part of the story introduces the reader to our protagonist, Piscine (self changed to Pi, because of people mispronouncing his name as `pissing') Molitor Patel. He lives with his father, mother, and brother Ravi in Pondicherry, India. The family owns a prominent zoo during the turbulent reign of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the mid 1970s. Pi is going through a confused time in his life were he is unsure if he is a Hindu, a Catholic, or a Muslim. This is one part of the book that I didn't think was relevant to the story. Anyway, Pi's father has had enough of India's politics and decides to sell his wild animals to various zoo's in America and elsewhere. He boards his family and animals on the Japanese cargo ship, Tsimtsum with the ultimate destination of Canada, and a fresh start in life. But guess what? The ship sinks several days out of port, resulting in the loss of Pi's family and everybody else, except for Pi and a few animals treading water.<br /><br />As the ship sinks, Pi has been tossed into a lifeboat by crew members. He sees the tiger ( Richard Parker ) struggling in the water. Pi throws a roped lifebuoy to the tiger and starts to haul him in, and then realizes that he is dragging a wild tiger to his boat! Pi says \\" Let go of that lifebuoy, Richard Parker! Let go, I said. I don't want you here, do you understand? Go somewhere else. Leave me alone. Get lost. Drown! Drown!\\" Too late, the tiger pulls himself aboard. You might wonder how a tiger got the name Richard Parker. Well, when the tiger was young, he was captured by a hunter named Richard Parker. The hunter saw the tiger drinking a lot of water, so he named him \\" Thirsty \\". However when they went to the ticket booth for the train ride to the zoo, confusion ran amok, and the names on the tickets got reversed, and the hunter became Thirsty, and the tiger became Richard Parker. At the zoo, Pi's father thought it was amusing and kept the unusual name for his tiger. Most of the remaining novel is about survival at sea, or man versus beast for seven months on a 26' by 8' lifeboat. Who wins? Can Pi train the tiger on the boat? Will the tiger try to eat Pi? Can Pi catch enough food to keep Richard Parker happy? These are a few of the questions that will be answered, as you read this daring fantasy tale. This novel is well worth the effort, I suggest you add it to your books-to-read list.destination of Canada, and a fresh start in life. But guess what?

B003O86FMW|5.0|While this was written as I understand, for the young generation I was very captivated by it, the strong plot, the engaging characters, and the unique ideas.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Loads fast, works perfectly, syncs seamlessly. I love the ability to switch between all platforms and not lose my place in whatever book I'm reading.
B008JFUNAU|4.0|This was an enjoyable remake, lasting a wee bit over 2 hours.  Although it is the same basic story-line as the original,there are some differences.  Dorothy and ToTo do not exist and no house falls on a wicked witch.  Since there is no Dorothy, there are no ruby slippers either.  And, of course, the beautiful song \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" is non-existant.<br /><br />Our story begins in Kansas 1905, where con-man \\"Oz\\" travels the country with his magic shows. He barely scrapes by with the change he makes but he dreams that someday he will be great.  He also is a ladies-man, schmoozing every pretty face he sees.  Running for his life, he hops on a balloon, cuts the rope, and laughs heartily as he escapes--until he sees everyone on the ground running.  He turns to see himself being sucked into the funnel of a tornado.  As you already know, he lands safely in the land of OZ where the adventure begins as he meets Theodora and travels to the Emerald City to fulfill the prophecy of the land and save the people from the evil witch.<br /><br />The movie seemed suitable for children (unless they are very young and might have witch nighmares).  It actually seemed a lot more tame than the original movie.  I saw plenty of children in the 6 and 7 year old range at the theater.  Adults and children all seemed to enjoy the movie.  There are some cool computer-graphic imaging and anamatronics.  Although I saw this in 2-D and it was great, it was also available in 3-D. The colors are great too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose this book because it was recommended to me. It has an incredible lesson to it along with being a book that you don't want to put down. There are twists and turns you'd never expect. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
B00B2064IY|4.0|I was skeptical of another re-hashing of the Hendrix archives.  However, this album is a great snapshot of the short lived 'Band of Gypsies' with Buddy Miles on drums and vocals and Billy Cox on bass.  The consistent vibe balances R&B and Electric Blues nicely and gives an unrealized picture of where Jimi was heading in the 70's.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun game for kids and adults.  Once you get started it is hard to put it down!  Fun for the whole family.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King you really aced this one. I have read almost everything he has written with the exception of the later sequels of the wasteland due to not liking the first 2 beginning series. This one is so different from most  of his later works. Many of his later novels were not as good as his earlier ones due to being too weird and disjointed with aliens and strange twists. This story reminds me of his earlier works which center on human emotions and what if? The main character George is caring and willing to risk it all for the sake of others and his  love affair with Sadie is amazing. I almost didn't buy this book because it just didn't seem that great. I am so glad I did.It has renewed my love for Kings books. THANK YOU Stephen King. You are amazing!

0060537639|5.0|The book is well written, is intelligently convincing and is mind provoking around the issue of western societies intentional distortion of history. The book Black Athena references the beginning of this trend and this book (1421) shows what that propensity to lie to oneself evolves into.

I found some parts a little harrowing to watch and kept reminding myself it was \\"movie land,\\" but it is such an addictive series. I waited and waited for the second season, and it was well worth the wait - buy it !! Looking forward, (hopefully) to a third season !!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The whole series is excellent, and this fifth book continues that tradition. With each chapter you follow a different character and become completely wrapped up in their story. Each chapter ends with action so that you are sad the next chapter doesn't follow the same person--but then it happens all over again as you follow the next character as they try to survive. Can't wait for the next enstallment!

Once you reflect, they stretch the imagination. Kerr has done a lot of research on SS and RSHA organization.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a gem of a book!    I wasn't at all sure what to expect when I first read the description, but I immediately became more and more engrossed in this book with every turn of the page and could hardly put it down. Other readers clearly felt the same; I've noticed the book price has increased since I purchased my download. Trust me, this book is worth it. I suspect this book was originally meant to be a self-published e-book, but I recently came across a print version at my local bookstore! Kudos Mr. Weir.    The story is very unpredictable, and Watley, the main character, is an absolute riot, a very engaging and sympathetic character.  There is a nice balance between the genuine humour the author intersperses with the more technical parts of the story, which the author makes quite understandable and plausible. There is some profanity, but it's all in good fun.     If you liked Apollo 13, you should like this book; they have a similar vibe, but they are completely different stories. There is a lot of tension and anticipation as Watley deals with the various situations he is faced with and I couldn't help finding myself experiencing them with him.    I can't praise this book enough. A great buy and a great read. I look forward with anticipation to reading more from Andy Weir.
B002UWH8SS|4.0|This isn't my most favorite show so I'm not going to write to long of a review. Also I'm only about 3/4s of the way through season one but I think I've seen enough for a good review. Overall, it's defiantly interesting/exciting enough to make me keep watching but there defiantly are some nulls in the action. Many episodes are really good but there's 3 or 4 and parts of other episodes that seem to just keep dragging on. There's also quite a few lose ends. Some episodes seem to end abruptly and the next episode they won't mention it again at all. It kind of makes you wonder what else happened, maybe they made it that way on purpose, I'm not really sure. Some things that aren't mentioned at all end up playing a big part later in the series making me wonder if I missed some things. Again, overall it's worth watching, I'm not really a SG fan, I've never seen any stargate anything before but after I finish season two I plan on watching sg-1 and some of the movies this series is good enough.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another great John Grisham book that I highly recommend to everyone. You won't be disappointed if you like his other books.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved this show and can't wait for the next season to be shown in the US.  Great characters, even the not so nice ones bring you around to seeing the 'weak' side of them, and feeling empathy for them.  And some great scenarios that hook you.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This should have been the movie version instead of the one they did.  I have to admit that I am a PoTO fanatic and am a huge fan of everything Andrew Lloyd Webber does.  The cinematography is just fantastic especially for a stage play. If you like PoTO, you will absolutely love this version.  A must for any collector.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|I didn't know much about the whole hostage situation (I was too young and I don't remember discussing in school).<br />The movie did an excellent job of setting the scene and mixing real tv footage with movie footage.<br />Although a 2 hr film, it didn't feel like it and kept you engaged the whole time.<br />The acting was brilliant and in the end, I wad amazed at how closely the actors resembled there real counterparts..which give casting, wardrobe and make-up props.

B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|It is not worth it to pay for the full game. Not very challenging, actually a pretty boring game. Don't waste your money.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|great book.........typical of nicholas sparks......easy read..I dont know why I need so many words to describe a book I told you I liked..
B00BHMF578|5.0|Have been wanting to see how good the Best Picture was. Ben Affleck did an amazing job on this movie and with the per trail of the characters. Would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie!!
1616550414|5.0|This book has so much cool information about the Legend of Zelda. LoZ is one of my all time favorite gaming series and I am so glad to have this collection of information about it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Hey, it's Harry Potter, how could it NOT be &#34;practically perfect in every way&#34;?<br /><br />The only issue I have is a technical one, and only on one DVD, disk 8, Deathly Hallows, Pt 2. The sound for the voices is subdued into the background soundtrack. In order to understand what was being said, I had to turn on (and read) the subtitles. Disk 8, Deathly Hallows, Pt 2, was the only DVD I had this issue with (with this collection/set; however, I also had this issue with my Lord of the Rings extended version trilogy set as well).<br /><br />Message to J. K. Rowling: From the bottom of my heart, humbly, thank you for creating the Harry Potter series. It meant more to me than you can ever know.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Graphics are good. The game play is fluid and I have been playing for a couple of hours already. So it must be fun.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a good but the problems are you have to get to much slicks 100 and something slicks and it goes to fast
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|it's a great soap opera type story with plenty of star-crossed lovers, family problems, money issues, petty sibling rivalries -- you name it.  and, of course, a lot of hilarious 'oh so british' one liners from the old lady dowager countess of grantham --- she is priceless.
B007W8S2MG|4.0|I've heard a lot about this game from so many different people. I never got around to playing it on my PS2, so when I heard about Golden, I decided to finally try it out. I cannot begin to describe how fun it is. It is the quintessential JRPG, but also really accessible to those new to JRPGs.<br /><br />Others have written at length about the merits of the game, so I would like to point out one aspect of the game that I find extremely distracting, ultimately causing me to give the game four stars: the translation. The verb tense used in the game constantly switches from past to present and back again. It's somewhat confusing and doesn't really make sense.<br /><br />Example: After making an option, the screen may say: \\"You tell Chie...\\". That's present tense, and it's the most fitting tense for the game. However, the next screen might say, \\"You decided to go home.\\" This is past tense, and it is best used for narratives.<br /><br />To some, this may be a minor point, but I find it really annoying. If only the person/people who translated had paid closer attention.<br /><br />Still, it's an amazing game!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Twist and changes keep you interested but not always disappointed. Can't wait for the next season to start! I watched all of the first 3 in less than a week I was so hooked.
B00B6CUO6Q|2.0|My package was damaged upon arrival. It looks as though it was mailed after it had been opened then resealed. There were fingerprints and dirt on two discs. The second disc of the second season was gouged. It was not usable. I had to spend more money to replace it.  I enjoyed seasons one and three.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Never would have thought it, watched cause my husband wanted to... but good show.  (wouldn't hurt my feelings if it was a lit less graphic but ...)
B0094K1PW4|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie. It was a very good story. However the end could have been a little better.
B00421IR5I|5.0|Another great movie for the French classroom that we enjoyed watching after reading a chapter from the text. A must have for the class.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have to say this is by far my favorite Bond movie ever, the action is fantastic and the story is straight forward, all around great Bond!
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is ok, graphics are great needs an update though. here is what it needs.  endermen. caves. easy to find iron and REAL NETHER PORTALS!not those cheap ones that just make a big castle.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|What a beautiful movie in so many ways:  superb acting, outstanding visual effects, and a story (which one) that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  I have never read the book and probably never will because I enjoyed the movie so much and will again and again.  Yes, the beginning was rather slow but I found it to be a foundation for what was to come.  The visual effects are awesome and so realistic.  There are some questionable scenes that can possibly leave the viewer scratching his/her head but overall, it is one beautiful adult movie that represents a huge slice of life.  Enjoy!
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I know that I am in the minority here, but I found AGOT to be dull, vapid, and (yes) sexist. To be fair, I only read the first book, so maybe I'm missing a bigger picture.  I've long been a fan of the fantasy genre, and usually enjoy large casts and elaborate plots.  Nonetheless, I could barely trudge through book one of the AGOT series, let alone consider reading the rest of them.  My advice? Don't bother. Unless, of course, you enjoy feeling empty, bored, depressed, and confused. My four main qualms with AGOT are the 1.) poorly-developed characters, 2.) vast multitude of plots, 3.) gratuitous rape, 4.) regressive portrayals of women.<br /><br />1.) Characters. Characters are plentiful, but Martin's writing style prevents us from really making an emotional investment in them.  I tried to like them, but there were only three characters I cared about *at all* by the end, out of a cast of maybe thirty: Arya, Tyrion, and Jon.  Throughout the book, character after character is introduced until your head is spinning. Martin provides every single detail of their armor, facial hair and weaponry, but fails to engage the reader on an emotional level.  Most of the characters are standard medieval-realm stereotypes.  It's not that having a big cast is inherently a bad thing, but in this case it doesn't enhance the world or the story.  Rather, it feels forced, and makes the book a chore to read.  Oh, and if you're hoping for strong female characters, look elsewhere.  This is a classic case of a male author pandering to feminism, but entirely missing the point.  Martin makes women accountable to men, and dependent on men.  He sometimes gives the impression of feminism, but it fails to flourish.  Sadly, there's not enough meat on the bone for readers to really believe in the characters -- the sheer number of plots, and endless descriptive details, prevents Martin from fleshing out any single story.  Arya was the only character that offered a shred of hope, but her rejection of all things female and her one-dimensional, tom-boy persona were such oversimplifications of feminism. Like, to be feminist we have to hate embroidery and dresses. I don't know if she becomes a fully-formed character since I didn't read past book one.<br /><br />2.) Plot. It's punishing, as a reader, to go through a continuous parade of chapters, each with a new plot and new characters.  I found myself being hopeful at first, \\"maybe we'll finally get back to so-and-so this chapter!\\"  Ha!  Don't get your hopes up.  It's not that I don't like books with multiple POVs, it's just that it never clicked for me in AGOT.  The plots felt thin and unresolved.  After holding so many people in my head -- and unraveling their back stories, family crests, and relatives -- why do they feel so hollow?  Yes, there are three more books to tie things up, but a good writer will give the reader some fulfillment in each installment.  Not doing so is lazy writing.  With so many plots brewing, it stands to reason that a few might end up rewarding the reader in a meaningful way.  Maybe reveal something important about life and love; maybe illustrate some underlying truths about humanity; maybe just give us a few cheap thrills or laughs.  Nope.  With rare exceptions (e.g. Arya, Tyrion), this book delivers a trencher full of zilch.<br /><br />3.) Rape.  Rape.  Rape.  And why not throw in a little more no-relevance-to-the-plot, just-for-fun, rape?  I mean, come ON.  Who thinks this is okay?  Entertaining? I just don't understand how anyone can think that this permissive \\"I know it's wrong but that's just the way it is\\" attitude about rape is acceptable.  Guess what?  Writing so casually about rape -- and portraying it as a natural part of this fantasy world -- makes people in OUR world think rape is okay.  Before you cry out, \\"But that's how things were in olden times!\\" or, \\"It's just a gritty writing style!\\" consider this: the more casually we treat rape, the more it will happen.  I'm not a prude.  A few sex scenes are kind of fun in a long-winded, boring book like this . . . but all that rape is just plain wrong.  A rape scene is NOT comparable to a regular sex scene with two consenting adults.  If you can't see that, then the problem is worse than I thought.<br /><br />4.) Feminist?  Some people think that Martin is a feminist, and this book celebrates powerful women.  I didn't get that.  At.  All.  Just because the female characters are miserable and want more out of their lives, we're supposed to feel good? But where's the second part? The part where that yearning turns into cultural change? It's nice that the female characters attempt to self-actualize themselves, but there's a major element missing: evolution. No one evolves, changes, grows, learns . . . as for male characters, we're left with a bunch of remorseless monsters going about their merry ways and feeling just fine with all their sexist crap. If you want to argue that this is a feminist book, where's the comeuppance? Where's the justice? Where's the character that shatters the norms and forces a change? Because if this book is just a snapshot of a chauvinist society, then what's the point?<br /><br />Overall, the book was depressing not because it contained dark themes, but because there was no payoff for the reader.  I came away feeling like I had wasted my time, and was maybe even worse off than before.  I cared so little about the characters and the plot that I'm not going to read the remaining books.  That has never happened to me before.  It is further depressing to see the defense of Martin's portrayal of rape by so many commenters on this site.  So many of you say, \\"it's realistic, don't be so sensitive.\\"  Well, aside from all the obvious reasons that the \\"you're too sensitive\\" defense is groundless (see point 3 above), I'd add that Martin's integration of rape into AGOT is alienating to female readers and makes light of a terrible, life-changing act that should not be casual background noise.  A timely example of how damaging this flippant perception of rape is in our culture is the Steubenville, Ohio high school football rape case.  Obviously, there were a lot of factors in that situation, and I'd never make any direct link to AGOT -- but pop culture DOES matter to how we think and act.  Culture matters, period.  It changes our expectations of ourselves, and our world.  Martin's careless representations of rape in AGOT aren't helping.  Martin, women deserve better.  So do men.  So does modern society, and so do the miserable people of Westeros.e.  A few sex scenes are kind of fun in a long-winded, boring book like this . . . but all that rape is just plain wrong.  A rape scene is NOT comparable to a regular sex scene with two consenting adults.  If you can't see that, then the problem is worse than I thought.<br /><br />4.) Feminist?

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Reading a story about a sexually deviated person is not my idea of interesting. I can't believe that people could possibly think of behaving in such a manner let alone make it into a novel.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Three stars from me, but I can see why it's a hit among young readers.  Lot's of feel-good teen features.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Such a great movie. A must watch with your kids. My son was 2 and loved it. Has some great lines in it for adult humor too.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Needs more retro. There are many things I would love to tell you about this movie. The new world created to keep the plot going was lacking in coinage. Other than that, watch out for the plot twist that will keep you going Turbo!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is AWESOME if you love games like subway suffers and super penguins, I LOVE this game and I think you will lice it to.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My daughter kept begging to watch this. I didn't until now. I really wish I had seen this at the movie theater. Great movie, moves fast and has a ton of goofy things that keep you laughing. I would recommend this to just about anyone.
B0054SMID0|3.0|Movie was OK.  It was an easy watch for a cold Sunday afternoon.  I found that it was kinda predictable.  Not bad, not good but worth watching if you like this actor.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Do you like medieval themed things? So do I! Sure, it's another Disney Princess all put together with all of the fixings of product placement. It's very enjoyable.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but based on the reviews, gave it a shot.  I really liked what I heard.  I could hear parts of many movies in the songs.  Which brings me to the one thing I wish I knew (and if I ordered the cd proper, and there is a booklet, the answers may be inside)- what songs go with what movies?  However, that little bit won't change the rating.  Overall, I'm very satisfied, so much so I purchased Archangel (which is also very good).
B0064W652A|5.0|Well worth the purchase. Best artwork I've ever seen in a comic series and with a very interesting plot. Loved it

B007WFTFG6|1.0|I ordered this free app to entertain my two year old. I should have known, anything labeled FREE never truly is free. This app has pop-ups and buttons that appear on the screen while coloring that will allow your toddler to order more drawings for this app. It seems to even happen with the Parental Controls set to prevent this. Be warned.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great. My family loves this game. Everyone plays it. It is a must buy. Fun fun fun.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|really fun game like a lot of it to but I wish there was a just a little more time

B00AECGQF2|5.0|I don't have this app but my friend does and I played it once on her Kindle Fire and it was sooooo much fun!! So I really think it deserves 5 stars.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you love 50 shades of grey like me this is a series for you very good story line and keeps you interested
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome that pretty much everybody has it on some sort of device! You may think it's bad because they're doing grafiti and being chased by a sheriff; but no. It's fine and fun. There may be a few ads in the beggining when you open up the app but they're acceptional. The characters are really fun too. This is the best game ever and I recomend it A LOT.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty cute game! Great time passer and my niece loves it. I play it too honestly :) horse s are a awesome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addi ting and I love it I play itnsll thentime I likenhoebcreative it is but not that it was. Opiednfromntemplenrun okay that fir knowing my kpion okay bye sorry for typo witted it on my kindkenfirr
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Very smart.  Tom knows what he's doing.  Could always be better, of course, but this movie is way better than its recent peers from Hollywood.
B0076DELIG|4.0|A decent read. Sometimes,the fluff is a bit much, but easy to skip over. Suspense is pretty good and keeps one guessing the next move.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I haven't owned an automatic watch since I was in the service during the mid 70's, it was a Seiko.  I needed an everyday all around watch and chose this one.  I liked the style, the canvas strap, durable case and so far it keeps accurate time.

0385349947|5.0|I'm not sure I understand many of the negative reviews of this book. Uneven edges? Only women and only those who are biological mothers to their children can be good mothers?<br /><br />I don't think Sheryl Sandberg is claiming to have all the answers. Nor do I think she's saying that following the footsteps of her life is the only way for a woman to become successful. In fact, she quite often makes the point that every situation is unique and that she has been unusually lucky. Rather, she's gleaning lessons from her own life in the hopes that others can learn from them. She never bashes women who have no interest in a challenging career; nor does she heavy-handedly blame all men for all the obstacles that women face. What she does do is put together a thoughtful argument that we should all do what we feel will help us be more fulfilled, and specifically as women, we should not let external factors -- like an assumption that you can't be a good mother if you have a career, or an inherent fear of risk, or misplaced guilt -- be the reason we hold ourselves back.<br /><br />Personally, I have no desire to be the next Sheryl Sandberg. But I still found this book to be inspiring, and it led me to question many of my long-held assumptions that were so ingrained in me that I never thought of them as anything other than basic truths. Even if a reader doesn't agree with her 100%, I feel there is still value to be gained here... and not just for women, but for anyone who wants to better understand the unique situations in which today's working women may find themselves.
0800141849|4.0|I'm not a big Streisand fan, but I do like this film.  It is both charming, romantic, and very funny.  Bridges is hilarious.  Bacall is her usual outstanding self, and Streisand is touching and her character is oh, so familiar to many of us.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I saw it in theater and when I walked out of the theater, I wanted to watch it again right away. I've seen it five times now, and can see myself watching it again in the near future.

B000GCFY0I|4.0|Tally dreams of being pretty.  All of her friends have already had the operation and now live in pretty town but Tally still has a month to go before her operation and live change.  Now she is stuck in Uglyville waiting until the day she turns sixteen.  She is all alone so she sneaks over to Pretty Town to see her bff  Peris who is already pretty.  She wants to make sure they are still friends because since his operation he hasn't contacted her.  She finds Peris and he assures her that once she becomes Pretty it will be just like old times together.  Tally becomes a legend before she every becomes pretty when she has to escape New Pretty town without getting caught, she meets a new Ugly friend Shay in the process of escaping and at least she isn't alone anymore before her operation.<br />Shay has strange ideas, she doesn't want to become pretty.  She knows of a way out and tries to convince tally to come with her.  Tally refuses but Shay leaves anyway and Tally is alone again.  On the day Tally has waited for her whole life, the day of her surgery, she is whisked away to Special Circumstances to learn that they know of all the tricks she has played and that her friend Shay went to live in the `Smoke' so that she never has to become Pretty and live in normal society.  Tally is given a choice, be ugly forever or find the `Smoke' and signal Special Circumstances.<br />This book had a lot of social ideas.  How do you keep a society in line, who decides what is beautiful, can you be beautiful to someone even if you are imperfect.  There was also some environmental preachiness I think the story could have done without.  I liked the way things were reused in the wilderness but some of the things they abhorred were really weird.  I didn't get how all the building and hovercrafts and stuff in the city were made so that they were environmentally sound and didn't use trees or animals.  It was a small part of the story though so it didn't matter a lot.  The contrast between city life and pretty life was great to see.<br />All and all the story is interesting and moves along at a nice pace.  You quickly pick up on the language and the end has a slight cliffhanger so I wanted to read the next book in the series right away.  Solid writing and plot line even if it was a little preachy at times.y life and pretty life was great to see.<br />All and all the story is interesting and moves along at a nice pace.

When introduced to the MC Quinton (great character name by the way) and his strange neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman they are kids that find a dead body together.  Right away we discover that Margo is in a class by herself.  She is different while most people would have been afraid she thought of it as a great adventure and tried to discover what happened to the man.  Fast forward seven or eight years and she is still this enigma.  She is wild, fun and remarkable in every way.  Her adventures are legendary at the high school and Quinton has loved her from afar most of his life.  Margo shows up at Quinton's bedroom window and takes him on one wild ride of a night righting some wrongs and wronging some rights in the course of an evening.  This was the part of the book I liked the most.  The crazy stuff she thought up to do on their adventure.  Just when Quinton thought Margo had re-entered his life she up and leaves town.  But she left him some clues behind and so the search begins for the real Margo Roth Spiegelman and where she went.<br />With the help of his friends Ben and Radar, Q tries to uncover the clues left behind and what he discovers is the idea of the person he thinks Margo is, is completely different than the person she actually is.  The more he discovers the true Margo the more he believes he is the only one that can find her.  I like the social dynamic of the mystery gang group.  Radar was one of my favorite characters in this book because he was a truly great friend.  He is the guy that sees people for who they really are and loves them anyway because of their faults not in spite of them.<br />Part 2 of the book stretches on a bit and gets a little tedious but maybe it is supposed to because Q is uncovering bits and details of who Margo really is and why she left.  Most of this part of the book has a strong emphasis on the poem Song of Myself by Walt Whitman and it is long and tedious so perhaps it was meant to parallel.  But then the breakthrough comes and the group is off on a road trip adventure to find Margo.<br />Part 3:  I have to say I love John Green's writing but in no way think 18 year old kids think like this, or maybe I was just the shallowest of 18 year olds.  Some of the ideas come up with just astound me.  The road trip was funny, the different conversations between the people in the Minivan the games they played.  Without giving away the ending I will have to say while I get why the ending went in the way it did I really really wanted it to go differently.  The conversation about Paper Towns and being a Paper Girl was very well thought out and explained Margo well I think.  She is looking for the real her as most of us are at that age trying to discover where we belong and the grand scheme of things.  But alas the ending bittersweet, it could have ended differently but then maybe Margo wouldn't have been as magical.  A big bravo to Q though I really liked his character and even though he was stalkerly obsessed with Margo I think through his travels he discovered himself as much as he discovered her and in that will be able to move on in the future.arallel.

B0098XY5VK|5.0|I played this game on Yahoo and loved it. I was happy to see it come out for the kindle fire. It's a lot easier to play with the touch screen than it ever was with the mouse! I play it all the time!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Awesome little game so far. I am only on the third level, so it may get too hard, in which case I will remove it. Sure wish the makers would wait till level 10 or so before begging for reviews. Many games I love at first, but then delete before level 10. The jury is still out on this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|wow that is all I can say. it just teaches you about horses. it is awesome. liv it.luv it _
B00005NKKZ|2.0|This album as judged from the music content is five star, but the sound quality is intolerable. Amazon was prompt in returning my money. I am ordering the deluxe edition now , hoping to find that the sound quality will be acceptable.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|game was short but didn't cost much. worth the money because graphics were cool.  couldn't put it down until I had beaten it.<br />Did take a long time to load though
B000LXHK2C|5.0|This movie kinda sneaks up on you.  Its not a big film, but you get to see some great actors plying their craft with grace. It makes Russel Crow look human for a change.  A real sleeper, heart felt, and funny.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. The twists in the plot were great. I reccommended this book to all my friends. I hope you do to
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|UPDATE, its mid June 2013, the left mouse button is starting make a weird annoying noise.  Probably not enough for me to try to RMA, but its disapointing since before the sound, it was perfect.  Its only when I click towards the back of the left mouse button, which I happen to do a lot.  It doesn't make the sound all the time which is almost worse since I notice it more when it starts.<br /><br />This is a great mouse.  It feels a lot like my old logitech G5 which is what it is replacing.  Working flawlessly.  I like how it feels like a good fit to my hand and I can grip it however I wan't without accidently pushing thumb buttons.  3 thumb buttons is plenty for me to remember what they do but its enough to give me a little edge or convenience in games compared to the usual mouse.  You can custom set all 4 DPI settings.  So far I don't even use over 2000 but it can go lightning fast if you want.  I can't wait to see what they come up with for the next generation of this mouse.  Hope it is similar.<br /><br />As a sife note, I tried the Logitech G600 and didn't like how I couldn't grip the mouse with my thumb without pressing a button and the groove for the right finger was weird and made it even less grippable.  You should really watch how you hold and use your mouse before you bother trying one imo.  So then I thought ill try the naga hex since its got that dot on the side to hold the mouse.  It worked better but having to have my thumb on that little dot all the time was too restrictive for me.
B00866JL96|5.0|I read the book by Nicholas Sparks and was anxiously awaiting this movie coming out in theaters for about a year and a half, especially when I learned who would play Logan & Beth. I loved watching Zac Efron grow up & grow immensely as an actor. I mean, in Charlie St. Cloud, he was just fantastic! And I've loved Taylor Schilling as an actress ever since her first few mesmerizing minutes of Mercy; a great show that should NOT have been cancelled, NBC!! I just knew that together, these two would do the story, the author, their respective characters, & the audience proud. I absolutely adore this movie!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is an outstanding movie about a true story.  It is filled with action, and at the same time it educates the public about what happened at this time in US History.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|the game does not allow you to do about anything unless you buy bling. It is a little fun at the begging but then its not.I say DON'T get it!
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Good quality product.  The cable is actually long enough to reach from the cigarette lighter to the passenger seat unlike the cheap-o non U.S. import that I bought elsewhere.  Liked the product so much, even researched the history of Griffin on the internet.  I will definitely buy from this company again.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|I ordered this for my friend's birthday, and she said she loves it! It's in high quality and contains awesome pictures of Gaga.<br />Love this so much!~~~~
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved this book it made me want to read it again on my kindle. It had great details on Greek mythology. I'm reading the next zeros right now and its really good :)
B002QY9RMA|5.0|Beautiful album, and it actually comes with a lyric book!! Which is exactly what I want! And it's only $9!!! Love u Beyonce.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I have gone off wheat. I could have gone off wheat hearing 1/2 of the first chapter and not looked back. (Which is essentially what I did.)<br /><br />I listened to this book on Audible. Thank goodness. The author has so much information and medical chatter. I can't stand medical chatter. He went on and on and on and on. I skipped 2 whole chapters for the most part - fast-forwarding as fast as Audible would go, and I still couldn't skip fast enough.<br /><br />I skipped a large chunk at the end too. I'm not sure which chapters, because I don't pay attention. One was something about glucose. Fine. &#34;Wheat spikes your sugar in your blood stream and then stores as fat.&#34;  Got it. Don't need a whole chapter explaining this phenomenon. It's not that complicated.<br /><br />So - here's my story. I am not allergic to wheat. I didn't think I had any problems with it. I went off it to see if I would lose weight. It's been about 3 weeks now. I haven't lost any weight. Ok, no problem.<br /><br />I stopped feeling bloated in about 24 hours. I started sleeping soundly at night, and am awake during the day. (This is a miracle!) About 2 weeks in, my face broke out really horribly (I've had acne since before 1980), worse than ever. But a friend assured me I was probably detoxing. It took a few days for that to calm down, and now I'm back to normal again.<br /><br />I ate a few Girl Scout cookies, then a piece of pizza about 2 days ago. I had an instant bad headache. Took me a few hours to get over. I didn't sleep that night, and was groggy the whole next day. I'm ok again now.<br /><br />There is more, but that will suffice for public knowledge, from my perspective, on Amazon. I won't be eating wheat again. I do crave some of it - 2ce now - but I've had some potato chips instead, or banana chips. I miss the munching.<br /><br />I am nervous, in this day and age, I feel there will come a time when we can't eat anything. ie: Corn is bad. Sugar is bad. Eggs are bad. Eggs are good. Eggs that are cage free and organic are good, all the rest are bad. Wheat is bad. Don't eat fruit. Don't eat cheese. Eat vegan. Eat raw. Don't eat fish due to over-fishing. Soy is bad. Milk is bad. Food that is not local is bad. Coffee is bad. Nuts are fattening..... &#34;  The list is so long, I can't eat so many things. Are we supposed to only grow our own vegetables and eat only that?<br /><br />Seriously - what are we supposed to eat? I'm glad I'm learning to garden and have my own vegetables in my back yard.d.

B00AA7O22U|5.0|The cast was great and the one liners from past movies made this move hysterical and fun. Is worth watching!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Excellent first hand account of WWII action in the Pacific.  Author gives details of the battles as well as the day in and day out duties and life of an AMerican marine.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Now quite as good as the first book in the trilogy.  Moved a little slower but it was still a good read
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie looked good from the previews but when I saw it I thought it was excellent. The story was well written and the actors in it played wonderful characters. This movie isn't for just one generation of teenagers it is for all generations of teenagers to come. The story might be set at a particular time frame due to the music but it can be any time frame. What some of the teenagers go through this movie conquers every stutus frame of school. The nerds, the jocks, the popular, the unpopular, the outsiders, the rich, the middle class, the poor, it just examines all walks of life that high school is.  I recommend this movie.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Loved this book.  Exciting and fast moving.  The characters were great.  Exciting to the end - making you want to read the trilogy
0446547573|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Everything from character development to plot to events were in sync.  Nicholas Sparks has become one of my favorite authors.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Now quite as good as the first book in the trilogy.  Moved a little slower but it was still a good read
B001I13PM0|5.0|and great performance. He's such a great talent, and the musicians surrounding him are amazing as well. If you have your TV hooked to a good sound system, it will be even better!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is among my favorite LPB Classics. I purchased this particular Season as a gift and am totally satisfied with the price, the packaging and the delivery.  Thank you!<br />Jacqulyn
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my brother and his new girlfriend.  Simply a classic movie that is just as fun to watch whether it is your first or 50th time
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|A fun movie for thise with apocalyptic leanings. It comes with a very quick shipp and delievery, was quite surprised at the efficiency.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm loving this video, its quick, but effective, I'm sweating after just a few minutes, and feel like I got a good workout when I'm finished, all you need is some hand weights. I've been recommending it to everyone!
1449325947|5.0|Well the Amazon partner I purchased from accidentally sent me the wrong book. However, they did send me this book at no additional change very quickly. I'm very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />The book itself is great and covers all the topics I need to know to update my skill set.<br />I highly recommend this book!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|interesting game. good graphics. a little difficulty with some of the hidden objects. you have to zoom out and check near the BACK label for some of them.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Awesome and very well done.  The animation is superb.  The only downside to a game like this is the ability to become addicted to it.  LOL
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I've had this game for a little while now, and it it fun to play.  My first problem is that I can't send to or receive from any of my friends. It worked fine to start with but now it keeps telling me there was a problem please try again later. I think 2 weeks is enough later! My second problem is that there is no exit from the game on my Kindle Fire. I have to completely shut down my Kindle. in order to exit the game.  It seems that every other game I have downloaded. has either an exit button on at least allows my toolbar to show at the bottom of the screen.  I have found neither with this game. Other than that,  I like it!!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I read the book many years ago. After watching the movie, I am rereading the book because I now have incredible visuals from the movie. The story takes me to a \\"letting go\\" place, allowing me to stop trying to figure out the plot, which allows the story to explode as something new and unforeseen in each scene. I am so glad they made the book into a movie of this caliber that will be remembered for a very long time.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|These guy's are very talented and have feelings which come across when they sing! What's wrong with that? They're different and I really love their stuff. Don't compare them with Queen~they aren't anything like them. These three guys love what they're doing and they're good at it too. I am 65 and back in the day,some bands had orchestra's playing with them~so what~just listen and enjoy!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. It seemed to have much heavier themes than any other Bond movie I've ever seen, but overall it was entertaining, action-packed and had a lot of style.
B002SEQ8ZC|5.0|Hermoso box set, con mucha información adicional y lindas postcards, no se arrepentirá ya qué es un deber de tener en la colección
B007SGM084|4.0|When I first decided to read Fifty Shades it was because of all the hype. Now I'm pleased to say the book is so much more than sex and toys. Christian has many issues but he tries to work through them with the help of Anastasia amongst all the other elements that interfere with their plans. Great read.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Admittedly, this movie may be a bit difficult to follow for non-Francophones. There are many, many references that are very cultural and may completely go over the heads of people who are unfamiliar with the French culture and language. But if you, like me, are at least semi-fluent in French and have even been to France (my favorite town is Lyon, not Paris), you may love this movie as much as I do. I only say this because it is a very visual movie (what movie isn't...?), so you will miss out on a lot if you have to continuously feast your eyes on the bottom of the screen to read. That said, I loved watching it on my Kindle with the X-ray turned on, and it had a lot of fun trivia about the making of the movie (for example, that the director had the filming areas cleaned to portray the fantasy-world that Amelie lives in). I didn't know that the first time I watched the movie, and having just freshly returned from The City of Lights, I recall thinking to myself (10 years ago) &#34;Wow, I don't recall Paris being that clean&#34;. Well, it isn't. Amelie is a classic, and I've loved every other movie with Audrey Tautou (Dirty Pretty Things) ever since.
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|The story line is much less annoying actually enjoyable compared to mirror mysteries. Lots of hidden object and mini games. I prefer point and click to hidden object but i felt this had enough other stuff to do that ho wasn't bad. There is a hint button and a skip button on puzzles. I wish you could go back into the levels you completed to get coins you may have missed. Call me ocd but i like to completely do everything. I enjoyed this game overall and would say get it for sure. This developer is getting better each time in my opinion.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Just great, just love it, fast shiping. Seller decribtion was right on, great product, great seller. I cant get enough of this looking for to many more seasons coming out on dvd.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I didn't even finish it....this was just uncomfortable to watch.  I felt like I was listening to someone else's therapy sessions.  Not what I would consider entertaining.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|just got this game a few minutes ago so I'm still getting used to it. but so far its been fun. I believe my kid will like it too.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The scenery was beautiful, the story had much more of a plot than I was anticipating.  It definitely was worth watching.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|great music !!!!!!<br />a must have !!!!!<br />a great way to shake your booty :)<br />a super way to make your day great !!!!!!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This was very predictable as expected.  Light, entertaining enough.  Basic baseball movie...basic father/daughter relationship movie.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but entertaining.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|incredible characters, thoroughly entertaining, Judy Dench, can I say more. A nice movie for us boomers and travellers to the EAST
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I would highly recommend.  Seriously.  I'm not a movie critic, but I know a good one when I see it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Captivating!  Could almost believe it was true!  Stephen King is a true artist!  A must read!!!!! A real page turner for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app you need to get it READ THIS so u get this.app if you think this.app is stupid you're stupid
B004QSQML8|5.0|great movie.  Instant classic.  Great effects for even a movie this old.  Watched it over and over again.  Great conversion to blu-ray.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|We heard these two on television and immediately wanted their cd. My family is very pleased with this purchase. I recommend it for anyone that likes classical music with a modern twist.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|This is a must see for the little ones.  Wonder, hope and dreams - my boys were enthralled (5 & 2 years old).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book I couldn't put it down. I read it with a few days an can't wait to read the next
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Another must have!  This movie was well worth the wait.  My boys and I have watched this movie over and over.  Another movie that my boys have been captivated by.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is so fun! When I have a few minutes to waste, this game really passes the time! Love it! Recommend this game to anyone....... the only negative thing to I would have to say is that it is kind of hard to control the steering when you drive, but it is still fun anyway!! :)
B007V4LKRU|5.0|The best album Rush has come out with in quite a while. The fact that it's available in vinyl and CD says a lot about how this band takes album releases seriously. I got both the CD and the vinyl. The vinyl is a heavier vinyl pressing, like the half-speed mastered albums I still have. And it's split into two discs, double-album style. The sound quality on my turntable is excellent. I don't have one of those plastic turntables either. It's a nice modded Yamaha YP-211 with a Grado GF3E+ cartridge. I'm not one of those audio-phools, but my 18+ years of experience at a local mom/pop audio emporium taught me that price has nothing to do with better sound quality. Rush did a great job with the vinyl and my friends agree...even those that originally thought that there's no way vinyl can sound as good, or better, than a CD. For fans of vinyl, this is a great example.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! I didn't think I would, but honestly you would get it a lot better than the movie!! A must read.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy!  I have now passed down to my teen daughter who is already on the second book!
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is addicting and fun. But you have to have invest points for too much stuff.I wouldn't mind,though if they were easy to get. You have to purchase them or post on facebook for them (which is annoying).However ,if they make invest points easier to get,five star game
B0018AM1YY|4.0|First off, you have to be a Neil Young fan..... Too many people I know just don't like his music. I myself like him so I like this Album. Had his older album... \\"Decade\\" . But that is a three disk set. This one kind of fills in where the other left off. Some duplicates, but hey like I said, I'm a Neil Young fan, And the price was right at the time.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Such a great movie! The cast was fantastic, and they dealt with issues that many of us remember actually dealing with and thinking that perhaps no one else dealt with them: sex, drugs, gayness, mental illness in the family, feeling marginalized, feeling betrayed and angry. Such a beautiful film.
B000002O4X|5.0|Based on the true story of Isaak Dennison and her travels and times of living in early Africa.  Wonderful movie! Great scenery!
B000FA675C|5.0|I have to agree with another reviewer, I also read this book in paperback years ago. Thank you Kindle for this great free book. This is a story that can be re-read for another viewpoint or aspect of a novel. Again, many thanks.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is from the Beautiful Creatures series. The first book was good, and when you start the new books its a whole new set of problems! Good story line, you have to have a good imagination to read these and I love that.
0446519456|5.0|excellent info. was really enlightened by the stories. it makes me think on a more spiritual viewpoint. earth life is so unjust for a reason due to karmic debt. it makes sense.
0767827791|5.0|I am a big fan of the older movies and of William Holden.  Picnic is a slow-paced movie with a great performance by Rosalind Russell, as well as the others.  And, of course, the theme song is beautiful.  I recommend the movie.
B006S009IY|1.0|I have repeatedly notified Amazon of the poor reception quality of some of the older videos. Unfortunately I fell asleep while this was playing AFTER several attempts to adjust it according to previous Amazon instructions BEFORE calling Amazon and AFTER NO success. I REALIZE its cost is only $1.99 but I am TIRED of WASTING money on Amazon videos I either can't SEE or else I can't HEAR!
B000K26ASO|5.0|This Alfred Hitchcock thriller is a real classic.  I was a big fan of Janet Leigh back in the 50's & 60's.  Her shower scene (which will incline you to take only baths after watching it) has been talked about during the last fifty + years.  Anthony Perkins gives a spine-tingling performance as the deranged Norman Bates.  I enjoyed watching the movie 53 years ago and enjoyed watching it again last week...an excellent addition to my collection.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I have all the shooter games if gameloft and I have all the superhero ones too and they all are great. NOVA is my personal favorite though and the only bad thing is the but I installed it anyway the only bad thing is the memory
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|Christmas day, once all the gifts were opened and the grandsons got bored, I let them watch this movie, and they loved it.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This book kept me interested from start to finish.  It has been a long time since I have read a book that was so intoxicating.  Looking forward to my next FOLLETT read!
B008220C56|4.0|The story is Leo Tolstoy's  but the movie is Mr. Wright's. This is a film that is a bit difficult to appreciate, as is the novel, but I don't want to argue about the adaptation from the text.<br /><br /> Joe Wright had already made two excellent films based on excellent novels:  Pride & Prejudice and Atonement,  both featuring Keira Knightley, but in this third collaboration he went a little further in his approach to the material, as we follow the story alternating two perspectives: the world of social rules and conveniences is shown as a theather play: characters move about in a stage, trough the props, having wardrobe changes on the go; and the world of true emotions and conflicts is shown as taking place in the real world.<br /><br />Both perspectives are beautifully shot by Seamus McGarvey and scored by Dario Marianelli, who were nominated for an academy award (both won for Atonement in 2008), actors dressed in costumes by Oscar winner Jacqueline Durran (who had also been nominated in 2008 for her work in Atonement).<br /><br />Keira Knightley phisically may not look very russian, but to me that was easily forgiven watching her in the role, she lifts the emotional weight of the film. I admired also the rest of the cast particularly for overcoming the extra difficulties they were presented with.<br /><br />Poor Anna Karenina's dilemma seems more than a bit outdated for our time, particularly since many movies in trying to appeal to the audience present conducts and behavior which are anachronisms for the period they are depicting, above all in respect to the social roles of women.  Anna's plight: discovering and following love outside her marriage, and the social consecuences it will bring her demand understanding of the audience.<br /><br />That said I must confess that the dual approach of Mr Wright tempted me to think that it was in favor of a smaller budget for the film, as a more conventional Anna Karenina movie would demand more expensive sets, locations,computer imagery to show exteriors of old Russia, but all those are just conventions that almost every movie, however serious it's intentions, offers. And Mr Wright's film's aren't lacking in beauty, in fact it is in that regard that I consider them exceptional, they take on fine and small details, and fill the screen with them, to me his films are impossible to watch just once.
0452295548|4.0|The book arrived as described;I suffered a stroke and it's interesting to read an account that is is so different from my own personal experience
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|great movie and extremely great acting. i am a huge fan of robert denero. so glad to now own it.
B006HL9G10|4.0|That you can set a startup delay is great - you can setup the timer, push the start button, and then get a few moments to put the device down, get to your cushon and get settled before the timer starts. It also has a neat feature that lets you setup multiple chimes as a 'start' - and you can set the rate at which these happen, too!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the writing,I am having a hard time putting it down.  I am  loving every minute of it.  I love the clothes the ladies wear and the settings.  Wow
B007SGLZP8|5.0|While the beginning seemed like just another yarn, it quickly became unable to put down. I had no idea where the story was going and was thoroughly surprised at the twists and turns!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am having a hard time not watching all of these sessions.  I am on # 5.  Just gets better and better.  Should not get  so wrapped up in this.....but I am.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We all enjoy this game! The kids love the game as well as the adults. Who wouldn't enjoy Perry right?
B007VUA7VO|4.0|WOULDN'T THIS APP BE EVEN BETTER IF THE PARTIALLY FULL BATTERY ICON ON THE CAROSEL OF APPS WERE LIVE OR DYNAMIC,  WHEREIN THE ICON WOULD SHOW THE CURRENT STATE OF CHARGE. I WOULD GIVE 5 STARS FOR THAT ONE!
B009AP2G26|3.0|The show seems to be running out of steam. Still great songs and dance numbers, but the plot is going nowhere.
B001TXUPH0|5.0|this is a fantastic show and its completely taken me by surprise with its simple premise - a guy turns to a life of crime to provide for his family. but the writing and direction is so top notch that u cant help but go thru 1 episode after another.  Cranston and Paul are exceptional actors who work magic on the screen together. no wonder they've both won multiple emmys for the show.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great games it has a good selection. Some are easy and some are a little hard. a few are nearly impossible but all in all its a good app. expecially for car trips.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Jason Mraz is so very talented. Lyrics, voice, guitar ----- His music literally speaks to life's real issues. Can and have listened to this as well as his other CD's over and over
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this book and I wished it never had to end.I loved the ending.I think anyone who loves fantasy romance will love this book.
0062014536|2.0|First of all, let me say that I loved the first two books in this series and I reread Pandemonium in preparation for Requiem to be released. I went into this book feeling completely torn whether Lena should choose Alex or Julian. By the ending, I was completely disgusted with the whole series. I was hoping to read a book focused on the character development and was disappointed to reach the end of the book and find out the author wanted to give a heavy handed lecture about \\"tearing down walls\\". What started out as a series about love morphed into something depressing and bleak that was more about the problems with love. Julian and Alex's characters are both very flat in this book. Hana's chapters are clearly the best part and the only part of the book that worked. Don't waste your money on this book. Check it out from a public library if you feel the need to finish the series.
B001F12J48|1.0|This is red/blue glasses 3D, not the  kind you need for the new 3D televisions. I was ended up giving it away.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|There is an IT professional, a student, and a child all playing this game. It is not something you can play just one of. Once you start, it really is hard to stop. Grade A game. Thank you.
B009GESJH2|5.0|What a career.  What a growth pattern.  Amazing entertainer!  There is a requirement here for they just asked for 11 more words and so I am just typing now
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It's fun. No joke. Kids or adults can play this game. It is a great one to pass the time.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I have this game for the PC. I didn't expect it would translate well on a phone, and I was right.<br />The smaller screen makes it hard to see the shapes, and even harder to click on the shape you want to select.<br /><br />However, when I played it on the Kindle Fire, it was a GREAT game! The play is the same as on the PC - you are traveling with Phineas Fogg from the book Around the World in 80 Days. You get to explore scenes from different parts of the world as you play match three games to progress. The match 3 games are not too hard, and there is variation in the way the boards are presented.<br /><br />Once you play through the game, you can play it again, but the story will not change. You will just get another chance to play the match 3 boards. Not a problem, but something to consider if you want a game that will last. Once you finish it, you may no longer want it on your tablet. I have spent several hours and have more than half of the game to go, so I expect it will last a while. However, I will likely delete it once I finish it.<br /><br />Overall, a good app for people who like Bejeweled, but prefer the match 3 games with a storyline. If you do not have a tablet, though, this is a pass.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play this game often. I like that you do not have to submit information to Facebook. I just play and have unknown friends. I can enjoy it with out worrying about sending my friends information or app requests that they do not want. This is great.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|While I liked this book, I did not love it. I felt his was a little too killing oriented, I know that was his job I felt he enjoyed it too much.
0316123587|5.0|If you are a die hard Glee fan, or just like the show, this is a must for you. It is made just like a high school senior year book from front to back. It contains about every subject that would be in a real year book, with a lot of facts about the students. Also contains many pictures that fans will love. If you are a fan, do yourself a favor and get this book. You will enjoy reading it and browsing the pictures.

Perhaps all that running should have helped him work it off! at least by now. lol<br />I love this game. just wish it'd let me log into facebook again..
B004AYCWY4|5.0|This is a very well written, well-defended explanation of evolution aimed at those who try to deny science.  I find it very useful for having debates with the close-minded (even though I know they will never let themselves listen).  It's also great for those who understand the basics of evolution, but want some more of the details of the science behind it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am fully enjoying the fast reply to it and it is very formative at a glance.thank you for it.
B000GRUMPU|3.0|Poseidon is the remake of the classic Poseidon Adventure disaster movie from the 1970s.  It is much flashier and glitzier than the original, but didn't have the same main character investments and storytelling of the original movie.  I didn't really care as much for the remake's characters.  Or whether they survived.  It's certainly watchable, but I think you'll find the original is a better movie.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Watching JOHN CARTER on blu-ray was a wonderful experience! The pacing is thunderous - drawing you in all the way through to the breathtaking end. The romance aspect is the big surprise - very powerful, in the tradition of great American classics. Special effects? FLAWLESS. The action is everything I expected and more ... this movie absolutely carried me away!
B0083I90HU|5.0|This book was my book club choice for the month. I am not often reduced to tears when reading a book, but I found myself sobbing during many parts of this book. The humanity of Sarah's story. The pain. The ability to never forget, or forgive herself. What her story did to so many others. So many families who were touched by her story. Her ability to never share her painful story with those who loved her the most. The secondary story about Julia Jarmond and her obsession to tell Sarah's story and try to track her down. Her inlaws connection to Sarah's story. It was a rich and beautiful read that I will reflect back to for years to come. I was unaware of the history behind this story as I am an American and we don't do a great job teaching American history let alone european Holocaust history. This story made me want to learn more about the Vel Div roundup, and about what happened. It was a powerful period of time and France is still trying to make amends for the horrific events of the summer of 1942.  It is so hard to believe that humanity allowed this to happen. Yet it did happen. I would recommend this book as it tells the story from a young girls point of view, and makes the significance of the \\"key\\" something you will never forget.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|does a descent job of protecting the kindle but the fold under support feature is a little weak. when I am in a restaurant or somewhere I use something else to support it on a readable angle.

1907590331|5.0|I am grateful to John Steinbeck for book \\"Of Mice and Men\\". This novel allows me to compare lives of people in 1930s and nowadays. After reading the novel, I begin to evaluate my life in a different way. I understand that I live in a great time.  I glad to have many friends around me. I almost have the same dream as Lennie and George. I believe my dream will come to a happy end.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Awesome movie, one of the best Bond's made! A true must have for any Bond fanatic! Daniel Craig kills the role again!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie is suspenseful throughout its entirety. I appreciated the attention to original event details. Plus I learned more about what really happened.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is way too much like 50 Shades of Grey. There is a rich gorgeous man with a silver tie and beautiful eyes, the main character with a best friend/roommate, and an elevator scene. And that was just the 1st chapter. I stopped reading after that.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The actors in this movie are all excellent, which is why it is a pleasure to watch.  The characters and plot are somewhat simple, though, which is why I only give it 4 stars.
0307476464|4.0|I just finished this book and it was actually the first Murakami book I've read.  There are plenty of things to not like, as many reviewers point out.  It's over 1100 pages with a limited plot, there's quite a bit of repetition (the amount of times he repeats himself when describing a character's physical appearance is borderline comical), and some of the plot is outlandish.  But still, it worked for me.  The alternating chapters between the two characters kept me interested and there were some decent themes to ponder.  I don't think this was a work of great literature students will be studying for decades, but I do think it challenges the reader to think on top of having a decent (if sometimes drawn out) plot.  I also enjoyed how despite the length of the book, the author didn't over-complicate things with too many different storylines and characters.  It's complex enough to be interesting but I appreciated how the plot could still be followed with ease.<br /><br />Definitely a big commitment to read but I thought it was worth it.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Great novel in the vetinary practices of the 1930's - the 1950's. His crystal insight into the personalities of th people he came into contact incredible. Very funny and interesting. At age 60 ... I fell in love with this series while in college during the 70's. Strongly recommend the whole series.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I didnt know anything about George R.R. martin until the Game of Thrones series on HBO. I had gotten out of Fiction reading a long time ago. I was tired of waiting for Season 3 to start so I thought I would see how the books were. I am hooked.

B00797MB0O|1.0|Boring, pathetic and lame.  Couldn't even make it half way through.  I don't even understand why there is a dog in the movie.  The poor thing just gets left behind to crap on the floor.  Aweful
B000JIHP88|4.0|The colors and music are a lot of fun for my baby. She can keep looking at it for a long time, but it has too many stimulations and so she cannot fall to sleep looking at it. Its more for play time than sleep time.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Very well written show with a great cast to back it up, If you like the show White Collar, which is also on the USA channel, you will like suits, I really have a hard time deciding whether I like White Collar or Suits more, both are great shows.

B004D1CK32|5.0|I always doubted that this movie was worthy of being one of IMDB's top 20 ranked movies on the site, but after watching it I can see why it is so well liked.  I am only 19 but have always enjoyed old and new films, if you don't like old films you might not enjoy this movie, but I still recommend it to anyone who enjoys a classic.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never would have guessed that I would be drawn to a show about zombies! Although after getting past the first few episodes of the series, I realized that it really is not about the zombies. Zombies are just the instrument of the apocolyps that the real subjects are being left to deal with, and those subjects are truly some amazing characters!  After the first 2 seasons totally clenched my interest it was hard to imagine where the writers would take us next. Season 3 has sggnificantly raised the bar! The worst thing about buying the entire season is trying to keep myself from pushing the &#34;play now&#34; button again, after watching one or more episodes! ...The cliff hangers are working here guys!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Easily the best show I have ever seen, I usually get a little bored from some of the other serious HBO shows like Rome, but Game of Thrones is entertaining the whole way through.  It features great acting and an amazing story.  I don't usually read books, but after watching this show I wanna read the entire series.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|What a great period mystery.  Kate Morton has captured the past as well as written a real page turner.  The story grabs you from the first page and is good till the very end.  I'm definitely going to read her books.

B001EC2IV2|2.0|Some scenes are just really funny, like the ones with Robert Pastorelli or whatever his name is...but lazy directing gives way to lazy acting from Vanessa Williams and Arnold...the rest of the cast is just along for the ride.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I'm not sure I'd give it best picture, but it might have been a really bad year for movies.  I loved the download.  It was a very good movie.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Not only is the language easy to understand, it is presented in a way that makes total sense.  I read this years ago, and didn't get as much out of it as I have now.  There is a time for everything!  All that Ruiz talks about is very possible and takes commitment and time.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I set up the account and named my horse but I just did not find the site, user-friendly or engaging which is the whole purpose of a game such as this. Sorry.
B006HL9G10|2.0|I originally rated this app with 5 stars. I've downgraded it to 2. As many others have noted, the functionality has changed and the Amazon version can no longer be updated. The developers added a &#34;login&#34; function which is unnecessary. Wish I could get the old version back.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|What is there bad to say about this movie? This certainly was my favorite Harry Potter movie, up until the second part of this movie. It wasn't even my favorite book (The Goblet of Fire was my favorite) but they definitely did the best job with this movie.
B000W93CHC|5.0|\\"World Without End\\" is an epic triumph of historical fiction; an uncommon love story for those not fond of love stories; a bold and fitting sequel to Follett's landmark \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\"  Set in mid-14th century England's fictional town of Knightsbridge, two-centuries after the author's sprawling saga of building the city's Gothic cathedral, Follett spins a remarkable tale of war, treachery, death, disease and, of course, love spanning the interwoven lifetimes of three Kingsbridge families.  \\"WWE\\" reads a lot like Bernard Cornwell with a smart bit of Ariana Franklin (\\"Mistress in the Art of Death\\") throw in - rich in historical detail, lore, and culture, combined with masterful storytelling and a lively pace.  And while loosely a follow-on, don't be bothered if you haven't read \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" as this one easily stands alone without the need for the predecessor's context.<br /><br />It is 1327, the year in which King Edward II died under sinister conditions, the reign passing on to his young son Edward III.  Four children, including Merthin, 11, and his younger brother Ralph, 10, wander into the forest to test a new bow-and-arrow, where they stumble upon an attack and subsequent killing, setting a thin central plot for the novel - and the next four decades.  Merthin and Ralph, sons of a down-on-his-luck knight, are the descendants of \\"Pillars\\" genius architecture, Tom Builder.  Merthin is small, wiry, and brilliant - in direct opposite to little brother Ralph, who is not only bigger, but is already showing signs of anger and cruelty that will determine the course of their lives.  Accompanying Merthin and Ralph on that fateful November day are Caris, the clever daughter of a wealthy wool merchant, and Gwenda, daughter of a penniless serf and thief.  Putting these very different family backgrounds to good use, Follett is able to paint a vivid picture of Medieval life, from an overbearing Church to the merchant guild, the privileged lives of nobility, mechanics of the feudal system, and the early decades of England's 100 Year War with France.  The raging bubonic plague plays large in shaping the twists of fate of this rich set of characters; a struggle between religious dogma and an emerging enlightenment in the medical arts.  The budding and frustrating love story between Merthin, the talented builder and Caris, bright, independent, and untamed, is a poignant and beautifully told literary feat.  In contrast, the brutal and lustful Ralph rapes and pillages on both sides of the channel, finding his own brand of fame through treachery, cruelty, and some timely good luck.<br /><br />Weighing in at over 1,000 pages, Follett has plenty of time to build characters and multiple story lines - and he does is with aplomb.  But despite its length, \\"World Without End\\" is neither tedious nor complex.  Combined with \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" this is legend of Arthurian proportion - a swashbuckling adventure and as good a slice of Medieval life as I've read.  A highly recommended cross-genre read that will have very broad appeal.hanics of the feudal system, and the early decades of England's 100 Year War with France.

9889979942|5.0|Tom Carter's book \\"China:  Portrait of a People\\" is an amazing insight into the Middle Kingdom.  I have lived in China for many years, but unlike Mr. Carter there are still many parts of this country which are unknown to me.  His book is like a roadmap to not only the 33 different provinces and regions, but to the people.<br /><br />Like many westerners I came here with a \\"One China\\" policy.  Oh sure, I knew there was Shanghai and Sezchuan and Cantonese...oh wait, those are restaurants back home.  In fact that is about all I did know concerning this vast country.  What I came to discover, as Tom shares in this book, is that China's 53 different minorities live vastly different lives in climates and terrain that vary from the heat and sands of the Gobi to the snows and peaks of the Himalaya to the bamboo rain forests of Sichuan, where the pandas live.<br /><br />It isn't all pretty.  For every bright faced school child heading to class and a promising future there is a gangster, a prostitute or a mentally ill beggar.  China's economic surge over the last decade has been amazing, but some of the people he met during his travels were unfortunately never allowed to live the Chinese dream.  However in between these extremes are everyday Chinese, the \\"Laobaixing\\" or \\"old hundred names\\", which is a term Chinese use to refer to regular people, the people who share the most common surnames and place in society.  It is through them that you can get to know the real China, and Tom Carter's book is a great introduction.<br /><br />Finally I want to say that Mr. Carter's photography is not only compelling, but often riveting.  There are clues in these images which come forward with study.  The little stories in the fabric of a jacket, or the contents of a basket.  And his portraits often capture an emotional connection with his subject which add even more impact to his overall narrative.  That he was able to capture such images with a ten year old Olympus digital camera that hasless resolution than almost every mobile phone produced today speaks to the abilities of the artist to thrive in spite of not having the latest Canikon.

B00BMVTS1S|3.0|The previous characters returning is all that saves this. If you enjoy this world, and like LOTR, you'll like this. If this is your first viewing of Middle Earth, you'll likely be confused and wonder where this dragon is. CGI and epic battle scenes can only keep you going so far, and then, the strange new characters like the brown wizard will leave you scratching your head.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a really good book.  I started reading it just because a friend recommended to me at the end I was so grateful.  It has a message and teack to appreciate the life.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have to say the colors in this movie come out so nice on my 3- D tv. I think they made this movie very well the grapics are Brilliant.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It's a epic movie based on the part that it's about a bad guy who just wants to be good. That's all we want sometimes, to change. Its a sweet, awesome movie and I don't have much to say but...buy this and watch it. It's worth EVERY penny.
B0058N2T3K|5.0|I just love the old scary movies ,such as this Freddy Krugar collection and it's on blu ray which is even better.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This was very hard to maneuver and no clear directions. It was hard to get the person to go in the direction that you wanted to go and hard to pick up the pages.
B000S57KVO|5.0|I feel better about myself just having Sinnerman in my collection!  ;-)  I like the Sting song, the Bill Conti stuff will likely never get played again (it isn't bad, just not my style), but I  LOVE Sinnerman so much that I'll give the whole thing 5 stars.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Anyone who loves music should absolutely own this film.  In addition to being a fan of music, I am a huge Dave Grohl fan.  He has a deep passion for music which is completely infectious.  I did find it ironic that I bought the film on BluRay seeing as the film champions making music the way is was meant to be, a sort of conversation between the artists.  I loved it!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I would only recommend this book to die hard John Corey fans.  Matter of fact, I am going to give my buddy grief who read it before me.  Yes, the smart ass humor of John Corey is as amusing as ever, but the plot is weak and is very drawn out.  629 pages is at least 4 times longer than needed to spin this thin yarn.  Poor follow up after The Lion which I liked.  I have read all of DeMille's books and this is one of his poorest.
0385344333|2.0|Ive loved a lot of Lee Child's books. They are very captivating. But the plot on this one falls short of my expectations.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Reading this book made me understand the various reasons why people on both sides served, and what was in their hearts.
B0093LINVK|4.0|I purchased an internal wireless card for this PC but I ended up not installing it based on other reviews.  This was not a show stopper but it almost made me rate it 3 stars.  That is something they should have considered in initial testing.  However, this is a great little PC.  Works well with wired network connection.  Drives two monitors extremely well (IMO).  i really like the ease of use with two monitors.  I use both HDMI ports
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it was a fun and brain game. Love to play it and will add more in the future to play.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|It was so perfect it's hard to believe that Bill Murray had his falling out with Harold Ramis after this one. One of my favs.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|Really interesting perspective to write from. A genuine book about love and mothering. An honest look at our desire to be more than the sum of our parts, to matter, to mean something<br /> To love and be loved.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Not a game... a sensation! Great music, great history. Joy!<br /><br />It is a game for starters who want to get a different experience from PS3. Forget shooting, running or jumping. This game is about feeling.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I played the game for hours and it was really fun. Very unique idea for a game. Then today, everything was reset back to zero. Start over??? don't think so.....uninstall.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the variety of games and that there are four different levels. I have not not been bored by this game either,  as I have gotten bored by others.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app and I use it every night. I just set the timer and drift off to the sounds of rain.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really do love the easy touch to this game. I play sometimes more then once a day. I like the first one best.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Interesting and exciting, but it is no best picture of the year to me. I like movies based on fact, so it was good in that way. significant
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks never disappoints me. I enjoy all his books so far. Definitely worth your time to read. It will keep you on the edge of your seat as you start to realize what is going on.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This iteration of Holmes is action-packed, with big name actors. They only do three episodes a season, so the quality is undiluted. It's the only detective show I know people my age (in their mid twenties to early thirties) to watch, so if you're in that age range, try it, you might like it, and if you're older, this is what's hip these days!
B005GIS1WA|4.0|The animation is very well done. Expressive characters and the carnival scene is amazing. The realism is amazing - you forget you are watching an animated movie during that sequence. Cute story line.
B0063IH60K|4.0|enjoy it but constant  pop ups are so annoying!!<br />wish it had more variations as might get boring<br />but it is free so go for it.<br />works fine on my kindle fire.<br />'
B003HC8I5M|5.0|Different than Collin's norm, but familiarity with the old favs.  Makes you want to dance. If you like Phil's voice and the motown sound, get it!
B00271HAK8|5.0|I watched this because everyone always talks about it and now I know why, its a great movie! I feel like older movies in general have much better plot lines and acting. Great movie, highly recommend!
1451695187|1.0|The author was obviously having some type of brain seizure.  The only way to Heaven is through JESUS CHRIST.  I consider this book to be fiction.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This is amazing. Beautiful. Amazingly  beautiful!! Love it, am listening to it all the time.  Boz is just simply incredible and his voice still makes me weak in the, uh....knees.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved this book. Captured my imagination for our near future virtual revolution! I loved the attention to detail and it was a thrill getting all the references :) would definitely recommend this book - and wish I could log into the OASIS right now!!
B002PEP4U0|4.0|This boy's story showes some of the history and the plight of the people of his part of Aafrica. I find it to be educational and entertaining.
0307352153|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a former academic turned university librarian owing to his personal realization that he was more introverted than he had previously understood and had finally found peace when he recognized it, and then found work more suited to his personality style. I usually do not rush to read a book just because someone mentions it, no matter who does the recommending. But his relief from the insights he discovered in her book made me go for it.<br /><br />What I liked immediately was that at last someone was writing about something that I and many of my professional colleagues (we facilitated behavioral simulations for mid and senior level management in organizations for many years) consistently found to be true--that the ones who often know the most about a situation or business context are not often the ones making the decisions or even being consulted for their knowledge, these being those who using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicators would be labeled as much more introverted than extroverted. If these more knowing ones were consulted, many business fiascos and other crises could be avoided or downsides minimized. But we do live in an extrovert-worshipping nation, the price for which is increasingly being paid for by us all.<br /><br />Susan Cain has pulled together many important ideas that resonate more correctly, based on what I and many behavioral consultants actually observe in practice, compared with anything offered by the limited, if not out-dated, underlying premises of traditional and often polarized/dichotomous interpretations of what constitute introversion or extroversion in human behavior.<br /><br />I not only found her insights important for validating what I have long known to be true professionally, I also found her book personally life affirming and emotionally freeing from the bondage of being presumed to have failed to live up to the extrovert ideal, an image which I found exhausting in trying to maintain. I am but an over-exposed introvert who can relax now.<br /><br />Cain's \\"Quiet\\" aids others like me to get free of the burden of responding to (or caring about the views of) those more extreme extroverts who hold wrongful assumptions (paradigms) about how a more introverted person (one who may have learned how to operate in a world of extroverts) should respond to situations and/or socialize to survive in the context at hand.<br /><br />[\\"Quiet\\" is the Hermit's Choice Book Award winner for the 17th Annual National Hermit Week celebrated June 13-20, 2013.]
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very cute movie--entertaining for both parents and children. If you're not an Adam Sandler fan, though, you might not love it. (Your kids will though)
086571701X|5.0|burried the old ticker that day was this one...  I had bout 2 others n made this one the king kong battle stick...  and it worked!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I had heard this movie was differenrt but I was pleasantly surprised at how personal it was.<br />It had a really great subplot as well and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Bond films but is also looking for movie where it's not just action all the time but a real requirements to think as well.<br />Good movie but I know some Bond enthusiasts may not be so enthusiastic as it is not the usual non stop action and explosions as it shows a different side of Bond.
030758836X|1.0|I did not like the book at all - some of the puzzles were intriguing, but all the characters were thoroughly dislikable, so it was not enjoyable for me.<br /><br />The condition of the item was excellent, though, as was the shipping time, and I appreciate that.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|And I can't believe I'm saying that.  Because ten minutes into this film -- once I realized what it was going to be about -- I was ready to pick up a book.<br />Tear-jerkers... or touching... or moving... or heart-rending films (or books), aren't, as a rule, my thing.  But -- to the extent that \\"The Sessions\\" was any of those... well, in the end, I didn't even care.  Or, really, notice.  What I did notice, though, was a thoughtful, brilliantly well-done (and acted) film about... being alive.  And how well some of us do that.<br />So...  I'm happy in the extreme that I hung in there with it.  Because film-making simply doesn't get better than this.<br />Sadly, though -- judging from the slim box office receipts -- relatively few people saw it.  Which is a genuine shame.<br />And another shame is how ignored this film was by The Oscars.  Yes, Helen Hunt (deservedly so) was nominated for her work in \\"The Sessions,\\" but as far as I noticed, that was it.  No nomination for John Hawkes; no Best Picture nomination; nothing else.  Which, I'd say, just underscores how irrelevant and meaningless The Oscars have become in recent decades.  But that's another subject.<br />To anyone who hasn't seen \\"The Sessions\\" yet, trust me on this:  You won't be sorry if you do.  At least you won't be if you're a fan of great film-making.  Or ever spent more than a few seconds reflecting upon the vagaries of life.  So, if you fall into either of those categories,  SEE THIS FILM!  You won't be disappointed.  It's an absolute gem.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|A big fan of both Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman. The video quality streaming through Amazon Instant Video is excellent!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this one and I hope a sequel comes out soon! I wish there more games like this for kindle fire!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|epic... just epic. best racing game ever. great graphics, great everything. very addictive. one of the gratest racing games amazon appstore will ever see
0385349947|4.0|It doesn't matter if you're a working mom, stay-at-home mom, newly starting your career as a young woman or advanced in your carrer as a mature woman - this book is for you.  Sheryl talks to all the roles we women play in our lives and how we have sometimes mentally, physically, or emotionally \\"leaned out\\" when we should really \\"lean in\\".  She addresses the fears we think or the words said to us and how we respond accordingly (or not). I found this book to be empowering, insightful, fulfilling and exciting.  For the first time I don't feel alone or crazy in my male dominated company.  I would encourage all women to read this book so they too can feel empowered, intelligent and worthy of a happy and full life.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This was great I really didn't want it to end haha<br />I loved it it was amazing required words? Why?
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is Not as fun or as addictive as angry birds, but definetly a great way to occupy the kids.
1897299214|4.0|This book is, as stated above, cute and sad all at once. I loved Delisle's cartoon style and thought he captured the Korean \\"phenotype\\" very, very well. It made me chuckle in recognition and gave me somber pause too. It's worth the $16 or so because I'm sure I'll be flipping through it again now and then.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Charlie is a lovable & confused character that you can both identify with and feel sympathy for. I still enjoyed reading this at 32, especially knowing that perspectives change after adolescent years & troubled high school days. Beautiful story about a sweet yet troubled boy.
B00BE97ONM|4.0|I found this to be an enjoyable story, although some parts stretched credibility a tad.<br />The characters were well-written and believable; an interesting book to spend a few<br />hours with.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Well, I have very mixed reviews on this series.. I didn't want to get involved from the beginning knowing the plot somewhat, but for some unknown reason I had to finish the series. It was very depressing from the beginning an  I just kept waiting for something, anything good to happen, but that never did happen. I was disappointed even at the ending. I expected Kaniss to become this great leader but she seemed very weak until the end. I think I will stick with the love stories next time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is addictive, extremely calms you. You really enjoy yourself taking care of your horse. Excellent graphics, very well  done. You do have the options of playing totally free or spend some $$$ to make purchases for your horse, or to get new horses. If you want to go the cheap way, sign up for some offers to get the gems and coins you need.
1401937268|3.0|I have read some reviewers saying the cards lack symbolism. This is not true. If you really study the images you will see a lot of the same symbolism as in traditional Rider/Waite with a slight spin. Having taken the online course through Hay House I learned a lot.  I don't like the size of the cards. I am petite. They are hard to hold and shuffle.  These are great for beginners because there are words on each card that describe the energy of the meaning.  The Dreamer's journey is the same as the \\"fool\\", just as in traditional tarot. And I love the positive changes of taking the scary images away.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Like most of the other reviewers, I found the game to be great and challenging, but with lacking controls.<br /><br />A suggestion: instead of placing the touch area for controlling the angle a ways from the cannon, change it to a horizontal gesture in the same area as the vertical gesture for the height control.  I thought moving my thumb to get to the right area to control the angle (and then back for the height) was the most frustrating part of the controls.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Fun game,very addictive! Works great on my kindle fire =)<br />I would recommend for travel time, or anytime you have time to relax and use your brain!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game. great for horse lovers graphics are great! I like the games with ito too. fun and addicting cant put it down good time killer
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love these books!  I have read the first book and now this one.....off to buy the third book. I'm really sad that there is only three of them. Can't wait for the movie(s)!!!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Disney nailed it with Wreck-It Ralph! The clever references to other video games and the storyline were fun. Great movie!
0062014536|4.0|Spoilers!<br /><br />I was surprised by Requiem. The first two books were filled with so much realization about love and what it truly means. I was expecting the same thing with Requiem, but I was surprised how little of the love triangle between Lena, Julian, and Alex actually filled the pages. At first I was annoyed and angry, then I flipped to the pages at the end, then I read all the reviews online. Everyone else seemed to agree that it was sort of frustrating how Lauren Oliver had chose to handle the love triangle she created. After awhile of stewing over this for a few days I finally got back into the book, and I realized that there's something more important going on in this book. It isn't about who Lena chooses.... its that she has the freedom TO choose. And that's what this book is about. It's about the people fighting for their freedom. In the book Lena even says that the choice could be the wrong choice, but we still have the right to make that choice. Many felt like the love triangle was unresolved, however I think Lauren Oliver gave us enough hope by what Alex says to Lena at the end... It wasn't the book I expected, but it was intense and very well written. And most importantly, I can understand why it ended like it did.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Game is fun but have to buy &quot;gems&quot; in order to speed up parts of the game. Other than that it is a good way to waste some time.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|It was a gift for my boyfriend who loves Led Zepellin Music. He said it's awesome and the likes it a lot. I recommend this product to everyone
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is a great movie, not just for the special effects etc... The moral and cultural lesson is there as well, should one choose to see it.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books. All of them are awesome. If you like to dream about someone, they will be the best choice for you :D
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Reading this book should be mandatory for anyone who has so much as a checking account.  Certainly for anyone who votes.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Very good I enjoyed the movie. Maggie Smith is very good at acting this movie (Gosford Park). Highly recommend movie.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|This book was a revelation that keep me rivited 'til the end.<br />Having lived in Brussels ~20 years ago, that added to the interest but, the story was clever and the twists in the plot credible.<br />Great, fun read!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Bought this because it is of course a family tradition to watch this movie on Christmas.  Very heartwarming with great morals.
1616550414|5.0|I got great service and the package came in quick! definitely will use this again for another product buy! Very pleased.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Hilarious!!  A def. must see.  My daughter wanted this for Christmas, and I'm so glad I got it for her.  We watched it together and then again as a whole family with my son and husband.  They even enjoyed it.  And the music in it is so cute and catchy.  My daughter downloaded most of the music to her phone and we listen (and sing along!) in the car all the time.  A really cute movie!
B004IFYMYI|5.0|I got great service and the package came in quick! definitely will use this again for another product buy! Very pleased.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is enjoyable to me  as I enjoy stories of this nature. Keeps you interested and looking forward to the next episode.
