B000GIXEIG|3.0|Unless you just get a kick out of--<br /><br />1. sweeping, windy, frigid landscapes with a sort of terrifying beauty<br /><br />2. modern revisionism that updates a classic adventure tale's meaning<br /><br />3. extremely attractive Northern European he-males<br /><br />--you may wanna skip Beowulf.<br /><br />And yet...and yet, I suggest you try it, even though I was less than blown away.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well, certainly number one above. Visually, this film takes you someplace stunningly cool (metaphorically, not just literally), an environment so bleak in spots and so callous in others and so apathetic to human suffering, that it's a fitting background for this stark tale of revenge and bloodshed and loss and heroics and loyalty. A cold wind surely does blow, outside and inside the soul.<br /><br />Also, you may enjoy the revisionist take. Grendel is now the terribly injured party dealing with a sort of bigotry for his \\"monsterhood\\": He and his kind are hated for being different, ugly, smelly,  not evil. (I believe, if memory serves from the long-ago high school reading, that Grendel did represent evil, and not merely a symbol of aggrieved minority.)<br /><br />And almost certainly you will enjoy the charisma of actor Gerard Butler. That man is good. He can act--see THE JURY or PHANTOM OF THE OPERA or DEAR FRANKIE or even CRADLE OF LIFE to see how he can inhabit various types of roles and make them come to life with that combination of personal magnetism, vocal expression, facial expression, body language and just plain emotive power. I have no idea why this man is not a huge, huge star. He's got everything it takes, the complete package of ridiculous good looks and acting chops and versatility. He can be funny or menacing or romantic or so vulnerable you weep. Perhaps 300 will do it for him in 2007.<br /><br />As to the others: Stellan Skarsgaard is dependably good as an actor, if not always top-notch. He's good here, definitely a man chased by a Gredelian fury for his bloody deed long ago. Sarah Polley is less effective as the witch, and yet not totally ineffective. She simply was miscast. (She was terrific in THE SWEET HEREAFTER and I liked her in GO! and know she can act. It's just not a good fit for her, this role.)<br /><br />Still, at the end of the day, Gerard Butler and the marvelous landscape are the two reasons to buy or rent or just borrow this DVD. Two potent forces of nature--Iceland and Butler--do manage to make a somewhat lackluster movie work in spots.<br /><br />Bottom line: Try it, because parts of it work. And if you're a Gerard Butler fan, buy it, because he is a gift to cinema and quite easy on the eyes and ears. And if you can't travel to a high Northern wilderness, but kind of want to, visit a remote and windy spot with BEOWULF & GRENDEL.he witch, and yet not totally ineffective. She simply was miscast.

1582701709|4.0|Some people will truly hate this book and toss it as new age [...]. The premise of the secret is not to simply wish and you will receive. The premise is what you put out in this world you get back. So if you continously are negative and you'll get negativity back in your life. However, if you put out positive thoughts you'll get the positive things back.     For example, if you want to be debt free. You can't continously hammer on about how poor you are and you'll never get out of this mountain of debt. Instead, the book tells you to envision being debt free, ensure you know how that feels. Then once you accept its possible put a plan of action together to achieve your financial freedom! However, you have to believe its achievable!     Basically, the book tries to help you think/strive/look for the good in situations - to not immediately go for the negative. It's not simplying 'wishing on a star' and if you believe you'll get it... you have to look for the deeper meaning in the Secret.     I'm working on changing my life and being a happier person - this book is certianly helping me achieve that. In other words, you make a decision to be happy and positive.
0385334176|4.0|Classic Vonnegut mix of humor, pathos, satire and social criticism.  From 1979's Jailbird to present, he's been on a string of winners.  They're not all stone cold classics, but every one is worthwhile read and has much to recommend.  This is no exception.
B000LC55F2|5.0|If one had to pare down THE PRESTIGE to two words, they would undoubtedly be \\"dark\\" and \\"twisted.\\" Coming from director Christopher Nolan, who gave us the BATMAN BEGINS gem, this shouldn't surprise anyone. Nolan is also responsible for the successful somewhat underground-ish film, MEMENTO, another flick that fits perfectly within those two pared-down words.<br /><br />Similar in style to THE ILLUSIONIST, but with much more substance, The Prestige has a unique flow and some surprisingly good acting from previously unknown places.<br /><br />Like Memento, the story jumps around time-wise, going from present tense, to past, then even further past before heading back to present tense (excuse the use of literary style rather than film, as this seems to also apply here), director Nolan has given us a study in revenge based on the lives of two fictitious magicians in the late 1800s. They are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman, THE FOUNTAIN), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, BATMAN BEGINS). Initially friends who's relationship is shattered by the death of Robert's wife after a terrible on-stage accident, the two become mortal enemies in a one-upmanship that leads to bad ends for both men.<br /><br />The two opponents are willing to do whatever it takes in order to be the best magicians in the world. This often entails \\"getting one's hands dirty.\\" Severing body parts, breaking one another's bones, and using anything and anyone to further their goals is a necessary evil.<br /><br />Double, triple, and quadruple-crosses await the viewer in this stark but beautifully filmed movie. The sets are awe-inspiring (in their own dark way) and each shot given plenty of thought with regards to shadow and contrasts.<br /><br />The big winners for the film, though, are the script and a surprisingly excellent performance by David Bowie as the genius (and real life) inventor Nikola Tesla. Melding fiction with nonfiction was a nice touch and added to the overall concept of the film.<br /><br />Many may be able to figure out \\"the big secret\\" long before it's revealed (this reviewer was able to deduce it rather easily), but this won't take away from the enjoyment of the film going experience. The great acting, moody sets, and applaudable screenplay will keep most viewers enthralled regardless.<br /> <br />Many may be able to figure out \\"the big secret\\" long before it's revealed (this reviewer was able to deduce it rather easily), but this won't take away from the enjoyment of the film going experience.

B000KJU1HI|5.0|The first edition of Don't Look Back was the first DVD I ever bought and I bought a DVD player the same day.  <br /> <br />It is an execellent example of the power and pitfalls of \\"cinema verite/direct cinema\\", a style emerging in the 1960s made possible by lightweight sound sync cameras and recorders, zoom lenses, and fast film stock.  The \\"who threw the f-- glass\\" altercation followed by the cruel juxtoposition of Donovon offering \\"Song for You\\" to which Dylan responds with a smirk and \\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue\\" is one of the great passages in documentary film. <br /> <br />You may love or hate Dylan's music and after watching the film, you aren't left with any illusions about him being a nice person.  But he is a force of nature.  Lyrics poured through him, some timely, some timeless, raw ones and delicate ones.  For me he was always better on recordings than in person, and the film reminds me why.  But I'm glad to have this glimpse of  the artist. <br /> <br />I don't know about the \\"deluxe edition\\".  It may be worth it for the higher quality telecine transfer.  The original film does not need amplification.  It reveals more about Dylan than the bloated \\"No Direction Home\\" that used so much of the same footage.
B00003CWTI|3.0|This is a perplexing, very uneven film.  It has great moments, it has adequate moments, it has really good dialogue, it has really bad dialogue, etc., etc..  It runs hot and cold throughout the whole film.  First, the good.  PT Anderson gets many points for the sheer ambition of the film.  Anderson is of the Gen X generation, but he has very little in common with his peers.  He's very ambitious, and rarely makes gratuitous pop culture references in his films.  Second, the game show sequences are well edited and put together.  Third, the camera work is first rate.  Fourth, the opening sequence (shot on an old, handcrank silent camera) gives the film a great introduction.  Now, the bad.  The film goes on too long.  It needed to be edited by an hour.  Jason Robards's first scene drags and drags.  Some of the dialogue is atrocious.  There's a very painfully bad scene with the cop (John C. Reilly) talking about keeping the music at a good level.  It just goes on and on, and the fact that the cop doesn't recognize that the woman he's talking to is on coke is ridiculous.  The story of William H. Macy's character being in love with the bartender is silly and contrived.  We're supposed to feel empathy, but we end up laughing at him.  Julianne Moore's character is badly underwritten, and her breakdown scene in a pharmacy is really awful.  Cruise's character breaks down too easily with the female reporter.  And the ending is way too over the top.  It really doesn't come as a surprise.  It seemed PT Anderson wanted to do something really memorable for the end, but it ends up being memorable for all the wrong reasons.  There are some reasons to see this film, but maybe not enough reasons to watch the whole film.  Still, an interesting failure.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I must say that this movie was amazing. If you like action packed movies, then this is the one. It kept me on the edge the whole time I was watching it. The action is just too cool. LOL! Hey, it's worth buying. Add it to your collection, you won't be disappointed.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Communication is vital to human survival; be it diplomatic, within family units, or at border crossings. There are tons of examples of deadly ends that have resulted due to miscommunication. And this is the premise for BABEL, a film winning (and probably destined to win) many movie awards. Although I think this is fine, I do think it a tad unfair for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First is that comedies are often pushed aside at these award shows in favor of dramatic roles. I point this out because this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE shone brightly with many award nominations but won too few. Comedic timing is probably one of the toughest achievements when it comes to script and acting, and to simply pass them by is the biggest shame in my estimation. Which brings us to Babel...<br /><br />Although thought-provoking and interesting, Babel isn't the monolithic film accomplishment I was expecting. After its multiple wins at Cannes and its Golden Globe pick-up for Best Picture, I was expecting a righteously perfect film. I did get a good film, an enjoyable one. But legendary? Above Little Miss Sunshine? I don't think so.<br /><br />Stories are about people, and Babel has that and a bit more. Perhaps too much more. Similar to CRASH in composition, Babel tells its story via a triad. The first is through the eyes of Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), a married American couple on holiday in Morocco. Well, not really a holiday. They are there to try and save their marriage after the SIDS death of an infant son. Both feel equal amounts of guilt and blame toward the other. While driving in a vacation bus with other tourists, Susan gets hit by a bullet fired from a hillside by a ten-year-old Moroccan kid and his elder brother. Richard, forced into the role of a caring husband, must now try and save his wife's life while in the middle of nowhere and with limited communication skills in this foreign land.<br /><br />The second part of the triad takes place in Southern California and concerns Richard and Susan's two surviving children as they await the return of their parents from overseas. Amelia (Adriana Barraza), an illegal Mexican immigrant, watches over their kids and needs to go to a wedding in Mexico. Unable to find another babysitter for them, she reluctantly crosses into Mexico with the kids thanks to her cousin Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal, THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP), a reckless man with a short fuse temper. Once in Mexico, everything goes fine. The wedding is beautiful and original in appearance. But crossing back over the border into the U.S. presents some nearly fatal results.<br /><br />The third and final part of the triad involves a deaf-mute Japanese teenager named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi). Battling with her mother's recent suicide and her own growing sexuality, Chieko struggles to be understood in a world that's alive with sounds she'll never hear nor understand. Her father was also a great big game hunter and once gave a nice, new rifle to one of his guides as thanks for a successful hunt; the same gun used to shoot Susan in Morocco.<br /><br />There's a fourth leg to this story, too (not really a triad now, is it), in that the Moroccan boys and their family are unfortunately involved in the shooting of the American through their own foolishness and the illegal obtaining of a high-powered rifle (which was supposed to be used to kill jackals that eat their goat herd).<br /><br />The big problem with the entire story is that it's built on such a grand scale that it just can't stand up under its own, great weight ...especially when comparing it to something like Little Miss Sunshine (which got the audience VERY intimate with its characters). That's not to say that Babel isn't watchable or even good. It is both. I'm glad I saw it. But on par with Little Miss Sunshine and the like?

B000005S5N|5.0|Scoundrel Days. The title says it all. It's darker and deeper, and more serious than a-ha's debut album Hunting High And Low. If you're not ready to discover something beyond happy(-ish, a lot of Hunting High and Low's songs have sad undertones in their stories), lighthearted pop music, don't go here!<br /><br />If you are ready, however: GO FOR IT. This is probably one of the most amazing albums ever made. The title track starts it off with a bang: did a murder happen? Is the world ending? Maybe, but who really cares when you hear Morten Harket's voice soar up, up, and away, and Mags' and Pal's instrumental skills grow stronger and stronger with each moment. Each song follows a little storyline, I think. Except perhaps 'We're Looking For The Whales' (my favorite song off of this) and 'Maybe, Maybe', which are the lightest songs on here and can be fun, sort of like a comic relief for a tragedy.<br /><br />The cover of Scoundrel Days reminds me of U2's The Joshua Tree. Or is it the other way around? This was made a full year before that.<br /><br />The colors on the cover definitely reflect the songs within: angsty, a little dingy in a good way of course, with a big sky of hope!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This isn't a romance movie, or anything of that sort. It was a beautiful look at a life outside of ours. A world of bliss we'll probably never see. I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was very heart felt. My whole family laughed, and cried.
B000002GVO|4.0|The first three tracks take any classic rock fan on a great escape through the immortalized American dream. As Henley once said \\"Every band has their peak. This was ours.\\" Although Victim of Love is a well respected ballad, the remaining songs were written/directed essentially on the `get this album out on the charts and let Billboard sign the singing' aptitude. Unfortunately, most every great rock band of the past has had no choice but to age their stage to the typical Greatest Hits CD of today. Nevertheless, Hotel California has remained a studio decadence throughout the years - no lost guitar picks about it.
B000050HTO|5.0|Bob Dylan is the greatest living American composer. As essential to his generation as Irving Berlin and Cole Porter were to theirs and sure to be remembered with the same reverence. This is a great collection of most of his finest work -- all remastered. An avid Dylan fan, I can't help but notice the absence of some of my favorites, like Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You, from Nashville Skyline and One More Cup Of Coffee, from Desire. I guess I would have liked to see a three disk Essential -- he certainly deserves one. That said, it is hard to argue with the song selections. For example, other than the original Greatest Hits collection, which was originally released in the '60's, this is the only other place you can find Positively 4th Street -- his follow-up single to Like A Rolling Stone. <br /> <br />If you want to purchase one disk for your CD collection that best represents Bob Dylan's body of work, this is the one to get.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|After seeing this film twice, I am counting myself as someone who rates The Departed as a very good film, but certainly not up to par with Martin Scorsese's best films, such as GoodFellas, Taxi Driver or Raging Bull. He covers familiar ground with this film, and its been done with greater effect in movies like Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The performances are quite good, especially DiCaprio, who tackles a \\"tough guy\\" role for once. Nicholson, however, is over-the-top in several scenes and is channeling Jack Torrance from The Shining. I just don't buy his Whitey Bulger-type character in this film. Damon is quite good, as is Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin. But none of these roles are anything new in a Scorsese film, and I couldn't help but think I've seen this all before. In addition, the romance angle between Damon/Farmiga/DiCaprio seemed quite contrived and not very believable. I found her performance to be quite weak, considering it was the only role in the film for a female. The film certainly keeps your attention for 2 hours or so, and there are some shocking scenes of violence that ramp up the excitement, but Marty has made better films. If he wins the Academy Award for this film, it will be the typical Academy \\"make up\\" award for past endeavors.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is an absolutely fabulous collection of songs!  Two CDs, great price, fun to rock out to!  I love it!
B00005JLRT|5.0|Not sure what is up with the negative reviews but, personally I loved it. It does a good job of trying to intergrate all these characters into this movie. The role Data has in this is great and the picard/clone relationship was good. Riker and Troi have their moment and we even get a Janeway, Wesley, Guinan appearance. Might have liked one more space battle but, the last one was very impressive and the general end was impressive and wasnt' expecting it to happen the way it did. In general it just showed me why the TNG was so great. Even in the interaction between the crew is vintage STar trek TNG.  <br /> <br />The only downside is that Worf one of my favs didnt' have a big role but, for the price here it's a must buy
B0000640VN|5.0|That is the beginning of a line where Leopold is high jacked into going way outside the box as a Duke from the late 19th century, somehow stuck in the early 21st.<br /><br />Wow, this movie is fun, funny, interesting, witty and quick.  It is not laugh a minute funny, yet it will make you laugh at loud at times due to Leopold's experience with a city he know so well, New York, but in a time he does not relate to.<br /><br />This is a renaissance man type movie again.  Yet, there is a renaissance woman type of approach to this as well.  You see, both Kate, played by Meg Ryan, and Leopold, played by Hugh Jackman, have a complete grasp of who they are and where they are coming from.<br /><br />Jackman really shows his versatility in this movie.  Instead of the tough demeaner you see in some of his other roles, he shows a sense of poise, culture and strength.  He has a lot of charm and you really believe this is the way he is.  Ryan, really plays a great role as an up and coming research executive who is on somewhat of a fast track.  She is so different from the meeker roles she has played at times.  Ryan too shows her versatility as an actor.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber and Breckin Meyer also play great roles.  Liev is a seemingly unlikely inventor and Breckin Meyer plays Kates brother, actor in training who learns a lot about how to relate to the world from his new friend Leo.<br /><br />This is a great movie, little or no language, no violence, nothing that would offend anyone really.<br /><br />There is some action as well.  I recommend watching the theatrical version first and then the directors cut.  There seems to be more surprises in the theatrical version.

B000CC4GEW|5.0|Director Sergei Bandarchuk recreates the 1815 battle of Waterloo.  The phrase 'They just don't make 'em like that anymore' immediately comes to mind.  You will never see another film made on this scale again with literally a 'cast of thousands' of uniformed soldiers and extras.  Vast in scope.  It will all be CGI from now on, which can be very good, but will never equal this kind of huge undertaking.  The only scene's that can top these are from Russian director Sergei Bondarchuk's previous, even more epic film, War and Peace.  I think I can remember reading in Guiness Book of World Records one time that he used 100,000 men from the Russian Army to recreate the 1812 battle of Borodino in what may be, adjusted for inflation, the most expensive film in history. I understand he again used Russian Army soldiers as extras for this film.  <br /> <br />This is a film that deserves a top notch remastering into HD.  This version is good and well worth watching but you will understand what I am saying because of the tremendous amount of detail present in the film that just does not fully come across in this transfer. <br /> <br />I thought Christopher Plummer played Wellington to perfection as far as everything I have ever read about him and his actions during the battle.  Rod Stieger is great as Napoleon with all of his personal quirks.  All of the other actors seemed well cast. <br /> <br />I don't know if it's true that there is a longer version or not but a few early scenes do seem rather disjointed such as the part where Napoleon has just won the battle of Ligny.  There is absolutely no lead in for the viewer and virtually no developement of the character of the Prussian  Marshall Blucher.  If you had never read on the subject you would be completely lost.  Some of the scenes perfectly recreate famous paintings of the battle I have seen such as the charge of the Scot's Grey's and the attack of Napoleons 'Old Guard'. The attention to detail is superb. <br /> <br />This version has one problem and that is the subtitles will not turn off once you have turned them on, so don't do it.  The English subtitles are completely rediculous, if you actually read them, they are so far off from what is actually being said to be a complete joke.  Otherwise, it's Chinese characters, which are at least less distracting than the assinine and distracting English one's.  How this is the only version available is beyond me. <br /> <br />So do yourself a favor and check out this great film.

1401200605|2.0|I'd like to preface this review by saying that I really respect Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee and the work they've done on various titles over the years; they've added a lot to the comics field over the years and I consider myself a big fan of each of them. <br /> <br />   That said, \\"Batman: Hush\\", the tremendously-hyped team-up of Loeb and Lee on Batman from a few years ago, was quite the let-down.  There have been worse stories done, but when you consider the past performances of this arc's creative team...well, I would have thought that there would have been a much higher glass floor that the book couldn't possibly fall beneath.  The art is fine, a high point for the book, but I really don't agree with any assertion that it stands out in any way from the other Batman material that was being published at about the same time.  If we look at all the Bat-related books being published in the same era as the \\"Hush\\" arc, there was a lot of great art being done, some of it still widely unheralded today.  The story writer Jeph Loeb (who's shined on such titles as Superman and Cable)has come up with is, in itself, a good one, an intriguing premise.  It's how that premise is handled, and, more so, the surprisingly weak handling of the characters, where the arc runs into trouble. <br /> <br />   \\"Batman: Hush Volume 1\\" reprints #s 608-612 of the ongoing Batman series (the rest of the \\"Hush\\" arc runs through 619 and is reprinted in the \\"Hush Volume 2\\" TPB) as well as a previously unpblished two-page prologue by Loeb and Lee called 'The Legend Of The Batman: Who He Is And How He Came To Be', which is actually one of the best parts of the whole volume.  The basic premise is that a number of linked crimes are happening - beginning with the abduction of a young boy - that are all part of a larger scheme, and are deliberately constructed so that the Batman will know there's more to them than the obvious, will know that he's being purposefully provoked to follow up deeper and find out what is truly behind it all.  (If you're thinking that this sounds like a great basis for an extended Batman arc, I'm in agreement 100%.  This could have been such a Tremendous story.)  A number of Gotham's highest-profile 'freaks' are participating in these crimes/ruses, and it's immediately a question as to whether they're in on the whole plan or are being manipulated.  Again, sounds good. <br /> <br />   Now, the downside: Batman is the Dark Knight, an intense, fearsome creature of the night with an iron will and a veiled abundance of compassion and nobility beneath the darkness and the ironbound fury.  Most of the time.  Here, though, the Batman's character is changed in so many ways, often subtle, sometimes more open.  The darkness and the intensity are played down, but with them drop the brighter aspects of the character as well.  We're left with a character who - in absolute contrast to the Dark Knight who's been built up over the years - seems to have little sympathy for the various people he protects; who comes off as innately cold and heartless rather than the cauldron of turbulent emotions kept in check only by an iron will and a deep-rooted phschological fear of his own emotions; and whose motivation is murky at best.  Another botched characterization - an even more egregious one because at least the Bat retains something of an 'open-to-interpretation' factor - is Poison Ivy.  Ivy's part in the flow of this book is her participation in a scheme to abduct a child for ransom, and have him left in a state where he's going to be killed anyway even after the money is delivered.  This Is Not Poison Ivy, not if you're going to try and be in any way consistent with the last decade of her portrayals.  The other partner in this job, Killer Croc - that's arguable.  I would say that most of the time he wouldn't kill a child, but his personality has always fluctuated along various states of the moral spectrum, the same as his physical appearance has - it's part of themakeup of the character.  Although there have been times Croc's been a more sympathetic villain it's not his constant state, and I can accept that at the time \\"Hush\\" takes place his psyche could have shifted again into a raw evil, or a near-mindlessness.  Poison Ivy isn't a child-killer though.  Read \\"Batman/Poison Ivy\\", her role in the \\"No Man's Land\\" mega-crossover or the two-parter in Detective Comics #s 751 and 752 (yet to be reprinted in Trade form, I believe) for a better representation of the character.  She will kill, but only for what she considers the greater good and only those she feels are guilty.  Her pyschological state may be questionable at times, but she's not blatantly evil like the Joker or Mr. Zssazz, and money has not been a significant motivating factor since her earliest days.  It doesn't end there - in flashbacks Thomas Wayne seems mishandled as well, although not so badly as some of the others.  Catwoman comes off right though, once you're into the story and realize what's behind her initial actions.  The Catwoman/Batman romantic angle though, feels contrived, not the way one would have hoped it would be when the books finally got around to opening that door wider. <br /> <br />   Okay, with that out of the way, time to focus on some of the good aspects of the book.  The story Loeb's created has a lot going for it, and even with the characterization hampering its flow (and too many convenient coincidences) it still manages to pick up some momentum and suspense - although this also seves to remind one of how overall great \\"Hush\\" could have been.  Jim Lee's art is a high point, and he does a particularly great job in the chase and fight scenes that take place high over the city, on rooftops and using cable-guns, and captures the dynamic, fast-paced nature of such action to great success.  His best drawn character is Killer Croc, who's just monsterous.  The cover to 610 is awesome.  Back on the writing side, a couple of unexpected cameos arevery effectively woven into # 611, and are a welcome surpise. <br /> <br />   So on a technical scale \\"Hush\\" has quite a bit going for it, but the twin banes (no pun intended) of falling so short of what it clearly could have been, and of the unfortunately inconsistent depictions of some of the DC Universe's best characters, add up to quite a disappointment.  Batman books in general, books written by Jeph Loeb in general, and books drawn by Jim Lee in general, all surpass \\"Hush\\" by a nice margin.  Oh well; not everything can be brilliant.  At least there are the good points (like the art on Killer Croc and the really neat guest-appearances in 611) to keep it from tanking too badly.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I came across this movie on television right before Christmas and started watching it with my 2 1/2 year old grandson thinking it would keep him interested for a short time.  WOW, he would not stop watching and neither could I. He almost couldn't make it thru each commercial. I ordered the movie from Amazon and it is probably one of the best purchases I have ever made. My grandson is still watching it at the end of February. I highly recommend this movie to anyone any age. Bless you Tom Hanks! You did a wonderful job.  We Love it!!
B00005B4GU|4.0|The world was speechless after Radiohead burst into the new millennium with KID A, their fourth album, which bore little resemblance to any of the group's earlier work.  Still, Radiohead was set to become the biggest band in the world; however, when they released AMNESIAC the following year, critics and audiences labelled it \\"more of the same\\" and began championing a new band for the title of \\"biggest band in the world\\": Coldplay.  AMNESIAC is, admittedly, taken from the same sessions which produced KID A, so it could be called \\"leftovers\\", and it does at times feel like that.  For the most part, however, it's a strong and underrated album.    PABLO HONEY had \\"Creep\\", THE BENDS had \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", and OK COMPUTER had \\"Paranoid Android\\", but KID A had no moment of signature brilliance.  AMNESIAC's moment is \\"Pyramid Song\\", written about one of Thom Yorke's dreams.  It has other great moments, like the simplistic yet surprisingly cool opener \\"Packd Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Can\\", the barren \\"Knives Out\\", and the band's brilliant foray into jazz, \\"Life in a Glass House\\" (recently featured in Alfonso Cuaron's CHILDREN OF MEN).  Unfortunately, most of the other songs sound like mere experiments, pointless exercises in ambience and techno oddity.  As a whole, AMNESIAC sounds a lot more distant and surreal than KID A, and a lot less brilliant as well.    AMNESIAC isn't rubbish, but it does feel like KID A's leftovers (the track \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" is simply an alternate version of the song \\"Morning Bell\\" from KID A).  Through the majority of the album it seems as though Yorke and the gang were simply drifting off into dreamy ambience, or just experimenting.  There are some excellent songs, and it's still a good recording, but it's also Radiohead's weakest album.  Although they would still retain a strong fan base for years to come, this was where Radiohead threw away their opportunity to become Earth's biggest band and instead just went their own way - but asthe subsequent album proved, there's nothing wrong with that.
0823016714|5.0|What a great resource! There are so many different types of people and so many different views that I imagine I'll be busy sketching for long time. My only complaint is that the book should have been spiral bound so it could lay flat.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After completely changing their sound with 2000's KID A and 2001's AMNESIAC, the fate of Radiohead seemed uncertain.  Where would they go next?  They'd already passed on their chance to become the world's biggest band, and they'd lost a lot of fans who loved the band for its strong, dreamy 90's alt-rock sound on the group's first three albums.  It all came together in 2003, when the band suddenly reappeared with HAIL TO THE THIEF, a 14-track masterpiece spawned from the recent (negative) changes in the political landscape.    A big part of why HAIL TO THE THIEF is such a success is that the band combines the strength, aggression, and subliminal protests of their early albums with the oddity and surreal techno sound of KID A and AMNESIAC.  The result is Radiohead's finest album since OK COMPUTER, and also their darkest and most unsettling.  On HAIL TO THE THIEF, the band is no longer trying to take a stand.  To them it seems that time is up, and they're just going to rub it in our faces, with lyrics like \\"We can wipe you out anytime,\\" \\"You have not been paying attention,\\" and \\"We tried but there was nothing we could do.\\"  Listening to this album, I can't help thinking that Radiohead is the best band since The Beatles, and that HAIL TO THE THIEF is the Radiohead equivalent to THE WHITE ALBUM, a diverse collection of songs (though these are, of course, considerably more morose than anything The Beatles ever composed).  Though there's not a bad or even lackluster song in the bunch, there are a number of songs that stand out above the rest, such as the firey opener, \\"2+2=5\\" (a reference to George Orwell's masterpiece of dehumanization and paranoia, 1984), the rolling \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\", the brilliant \\"Myxomatosis\\" (the very sound of rage), the dreamy, drifting \\"Sail to the Moon\\", the surprisingly down-to-earth \\"Go to Sleep\\" (the most \\"normal\\" Radiohead song since OK COMPUTER), and the hopeful yet bizarrely morose \\"A Wolf at the Door\\".      The band is at its finest, both performance- and composition-wise.  These are some of Thom Yorke's most intricate and meaningful lyrics, to which Thom lends some of his finest vocals.  Strongly supporting him are razor-edged guitar from Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien, prominent bass by Colin Greenwood, and impressively varied drumming styles from Phil Selway.  The album's themes deal primarily with the feeling of paranoia, distrust, suspicion, and disillusionment from the 9/11 attacks as well as the Iraq War and the U.S. government's handling of the situation (guess who the titular \\"Thief\\" is?).  It was clear that Radiohead was back in a big way - they experimented on KID A and especially on AMNESIAC, and HAIL TO THE THIEF was where they combined that with their pre-Y2K sound to make one hell of an interesting recording.
B000A6T262|3.0|I love Star Trek, every movie, even The Final Frontier(it has the classic Trek humor between the characters which I love). So my 3 star rating is not about the movies. It's about the fact that Paramount never releases their movies with deleted scenes added back in, or even in a separate category to view. I have seen some of these movies on television, where deleted scenes were shown, and it is very upsetting, and maddening, that I cannot have those same scenes added to the DVD's. For instance, on The Wrath of Khan, we see a young ensign who dies with a bereaved Scotty standing over him. The TV version lets you understand why Scotty is so upset over the death of this young man...he is his nephew! <br /> <br />Why is Paramount so unfair to its Trek movie fans?? I would pay more for the movies if they would just include the deleted scenes.  <br /> <br />Considering the fact that the fans of Trek have made it the blockbuster money maker it is, I think we deserve to have the full versions of these films.
B00004XONN|5.0|Rarely, if ever, has a band undergone such a transformation as Radiohead underwent from 1997's OK COMPUTER to 2000's highly-anticipated KID A, and rarely, if ever, have the opinions of the results been so mixed.  KID A was Radiohead's introduction to the new millennium, a rebirth of sorts, a slick, electronic landscape that has very little in common with any of the band's previous recordings.  It's no surprise that after KID A, Radiohead lost a lot of fans.  They were simply a new band.  Thom Yorke sounded more at home and less distant; he seemed content to let the millennium truck on by and watch in awe.  That's what KID A sounds like.    The big question is whether KID A was a big flop or a major success.  Given enough listens, it becomes clear that it's a techno-rock masterpiece, but it takes many listens for one to appreciate that.  It lacked the strength of the band's previous albums, though, and it seemed at first like Yorke & Co. had changed their stand.  In truth they were just moving with the times - OK COMPUTER was the late-90s fear of technology, and KID A was the Y2K embracing of technology while trying to figure out what to do next.  And though the album sounds much better as a whole, it does have a few standout songs, like the glittering title track, the bouncing \\"National Anthem\\", the icy \\"Optimistic\\" and one of Radiohead's least-appreciated masterpieces, the dazzling \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\".    One of my favorite parts of KID A is that the band's less-popular members finally get a chance to show themselves off without being drowned out by Thom Yorke's ever-prominent shadow.  Jonny Greenwood's guitar has rarely been better than in \\"Optimistic\\", though Yorke's bass dominates \\"The National Anthem\\".  Finally, Phil Selway's drumming is thick and taut.  Of course, Thom still has plenty of chances to showcase his own talents, though his trademark wail appears only on \\"Optimistic\\" and \\"Morning Bell\\" (an alternate version of which appeared on the subsequent album, AMNESIAC).  All in all, the statement \\"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder\\" means a lot here.  To me, KID A is another Radiohead masterpiece, albeit one vastly different from their previous masterworks.  Regardless of what you've heard or haven't heard, I highly recommend that you give KID A a fair shot.
B00068TJM6|5.0|It was a snap to set and use.  It comes with a little booklet to help with the aeronautical slide rule, if you want to play with that.
B000A0X6HE|5.0|I love Brad Anderson. His low-key directing style along with Christian Bale's magnificent acting make one helluva combination. Michael Ironside is equally entertaining, but then, when is he not? I absolutely loved Session 9, and this is sort-of similar, if only in the way it manipulates your mind. If you are a fan of psychological thrillers and/or intelligent horror movies, this one (and Session 9!) should definitely be in your collection. As an aside, I don't think Hollywood had much to do with this movie, and I'm fairly certain that it's not to be taken as a documentary on psychosis, as the above critic would have you believe.
0374105235|5.0|This is a book that everyone should take the time to read.  It is an eye opening account of what children went through as soldiers,  told by someone who went through these trials.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|The music from season of BSG is awesome...if you like that sort of thing.  It has a moody mix of middle eastern instruments (including a few tracks with Taiko style drums) and voices.  It's not your typical 'sweeping strings' type of soundtrack.  It's much more subtle and moody, creating more of an atmosphere than painting sweeping vistas.
0393327655|5.0|Fantastic.  One of the best books to critically examine the state of religion not just in the USA, but on the world stage.  How do we develop to a greater sense of personal conciousness and spiritual awareness?  Like Descartes, Harris breaks us down only to show us how to build back up.  A must read for those seriously considering philosophy and religion in today's society.
B000J103PC|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  The acting is amazing, from Streep to Hathaway to the minor, supporting cast.  What is perhaps the most entertaining aspect of this DVD is the special featurettes included.  While I enjoy the film, maybe more than any other during this Oscar season, I enjoyed watching these \\"behind the scenes\\" interviews with and about the writers, costume designers, etc.  It is very enlightening. <br /> <br />For those who have heard little of the film (what rock have you been hiding under?), this is a tale of a young college-grad who is searching for an internship and her big break in the world of journalism in New York City - of course.  Wide-eyed and naive on many levels, Andie (Hathaway) stumbles, rather by accident, upon an assistant-to-the-publisher position at the premiere fashion magazine.  Knowing little (or nothing) about fashion, she akwardly fumbles through the first weeks of her internship until she transforms herself by inculturating (some might say \\"selling out\\") into the scene.  She rises to the occasion of the daily bootcamp-like challenges of her job, which leads us to a surprising ending when faced with even more success and a blossoming career in the industry. <br /> <br />This is a cute, humorous, entertaining and well-acted film that is absolutely worth watching!
0449227545|4.0|This book was a bit of a page turner. The most interesting thing about it other than it was a good read like all Follett's books are is that the villain has so many likable qualities that you get suckered at first just like his victims.
B000M341QE|2.0|Martin Scorsese is my favorite director. That said, I now reserve my seat as the only person on the planet to find this movie a hokey, predictable and childish mess. I hold the mob/gangster flick closer than any genre. I can accept any premise and watch it for that level. The premise is delicious: Jack Nicholson as a gonzo Whitey Bulger and an assorted cast of misfit sadist mobsters and dirty cops turn Boston's Southie section into a meat grinder. The cops got a rat, the bad guys got a rat and for the next 2 hours...cell phones and more cell phones. These points are my problem: Can Matt Damons character seriously have achieved such high level status in a state police special operations unit that quickly? Can Dicaprio seriously have been accepted into the inner circle of the most vicious mobster in New England by using a couple brawls and a lousy pedigree for references? Was Damon eventually going to frame that envelope? Going off the deep end to link Dicaprio and Damon by trading \\"sloppy seconds\\" with a nothing character like the shrink? A \\"bugged\\" conversation recorded in a porno theatre that has c.d. studio quality? This is the anti-Scorsese. His trademark style of Mean Streets and Goodfella's isn't here. A lower case, less glorified Irish mob flick with plenty of squibs is State Of Grace. I accepted that movie on its own level. Nobody pumped me up for a re-telling of the Godfather like they did for the dear Departed.
0517288796|3.0|This was not one of Follett's best books. But still, I'm glad I had it on my last trip. It moved pretty fast, like all his books and it was sure better than the movie and made the time pass more quickly.
B00005JKG9|5.0|great acting... great writing (screenplay), great directing, great score, etc...  This is an excellent movie and one of my personal all-time favorites.  It is hard to recall any film that I have seen that displays such brilliant acting by such a distinguished cast.  Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, and Alan Arkin bring so much vibrant energy to the screen that it's impossible to turn away for even a second.  Pacino ended up with the best supporting actor Oscar (if that means anything anymore) and he 'nails' his role as Ricky Roma the slick, smooth, charismatic, slime ball real estate pro who is on a roll and isn't afraid to swagger about it.  However, any one of the actors I mentioned above could have easily walked away with the award and it would have been justly merited.<br /><br />This is my favorite of all Mamet's films and I think his writing was brilliant and right on the money.  I work in the world of real estate (not as an agent though) and I have to tell you that many of these men do act and talk a lot like this.<br /><br />One thing I really also enjoyed was the excellent musical score of the film led by the incredible Mr. Wayne Shorter.  The film's score is so important in my opinion and many times gets forgotten or overlooked when reviewing a film.  Remember the score for \\"Scarface\\" and just how absolutely awful it was?  It almost completely ruined the film, especially the montage scene in the middle.  Thank God that wasn't the case here - jazzy, bluesy, somber, dark, moody, sultry, etc... you name it, the emotion in the music was definitely present throughout the film.<br /><br />Finally, I am sure that most of you have probably read or heard about arguably one of the most famous scenes in movie history, definitely with in the last 30 years, the Alec Baldwin \\"Glengarry Leads\\" speech.  It has become legendary over the years and seems to be only gaining in it's popularity.  No one, I mean absolutely no one, will ever forget Alec Baldwin in this movie.  It is a scene that is less than 15 minutes long but it's the best performance of his career ever.  Bar None!  Case Closed!  Okay, okay, I apologize for being so narrow-minded and subjective, but he is just so great in this role that sometimes I can't help with the over-blown hyperbole.  You will see what I mean after you see the movie.<br /><br />In closing, I love this movie.  However, I can safely say that this film is not for everyone.  I know a lot of great people whom I consider friends who can't stand this film.  It's not that the acting isn't great, or the directing, etc... it's just that it's too heavy and dark and depressing, etc... to take.  Hence, the world we live.  Like a great man once wrote \\"...he who increases in knowledge, increases in sorrow.\\"  Also, not a great movie for kids at all.  Lots of swearing, you will hear the f-bomb more times than you care to count.  The dialogue is very adult and most people under the age of 20 will probably be bored after 10 minutes.  This is a classic.  A mature, Darwinistic, realistic look into a world of just your average everyday real estate sales person.  Well, okay, maybe not your average, but I know guys that are carbon copies of all the characters in this very fine film.<br /><br />Can't Recommend It Enough!er forget Alec Baldwin in this movie.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I've read the negative reviews for \\"Love\\" and I don't agree. Yea, its a rehash of previous Beatle tunes, they can't very well make new ones now can they? The Martin's did a great job of cleaning up the tracks and then putting them over the top. My Favorite is the Cross_Mix of \\"Inner Light\\" and \\"Tommorrow Never Knows\\". George's tunes seem to jump out the most for me, especially \\"While my Guitar Gently Weeps\\", an acoustic demo of the tune with strings added. The coolest thing is that they brought the drums up in the mix and really rocked the tracks up. Cool heavy version of \\"Walrus\\".  <br />I'd like to hear Sir George and son take on more tunes from the Beatle cataloug in this fashon.
038073186X|5.0|This book didn't catch me right away, but within 25 pages I was hooked!  It's one of those stories where I was sad to see it end.  I kept thinking about it for the next 3 days and went back to re-read several sections again which is something I rarely do.  I read a lot and I often figure out the ending before I get there, but not with this one!  I had no idea where the story was taking me and even when I got to it, I wasn't sure that's where it was going to actually keep me.  It doesn't end until the absolute last sentence which can leave you feeling as if it didn't end at all, but after I re-read the ending I was really awed by the way Dennis Lehane put it together.  I have not read any of his other books, but am going to start reading them today!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|McKennitt is always on top of her game.  This may not be too far a strech from previous recordings - but it makes no difference.  It is solidly beautiful.   It has a more Moraccan/Meditteranean feel than previous work.  The music is rich and her voice soars.  She has a fantastic ability to reveal a story through her music. Emotional. Enchaning. Don't miss it!

B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool is the only mainstream (on the radio) band in America still carrying the dim torch and spirit of a fantastic genre of music that peaked in the early to mid 70's and was dying by the 80's. Tool is a link to that period and it is great that they are still on the radio, otherwise unsuspecting retards who like any popular item that enters their earholes would not ever be exposed to it.       Anyway, 10,000 days is nothing new for tool, and I tend to think it's quite a bit less inspired than their earlier efforts, but it's not the same garbage that's on the radio. While it remains true that tool influenced a lot of that garbage (idiots who completely missed the point of what tool is up to) they are still far from it. To expect more is inviting a dislike for practically anything they issue; as I did. So, I would recommend giving this album an honest chance unless you just can't stand tool.
B0000639FE|4.0|For Hollywood movie geeks,and those who like to have \\"good\\" movies on theit DVD shelf,this movie definately cannot be missed. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise plays a sports agent who develops a conscience; loses his job and all his clients.'Show me the money' scene, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr),definately deserved the Best Supporting Actor at the Oscar's - mebe just for this scene (if not the,In Rod we trust flashdance on the football ground). Tom Cruise gave a good \\"supporting\\" performance in the same movie, where Bruce Springsteen sung 'Secret Garden' soundtrack for this movie. <br />Definately this movie '(You) had me at hello'
B000003TAL|2.0|Contrary to popular opinion, I find this album very difficult to digest. For me it went straight through and out my system like a wad of grass. The vocals, particularly the chick's, are bleh (you can hear exactly where courtney love stole her annoying bark from), and the music is just very plain; suffice it to say, plain music is not exclusively bad, but in this case it's nothing special. It's not pretty, it's not exciting, it's not relaxing, it's not anything.     I bought daydream nation to see what all the hype was about, maybe it was the wrong album to initially acquaint myself with, but after listening to it seveal times, putting it away for months and listening to it again, it's still a lump of fiber.     I gave it a chance and I feel like I wasted my time. Don't make the same mistake, unless you are predisposed to early punk/new wave/whatever the heck this is, (which I am not particularly) you might just be looking for something that isn't there.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|It is because of Brad Pitt,that this movie has won some accolades (if it did deserve).The history was distorted,but Achilles did a fine job.None,but Brad Pitt deserved and could have executed that Achilles arrogance. <br />Helen (Diane Krueger) was a waste.This movie was'nt Helen of Troy.But a beauty that could wage an epic battle of Troy (and hence the word,Trojan,emanated from here), this role could have been done more justice by a prettier woman - Catherine Zeta Jones. <br />She looked marvellous in The Mask of Zorro.And she did not have too much of a role to play in the movie :) <br />
B000FBGBPC|5.0|The first Three Days Grace CD was pretty good, however, it wasn't very unique and by now, we're all sick of hearing \\"Just Like You\\" on the Radio.  One X is a pleasant surprize.  Even better than their first album, there is not one bad song on it. <br /> <br />If you've heard \\"Animal I have Become\\" on the radio and liked it, GET THE ALBUM!  \\"Animal I have Become\\" is a very good song but there are some even better songs on the album. <br /> <br />The best are \\"On My Own\\", \\"Over and Over\\", and \\"Get Out Alive\\" - All catchy, very nice melodies.  That said, nearly every song on this album is catchy (with the exception possibly of \\"One X\\" - the title song, which is probably my least favorite track.  I still like it, though). <br /> <br />Yeah, it's nothing overwhelming revolutionary but if you're a fan of Breaking Benjamin, Seether, Shinedown, Hinder, Seven Wiser, even Hoobastank, you'll probably love this album.  In terms of heaviness, it's slightly lighter than Breaking Benjamin's older music, heavier than Hoobastank.  Great album.

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Simply stated: what could reveal Dilla's genius more? Soulful, innovative, jazzy, eclectic, beautiful ... these are the kinds of things that even the most surface-level listen of Donuts will immediately evoke. What is interesting is that Jay Dee, a producer known for chopping breaks in the most imaginative, and thus unrecognizable ways, here leaves them longer, less hidden, giving Donuts a kind of raw, un-cut feel. From one song to the next, you never really know what to expect from this album. An image of what was, and what could have been, Donuts contains some wonderful, yet seemingly incomplete, work. We can only speculate as to how great this album would have been had he been healthy. May he rest in peace.

B0001YFPKK|5.0|If your album is ranked by Rolling Stone Magazine at number 80 among the 500 Greatest Albums of all time, you are probably not too far off from having a veritable classic on your hands and fortunately this is the case here when it comes to \\"Odessey & Oracle\\".  Released in 1968 as their answer to the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" and especially to the Beatles' brilliant \\"Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts' Club Band\\" (coincidentally 2nd and 1st on the list respectively), this album seems to have missed the bus a little when it comes to timing as the whole psychedelic, flower power scene which seemed to hit its peak in '67 was already winding down by the time this album was released and indeed Rod Argent, the creative mind behind this whole endeavour almost decided not to release this probably for this very reason although he thankfully changed his mind eventually.<br /><br />This album features very strong songwriting in the psychedelic genre with the last track \\"Time of the Season\\" truly standing out as one heck of a great song.  Other tracks like \\"Butcher's Tale\\" also stand out as a strong anti-war statement which is still relevant today.<br /><br />This Japanese mini-lp sleeve version is a real treat for all Zombies fans though as the remastered sound quality is quite good although not great but still a lot better than the original sound quality.  We also get 14 bonus tracks in the form of the entire album in both stereo and mono formats and the addtional tracks: \\"I'll Call You Mine - single version\\" and another version of \\"Time of the Season\\" with a DJ preamble off a live radio spot way back when.  The cardboard packaging and design isn't the best but isn't the worst I've seen either and we get all the lyrics in English in a 16-page booklet as well.  Reading the lyrics lets you appreciate just how good a lyric-writer Argent was too.<br /><br />This is a classic album that takes you back to the psychedelic 60s vibe and if you liked \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" or any other albums of that era, you'll just love this.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|What a depressing film. This film is basically about a series of highly unlikely unfortunate events (usually the result of a really bad decision) occurring to a small group of people, with each event more depressing and unbelievable than the last. It's an emotional snuff film, offering only a voyeuristic trip into human misery. If you like to watch people suffer at the mercy of situations beyond their control, then then film is for you!<br /><br />About midway through this film it began to strike me as almost a parody of itself; the never-ending chain of gut-wrenching, anguishing events are truly over-the-top. The same film could have been made simply by filming little children as their pet-kittens are pried from their hands, and then thrown out a car-window into oncoming traffic. Do we really need a film to tell us how random and cruel life can be, or have people forgotten?<br /><br />I found the Asian-girl (whatever her name was ) sub-plot to be by far the most interesting part of the overall story, but, sadly, also the least relevant; why involve the family of the man who brought the rifle to Morocco in this story? Why not be totally avant-garde, and show the suffering of the man who made the bullets at the ammo factory?<br /><br />If you want to spend the evening feeling really, really bad, then watch this film. Otherwise steer clear...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is the by far one of the best sci-fi films ever!!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|What do you get when you mix Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHaviland, a well written script full of action, a music score that is merely fantastic and a supporting cast of some of the best of their day?  The Adventures of Robin Hood is a beautifully filmed, well acted action adventure story that has delighted generations of people.  It is one of my all time favorite movies.  Errol Flynn has just the right touch of dedication and mischeviousness to make this a hoot.  Olivia DeHaviland never looked lovelier.  Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains play their roles to evil perfection.  Add to that a load of charater actors like Alan Hale, Eugene Pallete and Una O'Connor for a fine cast.  Warner Brothers did this right with the \\"Warner Night at the Movies\\" format which includes a trailer of a concurrent film, a newsreel, a cartoon, and a short subject.  Add to that a disc with featurttes on differaspects of the movie and you have a treasure trove to enjoy.

0743455967|5.0|A must read, especially for the aspiring writer, or Stephen King fan. Whether you enjoy writing as a hobbie or profession, this book should be included along with your dictionary, thesaurus, and 'Elements of Style' (by Strunk & White).  <br /> <br />As it is said; behind every great man - there's a great woman; this couldn't be more true then after reading On Writing. Tabitha King, though we seldom hear much about her, deserves alot of the credit for her husband's success. Maybe the King's should consider writing a book together, on marriage & relationships...truly soulmates. <br /> <br />On Writing is good medicine - written from the heart with dedication, love, honesty & humor. Thanks to Stephen & Tabitha King - I've learned to love 'words & writing' again!  <br /> <br />
B000FQ4M58|3.0|Is this album a worthy successor to the \\"Bat\\" legacy? Or, more appropriately, would this album be getting this much attention if it wasn't named \\"Bat Out of Hell?\\" Probably not. The \\"Bat\\" moniker is just being used as a marketing ploy, and without the direct involvement of Jim Steinman this album isn't much different on the surface than Meat's last few albums. That is to say, dust off some old Steinman tracks (preferably from \\"Bad for Good\\" or Pandora's Box) and use the works of other writers for filler. <br /> <br />That being said, it's a fairly decent album in its own right. But let's face it: you're probably interested in the Steinman stuff. It's All Coming Back To Me Now takes a while to get going, but then turns into a powerful duet. The arrangement comes off more like the end title song of a Dreamworks movie than typical Steinman, but it works. During Bad for Good I was briefly transported back to 1977!  This is a great rendition, and the inclusion of Brian May on guitar was a good fit, too. Unfortunately it doesn't fit stylistically with the other tracks on Bat 3; not even the other Steinman songs! Meat has now recorded almost the entire Bad for Good album (let's pray that he doesn't record Dance In My Pants!), so gather up the appropriate tracks, create a playlist on your iPod and get a taste of what could have been back in 1980. The remaining Steinman tracks are hit-or-miss. Steinman has said that he would have picked different songs for Meat; I would've liked to have heard those, and perhaps, some day we will. <br /> <br />What about the non-Steinman tracks? Blind As a Bat is pretty good, and Alive comes closest to the Steinman style, but all-in-all, the rest are just generic rock tracks of varying quality (Diane Warren?). <br /> <br />This album could have come dangerously close to being \\"Midnight at the Lost and Found II\\" containing generic rock tunes gussied-up with titles that mimic Steinman's. Instead, the strength of those generic tunes, coupled with the successful Steinman compositions makes it much better than that. The only thing missing is the Phil-Spector-on-Broadway sound (courtesy of Steinman) that we've come to expect from \\"Bat Out of Hell.\\" Oh, well. I suppose that two out of three ain't bad.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I haven't seen a lot of Martin Scorsese films (there are a lot of crime films I need to go see), so I can't say whether or not this compares to his earlier works.  But I can say that The Departed is a great movie that is a must-see. <br />Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is an Irish mob boss working in Boston.  He has been active for decades, and yet, the FBI and police can't seem to build a sufficient case against him to arrest him.  However, that hasn't stopped them from trying numerous times.  To keep himself safe and have an advantage over the cops, Costello takes one of his young proteges, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), and has him enroll in the Massachussetts State Police Academy.  Meanwhile, Billy Costigan (Leonardi DiCaprio), a man whose entire family has been linked to crime in one way or another, also enrolls in the Academy so as to separate himself from his family and make a name for himself as a good man.  However, his background makes him perfect for an undercover assignment to infiltrate Costello's organization. <br />The two men each keep their loyalties to their actual employers at great cost to themselves.  It immediately becomes apparent that Costello has a mole within the agency, and when Sullivan is asked to head the investigation into finding out the mole, he has to find the balance between showing progress and not revealing too much about himself.  Meanwhile, Costigan is in danger every day; if he were ever discovered by Costello, he would be killed, but he is also forced to participate in the criminal activities, and if he were arrested, the only two people who know he is actually a cop are his captain (Martin Sheen) and sergent (Mark Whalberg).  His handlers would bail him out, but his cover would be blown. <br />One of the main themes of the film has to do with the duality of Costigan and Sullivan; each are posing as something they are not, and it is interesting to see how they handle their situations.  Sullivan is respected and is paid prettywell, though he is truly a criminal.  Meanwhile, Costigan is viewed as a criminal lowlife, even though he is really a good man sacrificing his life for the cause.  Costigan's situation takes its toll on him mentally, driving him to seek council from Marilyn Madden (Vera Farmiga), a psychologist who is dating Sullivan. <br />Every cylinder is firing in this film; the actors all do a great job, the writing is superb, and the music is great (I love the use of the Dropkick Murphys).  The film deserves all the awards it has received and is nominated for, and hopefully, Scorsese will finally win the Best Director Oscar.
B000ICM5W6|3.0|Hulk is a movie badly in need of some editing and a much better ending.  On HD DVD the film looks real good, and the movie does have cool moments like Hulk tearing up the M-1 tanks.  But, the ending is ridiculous, even my comic book film standards, and the first 2/3 of the movies is tedious at times, esp. when compared to gems like Spiderman and Batman Begins, which offer excellent creation stories for their superheroes.
0142404128|4.0|I really didn't know if I would enjoy this book as much as the first since the first half of the book is spent in outer space and not at the Chocolate factory. But once they do return to the factory, it picks up again. I still recommend this book, but the original is far superior. I don't know if I liked how selfish this book made Charlie's grandparents seem. This shouldn't be turned into a movie

B000F7CMRM|3.0|this is a good movie but i think it is unnecessarily complicated. if you blink you are going to miss something and then the whole movie does not make sense.  this would have been a much better movie had the writers decided to make it easier to follow.<br /><br />expect to pay very close attention to this movie with no distractions or to watch it more than once.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|This is a good CD. Devils night is better though.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This film is a gem among gems.Anyone who has worked in the \\"service\\" industry can appreciate the pains to which director Robert Altman has taken to show the \\"abuse\\" that the \\"employed\\" must endure at the whimsical hand of the \\"employer\\".Set in pre-WW2 England,a host of colourful characters (some historically true) gather at the Manorhouse called Gosford Park;they are rich,wealthy,entitled,pampered and spoiled.The in-house servants must prepare to meet their guests every demand ALONG WITH all of the personal servants that have had to accompany THEIR masters and mistresses! What plays out is a very interesting and compelling comedy/drama about all of these people's lives with intrigues among both and between both \\"classes\\";long held \\"dirty secrets\\" are disclosed;even murder occurs in an Agatha Chritie-like twist!What this film so deftly displays is the arrogance with which the elite treat their help,and with what wisdom and insight the working class have towards their \\"owners\\".Servants are people!!! <br />In true Altman style,there are MANY characters with MUCH dialogue that goes on simultaneously.It helps enormously to have the English subtitles through a first viewing to keep all of the people,places and things straight! <br />Jeremy Northam,playing the famous composer Ivor Novello,really gets to showcase his tremendous singing ability (with his brother Christopher REALLY playing the piano). <br />Companion films with similar themes would be REMAINS OF THE DAY,FAR FROM HEAVEN and MAURICE and the miniseries UPSTAIRS,DOWNSTAIRS.
B00005LC1H|5.0|As a fan of Little Britain, Goodness Gracious Me, The Kumars at no. 42, Mr. Bean, My Family, The League of Gentlemen etc etc, I've been hooked on British comedy. We recently received a new British channel here in Malaysia on cable tv (BBC Entertainment) and one of the very first comedies I've watched is Fawlty Towers. I recognized Cleese from Rat's Race but at first I thought the series is old, crappy and Basil's character is quite annoying (and so is Sybil) but the more I watched it, the more addicted I get and soon I'm hooked! I love British humor. Every episodes is fresh and funny. I also love the little 'goof' they have (The sign \\"FAWLTY TOWERS\\" keeps changing at the beginning).  <br /> <br />The DVD is way too expensive for me but if you love British humor, I fully recommend Fawlty Towers and you won't regret it!
B000053VAZ|5.0|No leading man in his right mind would have taken on the challenge of this film.  Not only was the physical comedy extremely difficult, the theme of a peculiar man falling in love with a mentally ill woman was off the charts.  Yet, this is a tender love story, full of smiles, good feelings, fear, anger and ultimately grim satisfaction.  Depp proves his dedication to art rather than box office and he shines in this film with an astonishing array of physical comedy, deep, sensitive characterization and a sense of wonder and amazement no actor has ever been able to achieve.  \\"Innocent,\\" \\"slightly off,\\" \\"low IQ,\\" \\"a stranger in a strange place,\\" Depp captures the awe and mystery of loving life and discovering tender emotion for another.  Certainly his greatest role in an unknown film, following \\"Ed Wood,\\" the ultimate, most brilliant achievement of his career.
B00030DEQE|5.0|I had a different manufacturer's Gigabit NIC that just stopped working at Gigabit speed. <br />I fought with it for a while and then realized it wasn't worth it when I could get an Intel NIC for such a great price.  This card installed easily and I was up and running at full Gigabit speed in 15 minutes. <br />If you are moving really large files, this is a great NIC for the money.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|i'm not gonna get into details about the movie because i don't think i can accurately describe it without taking something away from it. i just want to say that i caught part of this film on HBO & was hooked. visually the film  is dark & dreamlike, with subject matter to match (which i like) After the first viewing i was definitely scratching my head a bit at the end. But the film stayed on my mind. i decided to buy a used copy at my local video store and i have watched it 5-6 times the past week. I'll admit i still don't fully understand everything that is going on. but to me it's not an annoying confusion, the kind where you are like what the heck was that all about?!?!  i was left feeling like i missed something & needed to watch again. I enjoyed sorting things out & filling in missing pieces.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|If you have any interest in the current war in Iraq, I would highly recommend you get your hands on a copy of this documentary.  The only faults I have are that the numbered lessons are not always congruous to McNamara's words and that the off camera questioning of McNamara sometimes sounds loaded and sophmoric in contrast to McNamara's testimony.  Although I disagree with McNamara on very fundamental issues concerning the inevibility of war, I see this as evidence of self-conflict in his complex character particulary in light of the influence he had in averting global holocaust during the Cuban missile crisis.  As far as I can tell, the overriding lesson is that war is the product of bad diplomacy.  We are Americans, we should strive to be good at everything.
B000LGOPW2|5.0|i don't know what that other guy is talking about. This movie is great. if you like tim burton/johnny depp movies like edward scissorhands or beetlejuice then give it a try, i think you'll enjoy. This movie has the same type of visuals & musical score.  plus there are quite a few other great actors, christopher walkin being one of them.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|The Departed is excellent, a must have blu-ray movie. The Departed is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen, VC-1 format, with excellent 5.1 PCM sound. The suspense grabs you early on and keeps you glued to the screen all the way to the end. Aside for some unnecessary vulgarities, the departed is one of the best movies I have seen in years. The Departed is a remake of a Hong Kong movie titled Infernal Affairs. If you haven't seen the Hong Kong version, I highly recommend it. You might also want to know that there is a second movie title Infernal Affairs 2, a prequel to the first story.
B000KRN67C|5.0|This is quite possibly the greatest Rotting Christ album to date.  With a production value that exceeds their previous release, \\"Sanctus Diavolos\\" (I know!  That album sounded great!), and a significantly added crunch to the lead guitars this band is clearly at the peak of their powers.  Not only are there blastbeats aplenty mingled with their signature twin-guitar assault, but there is also an added sense of groove and layered ambience.  The most surprising aspect, besides the incredible production, is the fact that included into the gothic mood and Black Metal attack is a feeling of clear enjoyment in the songwriting.  The energy level brought to this release is superb and infectious, the creativity within the songcraft indelible to the end.  This is a two-disc set.  The first disc contains the actual album with a video clip of \\"Keravnos Kivernitos\\" and four different wallpapers of various sizes.  The second disc is a DVD containing different songs selected from their back catalog, and although the sound for each is muffled and the visual aspect not all that impressive, it is worth seeing just to see how rabidly devout their fans are abroad.  Fans should not hesitate to purchase this album as soon as possible; as for newcomers this is THE place to start collecting.  The total running time is (42:47) but the songs are so detailed with epic production value and furious riffing that it actually plays longer than it seems it should. <br /> <br />1.

0345475674|5.0|\\"Pompeii\\" was my first foray into historical fiction and it was quite interesting.<br /><br />It took me a few chapters to get used to the idea that the event (the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 24th August 79 CE) was true, but the characters were not.  I also had to catch myself a few times while reading this because I started asking, \\"This really happened?\\"  If an author is able to do that, then he/she has done their job of drawing you into their world.<br /><br />The book starts off with an explanation of the superior Roman system of telling time and their ancient names for the days of the week and months.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the modern era's names for the above are close to those of that time.  It never fails to amaze me that we have access to detailed information about everyday things that were around close to 2,000 years ago - and it's accurate!  Unfortunately, it took a catastrophic eruption to preserve ancient history (I've read quite a few times that the ash made the city into a life-sized time capsule with the way it settled).<br /><br />Harris did a great job of documenting the buildup to the eruption through the aquarius Marcus Attilius, his fictional telling of the corruption of the ultra-rich of Pompeii (which could very well be based in fact, as I've read that numerous times in as many books), and who could forget to mention those numerous brothels?<br /><br />It was a shame that so many people had to die because of the lack of knowledge of volcanoes, but when something is dormant for so long you're led to believe it's a dead volcano (and it was generations before Vesuvius came back to life, so the knowledge that it was dangerous was long gone by the time Pompeii became an important port city).  So before people ridicule the Pompeiians for their lack of knowledge of Vesuvius, I would like to remind them of a little incident known as Mount St. Helens in Washington State.  Even though there wasn't the loss of life near the scale of Pompeii with that eruption, there was no excuse to not know about that as 1980 is not ancient history!<br /><br />This was one gem that was collecting dust on my bookshelf.  I decided it was time to see what this was all about and was not disappointed in the least.  I know there are other fictional accounts on the same subject, but this is a good start.<br /><br />And I'm elated to have read this knowing that Roman Polanski is going to direct the (rather expensive) movie adaptation of this soon.  I'm rather eager to see how he brings the timeless beauty of Pompeii to life and how he's going to interpret the eruption and the ensuing chaos for the big screen.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable read.  Harris's sources are excellent and his research was impeccable.  - Donna Di Giacomofe near the scale of Pompeii with that eruption, there was no excuse to not know about that as 1980 is not ancient history! <br /> <br />This was one gem that was collecting dust on my bookshelf.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|Thank God I only rented this movie & even though it was free because I used a coupon ...I must say it was a total waste of my time to watch this utter garbage of a so called movie ! Brad Pitt should be ashamed to be associated with this mess ...however, I suppose for his usual salary of $20 - $30 million per movie, he really doesn't care.  <br />
B00092ZL80|5.0|Earth Wind and Fire are fabulous in this DVD. Chicago vocals are not so good.I watch the EWF performance very frequently and even listen to it as I exercise. The greatest thrill is to experience EWF live performances, I have seen them 7 times in 2007 at the Luxor in Las Vegas.
B000MM0L2S|3.0|Cinema buffs have lived with Maestro Morricone's music. This is a so-so compilation though: Celine Dion and Metallica? Give us a break. Here are the highlights: Quincy Jones and Herbie Hancock's version of \\"the good the bad and the ugly\\", Metallica's \\"the ecstasy of gold\\", Yo Yo Ma's highly emotional rendition of \\"Malena\\" and the three tracks by Morricone himself.
B0000027RL|5.0|I am really not a fan of Vedder these days after seeing him on VH1 Storytellers the other day...I think to an extent, one's political views can cloud the capabilities of musicians to the point where they become completely BORING.  Singing a poorly written song by Tim Robbins is lowering yourself in my book.... <br /> <br />Anyway, back to This great album.  I remembered it from my college days and just had to get it.  I've always loved Jeremy, even though some think it was overplayed back then.  Black is one of those songs I can listen to over and over again.  All the others are great songs as well.  Just a great album.  Too bad Pearl Jam will never repeat it...then again it's probably better that way.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|I don't know why some folks thought this film was 'poor'. <br />It's a cartoon, gee whizz. Even the brief 'woman in the tub' snit, she was covered at all times, steam, towel, behind glass, not like there was any nudity for 'kids' to see. <br />The animation is awesome, they blended CGI and 2-D animation very well. <br /> <br />The Engineer was o.k.,I mean, I didn't see much fault. He does honestly point out to Tony some bad char traits of his. Some STARK board members were total creeps, but hey, thats Corperate America. <br /> <br />We do see Tony change into a more thoughtful person after his accident. There's only so much char developement you can do in one show. <br />The action was great and movie had a twist at the end.  <br />As to the 'original Armour being used a lot', this movie IS an ORIGIN story. You get to see Tony use various models as well. I like this DVD and am very happy to own it. I hope MARVEL makes another!
B00000IBVC|3.0|Nine years down the road, this production strikes me as neither particularly good nor particularly bad.<br /><br />In performance quality, it is typical of the sort of thing one sees from second-string companies, such as--alas!--my own local company, the Vancouver opera.  The cast--satisfactory enough for that level--is resolutely, steadfastly B-list, with Frittoli perhaps aspiring to B+ status.<br /><br />Considering that this is as much a circus as it is an opera, concerns about the quality of conducting are largely irrelevant.<br /><br />In production values, this \\"Turandot\\" holds some interest, but primarily  as a stunt and little more.  It is a production transplanted from the Florence May Festival, a well-regard and respectable source.  That being said, I, for one, would bet that everything about it had worked better in Florence than any of it did amid all the foofraw in Peking.<br /><br />Except for the sheer spectacle of it all, this should not be anyone's first choice for \\"Turandot\\" on DVD.
0743298020|1.0|This book could have been written by anyone. If you like V.C. Andrews style fiction then this book is for you. The story was stupid and I only wish that I had read some of these reviews before wasting my money and time. Life's too short for poorly written bad stories.
B0000009SF|4.0|\\"The Grand Wazoo\\" is different from typical Zappa albums because it's mainly instrumental jazz. No satirical lyrics or crunching rock riffs, just five groove filled songs with plenty of room for improvising.  <br /> <br />The title track is a big-band jazzy tune with awesome solos all around, the shuffling percussion work and walking bass line really move the tune along making thirteen minutes fly by. \\"For Calvin\\" is a weird dissonantly arranged beast that could test your patience. I love the boogie-woogie keyboard break of \\"Cletus Awreetus Awrightus\\" and the quirky horn toot's and vocals near the end of the song are hilarious. \\"Eat That Question\\" incorporates a bit of blues into a loose-formed jam with some great keyboard and guitar work, and finally, \\"Blessed Relief\\" is a quiet, moving, intricate ballad that is the perfect closing song. What a wonderful jazz disc.  <br />
B000GIXEIG|4.0|In 2001, a new translation of the saga of Beowulf was published, and became an unlikely bestseller. How many copies were actually read probably remained on a par with Hawking's \\"A Brief History of Time,\\" or Pirsig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\"-but with this translation the tale I remembered hearing in part as a child was brought into the 21st century. <br /> <br />In 2005, a movie called \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" was released. It bore an interesting twist. Grendel was given reason to hate King Hrothgar and attack his hall: Hrothgar killed his father over a stolen fish, and left the child to starve. This is established in the first minutes of the story, and sets the scene for a movie that explores what might really have happened. <br /> <br />Throughout, I got a sense that the director, Sturla Gunnarson, was trying to look at this from a \\"what if\\" kind of persepctive. What if the \\"monster\\" were not a monster, but something that might have been a last stray remnant of Neanderthal man? Different, but not too different? Details I remembered as a child, such as Grendel dying by having his arm torn off, were given a different slant. The witch, Selma, had been a prisoner of war, forced into the role of concubine, and then outcast. In this rendition, Beowulf is not just an epic hero, righteous and sure of himself, but also a thinking, intelligent man who comes to realize that the king is not giving him the whole story. The troll doesn't harm his men until they offer him insult. <br /> <br />Interwoven with all this is the coming of Christianity to this land, through the blessings of a crazy Irish monk. The new faith offers succor when the old gods don't seem to be doing much for the Danes. Even the king is despairing, drinking himself to death through grief for his lost men and remorse over his own part in this story. He converts out of desperation, and his doing so does give a sense of how this wild land might have come to convert. <br /> <br />While on the face of it the plot does follow that of the saga, the modern twist and at times very brutal and crude scenes do make this more of a nod to the original than \\"the movie of the legend of Beowulf.\\" Taken in that vein, it's entertaining, even thought-provoking. The scenes with Grendel's mother do, however, make little sense; nothing is done to explain where she fits in and where she came from and why she wasn't cohabiting with Grendel and Grendel's father in the first place. Her scenes seem almost stuck on, superfluous to the main action. I would have liked to have seen her explained better. But aside from that, it's an entertaining and interesting movie that I, if not enjoyed, then appreciated. And it's got me thinking that I'd like to take a look at that translation again. It's been, after all, a while.

B00003CXTG|2.0|Pearl Harbor...December 7th...a date which will live in infamy.  This film took on a subject near and dear to the hearts of Americans everywhere, and failed to do it justice.  Fantastic explosions and effects and a quality score from Hans Zimmer could not resurrect this movie from the stench of mediocrity. <br /> <br />A tacked on love story was butchered further by the B-level acting \\"talent\\" of Ben Affleck, but one gets the sense that, even perfectly done, it would not have worked against the backdrop of the terrible attack.  It would be like the soldiers on Normandy Beach stopping for a romantic tryst halfway up a sand dune. <br /> <br />The movie also played out about an hour too long.  The last hour (all AFTER the attack on us) just pushed my opinion of the movie lower and lower. <br /> <br />All that said, I did mention that the movie had solid effects and a wonderful score.  But poor acting and a bad script were just too much to overcome.  Steer clear of this one!

B000000OY9|1.0|Okay, Neil with synthesizers and drum machines. Strike anybody else as stupid? Because this, along with Life, is the worst Neil Young album out there. The lyrics are frequently embarrassing (I've Got a Problem; Hippy Dream; Weight of the World; Violent Side; Drifter), and the aforementioned drum machines and such got on my nerves fast. There's not a single song on this mess worth salvaging. Neil's put out some great stuff, but this isn't an example of what he can do. There's not even a memorable guitar solo thrown in. Skip over it.
6304712936|5.0|'Amadeus' is an all-around well-crafted masterpiece.  It is one of those rare movies that is both frolicking fun and an epic classic.  How much of the movie is true or revisionism doesn't matter as much as how they use true elements to frame the enigma of Mozart's persona and genius.<br /><br />There are two stories really:  The main story is about Mozart (Tom Hulce), but it is told by an aged Solieri (F. Murray Abraham), Mozart's envious nemesis, at an asylum where a priest comes to hear his confession.  Bitter about life, Solieri rails against God Himself for feeling scorned by the eclipse of Mozart's talent.  Every time we leave the narrative into the flashbacks of Solieri's telling recount, we often are shattered as we come back to the cell with the sympathetic but perturbed priest--so absorbing is the story.  Amadeus is reckless and playful.  Having a wealthy father who scorns his son's frivolousness, Amadeus evaporates his monetary resources through wine, women, and song.  For the latter he only squanders through his venue.  For if he weren't such a serious composer and gave lessons, he wouldn't be in such a financial bind.  Considered an eccentric, he is, nevertheless, hired by the Emperor of Austria, to be a court composer in Vienna.  Solieri, an admirer of Mozart, has a big hand to play, for he is in charge of all the court music.  In the company of two other Italian composers, Solieri outnumbers and outpowers Amadeus in many ways.  Solieri has a plot by which he thinks by vanquishing Mozart, he will perversely reek revenge on God.<br /><br />'Amadeus' encompasses the genius of its subject matter.  With eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Abraham, it is one of the greatest films assembled.  The craftsmanship is marvelous.  Neville Mariner's score makes the whole experience worthwhile by itself.  Elizabeth Berridge's portrayal as Mozart's wife yields are sympathy, and Tom Hulce makes the whole affair an entertaining romp.  Even the priest frames our interest with his facial expressions, accentuating the audiences' horror and fascination.  Not to mention the scenery and costumes that have a splendour of their own.  After almost twenty-five years, 'Amadeus' is an untarnished jewel for the eyes, ears, and heart.priest frames our interest with his facial expressions, accentuating the audiences' horror and fascination.

B00000K2VZ|5.0|My favorite Joplin album, even though I'll grant that Cheap Thrills is a better set of songs. The reason I prefer Pearl is that it's better performed than Thrills, with several of Janis' most memorable songs: Move Over, Cry Baby, Half Moon, A Woman Left Lonely, posthumous #1 Me & Bobby McGee, and Get It While You Can. She occasionally slips into soft-rock irrelevancy (My Baby; Truet Me), and while the solo vocal on Mercedes-Benz is innovative, it's not one of her better songs. Regardless, this is Janis' best set of material in her all-too-short career. As usual, Janis' voice is in top form throughout, and the Full Tilt Boogie Band is far surperior to Big Brother & the Holding Company.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|Superbly acted, beautifully executed stinker of a film. It's got some really good messages. Unfortunately they get buried. We had no idea it was supposed to be about \\"communication\\" until I read the amazon synopsis.  <br />It almost seemed like a poor attempt to imitate \\"CRASH\\" which was awesome. <br />But \\"BABEL\\" had a lousy ending, no ending?, and the message was muddy at best.  <br />Cate Blanchett was supremely magnificent as Susan Jones. Brad Pitt gives the best (and most emotional) performance of his career. The acting was wonderful. The filmwork was great. The direction was great. <br />But overall, the movie was kind of a disappointment unfortunately. <br />Again, the individual stories were very good. The whole Japanese storyline could have been shortened or left out. The actress was boring. Just because she's naked, doesn't make her performance compelling. <br />

B0002A2WDQ|3.0|This movie has all the right elements. From script to directing to supporting cast to the music is all excellent. But Ralph Macchio is just the wrong choice for the lead role. Coming fresh off of Karate Kid, the role he will always be remembered for, Macchio just can't shake off that character, and in fact just reprises his Karate Kid role in a different environment. So instead of a great movie about the blues, we have Karate Kid meets the blues. I'm sure the choice of Macchio was all about marquee value and pulling an audience who would not otherwise pay to watch a movie about the blues. But how many 13 year old girls who went to see Macchio in this 1986 film really cared about the blues? And how many blues fans really felt that Macchio was right for the role? Count 'em on one hand! If you can erase the Karate Kid image from your mind, this movie is a loving tribute to the blues accompanied by excellent blues music. I just can't give it more than 3 stars because of mis-casting.
B000002G0P|5.0|\\"3 Sides\\" is simply put, one of the most underrated albums of the 90's, from one of the most underrated bands of the 90's.  After the success of \\"Pornograffitti\\" the band could have played it safe and done a copy of what they had done before.  Instead they put out this album that really moved the band into new territory.  Unfortunately the album did not sell nearly as well as it's predecessor.  I honestly think the material was too good (challenging?) for many of the people who just liked the band for \\"More Than Words\\".  People just looking for top 40 radio fodder probably hated this album because it required the listener to really take notice and get into the nuances contained within.  It also did not help that \\"3 Sides\\" release coincided with the whole grunge movement that killed many 90's era bands.  Many of those bands deserved to be pushed aside, but Extreme was not one of them.  The album is broken up into three sections.  \\"Yours\\", which is mostly metal, hard rock and funk, \\"mine\\", which is more acoustic, folk, melodic oriented, and \\"The Truth\\" which moves into progressive rock territory.  These guys really tried to cram a little bit of everything into this album and it is a resounding success.  Nuno is brilliant on guitar and keys throughout the disc as is Charone on vocals.  The rhythm section is also solid throughout.  The lyrics are for the most part very good, touching on a whole range of subjects including political and world issues, religion, and relationships.  Many of the lyrics on this album are more relevant today than when they were written.  The album is recorded really well too.  In fact it sounds better than many modern day productions, and is a great headphone album.  If you are one of those people who wrote Extreme off as just another hair metal band with limited talent, check this album out.  This album proves that Extreme were one of the best bands of the 90's, it is just too bad that the public didn't get it.  Sadly Extreme's next album \\"Waiting For The Punchline\\" would be a big disappointment.  I don't know if it was a reaction to the way \\"3 Sides\\" was received or record company pressure, but \\"Waiting\\" would be an attempt at a straight forward basic rock album and in my opinion was a big letdown from \\"3 Sides\\".  The band would then break up and go their separate ways.  Too bad, because it would have really been interesting to see where these guys could have gone had they continued down the path forged on the \\"3 Sides\\" album.
1582701709|1.0|I had to force myself to read this book. I work at a bookstore, national chain, and we can't keep it on the shelves so my curiousity was piqued.  I was horrified by the values of this book. Please stop buying this book! It is impossible. It's presuppositions are absolutely limited. In so much that if everyone were to follow the advice of this book it's offerings would fail! Meaning something like this: if thinking about money, acting as if you already have wealth will attract wealth, if this occurs in an environment where everyone is doing it then, well, what would happen? Socialism? Would all the money spread out evenly or would it go to<br />those who most sincerely want money?  These books are trouble. You don't need a book. You need yourself. Nothing more.  An  Egyptian saying attributed (incorrectly) to Jesus: If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you, if you don't bring forth what is within you, what you don't bring forth will destroy you. Or Rilke or anybody other than this [...]. All this stuffs only increases your dependence on these things. The presuppositions of this book are at odds with all the classic wisdom of what leads to happiness.  Why would this lady publish this book in the first place? Doesn't it only prove that it will take some of her wealth away. Secret. The past is a secret and mystery only to those who have spent no time pursuing it but are preoccupied with self-help books.
B00006ADD5|4.0|I thought this movie was good and relaxing. I was able to sit through the whole thing and find it interesting even if i didnt know some of what was going on. The restored version by robert harris is awesome the picture quality is a huge step up from the vhs version. <br />
0770430074|2.0|This novel is very much a \\"cotton candy\\" read.  The book drew me in with some initially enticing, journalistic prose--intense imagery, snappy sentences--but wore thin very soon.  The deeper \\"philosophies\\" behind this book reek of banality: (1) a very heavy-handed attempt to find common ground in Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam and (2) the inevitable triumph of the persistent soul.   <br /> <br />More importantly, the last 2/3 of the book are nothing but the ramblings of this little sophomoric Pi, who is now isolated from all other human contact.  Solitary rumination and interaction with an animal will only take you so far--this is why every genuinely readable book has more than one human character.  Sprinkled throughout is some interesting (but irrelevant and showy) zoological trivia. <br /> <br />Unlike many other commenters here, I found the ending particularly idiotic and unreadable.   <br /> <br />If you are seeking a dilettantish pastiche of feel-good psychology,  Reader's Digest-esque discussion of the animal world, and some \\"Home Alone\\"-style comedy, look no further.  Otherwise, avoid the hype.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This album is a straight up classic from top to bottom.  Every song is great including the intro and skits. Standouts include \\"Gin and Juice\\", \\"Tha Shiznit\\", \\"Murder Was The Case\\", \\"Who Am I\\"(best track in my opinion), and \\"Aint No Fun.\\" This was the last album Dre produced the entire album for another artist and Dre's production did not disappoint. Dre took a whole lotta samples to create a G Funk masterpiece.This album was Snoop's so i gotta give credit where credit is due. On this album, he was young, hungry, and his voice sounded so smooth and on point which perfectly meshed with dre's beats. Snoop brought a whole new flow, look, and attitude to being a rapper. He's so different than any other rapper in the game and that's why I'm a fan. All guests on the album hold their own especially Kurupt sort of stealing snoop's spotlight on a couple songs. I think Tha Dogg Pound should always be the most heavily used guets on Snoop's albums because they got alotta talent and them w/ Snoop create the ultimate Dogged out team. I constantly listen to this album over and over and never get tired of it. I just wish the songs \\"Doggystyle\\" ft. George Clinton, \\"Tha Next Episode\\" ft. Dr. Dre, \\"Gz Up Hoes Down\\", and \\"Playing for Keeps\\" ft. the Convicts were included because each one is produced by Dre and each one is hot. i understand they wanted to keep the album short and sweet and that's why these tracks were not included, but they would make this album even crazier...imagine that? Death Row to this day still hasn't released these songs so i'm getting tired of waiting. This was Snoop in his prime although I also like Tha Doggfather, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, Tha Last Meal, and a select few from \\"Da Game is to be sold not to be told\\" and \\"No Limit Top Dogg\\" but they still don't compare to \\"Doggystyle.\\" His stuff with the Eastsidaz are also solid. People give Snoop a lot of criticism when they only hear his commercial stuff nowadays.  Snoop changes his style up for every album and i understand that and i'm still a fan. All y'all Snoop Doggy Dogg haters need to slow up. Anywayz,I would like to see snoops last album with dre production on every song but this is highly unlikely but would be crazy. If not, we always have DOGGYSTYLE...my favorite rap album of all time. Other West Coast classics are Ice Cube \\"Amerikkkaz most wanted\\" and \\"Death Certificate\\", Mack 10's self titled album, WC-\\"Curb Servin\\", Dr. Dre \\"The Chronic\\", MC Ren \\"Kizz My Black AZZ\\" and \\"Shock of the hour\\", Bad Azz \\"Word on tha Street\\", Tha Dogg Pound \\"Dogg Food\\", Eazy E \\"Its On-187um killa\\",  and so many others. West Coast rap all night betta yet foe life! and i'm out ssssssssssee ya......
B0000CABBW|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults alike. Keeps the children's attention. Exposure to culture, traditions, animals, love and triumph.
B0000041TD|5.0|Karajan always provided a musical featherbed for his singers when he conducted opera, and here he takes La Boheme carefully, with measured tempos to wring every last tear. If you love the opera, this is a wonderful approach (at the very opposite of Beecham's famed mono account with Bjorling and de los Angeles, which is brisk and unsentimental. Well, as unsentimental as one can be with Boheme). On the twentieth hearing I am as moved by this performance as the first time I heard it. Pavarotti in prime voice and Freni as a Mimi to tear your heart out make an unmatched pair--how amazing that they both come from the small north Italian town of Modena.<br /><br />The orchestra and Decca's sonics are vast for such an intimate opera, but that only adds to the emotional excess--a compliment in this case. Harwood isn't the Musetta of my dreams, but she was a Karajan favorite and does well here, far beter than her embarrassing Merry Widow under him. The La Scala veteran Rolando Panerai couldn't be bettered as Marcello, and he can stand up to Pavarotti's overwhelming presence.<br /><br />In sum, I wouldn't change a thing, but canny buyers might anticipate that Decca will release a remastered version someday in their Originals line. The sound is fine already, but sonic updating never hurts. Highly recommended.
0792843584|5.0|I am firmly convinced about three fundamental factors that affected seriously the strong expressive message of the film. The first one: those were troubled times of social hopeless in North America, and the Vietnam memories became tremendously an emotional and affective burden to many viewers. As a matter of fact, Apocalypse now, Deer hunter and  Coming home shocked the collective conscious, that considering the fact that Kramer vs. Kramer, Ordinary people and On golden pond were not precisely easy to watch films, the Academy Awards searched overseas movies such as Chariots of fire (1981) and Gandhi (1981) that bet for the epic side of the life; the second aspect to remark was the excessive introspection around such delicate issue (in this sense, I think there was an European approach) and third the duration of the movie simply didn't' t fit in those times where the last awarded picture was Ben Hur or Patton twenty and ten years ago, but bearable due the epic message within them.<br /><br />But after twenty seven years it would be interesting to turn around and reconsider its values because the truths of yesterday are not precisely eternal, and you know that in which art concerns the majority has never the absolute truth.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Martin Scorsese has never won an Academy Award.  He has directed \\"Mean Streets,\\" \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\\" \\"Taxi Driver,\\" \\"Raging Bull,\\" \\"Goodfellas,\\" \\"Gangs of New York,\\" and \\"The Aviator,\\" among others.  He was nominated six times for the Best Director Oscar, yet never managed to snare one.   For his last two nominations, there was a contingent of show-biz folks who felt he was a shoo-in.  His time had come, they figured.  But Scorsese remained a bridesmaid. <br /> In \\"The Departed,\\" Scorsese's elegant new feature about good guys and bad guys, the director has chosen subject matter that fits him like a glove.  Once again, he returns to the underworld and toys with the complexities of right and wrong in a society in which \\"Might Makes Right\\" rules and bad and good are painted not in black and white, but in shades of grey. <br /> Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston gangster who learned early that you have to take what you want; no one is going to give you a free ride.  He's applied this principle in his day-to-day dealings, terrorizing rival thugs and his own crew.  Despite an ongoing investigation of Costello by the police, they can't seem to get anything solid enough on him to make an arrest. <br /> Having established the criminals, Scorsese switches to a graduating class of police recruits.  Among them is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who, as a kid, was taken under the wing of Costello, and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio), a smart young man trying to escape his family's criminal ties.  Both will figure significantly in the Boston police's plan to infiltrate Costello's inner circle.  Only two men on the force, Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his tough-talking second-in-command, Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), know who that infiltrator is. <br /> \\"The Departed\\" has a superb script by William Monahan.  It is riveting, never predictable, and provides solid roles for its four stars.  The dialogue is rough, as are the men -- both cops and mobsters -- who work the mean streets of Boston.  And there is violence -- a lot of it.  When it occurs, it is often shocking with little buildup.  This tends to shake up the viewer and keep him on his toes.   <br /> Nicholson is an actor it's always fun to watch, but he can be excessive and allow his trademark quirks to run away with his performance.  In \\"The Departed,\\" Scorsese keeps Costello in focus, never letting that devilish Jack wink at us.  Nicholson is immersed in his performance.  As an aging gangster, his Costello hasn't lost any of his bravado, his ruthlessness, or his ability to kill.  Nicholson plays Costello with dimension.  He doesn't resemble any crime figure seen on screen before.  His Costello is unique. <br /> Di Caprio turns in his finest performance since \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\\"  His Costigan is a deeply conflicted guy, placed in a dangerous situation by higher-ups who have faith in him to accomplish a difficult mission.  He wants to succeed, but his personal safety is compromised with each day, causing him to balance his fear with focus on the job at hand.  Di Caprio brings an intensity to the role that audiences haven't seen in his previous work.  This is surely an Academy Award-worthy performance. <br /> Damon and Wahlberg, both natives of Boston, draw upon their own background to provide characterizations of two very different kinds of men.  Damon's Sullivan is a smart cookie who rises quickly in the ranks of the police department.  He is secretive, authoritative, often arrogant to those under his command, and calculating.  Damon gives Sullivan a preppy edge.  His Sullivan is a man who's gone far and is capable of going even further.  The combination of his intelligence, drive, and cold-heartedness makes him a deadly person. <br />  Wahlberg's Dignam contrasts with the laid-back demeanor of his boss, Capt. Queenan.  He mouths litanies of profanities as fluently as an announcer would do play-by-play for the Red Sox.  He's a cop, but he's neverexorcised the tough streets of Boston from his being.  He calls things as he sees them, without tact, political correctness, or artifice.  What you see is what he is.  Wahlberg brightens an already stellar picture by sinking his teeth into this role and running with it.  Like Di Caprio, none of his earlier screen work matches his intensity in \\"The Departed.\\" <br /> The cast is rounded out by Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga, who portray a police captain and a police psychiatrist, respectively. <br /> For the last five years, I've been squarely against excessive running times.  Often, such long movies can be trimmed, benefiting the overall film.  Yet directors continue to give us overly long, padded movies that outstay their welcome long before the final credits roll.  \\"The Departed\\" runs 149 minutes, yet there is never the feeling that any of those minutes is extraneous.  The screenplay is crafted so deftly that every scene, every bit of dialogue, every close-up has a significant role to play.  <br /> I've seen many movies in 2006 and \\"The Departed\\" is easily the best.  No question.  All the elements come together perfectly.  The film's editing is quick and exciting, never sacrificing characterization in the process.  Not since Clint Eastwood's \\"Mystic River\\" has a director managed to corral such talent in a single film and come up with a winner. <br /> \\"The Departed,\\" plain and simple, is masterful movie making.  Director Scorsese has assembled a letter-perfect cast in a movie that showcases both that cast and his own ability to fashion intriguing cinema.
0440238609|3.0|My sister had gotten me the series as a Christmas gift, and in a lull between other books I actively wanted to read, I picked this up with no expectations whatsoever.  I agree with most reviewers here that the first in the series was written quite well, with an imaginitive storyline, a foreboding plot, and well developed characters about whom one could care.  The second in the series was less consistent, and at times I could pick up on Mr. Pullman's personality; I felt less like I was reading a great story, and more like Mr. Pullman was trying to teach me his world view.  I was therefore less than stunned when the last 200 pages of the third installment basically devolved into an anti-Christian diatribe: when Mary, one of the major characters, says \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all,\\" one gets the sense that it is actually Mr. Pullman speaking directly to the reader.  It is a shame that the series deteriorates in this fashion.  I could not help but feel that Mr. Pulman saw the success of the initial books in the series, and saw it as an opportunity to use the third novel in a heavy-handed attempt to espouse his world view of secular humanism, at the expense of any of his readers who actually subscribe to notions of organized religion; Christianity or otherwise.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Even though WALK THE LINE is labeled a biopic about June and Johnny Cash, it's also a solid love story that will stand for years.  Gradually the memories of the couple's musical performances will fade, but the memory of their love transcends simple history.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix shines as Johnny Cash, the romantic and the troubled drug user, and as the man who lost a brother.  Joaquin probably used the loss of his own brother, River, in preparing emtionally for the role, but that had to have been very hard.  Reese Witherspoon makes acting look effortless.<br /><br />The movie carries Johnny Cash from his early years, through the tragic loss of his brother, to his love for music.  I remember listening to his songs when I was a kid, but I didn't know that he toured with and around Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis.  I only knew his country years.<br /><br />The scenes and settings feel right and look right.  The visual storytelling gets choppy and leaves a lot out, but it keeps in all the good stuff as well as keeping the story moving along at a fast clip.<br /><br />Even though everyone knows that Johnny and June will get together, it's still emotional and uplifting when he proposes to her on stage during a live performance.  The chemistry between the actors is great.  This is one of those movies that fans will watch again and again.  And if you haven't seen it, you should take the time to do so.  If you're not drawn in by the legends, see it for the acting quality.  Either way you're going to enjoy the film.
0790732254|5.0|Yes People. I finally arrived to my castle in Scotland. Somewhere in Rhodes- but don't ask the address. It is reserved for only special people. Not that I am denying that you all aren't special. But, being inundated with tons of special requests is terribly hard -even for a reknown Seer (like myself!). I've had the chance to relax and watch a few videos that would relax my tired brain synapses. And I picked this one! I must have been crazy! But, not unlike the characters in this movie, believe me. Anyway, I have branched out to movie reviews and, after all, it is an art form like music- only more visual than audible. Needless to say-your Metamorpho has been well-versed in all the inner soul machinations. Thus, I take my crafty hand at reviewing this considerable movie.<br />I have been quite taken with it since it explores the human psychology in many vast and revealing ways. I seek answers. Why do people act the way they do? Certainly, we can all take behavior on a surface level only. But there is much, much more.<br />But first - let's talk about the acting here. It is perfect casting. Elizabeth Taylor has, absolutely, without a doubt, given one of the finest performances on screen ever. And, Richard Burton, is not far behind. With George Segal and Sandy Dennis completing the cast, it is about as perfect as it can be. Superb!<br />However, you must have alot of energy to view it because it will drain you. Why? Because the characters, George and Martha, who it seems are constantly at war, will exhaust you beyond your limitations. It is distasteful. It is crude. And, as your Metamorpho will testify, there really are people out there exactly like this.<br />There are many themes on display here. And, just like that miraculous onion universe - there are layers upon layers of revelations to discover.  For the most part-on the surface - is the question of reality and truth. And how people make contracts to perserve their illusions to  avoid reality.<br />It also makes the big statement of how we all hurt each other because of that illusion. How the illusion must be protected at all costs.  .<br />But, in all this, it is revealing. It is a mirror to ourselves and begs us to answer within; how much of this are we complicit with? It is an examination- but also, an unveiling. And, those with introspection would be amazed at all the wealth that this movie contains.<br />I cannot reveal all the inner workings and levels that are within this  movie. And, Edward Albee (the writer) has invented lines of sheer genius that, if you blink, and your ears don't hear for a second, you will miss entirely. So, BE AWARE my public!<br />The plot is so complicated that all I will give you is the scenario. George (Richard Burton) is an associate professor at a college. Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is his wife and the daughter of the head of the college. They have constructed an illusion of having a son to make life more acceptable. But, this is a fantasy only between the two of them. And their bitterness surfaces at inopportune times. When Nick (George Segal) who is a new teacher of Biology and Honey (Sandy Dennis) are invited over after a college social gathering, the tension between George and Martha really starts to escalate. Why? Because the \\"pact\\" between George and Martha was broken because Martha spoke of their son to Honey.  Information is gathered about the couple, then George and Martha include them in their illusion, turning Nick and Honey into victims as well.  Understand, there are so many themes here and so many aspects to view this movie. The more you watch, the more layers of insight you are able to decipher.<br />In my mind, Edward Albee has created a masterpiece with this and should definitely be watched by those who seek to avoid illusion in their lives  and those who need a mirror into their own lives. Absolutely superb. A dialogue and introspective movie which rates with the greatest.<br />I realize I have only touched on a very smallpart of this movie. But that only begs further examination on your part. Illusions are barriers, walls, if you will, to breaking through to reality and discovering your genuine own happiness in the world. But, like any other barriers in our lives, you can break them down and find a whole new world or richness within yourselves. That old adage is true. There definitely is a thin line between love and hate.<br />That is it for now. Your Seer always strives for true happiness in his life. This is a sacred right for me and everyone. Don't let anyone stand in your way for this quest because it is one of the very most important things in your lives. These characters deserve your understanding rather than derision. After all, it could be you.<br />Thank-you for listening. Now I am off to change the light bulbs in my library. I am currently reading a book and using only full moonlight doesn't cut it anymore. Wait! Is that Elizabeth Taylor on a broomstick, streaking across the sky? Or is it--illusion?<br /><br />Who's Afraid of Metamorpho's spoof? - thumbs up- Metamorphovie.

Zweig's updates are very helpful by using recent examples to put the original text in today's context. <br /> <br />The book carries the reader/student through all phases of investing with an emphasis on understanding risks, rewards and how to assess the viability of a contemplated investment. Wish I had read this 25 years ago. It would have saved me from more than a couple of mistakes.

B00004WG2F|5.0|If you liked Brad Pitt before he began appearing on the cover of People magazine every week, this is the film for you. Set in the early 20th c., before and after WWI, it's the story of Captain Ludlow, a veteran of the Indian Wars, marvelously played by Anthony Hopkins, and his three sons. Brad Pitt is Tristan, the middle son, a loner and lover of the wild, incredibly sexy and the favorite. Beautiful Julia Ormond shows up on the arm of the youngest brother, Samuel, as his fiancée, and the seclusion that the Captain has enjoyed from the turmoil of the wars is shattered. All three brothers are smitten, but reality intrudes when the idealistic Samuel decides to go to Canada to enlist, and his devoted brothers go with him to protect him. Samuel's foolish decision sets off a train of events that leaves many victims behind, except Tristan, who in the end is \\"the rock against which all others break.\\"  <br /> <br />Brad Pitt is marvelous in this film--although a bit overwrought at times, he can convey love, sincerity, integrity and humor, as well as brutality and insanity. Aidan Quinn, who seems to do mostly TV these days, is the pained older brother, who does everything right but is never loved. This sweeping epic won the Oscar for cinematography, and the prize was well-deserved. Be prepared for a few tough WWI scenes, and some gratuitous gore along the way, but the story grabs you and doesn't let go--you'll enjoy it. <br />

B0009MAP90|4.0|Dylan probably changed American and even world music and culture more than any other person in the 20th century.  This album is required listening for anyone with any interest in the popular, folk, gospel, accoustic, etc. music that followed.  This was the beginning.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|This album is so great!  Pure fun and laughter!  Especially the \\"Pop!\\" 80's-type songs.  Honestly, after listening to it, I dug out all my old Wham and early Madonna and Rick Astley and New Kids on the Block tapes and had a good old-fashioned teen-idol party (definitely worth the cost of the CD right there!).  What a good time!  And who KNEW that yummy Hugh Grant could actually carry a tune?  Not me!  What a great surprise, I happily thought, grooving around to Pop Goes My Heart, followed shortly thereafter by Wham's Wake me Up Before You Go-Go.  I nearly passed a note to my hubby asking him if he'd go to the sweetheart dance with me (yes/no/maybe, circle one).  Yay for 80's songs!<br /><br />Oh, and the love songs are great, too.  It's all great.
0553582453|5.0|The second book in The Tawny Man series continues along at a speedy pace, drawing the reader further into the machinations of the Farseer court.  The political intrigue involving Skill, Wit and prophesying is still a page-turner and one cannot stand to put the book down.  One always wants to know what happens next.  You won't be disappointed!
B000002LOE|3.0|This isn't a bad album, but nothing too special. \\"Losing My Religion\\" was a mega-hit, and probably the only song on this album that I can play more than once. The other tracks didn't really catch my fancy, but if you're into their type of music, it isn't all that bad. This was an album that I decided to buy mainly for that one track (\\"Losing My Religion\\"), so there isn't much else to celebrate.
0307341542|3.0|As a first novel, I really have to give the author props.  This is a very well-written book.  The language flows well, the characters are interesting, and (like everyone else has said here) you want to keep reading to see what happens next.<br /><br />As you probably already have discovered, this novel is about a journalist in Chicago who goes back home to Missouri to get the scoop on some local murders.<br /><br />The main character in this novel is a somewhat disturbed masoschist who even as an adult cannot get her act together.  Normally, this kind of literature bores me (it's been done to death), and I was annoyed at some of her actions and how she conducted her own investigation of the murders.  Even I knew whodunnit by page 49.<br /><br />What's amazing is how despite this warmed over rendition of \\"aw my life sucks because my mommy didn't love me as a child,\\" the novel is immensely readable and interesting.  There's something new and fresh amongst the old trappings.  And, if you're into that kind of thing, there's plenty of twisted, scary stuff.<br /><br />Kudos to the author.  I await her next work!
B000G759LW|4.0|Christina is one of my favorite young female singers, and she leaves no doubt as to why with her latest release. \\"Hurt\\" was the song that caught my attention to her new release, and the album as a whole isn't too bad. Regardless of some of her odd off-stage behavior, the girl does know how to sing, and this album is an example of her ability to be non-conventional as well. This album isn't full of the typical pop or pseudo-hip hop style that her other albums were, but rather a compilation of sentimental ballads and old-time cabaret-like tracks. If you're looking for something a little different from Christina, this album might be something you look into. I think \\"Stripped\\" is still her best album, but this one is different, thus interesting enough to be worth the cash you fork out for it.
B000JVT1U0|5.0|A truly awesome movie of the highest caliber. Powerful performances by legendary actors Christopher Lee (who played for free) and Edward Woodward. Composer Paul Giovanni brings this Anthony Shaffer story to life with beautiful songs \\"Corn Riggs\\", \\"Gently Johnny\\" and \\"Willow's Song\\". Really a must see, though I suggest watching the extended version and not the horrid butchered travesty of the American Theatrical release. One of the greatest movies of all time!
B00000F14B|5.0|Until recently, this wasn't one of my favorites - don't know why!  My husband bought it for me when we found out my daughter's HS choir was going to do the musical.  I watched it numerous times both on my 'puter and the TV to get costume ideas (really helped with the middy blouses that the \\"pick-a-little\\" ladies wear for practice) and help with other parts of the production.  Love Shirley Jones as Marian and Robert Preston IS the Music Man!  Mrs. Shinn is just too funny for words!!!  If you want a feel-good musical, get it!  The music and orchestration are great and the dancing is wonderful!
B00006F7S4|5.0|This album is a joy to listen to. Yes, Beck is clearly depressed and its clearly over loss of love.  But this is nothing like your typical \\"woe is me, for my lost girlfriend\\" chock full of depressing lyrics that make you feel bad when you hear it.  In this album Beck takes his pain and sorrow and finds the beauty in it and puts it into these songs. And even just saying that doesn't feel like I'm getting across what that really means. That he is able to turn his broken heart into this relaxing, beautiful, meaningful, and even hopeful piece of art is amazing to me.  If you really want a sense of what this album is about, I recommend you watch the video \\"lonesome tears\\".  I think the message portrayed in that video perfectly embodies the message of this album.   <br /> <br />also, I am a big Beck fan and had no problem falling in love with this album, like i did with the others. I highly recommend it.
0307237699|5.0|As an almost lifelong Democrat (I started as an independent, but Nixon (my first vote in 1972) disillusioned me about Republicans; those who followed him took the party further and further away from my values and politics; I finally registered as a Democrat sometime in the mid-80s), and a student of race relations, I was a ready-made candidate to enjoy Barack Obama's second book, and I did.  Obama's comfortable writing style almost makes you forget that you're reading a policy outline, though he does provide a good deal of background about his views on the Constitution and about his personal experiences. What's especially encouraging is his even-handed approach to issues--carefully considering and respecting where those who might oppose his position are coming from.<br /><br />Now that Obama has announced his candidacy for President, it's hard not to consider the book in that light.  Given his almost apologetic tone about the impact of his political life on his family, I'm a little surprised that he decided to run for President so soon.  However, I expect he'll appeal to a wide range of Democrats looking for a different type of leader, and will be a viable candidate.  I encourage people from all political backgrounds to learn more about Senator Barack Obama. \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is a good place to start.

Every time I saw a spinning propeller I thought of what my WWII veteran parents must be doing in their shared grave if they saw any of this crap through my eyes.

It did keep me watching for the entire three hours just hoping it might get better and it finally did when it stopped.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|When I first saw news about this sequel, I thought...oh, no. As if Rocky V didn't do enough damage to the filmic legacy of this uniquely American character, here comes another car wreck. Well, it just goes to show you that you don't know how good or bad something is until it's finished and ready (with some notable exceptions, of course).<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil any of the plot for you, I'm just going to say that if you love the character of Rocky Balboa, this is the fitting and just sendoff that his story demanded, and much better than could ever have been expected. Plus, the film's center has a surprisingly tender heart at its core with Stallone (who also wrote and directed the film) reminding us what a charismatic, charming on-screen persona he has. He should be proud of this last round for The Rock.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much the hooting, laughing and cheering audience did that I saw it in the theater with.
B00005B36H|5.0|I don't say \\"THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE!!!\\" for everything I like. This is a long over due review, but this album is since it was released the work of music ever produced by a band.<br /><br />Not saying that later music isn't good, it just isn't great (it fails to be mind blowing and complete). Lateralus is perfection that is meant to be listened to best as a whole (and yet as individual tracks it also measure up to excellence).<br /><br />This album should cost more money.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|If you're looking this movies up on Amazon, that means you probably already watched the thing.  Pretty great, huh?  Buy it and support the filmmakers for making such an honest, inspiring flick.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|I am 32 with somewhat young parents. So I grew up with my parents blaring Journey, Led Zepplin, Steve Miller Band, and Cat Stevens. I know what good rock is and these guys are IT. <br /> <br />Hearing all the greats growing up, I recognize many of their styles in the Black Keys music and none of it comes off as a cheap copy-cat sound like so many bands tend to. These two guys have talent of their own and they play music that just plain sounds good. <br /> <br />It's the kind of music you want to hear when you go out drinking beer with the guys or when you're driving in your car, or when you want to go out and hear a damn good live show. <br /> <br />I can't seem to take this CD out of rotation - it's really damn good!
B00008CLOA|5.0|Pink Floyd made an album that has become a legend. In SACD it's a fantastic journey around the moon.Pop makers nowadays have a lot to learn to make the music interesting for a long period of time.
B000002UD7|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys were and still are phenomenal. Back then in1987, still enamored with a-ha I was looking for more, something with that 80s sounds yet unique and original. I first heard \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\\" with Dusty Springfield of all people doing this song with the Pet Shop Boys on the radio. I sought out the Pet Shop Boys album \\"Actually\\" and found it to be very good and just what I was looking for. Their very melodic pop dance sounding music with great lyrics, delivered with such deadpan emotion, was just so ironic but very catchy and well as striking a chord of emotion with me. \\"Actually\\" is one great classic album and fresh as ever.
B000007492|5.0|Whats there to say? One of the best pop-groups in pophistory. Here they have an album that smell the best of Supertramp.Listening through a good Hi-Fi system puts you in a very good mood.
B000J103N4|5.0|Yes, it's got CSNY minus \\"S\\"...Jefferson Airplane minus Marty...The Dead minus Bob...Joni...Michael Shrieve...Gregg Rolie...but beyond that, it's a tight, transcendent album of 9 great tunes. Note that I said \\"9\\"...the bonus track \\"Kids and Dogs\\" is an outtake and sounds like one. But the fact that this classic has been remastered in both CD and DVD Audio format in the same package is reason for celebration. \\"Laughing\\" contains some of Jerry Garcia's best playing...EVER. You'll also hear the bee-sting vibrato of Jorma Kaukonen throughout, as well as harmonies that will leave you speechless. Crosby followed this release with many more superlative tracks, but on an \\"album\\" basis, this is it. This is his legacy. And what a legacy it is. The album isn't about the stellar guest stars. It's about one man reaching for greatness and grabbing it by the short hairs, \\"with a lotta help from his friends.\\"

B000FP2OPY|5.0|It's so refreshing to find a show that exudes creativity and keeps you begging for more.

Jensen Ackles \\"Dean Winchester\\" is ABSOLUTELY hilarious and Jared Padalecki \\"Sam Winchester\\" is a sweetheart.  I love both actors and definitely grown to love the show.  I hope that this show continues to be successful in the future and finally a show with HOT guys instead of the typical pretty girls.

B00061QK02|2.0|i wet my pants watching the Best of Will Ferrell Saturday Night Live, but this movie just stunk.  Another SNL movie that would be great as a recurring sketch, but quickly wears thin as a movie. Even a great cast couldn't save it.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|This is one of the most boring and pointless movies of all time.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Excellent piece of history (though a bit speculative in places of course). I think the greatest message that comes from this movie is the displacement of goals in creating heroism because someone shot a photograph of guys putting a flag in the ground. Ironically, the notoriety these men received did as much to undo their lives as bring them happiness. Americans will always need and desire heroes, but heroism needs to be built around the right reasons. I truly found this movie fascinating, but then I'm a history buff.

0786177888|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a book I read over and over as a child.  I so identified with Francie, the dreamer and eager reader, observing her surroundings as an outsider having trouble fitting in.  I loved and savored the detailed descriptions of Francie's routines and rituals of junk selling, little treats, and books devoured on the fire escape.  The world of turn of the century tenements seemed like a wonderful place, and the family's ability to make something from nothing was marvelous. <br /> <br />Returning to the book as an adult I found new pleasures in the parts I'd skimmed or barely understood as a kid--the drama of the adult relationships of Katie Nolan and her husband, and Katie's sisters Evie and Sissy.  Instead of Francie's impatience with her mother, I sympathized with Katie's point of view and saw the grinding poverty without the innocence of Francie's viewpoint.  I was amazed anew at the vitality and resourcefulness of the characters. <br /> <br />Recently I listened to the audio version of the book, read by Kate Burton.  I rediscovered the story yet again, finding parts I'd forgotten in the ten or so years since last re-reading it and anticipating the parts I remembered.  In having it read to me I enjoyed it all over, with the addition of Ms. Burton's talent for accents and the dialogue.   <br /> <br />If you have never read this book, read it.  If you read it long ago as a kid, check it out again--I guarantee you'll find fascinating new dimensions to the story.  If you've read it a dozen times, you will still find it worthwhile to spend a little more time with this old friend.  I know I did.
0385720920|4.0|I don't know what I expected when I started reading Choke...but it wasn't anything I could have possibly imagined.  The beginning is strange, and not for the conservative...Palahniuk puts down on paper some of the weirdest and unconventional thoughts to ever enter the human brain.  But I kept reading, and the book grabs you and won't let you go.  You begin to realize that he is just setting you up to understand just how messed up a human being his main character, Victor Mancini, is.  One of the most flawed characters to ever be put down on paper, Victor opens your eyes.  He makes you think about human nature as a whole, and the sad direction that the world is going in.  The book has one of the best endings I've read in a great while.  If you can get through the first few chapters, you will be very pleased.
0393325172|5.0|I listened to the audio download edition of this book and my comments pertain to that edition. <br /> <br />I saw the Master and Commander movie with Russell Crowe several years ago and absolutely loved the way it brought to life the world of the British Navy and naval warfare in the early 19th century.  I had heard for years of Patrick O'Brien's books and decided to read them.  I bought the first in the series, Master and Commander, on the way home from the movie theatre.  Alas, I never managed to read it.  I found the vocabulary, dense with naval terms, difficult to manage, and I bought an excellent reference book which assisted greatly.  However, reading the novel became far too much like work, and slow going with the constant flipping through the reference book. <br /> <br />When I discovered that the series is available on audio, read by one of my favorite audiobook narrators, Simon Vance, I resolved to give it a shot, but with misgivings because of my vocabulary issues.  To my surprise, the audio edition was the perfect solution.  Simon Vance is a fabulous reader who brings the dialogue vividly to life.  I became swept up in the story at once, and it's a wonderful story, telling the tale of Captain Jack Aubrey's first acquaintance with soon to be dear friend Stephen Maturin, and their first voyages together in the Mediterranean, with Jack at the helm of his first command, the sloop Sophie.  The everyday world of shipboard life, the petty ins and outs of naval politics, as well as the thrilling battles, came to life for me.  I hardly noticed my difficulties in telling a topgallant from a royal because the drama of the reading swept me past passages that, in the printed edition, would have stopped me cold and sent me to my reference book or onto the web.  You don't *HAVE* to understand every detail to follow the story after all--there's plenty to be gained from context.  I'm sure at some point I probably will want to return to the printed editions to enjoy everybit of the story--but until then the audio version kept me going and thoroughly enjoying the tale.  I have already downloaded the next book in the series, Post Captain, and can't wait to begin it. <br /> <br />If you are someone who has been curious about the O'Brian series but were put off by the amount of confusing naval detail, give the audio editions a try.

B000BKJ78U|1.0|1. This is not real widescreen. GOD what a dissapointment this purchase was! I knew that this edition had added CG effects, some of which are good and some ridiculous like the singer in Jabba's house, but decided that I could live with that. The real problem is the picture-format!! The top and bottom of the picture in all three movies has simply been masked, to suit widescreen TVs.     In RETURN OF THE JEDI, look for example at the chapter index picture of Jabba's fortress with a frog creature in the foreground, and compare it to the picture in the film. How enjoyable is it to see a panorama landscape view with a fortress in the distance having the top cupolas chopped off? It is awful!!! Furthermore the color nuances are all gone in this scene, it's all reddish!!     And how enjoyable is it to see tops of heads chopped off?? It is AWFUL!!!     Why do they have to mask the top and bottom of the picture??? If they had left it whole, a widescreen TV would still not show the top and bottom because it would not fit, so it wouldn't make a difference! But on a normal TV it does! Furthermore, widescreen TVs are not actually that wide, so they still show black stripes at top and bottom with this edition!     This proves that superficial proportions of the picture is more important than the actual content and integrity of the art. IS Star Wars art? Well, I respect George Lucas for his vision and work, but a real artist would surely not treat his own work in this abusive manner.    (The widescreen editions of the newest Staw Wars films, part I, II, and III, is a different matter. They are complete in picture. They are great.)     2. The Bonus Disc doesn't satisfy real fantasy fans. Where are the detailed pictures of all creatures and original sculptures? Phil Tippet's Rancor? The frog creature ouside Jabba's nest? The chessboard creatures? The new long-necked dinosaur creature at Mos Eisley? Those are the kind of things we want to see up close! For the layman's pleasure, and for future generations of fantasy creators to learn from. Why do you deny us that George?
B000MCH5P4|1.0|The man behind the camera (Gonzalez) did two great movies before this one. Then, he didn't work anymore, just  \\"cut and paste\\". The other people at the crew give us another great work (i-e; the music; Santaolalla excelent again). But the movie use every clichè, every low punch, all the common places. Poor movie. And dishonest. (The opposite is Little Miss Sunshine, a totally honest movie). <br />At least I have to say the title of the movie it is just perfect, brilliant.
0920668372|5.0|I was looking to purchase this book for a baby shower. It was given to me by my sister when my oldest son (now 5 years old) was almost 3, because HER son loved it so much.  Well, my son, as well as my 4 year old twins, NEVER tires of this book!  Inside the cover, my sister wrote the notes to the music for the song, so I have always sung the chorus while rocking the kids.  They anticipate rocking in my lap, and sing along with me.  By now they pretty much have it memorized. SO, perhaps (judging from some reviews) this may not be a book for new moms - my son was older when I received it.  But toddlers will LOVE the parent-child interaction as you read, sing, and rock (back and forth, back and....).
B0000AKY7O|5.0|Welcome is Santana's Fifth studio recording album; Nothing like Santana I, Abraxas or Santana III; yet a pure state of art (Latin Jazz Rock fusion) musical release.<br /><br />After his great success in his first 3 releases, Santana begins to discover new musical routes hand in hand with the Great guitarist John Mc Laughlin.<br /><br />They release this CD hand in hand with \\"Love, Devotion and surrender\\".<br /><br />Back in 1973, both albums were disregarded by most of the radio stations and even by most of Santana fans, who expected a more Latin Rock albums.<br /><br />Obviously Carlos Santana was deviating from his original Latin Rock roots sound and taking the Jazz Rock fusion path.<br /><br />Back to \\"Welcome\\"; if you are a Santana guitar fan, you will be pleased listening to this album today; it did not age one single minute.<br /><br />If you are into Jazz, Rock and Fusion, this album would fit as a real Jewel in your musical collection.<br /><br />Last and not Least; If you like this CD, I believe you would probably enjoy the following releases as well:<br /><br />1. Love Devotion and Surrender by Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin<br /><br />2. Caravanserai by Santana<br /><br />3. Illuminations by Santana<br /><br />4.

B000059TEQ|5.0|I love this rather corny, cheesy love story which has a very 70's movie feel. If you like 70's films you will love this. I am not sure this film would have been well received if it had been made today but with 70's movies you kind of expect a film like this. All in all it is solid on all counts - acting, writing and directing. It has being accused of being morbid and manipulative but I think the subject matter  was handled with maturity and in a way was uplifting in the end. Even though you know what is going to happen you can watch this over and over again and each time its a trip back in nostalgia - back to a time when Hollywood still made movies like this.

The book reminded me a lot of King's and Straub's Talisman and Barker's Weaveworld, so if you liked these you may like this book.  For me, it was too long and the transitions in the story were just awkward.  I will eventually try some of his other works because I do see talent, and there was a lot of interesting ideas in the book, I just couldn't get into the story a lot of times.

The story was appealing and the illustrations helped keep his attention focused as well as helping his imagination as we went through.  He enjoyed it very much which is why I rated it '4 stars.'<br /><br />As for the lack of a fifth star, the novel was not deeply appealing to me as an adult reader, but still a good story and nicely presented book.<br /><br />You should buy it.

B000K7UG20|4.0|I saw this film on crappy pan and scan VHS when I was about 12 and I didn't really understand it and I wasn't really up on Ridley Scott's work. As a result, the impact of the film was somewhat lost on me. I was expecting an action film instead of a character drama with lots of police procedure. But now, older and wiser and with a brand new HD-DVD of the movie, I am finally able to appreciate how clever the film is.<br /><br />The story unfortunately IS riddled with 80s Cop Movie clich&eacute;s and goes through quite a lot of familiar motions. But if you see past that you'll appreciate the immense atmosphere and mood that Ridley Scott piles on. Simply put, Michael Douglas is Nick Conklin, a bad cop (pretty much the exact same character in Basic Instinct) who drag races on his superbike to pay alimony and pinches drug money instead of turning it in for evidence. Enjoying lunch with partner Charlie (Andy Garcia) in a steakhouse in New York's meat-packing district, they just happen to witness a Yakuza execution by wanted Japanese criminal Sato (Yusaku Matsuda, who was dying of cancer during filming and didn't tell anyone). After a quick punch-up and shoot-out they find themselves chaperoning Sato back to Osaka. But when they arrive there he manages to escape, leaving them embarrassed with lots of questions to answer.<br /><br />Nick and Charlie find themselves in a very foreign and intolerant world and recapturing Sato proves to be difficult in many ways. Not the least of which is Japan's alienating culture (from an NYPD point of view) and rigid rules. Nonetheless, Nick is determined to catch Sato and restore his honor.<br /><br />Like I said, the atmosphere of the film is overwhelming, which is really all the film needs. The clich&eacute;s and stereotypes don't matter so much when you are involved this much. Hans Zimmer (his first film with Ridley Scott) provides a deeply emotional and very melodic score that'll be rattling around in your head for days. It's a shame it's never had a comprehensive CD release, as it's one of Zimmer's most impressive efforts.<br /><br />You could call it a pretty 80s movies, but I still do feel that it holds up pretty well today. As one of Ridley Scott's more forgotten works, it's well worth checking out.<br /><br />The HD DVD features a brilliant 2.4:1 1080p image with Dolby 5.1+ and a great retrospecive documentary by Laurent Bouzereau. But why is it split into 3 parts? Totally pointless! In total it makes for about an hours worth.

B00003CXXP|3.0|I will say the movie is mesmerizing to watch simply because the visual effects are so good, but it is a highly derivative movie.  Kind of like Blade Runner meets Pinocchio with an excrutiatingly long ending as Spielberg tries to sap as much emotion as he can out of this.  Personally, I thought it was enough when David finally discovered he wasn't real.  That scene carried with it a ton of emotional weight, but of course Spielberg couldn't content himself with such a somber ending to what was a very long journey for the boy to meet his maker.  Probably the most impressive scene was that in the robot graveyard under the light of an artificial moon, where robots tried to piece themselves back together from the left over parts.  It really gave this viewer empathy with their plight, especially when they were rounded up for the ensuing carnage in a carnival of robotic horrors.  Spielberg picks and chooses from a number of science fiction themes as well as children's stories to piece together this ode to artificial intelligence.

B000F3T3CS|3.0|One would be hard-pressed to find a more beautifully sung \\"L'Elisir...\\" these days.  Netrebko and Villazon are both in their prime, and they have never sounded better.  And I doubt there has ever been a more breathtakingly beautiful Adina than Netrebko's.  But I have serious reservations about the way this 1980 Otto Schenk production has been directed.  It's opera buffo, with an emphasis a little too much on the \\"buffo\\" for me.<br /><br />The major culprit here is Villazon, who never stops moving and mugging for a single moment.  With his Harpo Marx hair and caterpillar eyebrows, he's a walking cartoon, and he plays the character less as an open, uncomplicated bumpkin and more like the village idiot.  One longs to tie his hands behind his back and yell \\"Don't just do something, stand there!\\"  Thank God he calms down for \\"Una furtiva lagrima,\\" which is stunningly sung and well deserving of the audience's thunderous ovation.  Interestingly enough, during the encore - yes, he sings it twice; this is a production where more is always considered more - one can see the makings of a marvelous Nemorino: simple, heartfelt and devoid of schtick.<br /><br />Netrebko is considerably more restrained, except for her Act 2 duet with Ildebrando D'Arcangelo's Dulcamara, which ends in unbridled silliness.  This moment, along with Villazon's anachronistic happy dance in Act 1, is just one example of the way in which the singers have been given free reign to tap into their inner Tim Conways, much to Donizetti's detriment.<br /><br />I think much would have been gained by Nucci and D'Arcangelo switching roles.  As marvelous as Nucci is - and when is he not? - he's too old for Belcore.  He would have brought a wisdom and wiliness to Dulcamara that is lacking in D'Arcangelo's full-out comic performance.  D'Arcangelo is certainly funny, agile and inventive, but he's too youthful for Dulcamara, despite the fake gray in his hair.  Don't get me wrong, it's a marvelous performance - but it's a marvelous performance of Rossini's Figaro.  I think he would have brought a terrific, droll pomposity to the balloon-headed Belcore.<br /><br />We should be grateful to have any visual record of four such major talents as Netrebko, Villazon, Nucci and D'Arcangelo.  And it's obvious that the whole enterprise is being presented as nothing more than good, clean, operatic fun.  But I still find more lasting pleasures - and fewer distractions - in two other ideal DVD \\"L'Elisir's\\": the gorgeous Met production with Pavarotti and Battle, and the updated version with Alagna and Gheorghiu.of Rossini's Figaro.

B000069HPL|5.0|This movie reminds me why I'd never want a desk job. I had to watch it a couple of times before I got the full gist of it, but every time, I understood it more and more.<br /><br />Unless you're self-employed and work at home, you can't help but draw your own similarities to the Office Space work environment and your own. I've worked with a Lumberg, a Joanna, and a Michael... and a guy who didn't have an Arabic name, but he wanted to beat up every piece of office machinery which didn't work right. We even had a Milton-like guy once... he ended up going berserk and being escorted out by the police, but that's another story.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this movie to everyone who has a job and knows what it's like to suffer from the aggravation of office politics. This movie delivers a figurative eye-gouging to all the politics and backstabbing that goes on every day in America's corporate workplaces. It shows one of the things that can happen when big corporate CEOs think they're making some really smart move, and end up shooting themselves in the foot instead.<br /><br />WORDS OF WARNING: 1) if you're a bureaucratic jerk boss like Lumberg, DO NOT watch this movie because you won't find it funny... 2) never, ever do anything to make a Milton angry, because you never know what they'll do.

1582701709|1.0|The Secret has recycled a very old idealist philosophy, wrapped in pseudo-science and contemporary capitalism.  While there's nothing necessarily wrong with this, the book's claims are disingenuous.  This is not a \\"secret\\" passed down through the ages, but rather a conversation/argument engaged in by philosophers like Hegel & Marx.  My point is not to say that readers need to be informed of philosophy, but simply that the author's context is misleading. <br /> <br />Now, I am a big believer that everyone should (try to) be an optimist about their lives, but consider how The Secret looks upon those less fortunate people in our society.  The logical conclusion is that they are failures because they do not understand or follow through on \\"the law of attraction\\".  They are attracting failure and seeking failure.  Never mind any systemic causes for their continued and sustained poverty. <br /> <br />While The Secret seems to be good enough as a personal philosophy (believe in good things and there's a better chance they will happen to you), as a way of understanding the rest of the world, The Secret is plainly delusional.  And that doesn't even mean you shouldn't read the book or see the movie, because maybe it would help you personally, but be forewarned.  Give these pious platitudes more thought than what the author offers.

I have seen it live and I couldn't wait until the DVD release. <br /> <br />Agnès Letestu, as Odette, dances with grace and beauty and José Martinez, in the role of prince Siegfried, is just brilliant.  <br /> <br />The costumes are lovely, rich, elegant and colourful. The swans are beautiful. The dancers of the third act are dressed magnificently. <br /> <br />The sets and lighting are great and give importance to the dancers. The style isn't ornate. In the first act for example, the sets present everything that makes a palace look immense : tall marble columns, walls with moulding, large steps, a beautiful golden throne, and a bright lighting that changes to a dark one as the sun goes down; or, in the second act, a mysterious forest and a lake with a soft, bluish lighting. <br /> <br />The Black Swan Scene is remarquable. Ms. Agnès Letestu really has a talent in miming. In this scene, she shows evil, hypocrisy while dancing graciously.

It tries to differentiate itself from the original but also stays true to the book and for that it deserves merit.

I remember Rachelle's sultry voice from the early 90s and remembered some of her performances and decided to purchase an album. Well to my surprise, this album did not turn out to be what I expected. I truly think this is a very bad, sloppy and boring album. I had purchased this album along with her self-titled album Rachelle Farrell and this have had to been the worst purchases I've ever made on amazon along with Earl Klugh's Naked Guitar. Her albums sound like demos and although Individuality was made 12 years after her self-titled album, the album did not sound any different. There was absolutely no growth despite the reviews claiming to have had a fresh new sound.

They are all still in flawless condition on the playing surface but the player rejects them as being dirty or unreadable. The only possible explanation for this is the damage done by the sunlight near my shelves and the fact that the dvds in this set are housed in a clear case.

B00005JPO7|5.0|Hopefully, Academy members will rightfully award the Oscar tomorrow night for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year (2006) to 'The Lives of Others.'  Writer/Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut stands head and shoulders not only over the other nominees, but also over all the nominees for Best Picture.  That so-called 'best' list pales in comparison to the heights attained by von Donnersmarck's creation.  It is a expertly-plotted, richly-told depiction of life under the dominion of the East German spying apparatus, the Stasi.<br /><br />'Lives' tracks the Stasi's efforts to bug and disrupt the lives of writer Georg Dreyman (a striking Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (the incomparable Martina Gedeck).  Assigned to the case is Stasi agent, Gerd Wiesler, indelibly played by Ulrich M&uuml;he.  The reasons for spying on Dreyman and 'CSM' (as the Stasi calls her)?  A Politburo minister has the hots for CSM.  That's it.  For that most personal of reasons, lives are ruined.  A professional reviewer of 'Lives' really hit the nail on the head when he said that the movie turns on the fact that Weisler realizes he is spying into the life of a man who is 'vastly his moral superior.'

0060254920|5.0|I loved this book when I was a kid, and my children now love it.  My 5 year old reads it to us almost every night.  It's in the prime spot on the bookshelf as its the one the currently want to read most often.  The illustrations are absolutely scrumptious.
B000E5N67K|5.0|while watching this movie i thought that i was following the whole thing and understanding it all, then at the end it just hits you right in the face with a total curve ball. highly reccomended wether on DVD or UMD. UMD is all the better because you can bring it places. Deffinatley one for my UMD library.

B000K7VHJQ|3.0|I purchased this version after I saw it in the store the week it came out.  I already owned the original DVD release, but I heard this had lots of special features and the re-cut version.  Therefore I purchased this edition.  However, I was a bit disappointed. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the movie in the theater.  It tells the story of the last 12 hours of the life of christ.  It was very gory and I wouldn't want to show it to children.  However, for older people (12 yrs. and up)this does a good job of depicting the trials and tribulations of Christ's crucifiction.   <br /> <br />My biggest complaint about this movie was the subtitles.  However, if you are familiar with the Biblical story, you can pretty much ignore the dialogue and focus on the picture.   <br /> <br />Now for this \\"Definitive Edition\\" Special feature wise this is a great edition to have.  It has loads of extra features.   <br /> <br />My biggest complaint about this edition was that if you are a person like me who sometimes has to take several different times (starting and stopping) to watch a movie in it's entirety, the chapter selections are a wonderful thing.  You can stop where you need to and start back just by selecting the scene you were on.  However, with the definitive edition the scene selection is done with approximately 10 chapters.  The chapters are set up to coincide with the \\"stations of the cross.\\"  Although a good idea if you are Catholic and want to see those stages but for a normal viewer of this movie it was terribly frustrating.  The first chapter runs for over an hour.  I usually don't have that long to watch so I have to start all over each time and use fast forward to get to where I was.  It was just very irritating. <br /> <br />I really liked the fact that they included the re-cut version of the film as well as the original.  If you are unfamiliar with the re-cut version, it essentially is a \\"less graphic\\" version of the film (although it is still very violent).  This version may be better for a church library or a family with younger children.   <br /> <br />If you like special features and want the less gory version of the Passion then by all means purchase this edition.  However, if you prefer to be able to stop and start or jump to a certain scene of the movie then go with the original release (it has approx. 32 scene chapters).
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|This is the most amazing album I have ever heard since none so vile. The production on this album is so clean you have got to blast it in a quality stereo to really understand. All you grimy girls downloading horrible quality versions of this masterpiece need to buy this CD.     Lord Worm has a voice unlike any other in any music. If you are going to criticize this album because of Lord Worm and his lyrics-you are missing the point. After this, I heard the albums with Mike DiSalvo, and did not really like his understandable vocals.(relatively speaking) This is how its supposed to sound- Brutal and Ugly not Big and Tough.    Flo is the most insane drummer today. Just try keeping time with this guy. You can't even program drums like this. Not just speed, but highly technical and precise. I never heard bass drums being played like this -like they were finger tapping.     Enough raving. This album might even be better than None So Vile, it all depends on when you started listening to Cryptopsy.    Best Songs:  Carrionshine, The Pestilence that walketh in Darkness, In the Kingdom where everything...    THE BEST CD of the past 3 years.
B000002BHE|5.0|By far the most diverse album of her career, Falling into you explored a new sound for Dion including Pop, Regaee, Gospel and even country.  A project that took Dion's music and popularity to superstar levels.  This album featured a true diversity and very fresh sound that has not been present on Dion's other releases. <br /> <br />The strong opener \\"It's all coming back to me now\\" is an epic masterpeice that draws the listener into a variety of emotions and is a very visual, dramatic song.  Dion also glides through her tradmark ballads, \\"Because You Loved Me, All By Myself, and \\"I Love You\\" effortlessly.  \\"Falling Into You\\" is a bit moody and dark and a change for Dion.  Dion seems to be the most interesting when she stretches herself like on the very fresh sound of \\"Seduces Me\\". <br /> <br />Falling Into You is truly a fusion of new sounds and experimental music.  This is by far Dion's most critically aclaimed work to date.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|After seeing the movie in theaters with my sister, the songs were stuck in both of our heads for days after. They are not those annoying songs that you just can't get out of your head, but the kind you never want to leave. The main song \\"A Way Back Into Love\\" is sweet and romantic without being overly so, while the songs by Haley Bennet are a poignant twist on the songs done by early Britney and Christina (though I personally love \\"Buddha's Delight\\" as a regular song). This CD is a definite must buy, but make sure you go see the movie as well.
B00000IAU3|4.0|There aren't a lot of pop singers out there that I think is worth listening to. Most I find to be artistically changelleged. One of the few pop singers I do like is Dido. I first discovered her through the UK dance act Faithless. Her brother Rollo would often include her vocals on the group's songs. I later discovered her through cable tv and saw that she was a solo artist. \\"No Angel\\" is a pleasant but predictable mix of trip hop, pop, and folk music. The one song I cannot listen to any more is \\"Thank You\\" and that is because it was overplayed on radio stations 24/7 after Eminem's \\"Stan\\" (which took samples from \\"Thank You\\") became a smash hit. My personal favorite track on the cd is the folksy \\"Don't Think\\". I find the song addictively catchy and the melodies stick in my head for days on end. I also enjoy the haunting track \\"Here with Me\\". Sure the song is commonly found on many chill out compilations and soundtracks but it wasn't as annoying as \\"Thank You\\". Yeah the music is bit bland and inoffensive, and isn't the best representation of what trip hop music is. For all its quibbles, I still enjoy this cd to this very day. I find the music very soothing and relaxing to listen to on a snowy, winter day.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|There is one aspect of this film, that seperates it from many others. It is the very creative dialogue used. Like \\"Where's Dode Flopped\\"? And many others! The casting was very well done! One has to really appreciate the fact that even though this movie is in a modern high school in San Clemente, CA., Sometimes, I feel like i was even being transported back to a 1940's style movie. The pattern is somewhat like this. If you love a low budget movie, that is unlike any other I have ever seen; I recommend you get this DVD. You will really appreciate it. Oh, and did I mention the music score. It is really cool!<br /><br />Peace-
B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is the best new sitcom in quite a few years. The only other sitcom I currently watch regularly is (since Arrested Development was cancled) Scrubs. Though I find many things funny I almost never laugh out loud when watching tv. I truly consider a comedy episode a success when I laugh out loud once during an episode. This show does not disappoint me at all. Though at some points it looks like it is about to go into another sitcom plot that you can easily tell the conclusion of it always goes onto another path at the last minute. In this truly lies the brilliance on How I Met Your Mother...that and Neil Patric Harris of course.
B00001ODGR|5.0|This was an excellent video of a band that i grew up with.  Dennis DeYoung's voice is spectacular in this video tribute.  I don't think Styx is any good without him in their lineup.  It is a shame the other band members can't get over themselves and bring him back to the group.  This is a super video with all the old songs and DeYoung doesn't miss a note.  I highly recommend this video to true Styx fans all over the world!
B00005JNJV|5.0|The idea here--and it is an admirable one--is to account for in a realistic way how the fictional character Bruce Wayne became Batman the superhero.  Why did he become a crime fighter?  How did he become so skilled, so tough and so motivated?  How was he able to come up with such effective gadgetry including the super hi-tech Batmobile?  And why did he chose the bat as his motif?<br /><br />From what I can tell it was screenwriter David S. Goyer who asked himself these questions and saw that answering them could be made into a kind of blockbuster prequel to the Batman movie phenomenon.  But it was director Christopher Nolan who made it work.<br /><br />Nolan also directed the sensational Memento (2000) a story about a man who is only able to remember what has happened during the last minute or two and has no memory of anything before that up to the time he suffered a head injury.  He has to write down where he parks his car so he can find it later, and he keeps pictures with notes on people he sees regularly because he can never remember them or any interaction he has with them.  Memento is a stunningly brilliant film that skyrocketed Nolan to fame.<br /><br />Goyer wrote a number of screenplays before Batman Begins, none of them of much importance.  I happened to have seen the film Arcade (1993), for which he wrote the script, a harmless, undistinguished scifi for teens but nothing else of his.  Nonetheless, Goyer is a natural for something like Batman Begins because he is a writer of comics who attended the USC film school and (or was) a collector of comics.  He cares about comics and comic book heroes and he knows enough about film to write a script that might work.  He and Nolan share credit for the script.<br /><br />The story begins in Tibet where a young Bruce Wayne learns how to fight like a ninja and gains insights into himself and who he is.  There are flashbacks to his childhood in which he falls into a dry well and is terrified by the bats that fly out over his head as he lies trapped.  He sees his parents murdered in a holdup.  This motivates him to become a crime fighter.<br /><br />The later part of the movie shows Bruce Wayne discovering a cave under the Wayne Mansion, interacting with the loyal family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and getting help with his crime-fighting inventions from tech and forensics expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman).  Katie Holmes plays Bruce's childhood friend who has become a prosecuting attorney fighting bravely against the crime and corruption that have become rampant in Gotham City.<br /><br />There are an number of nice touches and the visuals are really arresting.  The Batmobile itself is fascinating to watch in action, especial during one of the most spectacular chase scenes ever envisioned, as Batman directs the vehicle up a ramp to the top of a building and then leads the cops on a chase as the Batmobile leaps from one building to another!<br /><br />Some of the early action is a bit beyond belief (although the intent is realism), most notably when Bruce Wayne manages to fight his way singlehandedly out of the ninja mountain training camp and has the strength in one arm to stop the fall of ninja leader Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and hold himself and Ducard at the precipice of a cliff and then pull Ducard up.  Near the end of the film as Batman shoots up from the ground on wires and glides and springs from rooftop to rooftop with the greatest of ease, the action becomes clearly comic book like.<br /><br />Regardless, this is without question the best superhero movie I've ever seen.  It is not only a commercial triumph for Nolan and everybody connected with the picture but, given the genre, an artistic and creative one as well.<br /><br />See this for Christopher Nolan who is quickly becoming one of Hollywood's most successful directors.ly out over his head as he lies trapped.

B00005OCMR|5.0|I just watched this again after first seeing it over twenty years ago when I  was a kid.  I was blown away by how beautiful the imagery is and I thought the story was great too.  The film definitely still holds up and looks better than most stuff released now a days. <br />Some of the extras are unnecessary but \\"The making of Tron\\" was very well done and worth the purchase. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005JPAM|4.0|Was skeptical of going to this movie, another account of the royals and all. Was absolutely convinced I was watching the Queen herself in Mirren's portrayal. Incorrectly titled as just 'The Queen', when in actuality this film is dealing with the Queen's and the Country's response to the death of Princess Diana. This is one moment in time. As far as the Queen's entire life, was expecting more history. Blair saves the day, and the staunchy people are flustered. Leaves you feeling a bit for the Queen, they missed the mark on Charles. Overall interesting.

B00005221M|5.0|DVD movie was excellent entertainment. Having spent some time down in that region of North Carolina near Chimney Rock and The Great Smokies this movie brings back great memories.Quite a few reviewers have written that the dvd version doesn't compare to the vhs version and perhaps it doesn't.However, deep analysis aside just watch and enjoy. You won't go wrong.
B000M4RG42|3.0|After watching this DVD, I am compelled to write this review, and I don't write many.  First off, movie was good, but you can see that from other reviews.  I am writing this to simply say that this DVD is horrible.   there is absolutely no special features on anything.  And if that isn't bad enough, the main reason that I write this is that there is not even a scene index on this DVD, so if you want to go to a certain scene, you have to fast forward.  In this day, you think they would at least have the scene index.
B00001QEE5|5.0|The prior reviewer needs a little schooling in widescreen. The 1st. true widescreen film was The Robe in Cinemascope 1953 and followed by How To Marry A Millionaire both by 20th Century Fox who owned the process. Not the King & I. By 1956 widescreen was in full swing with most of the studies either using Cinemascope or using one of their own. Quite possibly disney could give this film a matting since the industry standard in film was not 1.33 and tv was not yet a household item at the time. Also, disney did produce 2 films in widescreen Lady & The Tramp and Sleeping Beauty Cinemascope and Technirama. Both beautifully done on dvd and vhs. So please get your facts straight when make strong statements about others comments.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you were/are a fan of the above mentioned titles, I am sure you will love this show. It has the atmosphere of the X-files with the fun of Buffy/Angel. The story lines follow an \\"Investigating Urban Legends\\" arc, soon pushed aside for a greater threat of demons among us. Many episodes stand alone, while others continue to propel the war with the demons forward. You will find plenty to like about the Winchester brothers comaraderie that has now fully developed in season 2. I encourage you to pick this up and enjoy this Brilliant series!

Whoever remastered this from the original tapes FORGOT to mix in all the tracks and it sounds hollow. How incredibly annoying.

0141439610|5.0|A master craftsman of timeless classics that still garner accolades today, Wilkie Collins' brilliance was often eclipsed by the illustriousness of his well-known contemporary, Charles Dickens. Fortunately Collins' literary tour de force can still be enjoyed and appreciated today.<br /><br />The Woman In White is unquestionably one of his best works -- a superbly written, gripping gothic mystery that will enthrall Victorian lit and `whodunit' lovers alike. Complex, yet incredibly involving, the novel is full of atmosphere and rich description. Collins is also verified as a superb stylist with his evocative array of unforgettable characters.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Collins' allows several of his characters to espouse the role of narrator, which lends an exciting edge, where readers are unsure which characters, can or cannot, be trusted.<br /><br />When a mysterious woman clad in white, accosts Walter Hartright, a young art master on his way to a new commission to teach two half-sisters, the catalyst emerges upon which the entire narrative turns. The idealist Hartright is soon introduced to and fast becomes close friends with his two new pupils at Limmeridge House? Laura Fairlie, the young naïve maiden and heiress, who abides by her father's deathbed-wish to marry Sir Percival Glyde; and Marian Holcombe, head-strong, independent, and fiercely loyal to her younger half-sister. Despite Marian's belief that her sister's wedding should continue according to their father's wishes, Marian soon becomes suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions in marrying Laura, who she believes is only pursuing Laura for her fortune. Enter the cunning and rapacious Count Fosco from Italy, who is also strangely suave and genial a villain as one is likely to meet in literature. Sir Percival, together with his intelligent ally, Fosco, conspire to ruin the lovely Laura Fairlie, for her family fortune. There is also a secret of Sir Percival's that he will keep, whatever the cost. As a result, the sisters and Hartright are drawn into the intrigue and danger as the plot unfolds. What is Sir Percival's secret? Who is this woman in white? And how will she affect the lives of those at Limmeridge House?<br /><br />The engaging mystery wrapped up in The Woman In White vies three sanguine youth against the likes of avaricious, black-hearted villains who will stop at nothing to get what they want. It is truly a riveting classic that encompasses romance, drama and mystery. The Woman In White is a timeless favourite and a must-read for any classics lover!As a result, the sisters and Hartright are drawn into the intrigue and danger as the plot unfolds.

I think the price is too high and I didn't enjoy it as much because it cost me so much. Season 2 which I taped off of television is more enjoyable than Season 1.  David Tennant is just a warmer Doctor. Watching the finale of Season 2, I was also moved (in spite of myself!)

This movie is done without any plot or dialog. It is a grand panorama of many of our Earth's most beautiful scenery and Mankind's cultures. It is difficult to summarize as the movie is meant to encourage one to be \\"in the moment\\" with the movie, rather than trying to figure out what you are looking at or where it is. You just have to watch!

B000ION23A|5.0|Fantastic.  The Ant Bully is just a fantastic animated film on multiple levels.  The animation is superb, the characters are wonderfully memorable, the cast of voice actors boasts many a big name, and the story is as educational as it is entertaining.  Adults should have already learned the message of this film, but they can still enjoy The Ant Bully just as much as the kids.  Frankly, I had never even heard of this movie until a couple of weeks ago, and that's a real shame because this is an animated film that should have been talked about just as much as Cars, Happy Feet, etc.<br /><br />Like Lucas (Zach Tyler), the little boy in this film, I used to squirt water on ants and destroy their little ant hills - I'm not proud of that, but I was just a dumb kid.  Lucas has yet to learn that tormenting other creatures is bad.  A local bully keeps picking on him because he's little, so he turns around and picks on ants because he is bigger than they are.  For their part, the ants in his front yard have had enough of the horrible beast they call \\"Destroyer,\\" and thanks to a young wizard named Zoc (Nicolas Cage), they have a way to fight back.  Using a potion, they shrink Lucas down to their size and carry him back to the colony.  Many of the ants want to kill and eat their nemesis, but the benevolent Queen (Meryl Streep) decrees that he is to remain in the colony and, through training, learn to become an ant himself.  Zoc's girlfriend Hova (Julia Roberts) eagerly volunteers to train him, which threatens to drive a wedge between her and Zoc.<br /><br />Lucas makes for a stubborn student, rejecting the teamwork inherent in ant society; he doesn't need anybody's help, thank you very much.  Not having any human friends, he is even reluctant to accept the friendship that ants such as Hova offer him.  When the colony finds itself in danger, though - particularly when The Cloudbreather shows up to exterminate the lawn - Lucas sees the error of his ways, begins to understand how important friends are in life, and even goes so far as to risk his own life to protect those around him.  It's hard for a child to realize that a \\"me first\\" philosophy won't get you very far in life, and The Ant Bully communicates that very important lesson in a wonderful, expressive way.  While most animated films play strictly for laughs, The Ant Bully uses comedy to reinforce one of life's most important lessons.  Yes, there's an element of socialism in it all (and heaven knows how much I hate socialism), but the true message of the film is a good and proper one.<br /><br />I love this film's animation and cinematography.  The attention to detail is amazing; for example, it would have been all too easy to just give the ants plain white eyes, but these animators went the extra mile to make their ants' eyes reflect the convexity of real ants' compound eyes.  In terms of the cinematography, I found myself thinking back to some of the epic battle scenes from the original Star Wars trilogy as the ants rushed to defend their base from an aerial assault by wasps.  I also loved the scene where the view pulled way back for a dramatic ant-sized explosion, only to show - from a human perspective - the very modest poof of a little firecracker.  That doesn't sound like much, but I thought it was brilliant.  In fact, I thought this entire movie was brilliant.  And wait - there's more.  You also get to hear the great Ricardo Montalban and Bruce Campbell lend their voices to a couple of characters, as well.  Wow!  What else could you ask for?

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|A very enjoyable movie with a superb cast and supernatural overtones. Blurs reality in a convincing manner. The plot revolves around Ed Norton as a Magician, however as the movie progresses, you come to see that he is much more...at the very least a true Illusionist. I am a huge Ed Norton fan, and he is spot-on in this movie.

B000J103PC|4.0|Meryl Streep is surely the main draw to this movie. With one look, she shows her like or dislike. I especially like the way she pursed her lips, her admiration with one nod, two nods and the very rare smile she would give.     Emily Blunt and Stanley Gucci are wonderful. Anne Hathaway looked so attractive and classy in the second half of the movie. Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway in the limo letting their thoughts out were well presented and proved that Anne Hathaway could act and impress. Yet the movie was not as great as I expected.    Many a time the movie could not decide who the leading lady is. If it is Anne Hathaway, it failed because her performance was not consistent. It is one thing she had to display her lack in fashion sense, her ability to mix and match; it is quite another thing to deliberately dress her as bulky and unattractive. After all, she is a successful reporter at university with a brilliant resume. She can have brains as well as looks - casual as it may be. Second, if it is the fashion sense she lacks, the movie surely does not show much either. Compared with Project Runway or ANTM, fashion in this movie just focus on expensive clothes with not a single reference to fashion sense. Some dresses Anne Hathaway wore that were supposed to dazzle the room full of people did not really do her justice. Her other clothes at work were much more flattering. One can dress well without skyhigh price tags - just look at how good Anne Hathaway look in her leather jacket and jeans in the final scene.     More importantly, the script could have been bolder. It could not bring out Anne Hathaway as an intelligent, beautiful person with a dream, at least not in the first part of the movie. Here, there is no Melanie Griffth in Working Girl; no Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Only Meryl Streep can deliver throughout the movie. The unfortunate thing it doesn't look like she is the leading lady, unlike Glenn Close in Dangerous Liasions.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|What a great movie! Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Withersoon have exquisite chemistry and they really do justice to the legacy of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Amazing movie. Heath Ledger's performance as a laconic cowboy who falls in love with Gyllenhaal's more openly-gay character is what drives this movie. Ledger's performance is so multi-layered and subtle, as well as brave, that I don't see how he missed an Oscar for it. An extremely touching and beautiful movie, but sad and a little difficult to watch for that reason.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Ilove this CD/DVD!  I wish I could thank Kenny Wayne Shepherd for his efforts. He has so much talent, and yet is humble enough to join the original blues \\"legends\\" and share that music with all of us that love blues. He compliments and enhances the music perfectly.
1582405956|5.0|Frank Cho is one of my favorite artists. I started reading Frank Cho's Liberty Meadows comic strip and I really enjoyed his unique mix of \\"cartoony\\" animals and realistic humans. It reminded me of some of Bill Watterson's Sunday cartoons where he would represent Calvin as a realistically drawn adult. <br /> <br />This book, though, is not exclusively a Liberty Meadows book. It consists of figure studies, some nudes and a number of comic book covers. Most of the art is shown in finished form, but more interesting is where Mr. Cho shows the progression from rough pencil drawing to fully inked drawing. Mr. Cho is a truly talented artist and I look forward to seeing what he produces next.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Honestly everyone should watch this AT LEAST once.  Just like the title says it's an inconvenient truth. <br />There is no longer a \\"Debate\\" about global warming.  All but the most hardcore and hardheaded of right wing oil mongers realize that this is a serious issue that we are facing the consequences for.  Not just our children but we here today are facing it.   <br />This DVD will give you some great insight into that issue delivered beautifully by the man who won the US Presidential Election in 2000, President Gore. <br />Maybe, just maybe, you'll at least consider driving the small car to work the day after instead of the large SUV...
0385337388|4.0|I didn't read this book until I was a resident. The hospital I trained at wasn't anything like this in actuality, but the personalities, struggles, and oddities seem to be universal. A must-read for anyone in medical training.
1400049628|5.0|You may laugh, but what are you going to read when the zombies come for you? This book is overly thorough but has all you need to survive the inevitable walking dead invasion. Despite living in America, I was really surprised that many of my friends had no plan or enough fire arms. My friend, Tom, lives in New Orleans, known for zombies, and he hasn't read this yet. Highly recommended.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|I highly recommend this movie because it has seamless acting, a compelling story, and a wonderful soundtrack.
B000268QB2|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. I'd often listen to it while drunk and feeling sorry for myself. It's good for that. It's really effective for the 'girl that got away' thing, particularly 'Bed Shaped' and 'She Has no Time for You.' Talk about self loathing...I'd give it a 5 if only I hadn't sent a copy to the girl in question.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken may be short, but it is some of the hardest Industrial metal you can buy. It is definitely worth picking up, and is quite possibly Trent's best work. It is definitely up there with the best albums this band has put out. Every song is high energy, so get ready to rock, especially if you haven't heard this CD yet because it is awesome.
B00005JL96|5.0|This is one of Disney's more captivating modern movies. My husband and I don't have children, but we wore out the first VHS watching it. The acerbic nature of that little blue outcast is captivating. The basic morals that the story plays out are good for kids. But the humor keeps me buying copies as I burn them up.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|Once again, the folks at Marvel Comics have unleashed a big screen drama in the form of a cartoon.  Don't let the cover fool you.  This is not kid's stuff.  This movie was made for the hard-line, mature audiance, Tony Stark/Iron Man lover.  Not some saturday morning, hoaky, watered down version to amuse the kids.  Iron Man has always been a comic about romance, power, science, and the resolve of one man to live in-spite of himself.  With this brings meaning to one's life.  This version of the beginnings of the Iron Man charictor was great.  A must see.  Looking forward to more movies of this nature from my friends at Marvel Comics.
0060775858|5.0|I took this book out from the library in 1959 for my first child. It has never ceased to charm me through 5 children and 13 grandchildren. What is the magic? \\"Goodnight Moon\\" succeeds in entrancing everybody who sees and hears it. Unlike many other books suitable for children at an early age, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" charms adults as well. The repetition never bores, and surprises with small jokes like \\"Goodnight Nobody.\\" I ended up knowing it by heart. There's just some essence of the lyrical that is fully captured though you can't put your finger on it exactly. Maybe the author's publisher was right, \\"She's a genius.\\"
B000E33W1C|5.0|A wicked Ealing Comedy about twenty-five years after producer Michael Balcom stopped making them, \\"Wanda\\" is the inspired brainchild of John Cleese and director Charles Crichton (who directed such Ealing classics as \\"The Lavendar Hill Mob\\"). One part caper, one part sexy romance, two parts farce, three parts black humor, and altogether delightful. Even the actors with the smallest roles are hilarious, and the four principals--Cleese and Palin (the Brits), Curtis and Kline (the Yanks)--are gloriously funny. The Deluxe Edition is brimming with outtakes, commentary, and all that's needed to justify the price. But remember: \\"Don't call [him] stupid.\\"
B000M5AJQ8|4.0|The image is great.  Has a nice selection of extras, too.  But this movie sounds weak.  The little hydraulic sounds the menu makes when you bring it up is loud, but this movie sounds soft.  I have a 5.1 surround sound system, but I had to crank the sound way up from what I normally use to hear a lot of the dialog.  It just sounds quiet, and it doesn't use the surround speakers enough.  I got the HD DVD (for $35) expecting a theater perfect experience, but this movie just sounds weak.  I've tried the \\"5.1 surround\\" and the \\"True HD\\" sound, and none of them are loud enough.  It's a shame cause this movie deserves better.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|First of all, of all the places to vacation after the death of a child, why would Brad and Kate choose the desert around Morocco?  I didn't get that part at all.  I guess it was as desolate as their lives??  This film was very slow and unsatisfying.  Seems like America took some hits via border agents and news accounts of terroism.   <br /> <br />The mood was very tense, which did keep my attention.  I'm glad it wasn't any longer.

B0000C9ZSV|2.0|Many \\"critics\\" and fellow musicians alike have/had counted Jimi out by 1970, however, you can hear the intensity in which he plays with on tracks like Johnnie B. Goode and Hey Joe, the later of which may be the best, most tonal version available.  You can hear police radios bleeding into the feed-back.  If you a \\"true\\" fan of Jimi, you will already have this music in one form or fashion, if your are curious, it is well worth owning it.  It's truly awesome how 37 years after Jimi's untimely death,  his hold on generations of fans continues to expand. It is extremely likely that 100 years from now, they will still be listening to Jimi!  Buy it, you will NOT regret it!
B000J4QWMC|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever -- period.  The positive reviewers here must be using what everybody's selling on screen.  Like Rembrandt painting with his feet.
B00003CX8N|4.0|This delightful tale of a 20 year correspondence between a New York writer and a London bookseller made me smile a lot. There is more to it than that, but that's the net result. The movie is better than the book, but by all means read the book first, it's a fast read. The book is the actual correspondence on which the movie is based. Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are perfectly cast, as is everyone else.
1559408855|1.0|This is not a review of the Criterion edition. I have seen several of their productions, and they are the best! This is about this movie. <br /> <br />This film is sick. Very sick. I am not a prude. I am a grown up gay man with rather radical views.  <br />Still this film made me throw up when I saw it while preparing to write an essay on the director for a gay, cultural magazine. <br />I am aware of Pasolinis intentions of describing the real inner life and dephts of fascism, and I hate anything that even comes near to fascist views, even ordinary right wing views. <br /> <br />And still: This is the most evil film I have ever seen. <br />To think up this film, even with the literary source of it as a background, Pasolini had to use his own imagination. And I am glad I never knew a person with such an imagination (at least I hope I don't know any such person). <br />And worst of all: The young kids in the movie had to go through these scenes, to act out this sick story. To do those things! I do really hope they have been taken good care of ever since! <br />I do not understand how it can be high art, except for being very professionally acted and photographed.  <br />For the rest of it: I will never watch as much as a minute of this film again! <br />After viewing it I had to watch The Sound of Music three times. In a row! That was the best thing I could think of, just to get the images of this film away. <br />But they are still there. Two years later. <br />Do not watch this! You can't ever really escape its images, and you do not want to carry them around with you. There are other ways to find out what fascism is. This is only pollution!
B00005JPKC|5.0|This movie is arguably the best movie of 2006.  It's complete & comprehensive.  Who would have thought that Clint Eastwood betters himself every year in the craft of movie making? I have to say that \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is sublime.  For audience who have watched the American side in \\"Flag of our Fathers\\", this offering is able to fill some holes in the first movie. Whilst the first movie is more intense in battle scenes, this second movie goes the other way.  It focuses more on intimate scenes of Japanese soldiers hiding in underground caves and trenches to conduct guerilla warfare similar to ones used by VietCong during Vietnam War writing letters to their loved ones.  Here, we could understand why the Japanese lost the battle even before it had begun.  Most Japanese officers were deeply entrenched in the belief of death before dishonour and they would opt for gungho showdown rather than conserving resources to fight via element of surprises. Watanabe Ken is fabulous as the worldly General who'd been ordered to lead the Japanese side when most of his officers were disagreeing and disobeying his orders anyhow.  He's protrayed as a humane General who would perform his duty with courage, dignity and integrity despite of his yearning to go home safely to his family.  As Japanese force was severely depleted, there weren't any reinforcement and resources left to complement his strategies to undermine the American side.  Compounded by mass suicide of his soldiers as ordered by mutinied officers, he's fighting a losing battle and he knew it.  Audience bonded with two reluctant soldiers, Saigo  who was originally a baker & was coerced to become a soldier when the numbers were running thin; Shimizu, an ex-Kempeitai (akin to German's much feared Gestapo) who was sent to Iwo Jima because he wasn't tough enough.  They were torn between responsibilities to their Emperor & their country versus their longing to return home safely to their families.  There, there's also Nishi, an Olympic horsejumper who in his heydays would host party for Mary Pickford & Douglas Fairbank and who would volunteer himself to serve his country and a humanist officer; Ito, an inflexible militant akin to Tojo Hideki who would order his troops to their deaths just to win the battle. Here, we witnessed Americans soldiers gunned down Japanese soldiers even though they surrendered themselves, Japanese officers killing their own kinds just because they opted not to fight anymore, how some captured American soldiers were treated humanely in captivity by Japanese and some would be bayonetted & tortured cruelly. Certain scenes were deeply disturbing such as suicides with grenades, flamethrowers that gobbled everything and everyone along their paths. This is where war raises its ugly head and the time when we contemplate and asking why there need to be war at the first place.  It's ironic having a war movie suggesting an anti-war message.  This monochrome movie concludes rightfully with sunrise in glowing orange suggesting that the worst's over and a better promise & hope for future generations.  As read in the book, Ken's character ended up committing hara-kiri whilst to make it poetic in this movie, he used a pistol to kill himself that's been gifted to him during his stay in America.  An unmissable experience and an unforgettable movie. It's very rare a movie would give me lumps in my throat and what a sight to witness to see so many teary faces and people being contemplative in the cinema as end credit rolls.  Keep up the good work, Clint!

But we use different textbook, which was more narrow and doesn't touch the standard library at all. Even the temple chapter is hard to understand.

B000AY74OG|5.0|Every animal lover and kid alike should have this movie in there collection.  We find ourselves singing \\"You got to Move it Move it\\" from the dance and laughing about the penguins.  Worth buying and watching over and over again.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|First of all, anyone would love this movie if they like action.  Many Bond fans will hail Craig as the new and best bond, but thats just because hes new.  Everyone said that about Brosnan after Goldeneye, and I bet they said it almost every time a new Bond opened with a good first movie.   <br /> <br />So, let me start by saying, however, the film rocked. Really, I loved it. So why the three stars instead of 4 or 5?  Because it didn't feel like Bond to me.  It had some of the musical feel (not enough use of the original theme though), the same characters, but so many things were missing.  Q, Moneypenny, and an appropriate intro.  Yes, I hated the intro. Why? No girls. I'm not a pervert, but virtually every other Bond intro had girls dancing to the movie's theme. Not so in this film.  Instead we faced the polar opposite; guys getting shot and beaten up.  It was artistically done, and Bondworthy, if only there had been some lady silhouettes to balance it. <br /> <br />This movie tries so hard to set itself apart from other Bond movies the way Batman Begins set itself apart from other Batman movies.  It worked for Batman Begins, but thats because the other Batman movies sucked for the most part.  There is nothing wrong with the rest of the Bond franchise as a whole (except for Lazenby).  <br /> <br />This new movie is also notably gritty and too realistic.  Other Bond movies had ridiculous plots, usually involving something in space (like the moon, or a satellite) or some distant island with a midget or maybe some lasers or advanced nuclear technology, and lets not forget Jaws Jackson or Oddjob.  This one had a less crazy plot about a private Banker stealing money from his clients and having some big Poker Tournament. Now less crazy isn't necessarily bad. At least it got rid of some of the camp in the Bond films.  But it still needs that element of Fantasy that makes it a modern spy movie.  There's no invisible car in this one, there's no remote control car either, andthere's no laser guns or ethnic midgets.   <br /> <br />It feels unfulfilling to see everything that made Bond such a unique franchise go remiss in this newest installment.  So, don't get me wrong, the movie rocked. However, I still wish there was a little more Bond in this Bond film.  Daniel Craig, great job, director and script writer, bad bad bad.

0739326651|3.0|I read this booking hoping for more. Instead, I found the typical political memoir that pandered to just about every interst group and political issue. I didn't think it was particularly well-written or organized. If anything, this book made me realize that even as a Democrat, I would most likely not vote for Obama.<br /><br />It's worth reading and it will give the reader a better handle on who Obama allegedly is. Overall, I felt he pandered to everyone and I didn't have a strong enough sense about who he really is politically. He's all over the place, IMO.
0099526409|5.0|Brown's chronicle of the systemic slaughter and betrayal of American Indians at the hands of the US government is the highly readable and heartbreaking history your social studies teacher never told you about.  Dee Brown single-handedly turned back the American myth of the noble settlers fighting the savage Indians and his unimpeachable documentation to original sources has made this the definitive classic of Native American history.
B0002HMQUS|5.0|I have Essential Tremor and have trouble holding a camera still.  Even with the new image stabilizing technology, photos still show signs of camera movement at times.  This monopod has taken my photos to a new level.  I no longer worry about the camera moving.  When collapsed, it can be carried on cruises, hikes, etc.  Construction is much heavier (but not heavy to carry)than I expected and the tilt head makes photos of things on the ground possible, too.  Well worth the price.
B000002H33|5.0|For the longest time I was under the impression that Metallica was a 90's band.  Simply because I was about well .. unborn when Kill Em All released in 1982 ( or was it 83? if so, i was 1 lol ).  So, I was young and ignorant to all the fine pure thrash metal Metallica was putting out before the life ending sound change that occured with the Black album.  So I was a subject of the black album and beyond ( and even I knew the stuff after Black was horrible ).  So, you can imagine my shock when I find Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets in the 80's section at the local music shop!  I was thinking, \\" 80s music?!! 80's music sucked horrid \\" but I got them anyway.  Its Metallica, even when they suck for 10 years, you still have to give them a chance because you know their capabilities. <br /> <br />Well, long story short, I havent listened to anything Metallica 90's ever since hearing this album.  I got the others of course from the 82-89 period, and they are all on an entirely different plane then anything else done by another metal band.  Simply put, they are the master of metal.  They are the master of the metal puppets and they have a musical balance and appreciation that is still well beyond anything a so called metal band of the new millenium can push out.  Master of Puppets is by and large their most well produced album.  The album sucks you in and pushes you into a ride of extreme metal from Battery to Garage Inc. with some pleasantries thrown in for good measure.  Orion is probably the most beautiful Metal Instrumental ever produced.  It is a song you will listen to over ... and over ... and over ... and over ... and over.  Wishing that the simple melodies of the electric guitar were played just a little bit longer, but because they are not ... you have no mind in putting the song on repeat and humming those sections allowed when they arrive.  Battery is a thrash metal fans dream song.  But they are pale in comparison to the utter mind blowing rock of Masterof Puppets.  Simply the most hardcore, fastest, most energetic Metal song of all time.  9 minutes of head banging shouting metal with the most unique chorus of jams of all time.  You'll play this song and wonder just how the hell these guys had the energy to complete the song originally.  Its fast with crazy transitions and slides and tapping and everything else thrown in and thats just the main chorus.  Then you got thrash metal solos thrown in, some slow solos to give your head a break, and then it all kicks back in and your back to breaking your neck with no hope of stopping.  Sanitarium is probably their best lyrical work of this album, and the solos are fun to listen to as well. <br /> <br />All in  all, this is the best metal album of all time.  When you listen to this album, you will see just how ahead of the curve Metallica was, especially for the 80's, and how far ahead they still are today.  This is the stuff of legend, and it will never fade away.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a very recent convert to \\"Firefly\\" (I saw my first episode in January 2007 after a friend insisted I watch this show).  I must say that \\"Firefly\\" was truly a wonderful show that never got the chance to develop into what it could have been.  This is not surprising given the short sightedness of programming exec's.  They tend to drop innovative character driven shows such as \\"Firefly\\", \\"Dead Like Me\\" and \\"Wonder Falls\\" for a series of shows which revolve around either Courts, Law Enforcement and Investigation or Reality Programming.  What a waste of talent and potential. <br /> <br />The followup movie, \\"Serenity\\" was not the best sci-fi movie I have seen, and I would have given it 3.5 stars as a stand alone show.  This would have been based on just the stand alone movie (which is the first part of this series that I actually saw in mid 2006).  Certainly \\"Serenity\\" would score higher now that I know more about the series and characters by watching (and loving) the \\"Firefly\\" series. <br /> <br />My favorite episode was \\"Jaynesville\\".  Just absolutely hilarious.   <br /> <br />I would without reservation recommend the \\"Firefly\\" series to all people that enjoy shows built around characters and excellent writing.  This show is so good, that I decided to buy the series.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|The biblical tower of Babel created the myriad of languages that we speak on Earth, or so the story goes. We developed over time different ways, different cultures, and those differences are often driving points in the global conflicts that we face today. However, in Babel, despite the language and cultural separations, we are really connected by strings, connected by being the humans that we are. This connectivity is explored in this thought provoking movie.<br /><br />We start with a Moroccan family, two young brothers who love each other, despite their constant and common sibling bickering. Their fahter is sold a high quality rifle to scare off jackals from his herd of sheep, and gives it to the oldest son, who works in the field. The younger son is a natural shot, as is proven early on during their target practice. Trying to both prove to each other their manliness, and the power of the rifle, the two brothers stand on top of a mountain hilltop, and take a potshot at a bus, rather nonchalantly. The bus stops, and the drama quickly escalates.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and my personal favorite actress Cate Blanchette play an American couple struggling with the death of one of their children. They are on a tour of Morocco with a group of internationals, and are riding the ill-fated bus. Meanwhile, their two surviving children are staying with their live-in nanny, a second mother really, who desires to go to their son's wedding in Mexico. A fourth story comes in with a deaf-mute Japanese girl struggling with her sense of belonging and sexuality, and somehow mysteriously is tied into the other three stories.<br /><br />Each story has a thread, if somewhat thin, that links it together, and by the end of the movie, all becomes clear as to how they are linked and why. Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's deft handling of what could be a confusing conundrum of a plot makes the film both entertaining, heartbreaking, and suspenseful. A proven master of such story telling (yes, he made the brilliant Amores Perros!), Babel thrives in his vision.<br /><br />The standout of this movie, however, is not the often-cited Mr. Pitt, whom cameras follow around at will. Nope, the two standout performances were THANKFULLY acknowledge by AMPAS. First, Rinko Kikuchi's stunning performance as Cheiko, the deaf mute Japanese girl, is breathless, stunning, amazing. Whenever she appeared on the screen, her sadness and confusion was so real. She nearly steals this movie. As she longs to be a part of the world that she sees around her, you realize that every story has people in it that don't quite belong either, and we have another thread.<br /><br />And if it's even possible, Adriana Barraza's performance as Amelia, the Mexican nanny, delivers a performance that I now believe should get the Best Supporting Actress for this year (and I'm a grat Jennifer Hudson fan!). She starts off tame enough; we've all seen this performance a hundred times before. But then, as her story progresses, and she descends into a personal hell, her story becomes so heartbreaking that I wanted to reach through the screen and take her into my arms myself. She conveys such pride and sorrow in her final scene in the movie where she attempts to justify her actions; you know what's happened, why it happened, and it both outrages you and breaks your heart. Give Barraza the Oscar now!<br /><br />Babel is not a film for everyone.

B000I5X81K|5.0|Ok.First of all,I am a big JG fan.I have pretty much all of his songs.That said ,I'll agree that Josh did experiment.His African direction on a few of the songs is due to his recent visit to South-Africa,where he was inspired.I think experimentation is good for artists,but personaly I didn't like these African songs.  What I did like was the rest of the album.These are my favorites.  You Are Loved-so inspiring and love the music.Josh really shows off.  February Song-co-written with Five for Fighting (which shows).  So She Dances- beautiful and has a waltz-like rythm.Tells of a hidden romance that's \\"calling me silently\\".  Now Or Never- Imogen Heap lends her incredible talent.Interesting lyrics,accompaniment,some Immi mixing.Cool.    So although it wasn't as good as Closer,and not quite as singable due to some new falcetto,Josh still delivers.

B00005JNS0|5.0|I thought Cars was one the greatest movies.  It is right up there with Lion King, Beauty and the Beast & Little Mermaid, Toy Story and other kid/adult movies.   It is funny and the adult humor is there through out the movie to keep the \\"big people\\" watching along with the \\"little people.\\"  Would watch it over again!
B000LT2IHI|3.0|My 1-year-old daughter loves her ball popper toy, and when we received this as a gift, I thought this would be great.  And she does enjoy it.  It makes cute noises, and she loves to feed it the balls and watch them go around.  She also likes to push the button on the giraffe's head to make him play sounds. <br />There are a few problems with it, though, causing me to rate it at 3 stars. <br />One is that the balls don't always go into the giraffe's mouth easily -- you have to get them just right, or they stick, and little baby hands don't always get them in there just right.  This is frustrating for her. <br />Second, when she tries to pull up to standing on it, it tips.  Not all the way over, and if she was pulling from her knees, it might not be a problem, but she's pulling from a seated position, and it keeps wanting to tip, which makes me nervous. <br />Thirdly, the balls don't always emerge fully from the tunnel, so they \\"disappear.\\"  At this age, she doesn't understand that sometimes she needs to fish the balls out, so I have to get them for her. <br />It's an entertaining toy, but I would prefer something that doesn't require so much adult intervention/supervision.
B000LC55F2|3.0|Unfortunatley PRESTIGE did not quite live up to the \\"dueling magicians\\" concept the film appeared it would be in the previews.<br /><br />Also, we always hate films that pretty much start near the end, then tell the whole story in backflash.......... that knocks 1/2 the wind out of a film's sails everytime.<br /><br />Great idea, but faltered in it's execution despite all the great talent involved.<br /><br />The ILLUSIONIST was a much more entertaining period piece about magic with<br /><br />good plot twists
B00000K2W1|5.0|This compilation, while certainly not comprehensive, is very good for those who aren't familiar with Janis Joplin's work (such as I). The only songs of hers that I had truly been familiar with are \\"Take Another Piece Of My Heart\\", \\"Me And Bobby McGee\\" and \\"Mercedes Benz\\", When I heard this disc, all of the other songs, I hadn't been familiar with, so from a casual perspective, this CD is quite good and I wasn't disappointed with hearing any of the songs I didn't know. So, I recommend this CD to anyone who has a limited knowledge of Janis Joplin's songs and wants to \\"start out\\", so to speak, getting to know her work. I was really pleased with every song on this disc and the sound is excellent, also.
1582701709|1.0|Some friends of mine came across the DVD of \\"The Secret\\" and begged me to watch it. They proclaimed this was some life changing idea and the answer to all their economic wishes (logically translated). So I watched it, and then looked at them with antipathy and bewilderment. Maybe the arrogant, ruinous, and bottom line motives of the producers/authors of this garbage are more apparent to me given the years I have studied philosophy; however, I cannot help but to get a bad taste in my mouth knowing this is a bestseller and seeing all of these positive reviews.    In order to protect my own sanity and quality of life I will leave a suggestion to all those who have purchased this material (whether in video or print format) and given it a favorable review. Liken your mind to the idea of flying. Think, eat, and breathe your metaphysical opposition to gravity. Do this for a few months, or at least as long as it takes a child to materialize a bicycle, then firmly place your copy of \\"The Secret\\" in a pocket, traverse to the highest accessible point in your area, and jump. The law of attraction should take care of the rest.
0671646788|5.0|This is one of the most cherished books in my collection. It's the type of book you will inform others about and one you will refer to repeatedly.  <br /> <br />Ironically, there is no \\"Magic\\" behind the timeless lessons presented here; Schwartz simply exemplifies the characteristics and actions of the proactive, optimistic, assertive, and successful individual. The tools provided in this book are extremely effective, and Schwartz's presentation is motivating and inspiring.  <br /> <br />\\"The Magic of Thinking Big\\" has a place on anyone's desk, regardless of their position on the career lattice. This book will increase your productivity, demeanor, awareness, and success in all facets of life.
B000I2J2W2|5.0|An all time classic film.  Nice restoration for HD-DVD.  Good clean quality visual and audio.  Makes good use of the HD quality, even though you can see some film grain if you are looking, you can also clearly tell it is a hi-resolution transfer. I can recommend this to any classic Sci-fi lover with HD-DVD.  This is still a favorite, that anyone can appreciate.
0753820250|5.0|''The Shadow on the Wind'' by Spanish novelist, Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a magnificent read from start to finish!  This fascinating tale is set in post-war Barcelona and is told through the eyes of a boy, Daniel who is on a mission to track down the mysterious author of a book he inherits.  The beautificially descriptive prose and language used by Zafon builds a wonderfully atmospheric picture of the shady Ramblas district and the intriguing characters that inhabit Daniel's life.<br /><br />The opening line in the book really drew me in ''I still remember the day my father took me to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books'' leaving me wanting to read more and discover just what what this Cemetery of Forgotten Books was.  I was not disappointed, Daniel's quest takes him on a epic journey where he meets a host of beguiling characters along the way.<br /><br />One of the more sinister characters he meets is Chief Inspector Fumero - ''his appearance and manner seemed vaguely familiar although I couldn't say why.  Something about him reminded me of one of those figures from old-fasioned playing cards or the sort used by fortune-tellers, a print straight from the pages of an incunabulum;  his presence was both funereal and indandescent, like a curse dressed in its Sunday best''.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Zafon's decriptive narration of the Barcelona neighbourhood ''Dusk fell almost serrendititiously with a cold breeze and a mantle of puple light that slid between the gaps in the streets.  If you close your eyes, you can almost imagine yourself there.<br /><br />This tale has mystery, romance and adventure and it takes you along on Daniel's amazing life journey and all of its trials and tribulations.<br /><br />For me, this book was a joy to read and I look forward to the release of Carlos Ruiz Zafon's next novel!
B000IONJH4|5.0|Good HD restoring and remastering job.  I had just watched the restored DVD version, and can definitely say that the HD version is much higher quality.  It is, though, the so called \\"short version\\" of the film, as originally shown in theaters, not the \\"extended\\" version that came out later on DVD.  Well worth getting if you liked the original Dune movie.
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|A dear friend of mine was kind enough to lend me a copy of this CD. With my friend and I being fellow musicians, it stands to reason that we both have a deep love and passion for music. In a recent discussion, we were talking about Pat Metheny, Jean-Luc Ponty among others, and it was there that he lent me a copy of Pat Metheny's Still Life (Talking). From the moment I inserted it into my CD player I was taken away to a beautiful musical landscape. Such songcraft, such sentimentality and musicianship. A true measure of what music is supposed to be. Minuando (Six Eight) is a wonderful  beginning to what is a beautiful crafted collection of music, and my personal favorite Last Train Home is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. It was even used in an Amtrak commercial sometime ago. (There's a piece of trivia) Thank you Mr. Metheny for bringing us music as it was meant to be. Delivered from the heart and hands with love, craftsmanship and teutonic musicianship.

B000FS9FCQ|1.0|This movie is too long.  I didn't like it.  Didn't find it that interesting.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Well, at least \\"Babel\\" is not button-pushing pretentious, like Crash. \\"Babel\\" is a good movie, and one I would probably give 4 stars to, if it wasn't for the oh-so-important premise.  You aim high, you can also fall far.  Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is too good a director to fall very far, but he does stumble.  On the good side, just as in 21 Grams, he really brings out the best in his actors. For example, Brad Pitt is no longer Brad Pitt, but a gray haired husband and father on a vacation that turns bad.  There is an early scene Pitt has with Cate Blanchett at a table in a blasted landscape that I swear was influenced by Hemingway's short story \\"Hills Like White Elephants.\\"  Clearly, Inarritu is one literate guy, and one who can frame that literacy in one remarkable scene after another.   But do all these fine parts equal a whole?  I don't think they do.   <br /> <br />Perhaps unintentionaly, the glue in all of this seems to be the furious camera work. Inarritu uses cinematography like a busy surgeon, zipping from the wastelands of Morocco, to the city lights of Japan, to the border of the U.S.  As dazzling as all this back and forth non-linear story-telling is, holes exist in the story, and in a way that the telling of it can not excuse.  You are left, by film's end with the sense that the relationship between the three stories is tenuous at best, and to insist for more wrecks the fragile balance Inarritu was trying to achieve.   As stand alone stories, I thought each could easily have been expanded into their own films.   But by insisting upon a connective thread, even if that thread is the paradoxical Babel message, the director was rolling for a high number and an audience that would appreciate and buy into the way in which he rolled.  In Babel's case, Style must go hand in hand with Substance, and that is not what Inarritu delivered.  Still, Inarritu is a great director who is going to make a lot of great films, and I welcome the risk taking going on in Babel,even if I'm not totally satisfied with the result. <br />
0743289412|5.0|I adored this book, not just because it was written by Stephen King. As others have mentioned, it is not the same as much of his previous work. I have read everything that King has written, and his latest books seem to be much more reflective. That is definately the case with this book. Here King explores the nature of love and trust beautifully.
0060763280|3.0|This book has some good ideas but the \\"free\\" class offered is a little misleading.<br /><br />The book promotes itself by offering a \\"free\\" class that it says is worth $2590 but they charge a $97 materials fee to go to the class.<br /><br />I didn't feel the class was worth 3 days of time. Save your time and money.  The audio CDs they provided for the class were mainly interviews of successful people and are good...but not sure if it was worth $97.<br /><br />The class isn't much more than reviewing the points made in the book and there isn't much more info other than what was in the book.  If you read the book, you don't need to waste time or money going to the class.<br /><br />The speaker repeats what was in the book and a lot of time is wasted on stuff that has nothing to do with learning or education.  About every 10 to 15 minutes the speaker asks you to shake the hands of everyone around you, tell each other \\"you have a millionaire mind\\", hug each other, stand up and do stretch excercises, etc.  The class is also a big sales pitch trying to get you to buy coaching time, other books, materials, etc.<br /><br />The new stuff mentioned in the class could have been given out in maybe 2 hours of time.  It didn't require a waste of 3 days of time. The additional stuff isn't worth wasting 3 days of time and $97 of money.<br /><br />The class basically feels like you are in kindergarten.  The teacher tells you what he wants you to say, tells you to repeat what he says, and a lot of fake enthusiasm.<br /><br />Save your time and money and don't go to the class. The book has good info, but the \\"free class\\" for $97 is a waste your time and money.  The seminars they try to sell at the \\"free class\\" cost thousands of dollars each.  I haven't taken any of the other classes.
B000M341QE|4.0|Great film -- keep any prejudices or expectations aside when you watch this, this ain't GoodFellas, Taxi Driver or anything else the other reviewers try to compare this with. You'll appreciate it more that way.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Just when I thought My Chemical Romance couldn't release anything better than Three Cheers.. they surprised me once again with this amazing album. They just keep getting better and better. Their first CD \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\" was good. \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" was awesome. And now \\"The Black Parade\\" is even better!<br /><br />Alot of people don't like them simply because they've changed their sound. Yeah, I love the old MCR.. but these new songs are so much deeper and more meaningful. They're still the same band and they didn't sell out.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go grab a copy of The Black Parade.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I'm going to see them live on Sunday in Philly<br /><br />with Rise Against.<br /><br />These boys have seriously changed my life.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|A few weeks ago, I walked into the music department at my local media store, and heard a classic, driving blues number playing.  I instantly asked, \\"Who IS this?\\" and the clerk held up 10 Days Out, a CD / DVD combo by Kenny Wayne Shepherd.  I did not know Mr. Shepherd, and the price tag was a bit daunting, but I made a mental note anyway.<br /><br />A few days later, I walked into the same store, and heard a great version of a blues song I know well, The Thrill Is Gone, and again, I instantly asked, \\"Who IS this?\\"  Much to my surprise, the clerk again held up this CD / DVD combo, and I knew immediately that I had to get it.<br /><br />Upon further perusal, I realized that there were some very good reasons why it caught my attention.  Two of them are guest artists B. B. King and Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, two of the most respected blues artists in the genre.  Since taking it home, I have discovered there are at least a half-dozen more good reasons for liking it, all in the form of the many special guest stars who show us what the blues are all about.<br /><br />Despite a lukewarm review by Rolling Stone (and their website is ablaze with fans complaining that the reviewer for R. S. missed the boat on this one) I have to say it's one of the more accessible and enjoyable blues jams I've yet acquired, and that's saying a lot.  Picking a favorite track is hard out of so many gems (and how better to know when you've purchased a great piece of music; so much of today's \\"product\\" - in almost any musical category - offers a single listenable track, or hit, and even that is usually overrated) but I have a sentimental weakness for the old tune, Sitting On Top of the World, which has been recorded by countless artists in the blues, jazz, country, western swing, bluegrass and folk canons - how's THAT for a roots perennial?<br /><br />If you know nothing about blues but have always been curious, especially if you have a penchant for R & B or rock and roll, and want to explore their true roots, this album may just open up a whole new world for you.  And if it doesn't, it's still a great piece of music.<br /><br />Since receiving it in the mail three days ago, I haven't been able to get the CD off my stereo long enough to check out the DVD portion, but user reviews I've read say that's the best part.  Hard to fathom, but I'm sure looking forward to it.just open up a whole new world for you.  And if it doesn't, it's still a great piece of music.

0670034711|2.0|..I think it is more like a long magazine article than like a book. The writer uses a lot of slangy expressions and popular culture references. In five years, I think it will seem very dated.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|The biggest problem with this film is the script;it needs to be trimmed severely.Two hours of plodding disappointment and \\"bad luck\\" for about two minutes of happiness does not make for the most effective viewing.Much of the hardship could have been compressed and the point would have still been made effectively.Will Smith's performance of(inspired by a true story) Chris Gardner is truly outstanding and the film is worth a see just for that alone;but overall the film has a drone about it that stays stuck in a downward spiral just like it's lead character.DOOR TO DOOR with William H.Macy is a better treatment of a similar subject.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a must see for everyone, this video tells you the truth about the government and the iraq war in a raw, uncensored manner, you can't make an educated decision about politics if you don't know understand both sides.
B00005JPFQ|3.0|I did make it out to see this movie finally, and it was, but not great. I like nicholas cage in this film, and funny to see peter fonda as the devil.  The action was decent, and the story was ok, but very comic book, didn't translate well to a movie. I loved the punisher, and the spider-man movies are entertainingly far fetched.  The acting just wasn't up to the level of those movies, and the story wasn't one of my facvorite comics.  so check it out, good for some entertainment, but not a must have in my opinion
0446615625|4.0|As for the one and two stars below--they are unwarranted.  <br /> <br />Near future; one of those \\"we can't go to the police\\" type of stories.  The book centers itself around four conspiracy theorists who call themselves the Camel Club; one stakes out as a protester near the White House.  These men draw in two government officials on the case after they witness a murder.  They don't know it but an incredibly devised plot is in the process by multiple countries. There are many characters to keep track of; they all slowly assemble throughout the book as if drawn by a magnet.  Could something of this magnitude possibly happen? <br /> <br />Definitely a page turner; not a Tom Clancy or a Ralph Peters, more like Dan Brown, only a tad better.  Well researched, with interesting factoids and good political points. <br /> <br />I do feel the the author is trying to make a political statement.  This may just be the way he wanted his characters, but it is pronounced throughout.  There are some ridiculous moments, although they can be overlooked.  I think the power to the executive is unrealistic.  Overall, a well thought out conspiracy. <br /> <br /> <br />Wish you well <br />Scott <br /> <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|Oasis have never sounded so good. Gem and Andy have really found their feet in the band now and this is an improvement on their previous album 'The Heathen Chemistry'. These two bring something that make Oasis more of a complete band and not just the Noel and Liam show. While I still find 'Definitely Maybe' the best Oasis album, the Manchester lads have gone full circle with their career and nearly matched it with this effort. It almost feels like they have started their careers again and from here the sky is the limit. More great live shows and #1 singles and I really think they can reach the heights of the mid 90's again and keep their feet grounded at the same time.<br /><br />  This is a great album from beginnig to end. The songs flow perfectly into one another and sounds like the most complete album Oasis have ever released. It opens up with 'Turn Up The Sun', which at first doesn't sound like Oasis until the first chords kick in after a great opening few seconds. Written by Andy Bell it is top 3 best tracks on the album.<br />'Mucky Fingers' written by Noel is a cross between the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan<br />'Lyla' the first single, is a good song, not great, very simple but typical Oasis in its chord playing, also written by Noel.<br />'Love Like a Bomb' written by Liam and Gem is a highlight of the album, a mixture of acoustic guitar and piano it is Liam's vocal on this track that got my attention, much like the way in which he sings 'songbird'.<br />'The Importance Of Being Idle' Noel sings on this track which he also wrote, the second single off the album, sounds a little bit like 'the Doors'.<br />'The meaning of Soul' is a two minute fast acoustic driven song by Liam with a simple drum beat, unlike anything I have ever heard from Oasis before. It sounds familiar but I can't quite put my finger on it. Catchy and stays in your head.<br />'Guess God Thinks I'm Abel', another Liam penned track, has a cool tempo and mellow atmosphere. A slow song, not one of Liams best unfortunately.<br />'Part Of The Queue' Noel was inspired to write this song after being forced to stand in a real long queue just to buy a pint of milk. He considered stealing it even with his millions in the bank. Has a 70's feel to it, almost like a protest song.<br />Along with track 1, this song 'Keep The Dream Alive' is one of my favourites, also written by Andy Bell, this guy writes good songs. A very happy tune with good guitar and Liam's vocal sounds great.<br />'A Bell will Ring' is Gem's contribution to the album. A pure rock n' roll song, in the mould of 'Hung In A Bad Place' from Heathen Chemistry.<br />That brings us to the albums closer, 'Let There Be Love' the best song on the album and arguably the best Oasis song ever. It features Liam and Noel on vocal and I rate it right up there along with the Beatles 'A Day In the Life'. John and Paul could have easily have written this song,but it is written by Noel. The third single, this has the potential to pull in fans much like the way 'Wonderwall' did.<br /><br />  The album sounds great, the production and mixes are perfect. The band opted to hire Dave Sardy to produce and mix the album for them, instead of doing it themselves and it has really paid off for them. He was also responsible for producing Jet and really knows how to acheive this kind of sound. Also lending out on this album is Zak Starkey on drums, son of the legendary Beatles drummer Ringo, he is a more complete drummer than Alan White.<br /><br />  The album features a 6 page booklet with complete lyrics for all songs. A great buy...rtunately.   'Part Of The Queue' Noel was inspired to write this song after being forced to stand in a real long queue just to buy a pint of milk.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I appreciate and collect fine Sci-Fi movies (such as Blade Runner, Aeon Flux, Ultra Violet, Minority Report, Equilibrium, Pitch Black, etc.). Firefly/Serenity, however, moves far beyond a simple \\"Sci-Fi\\" characterization.    I purchased \\"Serenity\\" a little while ago, and was pleasantly attracted to the cast and its gritty story line.  I found myself watching this movie a number of times, and it continued to grow on me.  -Imagine combining Sci-Fi with script writing such as found in \\"The Last Boyscout\\", \\"True Lies\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\" and you have found your match in Space.  Incredible!  The next step was a logical one: I wanted more of Serenity's caliber of story line.  That motivated me to purchase the Firefly collection.  And after watching them twice already, I can say that you really cannot go wrong obtaining these releases.  Trust me!  Plenty of character development, (space) action and intrigue.  The picture res of all 14 episodes is at least 720p/1080i (and fits your hi-def widescreen TV set perfectly) -soundtracks are decent too.    I would recommend Firefly/Serenity to any Sci-Fi fan, Trekkies and Star Wars fans alike.  Remember though, that a number of Firefly episodes are intended for a mature audience.  These are not your proverbial dad's cutesy Star Trek story lines.  It really is too bad that there are currently no follow-up Firefly episodes in the pipeline.  There is yet so much more to the story and the characters that hasn't been revealed.  I am hopeful though, that some media outlet will pick up the thread someday.    Enjoy (\\"They can't take the sky from me\\")!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|The Departed<br /><br />Movie number 2 out of 5 in the list of Best Picture 2007 Oscar nominees was \\"The Departed.\\"<br /><br />The film is destined to become a classic due to many aspects.  Not only will it, I predict, win the Best Picture award this year.  It will also become known as the one which finally won Martin Scorsese a long overdue Academy Award for Directing.<br /><br />Among the other reasons the classic label shall be thrust upon this great piece of filmmaking is an intense, but twist-filled tale of cat and mouse, good and evil, gangster and cop, and pure americana.  The last bit is a tad ironic since it's a remake of a Japanese thriller from a few years ago.<br /><br />With a cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson and others, the actors alone make this a film to behold.<br /><br />The plot involves Leo DiCaprio as a kid whose uncle made a few mistakes in his life and wound up killed by Frank Costello (Nicholson.) Later in life he joins the police force, and is offered a position by Sheen and Wahlberg  to help take down Costello and his Irish mob crew. While on the other hand, Matt Damon grew up admiring Costello and moving up the ranks within the Massachusets State Police through hard work and cunning. He's always thinking one step ahead of his superiors.<br /><br />The two lives of DiCaprio and Damon intertwine through minor 'almost' meetings and just misses.  Each of them has set out to detrmine who the rat is for the other side.  Each of them have the task of protecting their own lives and careers while helping those undeserving.  Yet, with all the similarities within each character, they're complete opposites.  Both of them make a living and income from a life of crime. One attempts to shut it down while commiting it elsewhere.  The other tries to commit crimes while wearing the facade he's trying to shut it down elsewhere.<br /><br />The movie is overall fun if nothing else.  For the movie buff who enjoyed Casino, Mean Streets, Goodfellas or any other underground urban gangster film, this is their type of adventure.  Even for some waiting and hoping again for the classic Nicholson craziness audiences love.  His boisterious mannerisms, cocky attitude and smartass evilness is all here in glowing technicolor.  The movie is violent to say the least, and gory especially near the end.  However, it's done reasonably and with merit because it's meant to get the point across of how violent and disgusting a life of crime can get.<br /><br />Clocking in at a little over 2 and a half hours, it's amazing just how little the movies paced dragged on.  Every frame is filled with either excitement, great drama, fantastic acting, or shocking gasp-worthy scenes.<br /><br />Even the music, Scorseses masterful use of classic rock songs from the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd (redone by someone else, unsure of who.) The music doesn't downplay the violence, instead it enhances it.<br /><br />I must say for anyone who doesn't care for Leo DiCaprio (I'm one of them,) this movie will change your mind a bit.  One should with all warrant, feel your heartstrings pull for this character in a tough spot no matter which path in life he chooses.  If anyone doesn't care for Matt Damon as an actor (my wife for example,) this movie isn't going to change your mind soon.  His character is one of pure arrogance and selfishness, one may feel like taking a crowbar to him within the first 15 minutes of his screentime.<br /><br />From the streets of deep, dark Boston, the story of brotherhood on both sides of the law is intriguing and disturbing and and joy to behold.<br /><br />Watch...and enjoy!!ll fun if nothing else.

His character is one of pure arrogance and selfishness, one may feel like taking a crowbar to him within the first 15 minutes of his screentime.   <br /> <br />From the streets of deep, dark Boston, the story of brotherhood on both sides of the law is intriguing and disturbing and and joy to behold. <br /> <br />Watch...and enjoy!! <br />  <br />

6305428557|4.0|This is not Hugh Grant's best, but for anyone who has been to Wales, or know any Welsh personally, it is a great enjoyment. The Welsh are proud of who they are, their heritage, beautiful country and ingenuity. There is not much they would more prefer than autonomy from England, so they love to \\"get over\\" on the English. With that in mind ... ENJOY!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|No, this isn't up to the level of \\"Goodfellas\\"; and no, this definitely isn't up to the level of \\"Raging Bull\\" or \\"Taxi Driver\\".  Scorsese deserved an Oscar long before this so I can't say anything that hasn't already been said about that sore subject; however, if he did need one, I wouldn't mind if the Academy believes the hype around \\"The Departed\\" and gave it to him as a reparation of sorts.<br /><br />I know the plot was adapted from a film called \\"Infernal Affairs\\" and I really don't care: no one complains when foreign directors take American films as their inspiration with roughly the same plot, so I'm not complaining about Scorsese doing it in the opposite direction.<br /><br />\\"The Departed\\" is a gripping, brutal, and unflinching meditation on the sometimes tenuous difference between good and evil.  Scorsese's juxtaposition of Roman Catholicism with the sordid realities of crime and perversion is not a new one, but is given a different sort of treatment here.  Comparing it to his other films is to do it a disservice: it is a welcome revisiting of what made this director great in a new way.  This is more an Eastern type approach, with more things taking place off camera that eventually play a crucial role in the gut-wrenching finale.  It may seem ridiculous to call this film subtle, but there is an element of that many people have missed.<br /><br />The performances vary, but if an Oscar should go to anyone it should be to Jack Nicholson.  He makes Dicaprio and Damon nearly disappear, and I don't care if he was stealing scenes; I enjoyed every one of them.  He plays Irish mobster Frank Costello, loosely based on Whitey Bulger, and his performance within this genre transcends much of even of the best work done before.  He is debauched, sadistic, thoroughly evil and corrupt even within the framework of his own twisted ethics--and he doesn't care. He is hilarious and frightening, repugnant and magnetic all at the same time.  He is Nero watching Rome burn and playing his violin.  If he had been in eating up every shot I might think this deserves Best Picture of 2006.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the other two key figures in this Grand Guignol are simply not fleshed out enough to be believable.  We see only the seduction of Colin (Matt Damon) into a life of compromised loyalty at an early age, and we know virtually nothing about Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) except that his family was tangled up with the Southie mob and that he doesn't like his Uncle too much.  And then the action begins: Billy goes undercover as a member of Costello's crew and Colin becomes a Detective who does his best to give a heads up to Costello every time a move is made against him--particularly about the new undercover in his crew.  I have to confess I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio has improved much as an actor: people keep giving him new costumes to try on and the same thirteen year old who just got his skateboard stolen and is fuming mad emerges every time.  Damon is like he usually is only with an on again off again Boston accent.  With these two Scorsese made a bet and I'm not sure he came out on the winning end.  A good example is how badly the \\"father figure Queenan tragedy\\" with DiCaprio came out: a complete lack of connection.<br /><br />At no point do we really understand why either character is willing to go to such extremes and that seriously weakens the power of the film, in my opinion.  Both are from the same area and are in some respects not that different: capable of violence on the spot, an ability to endure the most uncanny situations without cracking, and along the way both have picked up the unique skill of pathological lying.  They seem phantasmagoric are supposed to be the connective tissue for the whole plot.<br /><br />Also, I get the distinct feeling (having been Irish Catholic my whole life) that Scorsese should stick to his Italian heritage and get rid of this pet fascination with the Irish.  This is an area I believe he has read more about than experienced, and sometimes the Drunk Violent Irishman Cartoon comes out once too often in this movie (Alec Baldwin's character is a case in point).<br /><br />All of this aside, it is absolutely worth watching and worth owning: there's a Shakespearean quality to this dirty earthquake you won't find in one single movie out there right now.  Any Nicholson fan has to see this: its like his ultimate Ode to all the Bada** characters he's played so brilliantly over the years. It is a testament to Scorsese's genius that despite some fatal flaws he's made yet another film that isn't likely to leave my mind or the mind of most people who see this for years to come.<br /><br />And just give him an Oscar already.  He's earned more than one.the Drunk Violent Irishman Cartoon comes out once too often in this movie (Alec Baldwin's character is a case in point).

B000BTJCRM|5.0|Now Wolfmother has one of the oddest names, and after a year and a half, I'm still not entirely not used to it. But when you hear them, you can't help but love them. Songs like 'Woman' have even landed in the hit video game \\"Guitar Heroes II\\" because of how... how... mind blowing they can be. rockin' riffs and catchy tunes, the songs are fun to sing along to and move with. I haven't heard anything like them come out of a studio in almost 30 years. 'Mind's Eye', my favorite song of theirs, and a top five for me, uses keyboard with rock as well as Led Zeppelin. 'White Unicorn' also uses keyboards, but comes out almost like The Doors when they jam in the middle of the song. The voice is nothing like Jim Morrison, however. Original and individual, this band rocks.  <br /> <br />The album itself is a masterpiece, and most of the songs are release as singles because of it. Now their are two versions of the album. I like the Australian version most, which is what I reviewed above. No, they are not the same. The songs are somewhat different (much more than just a little), and the style of the Australian version is more refined and rocking, while the American version is rougher and freer. They are still experimenting with their sound, as is evident between the two albums. Either way, A rock collection isn't complete without this album! If you like classic rock, this with a young twist will make anyone happier.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When the lights came up on 1990's Rocky V, like most filmgoers, I thought that I'd seen the last of Rocky Balboa, the indomitable everyman who, through the course of five movies, took the heavyweight boxing title not once, but twice (and also singlehandedly won the Cold War). Certainly if you'd told me then that we'd get the chance to revisit this character nearly two decades on, I would've called you crazy. <br /> <br />And yet, like his cinematic alter-ego of thirty years, writer-director-star Sylvester Stallone apparently still had \\"some stuff left in the basement,\\" and here we are sixteen years later, with Sly once more lacing up those padded gloves and stepping into the squared circle for one final (\\"We really mean it this time!\\") bout. <br /> <br />I guess that's why, for me, there was a bittersweetness to watching Rocky Balboa. The whole experience had the feeling of seeing a friend you never thought you'd meet again, knowing you have to say goodbye before too long. If that sounds a trifle maudlin, so be it. Nevertheless, with this character, the big-hearted fighter from South Philly, Stallone assured his own place in the annals of filmdom by creating one of the most indelible, enduring, iconic roles in movie history. So it's hard not to feel attached to the big lug. <br /> <br />In Rocky Balboa, the two-time former champ is at his lowest ebb personally. His beloved wife Adrian has passed away (from \\"the woman's cancer\\"), his son is a largely-infrequent presence in his life, and he mostly spends time at his semi-successful Italian restaurant regaling customers with tales of his former glory. This is a Rocky at the twilight of his career, largely pushed to the wayside by things shinier and newer. This is a Rocky who has become, in essence, the guest star of his own story. And yet...he still has something to offer (cue Bill Conti's \\"Gonna Fly Now\\"). <br /> <br />The \\"Rocky\\" story is a timeless myth for the ages (yes, even the fourth one). More than that, the entire Rocky cinematic cycle, from 1976's original through the four sequels and now with Rocky Balboa, represents a singular achievement in movie lore: tracking the life and times of a single fictional character, essentially in real time, over the course of three decades. We've seen the highs, we've seen the lows, and now we're seeing him off. <br /> <br />Rocky Balboa is a fitting (and welcome) coda for a character with whom we all were able to go the distance.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|I've been a fan of Pain of Salvation now for about 5 years, since the release of Remedy Lane.  Their music is not \\"easy\\", it is complex and challenging.  Certainly not for everyone.  If you like formulaic, highly structured or feel good music, look elsewhere.  Also, if you are easily offended by music with brutally honest lyrics, you will most likely not enjoy some of their music.  If, on the other hand, you want to hear Progressive music that moves effortlessly from metal grinds to soaring harmonies to time signature and melody changes that can twist your brain and tapping foot into a knot then PoS is for you.  <br /> <br />Scarsick is, IMHO, their best album yet.  Like most of their albums, it is a concept piece (ergo the Perfect Element title).  It is the second part of a trilogy called The Perfect Element having to do with humans and humanity.  I don't pretend to understand all the subtleties, but the music works.  For those of you who may have heard the band before, this album is most like their 2000 album The Perfect Element I with the added maturity they have demonstrated on the more recent BE and 12:5 albums.   <br /> <br />
B000MNP2KI|5.0|When last we left him in 2002's Die Another Day, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan), armed with an invisible Aston Martin, a gun-toting Halle Berry at his side, had just defeated a face-changing Korean colonel and his giant space laser. <br /> <br />If that description elicits more of a groan than a gasp, you're not alone. After forty-plus years of cinematic spectacle, it's easy to understand why Agent 007's recent adventures haven't done very much to leave expectant audiences shaken or stirred. <br /> <br />It wasn't always like this, of course. There was a time when a James Bond movie represented the pinnacle of filmmaking -- both unceasingly innovative and wildly subversive at the same time. With their unparalleled technical prowess coupled with heaping helpings of violence, action, and innuendo, the early Bond films forged the path that nearly all commercial blockbusters follow to this very day. <br /> <br />But then, that was a long time ago. <br /> <br />By the time I watched my first Bond, 1979's Moonraker, the series was firmly ensconced in the (quite-successful, mind you) Roger Moore-era, and had long since traded in narrative trailblazing for a kind of baseline consistency and an insistent clinging to formulaic repetitiveness. And yet, there was something oddly reassuring about it. It was just one of those things. Every couple of years, you'd go to the theater, that strobe light/gun barrel opening would come up, and you'd watch 007 save the world yet again. It didn't have to be a good movie; it just had to be a Bond movie. <br /> <br />Well, it's taken awhile -- several decades, in fact -- but with the release of Casino Royale, the 22nd film in the invincible series, we can finally, definitively say that the two are no longer mutually exclusive. James Bond is back, and as it turns out, he's been gone a lot longer than anyone even realized. <br /> <br />As soon as the lights go down, before the opening credits even start, we know right away that something is different. What is it? That famous opening shot. The gun barrel motif that has signaled the beginning of every official Bond movie from 1962's Dr. No until now -- it's not there. And just like that, all our preconceptions of what to expect are kicked to the curb. <br /> <br />When you think about it, the Bond producers have done something that's really unprecedented for a series as successful as this has been (each of the four Brosnan entries made more money than the last) -- they've dared to buck tradition and go in a new direction, winding the clock back for a Batman Begins-style reboot, giving us a ground-up look at James Bond's first mission. <br /> <br />Taking its title and basic plotline from Ian Fleming's 1952 debut 007 novel, the film revolves around a high-stakes poker game that the wet-behind-the-ears Bond (Daniel Craig) is recruited to participate in against terrorist broker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). <br /> <br />It's a straightforward affair, with none of the standbys we've come to know and expect from these things -- no banter with Q, no fancy gadgets (nary an invisible car to be seen), no innuendo-laced banter with Miss Moneypenny, and an honest-to-gosh love story with new Bond girl Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) dropped down right smack in the middle. <br /> <br />This is the Bond formula stripped bare, and every frame bespeaks the joy of rediscovery, with the gleeful abandon that comes with freedom from the stultifying sameness that has crippled this franchise for the past twenty-some years. <br /> <br />As embodied by Daniel Craig, far-and-away the best actor to don the trademark tux since it was doffed by Sean Connery in 1971; the character is more meat-and-potatoes than caviar and escargot, and for the first time in seemingly ever we get a sense of the raw brutality and casual cruelty that drives him. <br /> <br />Paradoxically, Craig also makes him far more real than he's ever been by also showing us a vulnerable side to this heretofore unshakable assassin. This is no easy task, as both Timothy Dalton and Brosnan before him tried and failed to lend some much needed gravitas to the usual 007 derring-do. <br /> <br />At just under two-and-half hours in length, Casino Royale is longer, even, than the George Lazenby-starring On Her Majesty's Secret Service (one of the best in the series), and yet, from a breathless opening footchase in Madagascar to a cat-and-mouse game in Miami to a showdown in the canals of Venice, it remains utterly involving for its entirety. <br /> <br />Much of the credit for this can go to star Craig, who electrifies from his first scene, as well as director Martin Campbell. Campbell, who also helmed Pierce Brosnan's 1995 007 debut, GoldenEye, also seems to have benefited greatly from the franchise's reinvention, employing a style here very clearly beholden to such recent spy outings as the Jason Bourne movies (as evidenced by a visceral bathroom brawl before the opening credits, depicting Bond's first kill). <br /> <br />Ultimately, it's a bit of a wait before we finally hear Craig utter that most famous of lines -- \\"Bond. James Bond.\\" -- the whole movie, in fact. But by the time he gets there, and by the time we first hear Monty Norman's \\"James Bond Theme,\\" we realize that the usual promise at the closing credits that \\"James Bond Will Return,\\" has finally transcended the constraints of the familiar and become something it hasn't been in quite awhile: something worth getting excited about. Good show, 007. A

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I remember very distinctly the revelatory feeling I had back in the Fall of '99 as I tuned in to this much-ballyhooed series from some guy named Aaron Sorkin, who had previously worked on a show I'd never watched (Sports Night) and a couple of movies I'd never seen (The American President, A Few Good Men). It took mere minutes for me to realize that this Sorkin guy was the real deal. <br /> <br />In rapid-fire succession we were introduced to Sam Seaborne (Rob Lowe), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), CJ Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), and Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), the senior staff of a fictional presidential administration, along with the equally-rapid-fire walk-and-talk style that became the series' hallmark under director/executive producer Thomas Schlamme. <br /> <br />By the time that first episode ended, with its closing minutes serving as our first introduction to President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen), intoning \\"I am the Lord thy God...\\" with his trademark twinkle, I was hooked. Somehow Sorkin, assisted ably by his journeyman cast of famous and familiar faces, had managed to make me care about a show I had no business caring about. Those first few seasons were about as perfect a collective of television episodes as has ever been produced. Ever. And they have the raft of Emmys (24) to prove it. <br /> <br />It's truly a testament to the bravura power of creator Sorkin that he was able to create characters of such lasting vividity that three years after his exit that initial fondness diminished not one iota, not even through cast departures bitter (Lowe's salary-dispute led to his exit in year four) and sudden (Spencer's death by heart attack). <br /> <br />Looking back at real-life events of the past six years, from 9/11 to Afghanistan to Iraq, from rendition to torture to domestic spying, it was always reassuring to cast a wistful eye towards The West Wing, and imagine a White House where intelligence prevailed over belligerence, and what was right was more important than what was expedient. It made us believe that public service was something honorable. Maybe it was misguided idealism, but idealism is something I think we place too low a premium on. The West Wing made us believe in idealism as a trait that's worth having. <br /> <br />And so, as he heads off to the Valhalla of syndicated immortality, let us stop to bid a hearty hail and farewell to Jed Bartlet, the greatest president we never had. <br /> <br />The faux-leather attache case contains the entire series on forty-five discs, plus the complete pilot script written by the man himself. Whether you followed the show for the duration of its run or haven't yet had the pleasure, there's never been a better way to own one of the greatest shows in TV history than in this gorgeous box.

I found it most beneficial to know why the dog was doing something rather than just knowing a way to correct it and nothing else. I haven't found an all inclusive book to training a dog since there are an infinite number of behaviors but this one covers quite a few and is useful from puppy, adult rescue and even the \\"old dog\\". Would without a doubt recommend to anyone that needs help.

I finished this movie in half the time. It was just corny, predictable, and all in all pretty lame. 2.5 stars, mostly for the action scenes. The characters, while not wholly one-dimensional, are too easily read. There is no complexity, which makes it a subpar drama. It's also a lame action movie because of the ill-disguised attempts to put artificial depth into the characters. I find most of the dialog agonizing to sit through.<br /><br />But at least I finished the movie.

0743298020|5.0|Vida Winter is an enigmatic, bestselling author who has told the story of her life innumerable times over the years but never truthfully--until, her health failing, she determines to confide all in a certain Margaret Lea. Margaret has spent her life absorbing the contents of her father's bookstore, and Setterfield lingers over the details of Margaret's life in books, pausing to explain even the economics of her father's business. Setterfield tells us also of the tragedy that has been the singular fact of Margaret's life, that her twin sister died shortly after their birth. Margaret's life is quiet and reclusive, but she has contributed to the world of letters herself in a small way, having written a handful of biographical pamphlets, studies of ordinary lives. It is one of these which attracts Ms. Winter's interest.<br /><br />Margaret's story in the present frames the tale that Winter tells her over months, the initial, quiet chapters yielding to something nightmarish and ugly. Winter's story is filled with sadism and incest, haunted lives in a decaying mansion--Angelfield Hall--the truth about its inhabitants hidden from the world. Winter's story, too, has to do with twins, Adeline and Emmaline, inseperable from one another and neither of them quite right in the head. There is a mystery in Winter's story, or a series of them, and I'd be shocked if any reader should guess what really happened at Angelfield the night that changed Vida Winter's life.<br /><br />I was not initially excited by The Thirteenth Tale, though I was impressed at the languorous pace with which its author dwells on the details of Margaret's life. In its early chapters the book seems almost a 19th-century product in that Setterfield is not afraid to take her time with it. And in fact the story has a timelessness to it: there are cars and telephones in Margaret's present but apparently no computers; it is difficult to be very specific about its temporal setting. The story Vida Winter tells Margaret, meanwhile, is initially offputting because of its violence. But Setterfield has woven an intricate story which, if slow to start, becomes downright gripping by mid-book. One finds in it also the occasional, beautifully-wrought passage:<br /><br />\\"With a bit more imagination they might have been able to leap the bounds of their own expectations; they might have recognized their feelings for what they were: love of the deepest and most respectful kind.

So they became friends, the way old married couples often do, and enjoyed the tender loyalty that awaits the lucky on the other side of passion, without ever living the passion itself.\\"<br /><br />My one reservation with Setterfield's book has to do with Margaret's obsession with her dead twin sister, the intensity of which I thought highly implausible.

0790733226|3.0|\\"Contact\\" is the filmed version of Carl Sagan's novel of the same name, and was completed after his early death.  I can imagine Carl having as mixed feelings about this movie as I do, but overall, I think he would've been generally pleased.  However, there are so many things, so many details, and extrapolations in this filmed version which were dealt with so much more satisfying and explanatory in the novel, that I wonder.<br /><br />Generally, \\"wonder\\" and a sense of \\"awe\\" at the scope and size and meaning of the universe, and whether or not we are \\"all alone\\" (as far as technological, advanced, intelligent OTHER civilizations in the cosmos are concerned), or not, is at the heart of this movie.  And considering Hollywood's reluctance to tackle such weighty cosmic matters, overall, this film has to be considered a moderate success.<br /><br />Unfortunately, crucial elements from the novel are simply ignored here or are given lip service at best, and the result is a film which is compelling and eye-candy in some parts, but in the end especially, lacks any solid ground and is overlong and in too many sections, insufficiently explained for the layman/average viewer.  Also, while the beginning of the film is one of the coolest major motion picture beginnings of all time, the payoff and end leave something to be desired.<br /><br />Technically, the film is almost perfect, with great pace, acting, and a mostly intelligent screenplay.  The opening sequence, in which we travel from our own little noisy corner of the universe, zooming out towards our real, rather insignificant and silent place in the greater scheme of things, is amazing.  It's just too bad that the whole film couldn't have kept up that quality.  And the end, in various ways, seems to contradict and/or diminish the same.<br /><br />Having read the novel long ago, I remembered an ending even more cosmic and mind-blowing than that which is exhibited here.  Perhaps, in retrospect, the ending of Sagan's novel, in which the whole question of \\"religion\\" and \\"God\\" and the \\"cosmos\\" is given as compelling an ending as the film's beginning, couldn't really have been \\"filmed.\\"  Perhaps during the production, it was decided that the end of Sagan's novel, really couldn't be visualized with film, so while the movie as a whole is generally satisfying, the end is very disappointing.<br /><br />\\"Religion\\" and humankind's views of such and how they may or may not explain our being and place in the cosmos, play a significant part here, but a more undefined \\"belief in a God\\" is confused with \\"terrestrial\\" religious tenets and symbols here.  And the whole government/taxpayer supported SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) \\"scientific\\" project and \\"mission\\" is eventually revealed to be nothing much more than just another \\"religious\\" idea, explored with science and technology and MONEY, instead of meaningless ancient voodoo and superstition.<br /><br />This leads to a confusion between \\"faith\\" and \\"evidence\\" which the movie never really addresses.  In a crucial scene, the question is asked, \\"You loved your father?  Prove it.\\"  I'm sure Sagan could've and did (in the book) explain this, but in the film, this is left unanswered unnnecessarily.  As are so many questions and answers, up until the end.<br /><br />Many parts of the film and premise, are just too simple-minded and too much a set-up for easy answers later on, when it all could have been so much more.  And yet, a lot of this I'm sure, will fly light years above most people's heads.  Still, as one who has studied both UFO/ET/Abduction evidence along with that of the continuing mission of SETI, I'd have to call it a draw so far.<br /><br />In the end, the film comes nowhere near the truly mind-expanding conclusions and questions of the novel, but again, perhaps, this was just too much to be put in a Hollywood movie, and may even have been impossible to visualize with mere cinema.  The main problem here is that a very patronizing ending is tacked on where something more in keeping with the general spirit of the novel's original ending, would've been so much better.<br /><br />We are told, in the end, that the traveler's journey and contact with real ET, can somehow be proved beyond faith, with science and human measurement instruments, but besides the temporal moments the traveler spent light years away, the only proof of such, could lay in a 1000 different explanations, including the first one that came to mind.  The traveler could've dreamed it all up, in a split second.  While observers (and human science) recorded it as something more.<br /><br />This is an overall entertaining and intelligent movie, with some great special effects and wonderful music, but its basic premise, that of SETI itself, is flawed in my view, and is never fully and satisfyingly addressed within.  In the beginning, the young girl is told by her father, when asked if there was anyone else out there, \\"if not, it would be an awful waste of space.\\"  Sadly, the end of the movie, refinforces this general idea, but it is as much a \\"religious\\" idea as is anything the movie preaches against.<br /><br />Space and our universe is big, really, really big.

The traveler could've dreamed it all up, in a split second.  While observers (and human science) recorded it as something more. <br /> <br />This is an overall entertaining and intelligent movie, with some great special effects and wonderful music, but its basic premise, that of SETI itself, is flawed in my view, and is never fully and satisfyingly addressed within.  In the beginning, the young girl is told by her father, when asked if there was anyone else out there, \\"if not, it would be an awful waste of space.\\"  Sadly, the end of the movie, refinforces this general idea, but it is as much a \\"religious\\" idea as is anything the movie preaches against. <br /> <br />Space and our universe is big, really, really big.

B000B7QAHO|4.0|I must admit I have not seen this movie in its entirety, rather just managed to catch most of it at different points a couple of times on HBO.  My son loves it and is freaked out by it at the same time, referring to it only as \\"The Squirrel Movie\\" (he's 3). But I will say that Johnny Depp by far is one of the most fascinating and engaging actors of our time -- I loved him in 'Edward Scissorhands' and the 'Pirates' series, but he is equally wonderful and sexy and heartbreaking in roles such as 'Chocolat' and 'Finding Neverland'.  For this alone it is worth sitting and enjoying 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', because there is not another actor working today that can embrace and make believable the quirkiness, weirdness, and vulnerability that Depp does with Willy Wonka.  I read the Roald Dahl book as a child and do not remember the backstory of how Wonka came to be such a weird little chocolate-loving man, but I think that this subplot certainly gives the movie and the other characters (Charlie and his family) some depth and certainly an explanation for why the Buckets seem to (in the end) invite Willie to be part of their family.  The movie has obviously more than its fair share of Computer-Generated Imagery, hence the squirrel scene and why my son is obsessed with the movie, but it still manages to be believable most of the time, particularly if you forget about the backdrops and concentrate on the relationships between all of the young characters, their parents, and of course what along the way in Wonka's factory ultimately becomes their demise.  For as happy and sugary-sweet as the Gene Wilder version was, this version is certainly dark and weird but just as lovable if you give it a chance.  The Oompa-Loompa(s), played by one little man and a lot of CGI, are the only parts I just didn't like -- just because he is (and thus they are) all weird-looking and fodder for bad dreams if you are a little kid.
1594200823|5.0|This book may change the way that you think, not merely about food, but also about the American food industry.  In describing the production, preparation and consumption of four very different meals, Pollard also charts the history and explains the economics of modern food production.  Basically, as depicted by Pollan, the American food industry is built on corn, agricultural subsidies, and the economies of scale of mass production, the latter of which \\"fuel\\" not merely waste and, through the use of fossil fuels in mass-agriculture, global warming, but also the production and use of food additives. The results are poor nutrition, sick and suffering animals, a damaged environment and a less-than-healthy America.   <br /> <br />Pollan's description of the conditions under which cattle, hogs and chickens are raised in mass-breedings pens may transform the most cynical meat-eater into, not a vegetarian, but rather an advocate of small-scale farming and grass-fed animals.  His consideration of the arguments for and against vegetarianism are thoughtful and well-reasoned.  After reading this book -- which I have recommended to friends, including those who might be more interested in the historical, economic and philosophical issues addressed therein than the arguments for better nutrition -- I used Pollan's bibliography to identify several sources of \\"local produce\\" and \\"grass-fed\\" animal products close to my home.   <br /> <br />Anyone who eats should read this book.
B00005JPAM|5.0|Helen Mirren won the Academy Award for her portrayal of HRH Elizabeth II with a performance that knocked me out.  Her small nuances and gestures and even her walk easily evoke Her Majesty - the one in my public mind.  As the film progresses we're privy to behind locked door scenes that are only the speculation of Director Stephen Frears and Alan Morgan - but they fit in perfectly with what we think we know about the house of Mountbatten-Windsor.  In the emotional final act, Dame Mirren's performance becomes even more remarkable as she gives us a brief glimpse into the humanity of the woman never seen by the public eye.<br /><br />Michael Sheen gives an equally impressive supporting performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair, who as the film opens has just been elected from the Labor Party in a landslide after eighteen years of Conservatives. (Blair's predecessors John Major and Margaret Thatcher aren't mentioned.) The Queen and her advisors are in preparation for Mr. Blair's promise to shake things up when tragedy strikes.<br /><br />For those too young to remember the effect that the unexpected death of Lady Diana had on the world - \\"Princess Di\\" married Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and future King of England, while she was a teenager and Charles was in his thirties.  The Prince has a reputation for being very properly British - stiff upper lip and all that - and somewhat detached from the \\"real world\\" while Diana hung out with rock stars and made conspicuous public appearances that made her maybe the world's most famous celebrity.  They were married fifteen years, had two sons, and divorced a year before her death in Paris - her car speeding in a narrow tunnel, trying to flee paparazzi.  For the twelve-year old reader: if Anna Nicole had intelligence, charm, character, and had devoted years of her life to world-wide charitable causes like the fight against AIDS and land-mines, after being married to the future King of England, well... you get the idea.<br /><br />Anyway - back to the film.  Diana and Charles have been divorced for a year, and when she is killed she is no longer \\"Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Wales\\".  In addition, the media attention around Diana and her split from Charles has not been flattering to the Royals.  When Elizabeth is told that Diana's family, the Spencers, want to have a private funeral, the Queen is satisfied with that.  She doesn't want a big \\"to-do\\" and, after all, it's what her family wanted.  A recurrent theme in the film is how badly the Queen and her advisors initially underestimate the national and world-wide outpouring of grief over Diana's tragic death.<br /><br />The royal family is on holiday at the massive estate at Balmoral.  While the Queen is away the flag doesn't fly over Buckingham Palace.  But mourners are lining up outside the Palace and leaving flowers and keep-sakes outside the royal gates and Prime Minister Blair correctly senses that the British people think that the Queen and her family should return to London and fly the flag at half-mast.<br /><br />Elizabeth worked for the British Military transportation during World War II and when her father died and she became Queen in 1952, her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill.  Her Majesty is \\"old school\\", and she knows protocol.  Her subjects are demanding a degree of Royal respect and honor which she knows that she would not receive if she were to die herself.  She wants to shield her grandsons from the brouhaha in London - it's bad enough that they've lost their mother, isn't it?<br /><br />James Cromwell gives a great performance as the Queen's husband, Prince Phillip, and Sylvia Syms gets many of the best lines as the Queen Mother. Alex Jennings looks a little bit like Prince Charles - from behind - and he gives a good performance that shows that Charles had strong feelings for Diana a year after their divorce.<br /><br />The best scenes take place between the Prime Minister and Her Majesty - some of themphone conversations.  A subtle, but plainly growing, degree of respect develops between the two of them as they both realize that the other is behaving in a way that is perfectly understandable.  Mr. Blair realizes that the Queen is a product of her upbringing and experience and that she has always behaved in the best interests of her country, while Elizabeth realizes that Mr. Blair is being both respectful of the crown while having his finger on the pulse of her subjects.<br /><br />Doesn't everyone wonder what the real Queen (and others behind the gates of Buckingham Palace) think of this film?  I think they wouldn't be disappointed.  The Mrs. and I give two thumbs up.degree of respect develops between the two of them as they both realize that the other is behaving in a way that is perfectly understandable.

B000001GQQ|5.0|The few complainers about this famous recording have slipped far down the list here at Amazon, and what's striking is that the things the detractors hate about Argerich (mannered phrasing, overly aggressive attack, rushing, banging) are the very things we don't get here.  Argerich can adopt a reckless, hectoring style, but at her best--as here--she's full of imagination, wit, and an uncanny ability to see beneath the surface of the score.<br /><br />I can only second everyone else's high praise for the Prokofiev and Ravel concertos, which are spellbinding, as well as the praise for her Gaspard de la Nuit, which is staggeringly virtuosic and original. Abbado conducts with gusto and style, if not the greatest nuance, and only the somewhat dated sonics detract (marginally) from an acclaimed recording that has remained in print for forty years.

B000J103N4|5.0|Very few albums start out flawless and continue to build on that brilliance until the last note sounds. \\"If I Could Only...\\" is so stunning and enveloping in it's vision and direction it sounds like it could been recorded over the course of one long, lazy night with the tape machines just left running. \\"Cowboy Movie\\" is both frightening and engrossing with Crosby's vocal gradually surging with agitation, fear and defiance while the Grateful Dead and co. chug along behind him riding an insistent riff off into the sunset. \\"Laughing\\" featuring some of Jerry Garcia's finest steel guitar is so great it makes me weep every time I hear it. This is the album as art, not a collection of singles or half-finished ideas, but a cohesive, full bodied work that stunningly shows the power of the first and finest instrument; the voice. PERFECT.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|For Christmas I received not one, but two copies of the new Beatles album, \\"Love\\" which I had desperately been wanting ever since learning of it. For anyone who doesn't know, Cirque Du Soleil wanted to do a Beatles themed show so George Martin and his son Giles took the original Beatles master tapes, put them in a metaphorical blender and came up with some amazing musical casseroles, some pieced together like Frankenstein's monster, with amazing results. Some songs have the vocals from one song set to the music from a completely different song with various textures from even more songs thrown in, while some other songs are changed very little from the originals but almost everything has at least some small subtle bits from other songs creeping in.<br /><br />I definitely think the die hard Beatles fans (like myself) will reap the deepest rewards from this collection but even more casual Beatles fans can't miss the more extreme remixes and sound collages which, in my opinion, are by far the best and most amazing. This album continues to elicit goose bumps from me even several after listenings. I'm just about as big a Beatles fan as there is but I have yet to be able to trace each bit of each song back to its origin. The end of \\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" mixed with \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" sounds to me like a pristine aural representation of Hell, and I mean that in a wonderful, pure genius way. Listening to this album is like being caught in some strange wormhole where the entire Beatles catalog exists as one living, breathing entity; time and space ripple and fold back on themselves as sounds and images fade and meld into each other and through you.<br /><br />I've evangelized for years about the genius of George Martin and how I think his role as producer had as much effect on the end result of Beatle records as the 4 Beatles themselves had in writing and playing them and I think this album puts his talents on display more than ever. Just listen to \\"Anthology\\" and you can hear a demo of a good song end up as a true masterpiece due in no small part to Martin's input.<br /><br />The album is also available in two formats, standard CD, and this double CD+DVD version which includes the whole album (with some slightly longer versions of some songs) in 5.1 surround sound which I definitely think is the only real choice. This is an absolute must hear. Absolutely one of the most creative and amazing things I've heard in a long time.o \\"Anthology\\" and you can hear a demo of a good song end up as a true masterpiece due in no small part to Martin's input. <br /> <br />The album is also available in two formats, standard CD, and this double CD+DVD version which includes the whole album (with some slightly longer versions of some songs) in 5.1 surround sound which I definitely think is the only real choice.

0385493622|5.0|Fermat's Enigma was one of the world's great unsolved mysteries - Pierre de Fermat postulated several theorems, whose proofs he left undocumented.  Was he speculating, or did he really do it?  One at a time, mathemeticians knocked off his theorem.  Except for one - Fermet's last theorum. <br /> <br />Simon Singh takes us to Princeton, where Andrew Wiles locks himself away for years to solve the problem.  The book does talk in math, but Singh explains it as he goes, and anyone that recalls high school algebra should be able to follow 90% of it.  And the other 10% doesn't detract from the story.  Wiles follows old mathematics, synthesizes new mathematics, and even takes a few wrong turns.  In the end, the story is as much about gripping obsession as it is about pure math, and is a good read for a general audience.
B00005JMX6|5.0|The secret to the good impression that most viewers have of \\"The Girl Next Door\\" lies in the characters.<br /><br />We get a very clear picture of who each of the main characters really is, and the actors never let us down.  Whether you identify with Matthew, as he gets a surprise view through the bedroom window of the gorgeous new girl next door, or if you like Danielle's attraction to a nice boy who needs to loosen up, you'll enjoy the people in this story.<br /><br />This movie works for the same reason that Romeo and Juliet works--you know eactly what each character is feeling.  If you've ever been in love, or even just in lust, you can identify with what they're going through, and you can't wait to see how the story is going to turn out.<br /><br />If you've been in love, you'll love these characters--you'll remember your own experience with the guy or girl next door.
1590171993|2.0|If you think a book must be depressing, hopeless, and about unhealthy people who don't really want to change, than this is the choice for you.  It is well-written, but pointless, falling into the genre of fiction about pathetic losers failing to find any glimmer of happiness or meaning or joy or redemption.   <br />I am not suggesting that fiction must be happy, but this book is just too much about  failure and mean-spirited revenge.  There are no good guys.  The main character watches as his little girl's life is destroyed by his wife, and doesn't stop it!  Or even try to stop it. Angry and Hopeless: and do we need another book about such people? <br />Sure, there are such people: by why wallow in their misery? <br /> <br />

B00014X8KO|4.0|The movie is really three different short works. The first is \\"Magnetic Rose\\" where the crew of a space garbage collection ship answers a distress call. The two men who go into the wreckage to find the beacon get separated and confused by holographic programs, automated systems, and an AI of the original owner of the ship -- who believes she is alive. In \\"Stink Bomb\\" a young man gets a flu shot and goes to work where he takes a dose of an experimental drug rather the cold medicine he thought he was taking. The mix of drugs in his system has an strange and catastrophic effect on those around him. Then there is \\"Cannon Fodder\\" where we spend a day with a family who live in a city fighting a war. A war that they've fought so long that no one remembers who they are fighting anymore or even why. <br /> <br />All of these are beautifully rendered and each has their own unique look and mood from the dark, dreamy, chaotic feel of \\"Magnetic Rose\\", to the buccolic \\"Stink Bomb\\", and the urbanized, regementation of \\"Cannon Fodder\\". Each of the three pieces in some way hinge on memory -- to one degree or another -- but that link it sort of up to the viewer to make as they process the film after viewing.  <br /> <br />Like most anime, you're dropped into the story and must make your own leaps of logic to pull it together and add the meaning to what is going on. They don't spoon feed you the 'message' of the film, it's for you to determine what it is.

1582701709|5.0|My husband and I watched the DVD and truly enjoyed it but a person has to watch something like that with an open mind. I believe we attract things into our lives without realizing it good and and bad. It is all about attitude and how we choose to see things. I can look back through my life and see how the law of attraction has affected my choices and did not realize it at the time. Watching this DVD gave alot of \\"Aha\\" moments. We are definately what we think. Human beings as whole like to play the blame game instead of taking responsibiliy for their actions and this DVD takes all that way.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|For what is supposed to be a horror movie, I did not find it scary at all.  Instead I found it annoying and boring.  The two actors are either wrong for the roles or just did not know what they were doing.  What were they thinking when they made this ugly movie?
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Wow, what an album. The first 4 tracks absolutely smoke. Lovely mixture of symphony, opera, heavy metal and synth pop.<br /><br />Complex arrangements, soaring vocals, head-banging rythems and majesty weave in and out on this masterpiece. Aside from the first 4 tracks, \\"The Siren\\" is an amazing tune as is \\"Romaticide\\" and the 2 bonus tracks.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|\\"The Italian Job\\" is a fast paced crime thriller is actioned packed with a excellent ensemble, a terrific musical score and some awesome cinematography especially when filmed in Venice and the Italian Alps.  It suffers however from mostly pedestrian acting performances and often uneven plot.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, the mastermind of a elaborate heist in Venice of $35 million of gold bullion.  His team is bolstered by his mentor and father figure John Bridger, a career thief played by Donald Sutherland.  The brilliantly conceived plan goes off without a hitch however team member Steve played by Edward Norton decides to double cross Wahlberg. He kills Sutherland absconding with the gold and is convinced that he's also terminated the remainder of Wahlberg's crew.<br /><br />The film then turns into a tale of retribution as Wahlberg who does little more than flex and smile recruits Charlize Theron, Sutherland's daughter Stella who is a high tech security expert and safecracker, to join his crew.  Even the talented Norton fails to deliver a notworthy acting performance and computer geek Lyle played by Seth Green steals the show with his performance.<br /><br />The action including an excellent car chase scene featuring a trio of Mini Coopers roaring through gridlocked Los Angeles streets is unrelenting.  The plot suffers from a lack of imagination when the scheme to recover the loot from the villainous Norton utilizes the same mechanism used in the original theft.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|If you love Phantom from the stage show, you will be very disappointed with the quality of the singing in this movie.  If they were going to lip sync anyway, why didn't they hire spectacular singers?  The only shining star is Raoul.  The rest are weak at best, except the voice over for Carlotta (Minnie Driver plays the character).  I love the stage show and the music CD but this is a big disappointment.  The costumes and special effects are well done but when the show is all about the music and that part is lacking, the costumes and special effects don't really matter.
B00005JPKC|4.0|Clint Eastwood's epic \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", an emotional documentary style tribute to the Japanese defenders of Iwo Jima should be viewed as a snapshot into a horrific, dehumanizing episode of history rather than for purely entertainment value.<br /><br />Eastwood portrays the battle through the eyes of commanding General Kuribayashi played by Ken Watanabe and a pair of conscripts humble former baker Saigo played by Kazunari Ninomura and disgraced military academy cadet Shimizu played by Ryo Kase.  Using bleached almost colorized black and white cinematography which enhanced the representation of the bleak terrain,  Eastwood mixes dialogue with excerpts from letters unearthed from Japanese soldiers years later to tell the tale.<br /><br />Watanabe arrives on the island ordered to defend it as a strategic and essential buffer to homeland security, at all costs.  The organized and compassionate general quickly alters the slipshod preparation already made for the upcoming invasion gaining the respect of his men.  Digging a series of honeycombed caves in the volcanic rock, the soldiers hole up and await their fate.  Watanabe soon however learns of a series of devastating military defeats which dooms the ability to reinforce Iwo Jima.  He conveys the suicide nature of their defense to the defenders and what plays out is a touching depiction of how the men deal with their tragic situation.<br /><br />Amid a dizzying display of brutal combat and intense psychological turmoil, we gain empathy for the Japanese ordered to fight to the death.  With the revelation through their letters that their thoughts and feelings are identical to their American enemies, Eastwood gives us a previously unconsidered respect for the condemned Japanese troops.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I am not a Scorsesse afficionado, and I have not seen many of his movies. Is this his best movie in years and years?. I have no clue. Is it one of his best movies?. Couldn't tell you. What can I tell you?. Well, I can tell you that this is a fine, fine film done with such artistry and talent from Marty, as everyone calls him. I am not always an easy sell on crime/mobster type films, but you can't help but be intrigued by the magnitude of talent going into this, and the big acclaim that came upon it's release. The Departed may not be the best film ever made, but it's a great film, and the best film of the year. Surprising, twisty, and unrelentingly violent, It holds you rapt from start to finish. Jack Nicholson is mobster Frank Costello, who plants a mole in the Boston police force. This is up and comer Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon). The ppolice themselves have a mole to plant in Costello's group, Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio). The result is a tense and taut cat and mouse thriller as the two moles try to discover the other's identity. DiCaprio really starts to become an adult movie star here. This is the first time where he seems to not just be a kid. He is grown up, dark, and wonderful in the role. Damon keeps his cool throughout, but he is less showy and impressive. Jack. Where to start?. There is a bit of \\"Jack\\" here, but that's okay. He is always electrifying with whatever he does, and he takes hold of every scene he's in and doesn't let it, or you the viewer, go. He means business. Wahlberg is great in the role. At first, he is extremely unlikeable, but you like him as time goes on. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone all give stellar supporting performances. It runs on a bit long, and I wasn't totally satisfied with how certain things came to and end, but they are minor quibbles. The film is set in Boston, but I heard it was actually filmed in and around New York. Interesting. People talk about sloppy work here, but I can't find it. The film is done with delicate care and talent. It felt raw. It felt real. It was exciting, and it seems that no one is safe. It keeps you on your toes. The ongoing character development with Leo's character makes him the most interesting out of the bunch. The relationship between Jack and his mole and his new buddy(Leo), makes for some interesting storytelling and twists and turns. The characters are deep and fully fleshed out, the story keeps you interested, and the music used in the film and the score are perfect. All in all, it's a great film. While people continue to voice their thoughts on how this ranks in Scorsesse's roster of films, and how this was(or was not)his best film since whatever, all I can say is that this is a Scorsesse picture. And it's a damn good one.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Iron Maiden has mastered the art of providing both a musical and visual kick in the face.  There is no band in my opinion that has been able to capture their essence in the dvd format better than Iron Maiden.  The sound on this dvd is incredible.  The three guitars mesh incredibly well in the studio and live.  They play with such precision it's remarkable.  The camera work is great but I do wish they didn't cut from camera to camera as frequently as they do.  That of course, is certainly not limited to this dvd as I find it to be the case with most concert dvds.  As with any band with an extensive catalog, there are some songs I would substitute but this isn't a chinese food place.  This concert is from that tour and thus, we get that set list.  This dvd is a must have for all metal fans.  Those wishing to check out what Iron Maiden is all about or those who have been upping the irons for decades will be thoroughly pleased.  I can't recommend this enough.
B000002KGT|1.0|In 1977 I was eight and far too young to appreciate this slice of ubitquitous AOR southern Californian pop-rock. Now, at 38, I should be old enough. Yet this still leaves me cold. It's only a matter of taste, and clearly millions disagree with me, but this music doesn't make me FEEL anything except tedium. There is one exception: Go Your Own Way is undeniably a decent song. And that great bass riff on The Chain DOES still sound great and brings back happy memories of watching Grand Prixs on tv when I was a kid (it was the theme music in the UK). <br /> <br />Otherwise though, to me, this is a bunch of coked-out, self-satisfied musicians coasting on automatic, who fully understand that safe, bland songs like these have the potential to bring in pots of cash. There's nothing remotely ambitious about these songs: they're custom-made for undemanding ears who want some light background entertainment while driving to work or washing the dishes. There's nothing wrong with that in itself - there's a demand for undemanding music and we all want a bit of background diversion from time to time. And that's about all that can be said for it, really.  <br /> <br />Fleetwood Mac got the last laugh. They could have churned out these songs in their sleep, yet they made them multi-millionaires. Good for them. Being successful has rarely had much to  do with creating interesting music.  <br />

0743454537|3.0|This book started so strongly. After 20 pages I was already recommending it to someone else. I bought into it - I liked the characters and the plot was real and scary to think about. What would you do in this situation? One daughter diagnosed with an agressive form of cancer, so would you create one child to fix another child? It happens. Is it morally right? What about the ethics? This is some of what is explored. <br /> <br />I want to know why no one in this family was going through therapy. I can't imagine the decisions and the stress. I feel like I need to talk to someone. In this respect, the author has succeeded by making readers ask questions and look for answers. <br /> <br />I wish we'd been able to meet Kate, the sister that was sick. Most everyone else gets a voice. However, we see her through everyone else's eyes.  <br /> <br />And then, I'm with so many others here, the ending just knocks the wind out of you, and many of the questions you wanted answered are not. Of course there can't be any happily ever, but does there have to be a what the heck just happened when you've been on the ride for so long? I do know I can't recommend it as much as I did when I started the book. Ah, if only... <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007R4TAS|4.0|This is a fine story with great characters & solid acting.  The scenery is terrific.  But, the quality of the DVD is poor, as it seems to have been made from a poor quality film, with some skips in the dialogue, and a verticle line running through the DVD in certain spots.  However, the inexpensive price somewhat offsets the poor quality of the DVD.
6304498969|5.0|This 1992 MTV Unplugged video is something everybody should watch at least once in a lifetime. Now that the standard for good music is set really low, a Clapton Unplugged DVD is something that can calm down stressed ears. (I mean, what is hiphop, rap, punk, emocore, and other bad stuff doing on top of the charts?)<br /><br />The band is doing really good in this video; Clapton's acoustic guitar bluesstyle playing is incredible; Chuck Leavell's keyboards are subtle but quite meaningfull (I place his piano solos here among my favorite one's); Nathan East is always perfect; Ray Cooper and Ferrone on Perc/Drums do it fine and precisely and Andy F. Low is the 2nd guitar player on Clapton's bands I enjoy the most (like him better than Doyle Bramhall II, but not as much as Derek Trucks in the current EC Tour).<br /><br />Acoustic versions by Eric Clapton: can anything be better than this for a quiet, rainy day with the one you love?
B000FGGE68|2.0|Nighly stylized movie that uses Sky Captain CPG with an Equilibrium theme.<br /><br />In the future, a blood disease creats a world of normals and hemophobes. I'm good with that part, and Mila Jovinovitch rocks as the comic book hero `Ultraviolet'. What doesn't rock is her ability to create weapons out of thin air. There is no explaination how, and the dumbass drones after her don't have the same ability. Personally, I wonder how a lowly rebel could have more at her disposal than a government funded ARMY of top notch killers!<br /><br />The whole film is shot in CG touches a la Sky Captain and The World Of Tommorrow. This supposed to be about her being a rebel and rescuing a human child with a protein in his blood that can cure the world's `vampire' problem. In reality, it is simply an outlandish style of cinematography.<br /><br />Normally, I would have given this a 1 star. Poor piece of film. Period. BUT, after the Resident Evil series, I felt MJ did a very nice job here. Thus the 2 stars.<br /><br />Do not buy, but wsit until it is on cable, which I did. Even then, I got it on Starz, and used DVR time.
B000002U82|5.0|To me, DSOTM is the best album ever produced. It is the outcome of truly musicianship of the 4 members of Pink Floyd. It was done in 73 and is a landmark in the history of music forever. I can listen to it a million times and I won't get tired of it - that's what good music is all about, it is timeless! - the songs are well structured, the transitions between songs are great, the playing is just what it is supposed to be (no frills, just plain progressive rock/blues style plus the ingenious addition of Wright's synths), and one last thing that must be why it is still an up-to-date really successful album: the songs are pictures of the real 1970's society, pictures that resemble (maybe even duplicate) the reality of nowadays'.
B000GUJF4G|5.0|This movie blew me away , I saw it at the theatre when it first came out and it just blew me away , I had to see it again and immediatly bought the soundtrack and couldnt wait for the DVD that I saw it for the 3rd and last time , Im sorry but this \\" Posiden \\" may be the same name , but this in no way is a RE-make , the only thing familar is the idea of a giant rogue wave hitting the ship and turning it over , the special effects on this is mind blowing and horrific !<br /><br />There is no stopping to take a breath , this is a heart pounding movie , and very upsetting to see what the survivors have to go through and of course some dont make it , the way they were killed is very upsetting and heart wrenching .<br /><br />I urge you to rent this , hell buy it and watch it over and over again and watch how they made it and you will be more surprised to learn that the things you see infront of you are not exactly what you thought ! lol<br /><br />Have fun , make lots of popcorn and go to the bathroom before you view this , you dont want to miss anything ! lol<br /><br />And remember this is not RE-MAKE !
1582701709|5.0|I originally watched the DVD last year and was pleased to see the concept of the law of attraction presented in an easy to understand format. The book expands on the DVD with the author adding her own insights. This is the kind of book you need to read repeatedly. The information is so important and life changing, it takes time to absorb and implement it's message.<br /><br />It is not always easy to keep your thoughts focused on what you do want instead of what you don't want, but the results of doing so can and will change your life. By envisioning the future you desire and feeling the good feelings that come with that, you start creating the life you have always wanted.<br /><br />This book is for everyone but can be especially helpful to people who are going through a difficult time such as divorce,depression,loss, ect.After<br /><br />discovering \\"The Secret\\" you spirits will be lifted and you will feel more in control of your destiny.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|I can not disagree more with the RS Review. I feel that a different reviewer should give this CD/DVD combo a second look. This is for the Blues enthusiast and not the show-boating KWS we have seen in the past. Kenny lets the Blues greats enjoy \\"their moment\\". As it should be. The RS reviewer could not possibly have and heart felt appreciation for the history of the blues or have watched the DVD. Remember when SRV was told BB King was opening for \\"him\\". He told his management this is to NEVER happen again! KWS wanted to make this CD/DVD to capture some of the blues greats that were getting on in age to preserve some of there talent and stories for all time. In fact three of the people that were featured on these recordings past away even before it's release. This is probably one of the top 5 CD's I have ever purchased and I own thousands. Granted it is probably not for people looking for a new pop album or a top charting hit. The live lessons learned on the DVD alone are worth the price for admission. As Cootie Stark sings \\"I searched and I searched and I searched and I searched but I ain't never found no U-Haul behind no Hearse\\" RS just got this one wrong. This is a must buy for any Blues enthusiast period.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is one of Mariah's best albums, no matter what other people may say. It's either Daydream, Music Box, or Butterfly in my opinion. Here's the list of the songs <br />Fantasy - Great, but I love the Bad Boy Mix of it better  <br />Underneath The Stars - Love this song. It's like a stepper's cut/slow jam. Perfect song for those summer nights.  <br />One Sweet Day - You gotta love the colaboration with Boyz 2 Men. It's a sad song, but I love it <br />Open Arms - The Journey cover. Love Mariah's version - it's more of an R&B ballad <br />Always Be My Baby - Love it, and always had.  <br />I Am Free - It's okay. Not the best song on the album <br />When I Saw You - Great song! Another ballad with great lyrics <br />Long Ago - The hip-hop jam. It's a nice song <br />Melt Away - Love this song. Another great ballad - it's one of those rainy day songs <br />Forever - More like a doo-wop song. Great!! <br />Daydream Interlude (Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix) - Love it, even though it's a shorter version of the Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix. The full mix is 8 minutes long and way better than the edited version.  <br />Looking In - Love the song. Anyone can relate to it - the final ballad from the CD.  <br />Overall, if you love Mariah's ballads, you'll love this CD <br /> <br />
B000N6U0E2|5.0|In this time of unoriginal/thoughtless movies coming out at about every few weeks or so in the theaters, we finally come across one that shines above all the others. The way the story is told is very realistic; Charles Gardner deals with the same problems that so many of us have gone through. I have enjoyed seeing Will Smith's previous films, but this one made the biggest impression on me. Perhaps it is because of the fact that the boy in the film (Christopher) is actually his own son (Jaden), so their acting together is all the more effective. Whatever the reason, however, Smith's performance here is stronger than that seen in I, Robot, Independence Day, Hitch, or Men in Black, and greatly deserves a notable award for his effort. I especially liked the scene where Chris must take shelter in the men's room with his son at the subway station. It is moving, to say the least. At the end of the movie, we are told that the real Chris Gardner is now a respected millionaire. Perhaps it's a result of the enduring love for his child that motivated him to become who he is today? This movie will teach you what it means to be a good father. Highly recommended for those of you who want a drama that is very well crafted as well as seemingly flawless.
B000NA1XSA|4.0|I am not as immersed as other reviewers in Beatle book reading but I was intrigued by this book because it offered a behind the scenes, first-person perspective of someone deeply involved with most of the group's music making (save the White Album and Let It Be), but not quite so publicly associated with it as George Martin. It proved to be very readable, perhaps because it is co-written (the author finished his schooling at age 15), although I am skeptical of the authors' use of quotations to recount passing conversations that took place 40 years earlier, which I believe are not likely to have been remembered verbatim, but more probably reimagined by the authors.  It paints a very vivid picture of the scenes that are being reported, of the era and of the personalities of the individual Beatles as Emerick saw them.   <br /> <br />There are a couple of early chapters on the author's childhood. I initially feared that the book was going to linger there too long, but he meets the Beatles at age 15 so you get to the main subject quickly enough and his growing up in England in the 50's no doubt parallels the Beatles' own experiences to some extent.   <br /> <br />I thought the amount of time spent on each album was just perfect and the story moved along very well. Particular highlights for me were his discussions of recording She Loves You, All You Need is Love, A Day in the Life and Because, four songs for which his love for the band's work really gushes out (interestingly, they are Lennon's songs, while the book has a very strong, almost sycophantic bias in favor of McCartney, who seems to be the only Beatle who was friendly to the author). He also chronicles well the tension of recording the White Album, although he quits working with them in the middle because of it. <br /> <br />I found it a little tedious that Harrison and Starr are recurrently criticized for lack of skill as musicians and Lennon is criticized for lack of professionalism (impatience, lack of interest in technical matters, drug abuse and Yoko-centrism), whereas McCartney seemingly never does any wrong in the musicmaking process.  I'm not in a position to dispute his evaluations and really don't disagree overall but at some point the repetition of them became too much. There's also a lot of focus on his own contributions to shaping the group's sound with engineering solutions, which seem to outstrip George Martin's contributions, but maybe that's just the unintended consequence of this being the author's memoir and not an objective report. <br /> <br />All in all, it was a very pleasant read.
B00008BRB5|5.0|After the density of \\"Ghost In The Machine\\" and the brilliant pop glow of \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,\\" The Police did as abrupt a course change as anyone could have expected. Sting had become the band's major-domo (or an egotistical maniac, depending on your point of view) and demanded that Stewart and Andy strip their music down to the barest of bones, and then see if the parts gelled by happenstance. Thus came \\"Synchronicity.\\"<br /><br />This is the album that pretty much defined The Police for many, and it really is a crowning achievement. Sounding only like The Police yet totally unlike their prior four albums, it remains an uncategorized success. Sting's lyricism became more fatalistic and poetic, trying to say as much in three words as most men dare to in novels. Songs like \\"Walking In Your Footsteps\\" or \\"King Of Pain\\" explore emotional territory in a sensitive and literate way.<br /><br />But nothing here came close to \\"Every Breath You Take.\\" Probably Sting's pinnacle as a songwriter, this tale of obsessive love to a classic pop melody became a rightfully deserved popular smash and drove the album to number one. Even the videos for \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and \\"King of Pain\\" reflected the shift in tenor. Instead of the near seizure inducing freneticism of the typical music video circa 1983, \\"EBYT\\" utilized long, slow shots with carefully motioned camera sweeps. (Thanks to the still eye-popping work of Kevin Godley and Lol Cr&egrave;me.)<br /><br />The band did not forget how to rock. \\"Synchronicity II,\\" with its howling bursts of Summer's guitar, actually cracked the Top 20. Stewart's \\"Miss Gredanko\\" was an \\"Avengers\\" themed political commentary. In fact, the only bad thing about \\"Synchronicity\\" is Andy Summers' virtually unlistenable \\"Mother.\\" Other than \\"Mother,\\" The Police used sophisticated production and arrangements to craft 1983's best album.<br /><br />It was also The Police's swan song. The individual members never reached these heights again. As an additional note, the original vinyl album ended with the melancholy \\"Tea In The Sahara,\\" and \\"Murder By Numbers\\" was a b-side. It was attached to the original CD issue in an effort to lure in fans of 'bonus tracks,' but it has always been my contention that it was off the album for a reason. The re-mastering also shows up the song's shortcomings - it is nowhere near as smooth as the rest of the CD. Thank heavens for CD burners; you can recreate \\"Synchronicity\\" without \\"Murder By Numbers\\" and \\"Mother.\\" It makes for a much better experience. (But this is still a classic. You like 80s music? You must have this.)al vinyl album ended with the melancholy \\"Tea In The Sahara,\\" and \\"Murder By Numbers\\" was a b-side.

B000IFQLSW|4.0|The DVD alone is worth the price. Even though KWS can be a little annoying in the music clips at times, the older guys are worth every penny. Not that KWS is bad, the older guys just show he still has a little way to go. But Kenny is a gratious host and takes us on a great ride into blues history.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I'm only 14 and i guess i wouldn't have as much insight as the customers who saw this way back when in 1944, but i liked this movie. I'ts happy and it has great tunes vocally performed by Miss Garland and i thought it was all quite charmingg. The best scene hands down was with Judy and Margaret O'Brien in the living room at the party singing \\"The Bamboo Tree\\". I feen for this movie and i can see why Vincnte Minnelli is known for his artistic flair because the set designs and backgrounds are so detailed no wonder he was such a successful director. Who doesn't like a burst of colorr! All in all i luv dis movie, its soo cute, and when i watch it i feel like i'm a bystander watching on the set. Kudos to of course Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli, Margaret O'Brien, and whoever wrote the soundtrack (its great)The Boy Next Door is the songggg!!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I have \\"Fallen\\" and I was fairly impressed with it as an album.  That said, \\"The Open Door\\" outdoes it.  It's a vastly different sound, heavier and darker, but I'm very fond of it. <br /> <br />You can really lose yourself in \\"The Open Door\\" if you're not careful.  It's one of those CDs that doesn't really have bad songs on it, only songs that show different degrees of mastery.  The one exception is \\"Lithium\\", which needs some lyrical help.  All-in-all, though, it's a stellar follow-up. <br /> <br />My one other wish for Evanescence' music, is a studio record of some of the live tracks from \\"Anywhere But Home\\" (like \\"Missing\\", \\"Breathe No More\\" and \\"Thoughtless\\"), which are quite solid songs in their own right and deserving of a place on a studio record.
0435131001|4.0|Let me give you an example of how seriously this author can mess with your mind:  I was watching a CNN news clip concerning a New York City Taco Bell restaurant that was infested with rats, and I actually leaned forward to see if I could spot the tap-dancing rat (his name is Sardines).<br /><br />Pratchett rules!<br /><br />\\"The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents\\" is about a leader (Hamnpork, not to be mistaken for Moses) who dies before he enters the Promised Land (an island without humans).  The holy book of his people (\\"Mr. Bunnsy Has an Adventure\\") is torn apart and thrown into a sewer.  His followers are in disarray.  Who can a rat turn to for help?<br /><br />Well, there's Darktan  (picture John Wayne playing a tough-but-tender-hearted-rat-sergeant), who treats his recruits in the trap-disabling squad with a sort of gruff-tough love.<br /><br />There's also Maurice, the shifty, jiving cat who could be played by Will Smith (with the addition of two chewed-up ears and a case of the mange).  Maurice used to hang around the dump behind the Unseen University, where the wizards discarded their trash.  He was just a regular alley cat until he ate a rat that had been nibbling candle-ends in the wizard's dump.  Now he and the rats can talk and think.  Whereas the rats used to eat books, now they read them.  Maurice acquires a stupid-looking street musician and together with the rats, they roam from village to village on Discworld, pulling the old Pied Piper scam.  The rats invade the targeted village, widdling in the flour, gnawing on the sausages, and (yes) tap-dancing across kitchen floors with a straw hat and cane.  The kid with the flute shows up, pipes the rats out of town, and is given a bag of money by the grateful villagers.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Maurice, his educated rats are acquiring ethics along with intelligence.  They decide to hit one more village before retiring to the Promised Island---the village of Bad Blintz in the mountains of Uberwald.<br /><br />And as all serious Discworld fans know, there are stranger creatures in Uberwald than tap-dancing rats.<br /><br />I see that this book has been turned into a play, and other subterfuges for educating children, but it's still pretty good Pratchett although a bit preachier than usual.  The characters are as weird and wonderful as anything on Discworld and you DON'T want to miss the scene where the stupid-looking kid and his tale-spinning friend confront the real rat catchers.

1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder's \\"Save The Cat\\" is more than just a how-to book. It's key strength may well be it's ability to guide the screenwriter to properly conceive of their idea. So their mind-fruit is not a mutant offspring destined to languish on a shelf unloved, but rather, a happy, healthy, bouncing baby screenplay that the studio executives will be clamoring to cuddle up to and call their own.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Since the first production of J.M. Barrie's play, PETER PAN, in 1904, the story of the boy who never grew up has become a part of popular Western culture.  It's a story that children love and that adults often adore.  It even coined a sociological phrase (Peter Pan syndrome).  The play has been performed on stages throughout the world and to this day it remains one of the most popular shows performed in children's theatre companies.  It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Peter Pan was one of Walt Disney's favorite stories of all time.  He starred in a school production of the play as a child and the 1924 silent movie of the story sparked the imagination of the young filmmaker.<br /><br />Walt Disney had intended to make PETER PAN his second major animation production after SNOW WHITE.  However, it took many years to get the look right and to adapt the story (Disney, after all, was a master of taking a story and changing it and creating it to his own liking).  Of course, there was also WWII which stopped the production of the film for almost six years.<br /><br />When the film was finally released in 1953, the film was almost an immediate success.  Disney markets the film as a \\"classic\\" and even though the film produced some memorable characters that have become collective images of our culture, such as Tinkerbell, Smee, and Captain Hook, and is noted for a couple of historical reasons (it was the first film to have Peter be played by a boy and it was the last film RKO distributed for Disney) the film isn't all that spectacular.  In fact, after the film's release Walt Disney himself was disappointed by final product.  Yet, Disney's version of PETER PAN is loved by children and looked upon fondly by adults, just like the story of Peter Pan always has.  In that since, the movie is a classic.<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company has released PETER PAN several times on DVD, but if you're a fan of the film, the Platinum version is the one worth owning.  The Platinum Edition of PETER PAN comes in a two-disc set.  The film itself is found on the first disc.  There is a commentary that included comments from some of the films illustrators and performer, but the commentary is more of a vocal documentary about the making of the film rather than a commentary about the movie itself. The first disc also includes a preview for the upcoming CGI film TINKERBELL (I'm not sure from the sneak peak if it will be a theatrical release or a direct to DVD), sing-along versions of the film's songs, and a read along story entitled \\"Peter's Playful Prank\\".<br /><br />The real special features of the extra features are found on disc two.  This disc includes a deleted song from the film entitled \\"The Pirate Song\\" that is accompanied by the actual rough sketches intended for the sequence.  There are two music videos.  One of the music videos has a group of pre-teeny boppers named T-Squad jumping up and down to a technoized hip hop version of the song \\"Second Star on the Right\\".  The other music video has Paige O'Hara singing along to the song \\"Neverland\\", a number written for PETER PAN, but that was never included but was recently discovered in the Disney archives.  This video is previewed by a short featurette describing how the song was discovered and why it was written.  There are three children's games on the disc, including a Sudoku challenge named after Smee.  Then there are several featurettes.  These are what I found to be the most interesting part of the second disc.  First there is \\"You Can Fly\\" that is a look at how PETER PAN was made.  Next up is a reading of one of Walt Disney's own writings that was originally published in 1953 in a now defunct magazine to herald the release of the film.  The piece is called \\"Why I Made PETER PAN\\" and is accompanied by pictures of young Walt and dramatic reenactments.  This piece explains Walt Disney's love for the story of Peter Pan, how he grew up on the story, his experience of playing Peter in a school production, etc.  Another featurette I really enjoyed was \\"The Peter Pan That Almost Was\\".  This segment includes two of the researchers/producers of the Platinum Edition going through original illustrations, sketches, and storyboards to illustrate how Walt's original idea of the film evolved through the years.  For instance, Nana was supposed to accompany the Darlings to Neverland, but this idea was axed just before final production began.  Another featurette is \\"The Peter Pan Story--1952\\" which is an archival promotional film strip.  Strips like these used to be shown in theatres before feature presentations, along with newsreels, short films, and cartoons.  I guess you could say they were the original cartoons and trailers, but these things are so much more interesting.  Besides, they weren't trying to sell anything else except for seeing the movie itself.  The last extras on disc two include numerous art galleries that show illustrations, sketches, storyboards, etc. from throughout the making of the film, including some things that haven't been seen before by the public.tte I really enjoyed was \\"The Peter Pan That Almost Was\\".

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I have many emotions about this movie, especially when I read the customer discussions at the bottom of the page. I feel sick hearing people say that we won't be long on this planet anyway so we it doesn't matter how we die off, and those that discredit science and talk about bad science (I'm a science educator). I found no bad science in this movie. Scientists are not going to collect ice core samples in the Antarctic and collaborate to change the data over the last 100 thousand years so that they can alarm others. A scientist's goal is to achieve truth, and understanding. I'm sure that every scientist out there would love to report that scientific evidence shows our environment is improving, and everything is peachy, no worries. People are saying that the Earth is so big that a little extra CO2 won't have any affect, but when you have 6 billion plus humans, competing for space and superiority at any cost, we end up with a big problem.  <br />People say this is a boring movie. I never saw it advertised as being entertaining. For me it is informative, intriguing, and really makes you think, and continue to think. I get the idea that many persons with low opinions of this movie have never seen it. They have an opinion and they are sticking to it. <br />No, Al Gore is not a scientist as many of you point out, but he never claims to be. He does however understand science, and is wonderful at disseminating information. Al Gore deserves our praises for his many years of work on this topic.  <br /> <br />
B000002GWN|4.0|By the time this album was released, Joni had reached legend status and her views on the music industry had become a bit jaded (and that is reflected a little in the music and commentary between songs). Nice compilation.

I put on the record the other day reminded by the fact that the recent movie \\"Children of Men\\" had \\"The court of Crimson King\\" in the movie, and I was also reminded of how much I had loved this record in my young college going days.  Monumental and timeless album. There are other albums that don't grab me much anymore that I loved back then, but this still has an enigmatic and otherworldly quality that makes it a work of art.
B000ICLHIE|1.0|I have tried again and again to appreciate Wait's songs as so many people have pushed him on me. This is the latest, and my last attempt.

If you like the gimmick run with it, if you're curious I would advise running in the opposite direction, with haste.
1400064287|5.0|With an entertaining blend of case studies and startling research, the Heath brothers lay out the critical elements of a sticky idea.  They are--<br /><br />1. Simplicity<br /><br />2. Unexpectedness<br /><br />3. Concreteness<br /><br />4. Credibility<br /><br />5. Emotions<br /><br />6. Stories<br /><br />As you might expect, the authors use these techniques to drive home their point.  For example, in the chapter on stories, they talk about Subway's Jared campaign--quite a dramatic behind-the-scenes story besides being a near perfect example of storytelling in marketing.<br /><br />Although these six elements seem like common sense, they are woefully underapplied in business communication.  The authors state it well--<br /><br />\\"Business managers seem to believe that, once they've clicked through a PowerPoint presentation showcasing their conclusions, they've successfully communicated their ideas.  What they've done is share data.\\"<br /><br />Well researched, easy to read and hard to forget.
B000002KDW|5.0|Ronnie Lane's poignant ode to his dad...\\"Debris\\"...is the killer track on this album. Stewart's BEST vocals are the background vocals he provides on this track. That's a pretty bold claim when you're talking about an album that includes \\"Miss Judy's Farm,\\" \\"Stay With Me,\\" \\"Too Bad,\\" \\"That's All You Need\\"...but it's a fact. The late, great Ronnie Lane provided a much-needed \\"McCartney sweetness\\" counterpoint to Stewart's rooster-haired strutting, and that combination (along with the unstoppable Ronnie Wood) made this band magic. They pulled off one more...the lesser \\"Ooh La La\\"...and Ronnie Lane headed south. Free's Tetsu Yamauchi gamely stepped in to fill the void, but with all due respect, he was \\"just a bass player.\\" After a sloppy live album, Faces faded away and Stewart became a cartoon of his former self. But on THIS album, you have an ample opportunity to understand what the hype was all about.

B0001V6ZJ8|4.0|Not to be confused with the Nicole Kidman version of [[ASIN:B000077VR3 MOULIN ROUGE!]] (2001), this 1952 fictional portrait dramatizes love in the life of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (José Ferrer). MOULIN ROUGE will stir emotions from pity to disgust. Hopefully without giving away too much, you may even notice a familiar plot borrowed from Bette Davis' early work [[ASIN:B00008K7AD OF HUMAN BONDAGE]] (1934).     A wealthy heir's life is dramatically altered by a childhood accident that leaves him crippled, estranged, cynical, and alcohol dependent. Through his adversity, a co-dependant relationship between the unseemly backstreet life of France and a prolific artist is nurtured. Ever on guard against emotional attachment and the bitter pain to which it routinely leads, articulate Lautrec fails to recognize genuine love.    Ferrer convincingly plays the dual role as diminutive Toulouse and his own stately father. It didn't seem dubbed so I was surprised to later read that a black burlesque showgirl in the movie, Aicha (Muriel Smith), provides the singing voice for brief, mostly annoying, appearances by Zsa Zsa Gabor. It is difficult to call a sad movie \\"good\\" but that is a fair depiction of MOULIN ROUGE. Prepare yourself for the ugly side of artistic genius.    Movie quote: \\"Only Leonardo could have painted that smile; she smiles with her eyes!\\" \\"I don't care if she smiles with her navel, that still doesn't say that Da Vinci painted it.\\"
0694003611|5.0|I can safely say that since my 22 month old son became obsessed with this book, we have read it atleast 4 times a night for the past 5 months. I know it by heart, and often recite it to him before a nap (we save the book for bedtime). Its hard to believe anyone hasnt heard this story. My son has the copy which I had when i was a baby. Definetly a story that stood the test of time, which is rare in the children's world.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|The original Beatles arrangements are true works of art. Who wants to hear a classic rock masterpiece chopped off and/or segue into some awkward musical \\"bridge\\" linking it to the next song? Yes, sell your circus soundtrack disc (and maybe your rubber soul) to a Vegas act if you must but for Christ's sake give Beatles lovers the high-rez standalone cuts of the original arrangements with a bit of tasteful 5.1 mixing.<br /><br />The tragedy of \\"Love\\" is that you can hear how freaking great the songs are capable of sounding...and almost every one of them lacks a proper beginning and end! It's like \\"touching up\\" a Rembrandt with sequins. George Martin and Son should be ashamed. Three stars for awesome sound.
0618680004|2.0|If you read a true piece of literature such as C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity, you will be treated to an intellectual journal where all sides of the debate have been thoroughly examined. You wont find that kind of intellectual honesty in this book. If you hate Christianity, Christian, and Jesus you can join the clapping seals who have fallen over themselves in lock step approval the new atheist messiah.<br /><br />Bottom line is that it amounts to an attack on Christianity in particular, as makes cases that wouldn't hold up in a kangaroo court if held under the light of fair and balanced scrutiny. Loaded questions such as him making light of a verse out of scripture where it is said that Jesus would be born of a woman, and holding it up as an example of how simple the Christian faith is. The only I found simple was the reasoning he tried to use in making straw man arguments against a single religion instead of a concept such as a deity... yes or no.<br /><br />Sorry, but I wasted my money and time on this one. I thought it would be challenging and stimulating, but in the end it was polite hatred pointed towards the Christian religion by in large. It belongs in the religious humor section of the book store.
B0009S2T0M|3.0|You can learn a few things from this ultra violent, darker than dark Drama / Mystery / Thriller with the occasional elements of humor: you will learn the new meaning of words Fresh Sea Food, you will never be able to listen to Vivaldi's \\"Four Seasons\\" the same way again, you will think twice before going to your Dentist's office. Be careful of what you say about anyone - you never know how your words can (and will) affect their (and what is most important your) life. And the last but not the least, revenge is the dish better served cold, 15 years cold. Without spoiling anything, no matter how far and how fast we try to get away from our destiny, each step would bring us closer to it until the inevitable and shocking \\"Appointment in Samarra\\".<br /><br />I have mixed feelings for the movie. It is very impressive, and trying to take the story in its second hour to Sophocles's realm was a clever twist but something stops me from pronouncing it great. The more I think the less I like it and the reasons are incoherent plotting, very ambiguous moral equation, and technical sloppiness that insult my intelligence.<br /><br />Threre are two things that impressed me the most - fascinating performance by an octopus (sadly, it was its one and only performance) and the story of a guy with a little dog that we never heard. I'd love to hear his story.<br /><br />5.5/10
B000K4WLXA|1.0|The visuals in this film are astounding.  Everything else is awful.  The plot is pretty much nonsense and full of holes, the script is terrible and cheesey all the way through.  The acting is just as bad.  There are a few tiny redeeming features but the badness of this film by far exceeds everything else.  The characters couldn't be any more self-involved unless they were in a soap opera. <br /> <br />Don't even try to show it to people who haven't played the game, they won't get any of the in-jokes and will only understand 1% of the film. <br /> <br />The biggest wasted opportunity of recent times.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The purists might not like it, they might even think that the enhanced audio on \\"I Am The Walrus\\" is sacrilegious or something, but for people who simply enjoy The Beatles' music and can't get enough of it, like me, this is a wonderful CD.  I was truly amazed by the ingenious combination and mixing of songs.  The album flows as one big 45-minute long song that is full surprises and musical mastery.  If you know their catalogue, it will be interesting to recognize the small bits and pieces of different songs as they are melded into one.  True, you don't really hear anything new in this CD, about a third of it is material already released in the Anthologies CD's, but it is wonderful nonetheless.
B000007VCO|5.0|Released in 1979, Onesess is Carlos Santana's first solo album.<br /><br />Although CS was not sure which musical style to follow; Fusion Jazz which he really loved, heavily inspired by John McLaughlin; His great basic Latin Rock sound; or the new Pop Rock trend. Onesess came up as a combination of all three styles reflecting the puzzled period; this artist was living in; yet a great album, perfectly picturing what a great musician and guitarist Carlos Santana was.<br /><br />This album fits perfectly among his best recordings, making it highly recommended to any old Santana fan, or to any Fusion Latin Rock music lover.<br /><br />Some Other highly recommended CD titles for this great artist:<br /><br />1.

0743289412|5.0|I have read alot of Stephen King's books and I thought this was the best one he has had out in several years.  The beginning was a little slow, but once you got past that, it was excellent.  I'd highly recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My son brought home the movie Serenity from the local Blockbuster a couple of weeks ago and I decided to join him in watching it. I had heard of the movie but had no idea what it was about. During the first half hour or so I wasn't really getting the story and then the DVD froze up and quit playing. Turned out that there was a big scratch that caused this so we took it back. The next day we started watching it again from the beginning and since I had seen the first part the day before I knew what was going on. This time I got totally immersed in the story and enjoyed the interaction between the crew of the Serenity. The movie was thoroughly enjoyable and combined elements of classic cowboy westerns with future outer space adventures. What a combination, but it works well here. I got hooked and immediately went to the computer to learn more about the series that started it all. The more I read about this short lived series the more I wanted to watch the whole season. I ordered the complete series and have been enjoying two episodes each week in order to savor them slowly. The story lines are always interesting, and I thoroughly enjoy the subtle humor, especially from the ships captain. This is a well written, thoughtful and well executed show. I don't understand how it was canceled during it's original tv run. My only complaint, of a technical nature, is that the series uses Dolby Pro-Logic sound instead of Dolby Digital, and that there is no HD-DVD version available, except for the movie Serenity, which I also purchased.
B000B8QF00|2.0|Well, I wish I could say that I absolutely loved this CD and listen to it all the time, but I can't. When I ordered this CD I was so excited, because I really do appreciate everything Alanis Morissette does. I'd heard a few of her songs on the radio once or twice and loved them.<br /><br />Ok well here is the problem I have with it: All of the lyrics in each of the songs seem to be so negative. I never noticed it before I bought the CD but once I owned the CD and listened to each song a few times in a row I realized that they are all about something negative. Or at least most of them are. I am the type of person who appreciates meaningful lyrics, but these are not meaningful to me. They are all a bit depressing, really. I love Alanis' voice and I think it is very uniquely beautiful, but I am just disappointed in what she is singing ABOUT. It's not the worst I've come across, but I really wouldn't recommend buying this CD unless you are into the depressing, angry lyrics.<br /><br />~Peace out~
B00005JPFQ|3.0|First of all, based on the original material - the graphic novel -, the film is actually executed very well. Fans of this genre won't be disappointed. Cage is cool as always and it was a delight to see Peter Fonda again, even though he's playing Satan. Also the modern-day ghost rider legend comes across well. As usual with Cage in the picture, there's a slight touch of Elvis in there. Technically, I don't think they could have done it any better, because the CGI effects are all in the right places and the ghost rider looks cool. Again, it's a fun comics hero flick with cheese nachos in one hand and a bucket of popcorn in the other ... and in a sense it's a thrill ride, but don't expect a super mega Hollywood movie blockbuster. Still, it's well worth watching it on a rainy/snowy Saturday afternoon.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Geez, whatever Madonna's on, keep on doing it.  This is a fantastic CD!  Hung Up is like Madonna's anthem now.  So beyond infectious!  The songs Sorry, Like It Or Not, and Get Together are great as well.  Can't wait to see what sound and look Madonna pulls out next!  5 stars!
B000MCH5TU|1.0|The dvd version if played on the xbox HD dvd does not work correctly fast forwarding and rewinding freezes it - and the subtitles flash on and off before you can read them at all - Ironic that the movie is about communication and they cant get the HDdvd to communicate correctly.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|DISCLAIMER: I will try my best not to spoil anything in this review, since it is far better to watch this movie knowing as little as possible.     I just finished 'experiencing' Old Boy (it somehow felt more like an experience as opposed to merely watching the film) and was quite happy to find it wasn't a \\"horror\\" movie, as it had been advertised. Rather, I would characterize it as a psychological thriller or revenge thriller.    The film was purposely frustrating for the first forty minutes or so - neither the audience nor the protagonist knew why he was imprisoned for fifteen years. However, once he is \\"freed,\\" the film really picks up,  the surprises are plentiful, and the ultimate realizations really push the envelope. While some may find it slightly \\"twisted\\" (American viewers like myself who aren't used to seeing some of the topics depcited in our Hollywood films), it is shocking in a good way - very thought-provoking and a great discussion piece.     While I recommend this film for those who aren't queasy, are interested in psychological thrillers and the concept of revenge, I do not recommend it for anyone under 15 years old (or thereabouts).
B0000TB050|5.0|I read the book U2 by U2 and I've seen the other vids, but reading the book and seeing this vid gave me such great insight into this concert. IThis concert has so much meaning, more than the others, cuz Bono's Dad passed shortly before and he and the band played with an emotion and looseness that you cannot find on other vids. Watch and see the playfullness. Adam had a great night and Edge went off! Bono's vocals were top notch also. <br />GREAT CONCERT! Sound quality is superb and the video quality and production is very nice. It gives a good feel of being very close to the performers.  <br />This is a must have DVD.

B000DZIGDU|2.0|I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead.  I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military.  For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested.  As someone else mentione.  I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't...

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The Illusionist is a quiet film directed by Neil Burger from a short story by Steven Millhauser.  It stars Edward Norton as Eisenheim the illusionist, Jessica Biel as Duchess Sophie, Paul Giametti as Inspector Uhl, and Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold.<br /><br />It movie starts with a flashback to the past in the late 19th century where Eisenheim as a young boy encounters a magician under a tree.  He becomes fascinated with magic and practices sleight of hand constantly.  This attracts Sophie, a girl his own age of noble birth to him.  Eisenheim is the son of a cabinetmaker, so Sophie is completely out of reach for him.  Still they plan to run off together, but are inevitably forced apart.  So Eisenheim leaves Vienna alone and travels the world.<br /><br />Fifteen years later in the early 20th century, Eisenheim returns as a celebrated magician who's first show so wows the Viennese crowd, that Crown Prince Leopold and his entourage comes to see his show the following night.  Among his group is Sophie who is soon to become engaged to the Crown Prince.  The rest of the story is Eisenheim's struggle with Leopold, and his Chief Inspector Uhl, to regain Sophie's love.<br /><br />This is a beautifully shot dark romance that really captures the spirit of early 20th century Vienna.  The creamy yellow brick buildings, the dark wood furniture, the horse drawn carriages, the wrought iron fences, the starch collars and bowlers for the men and the long gowns and flowery hats for the women, just every detail is paid attention to in this movie, and in the details are a feast for the eyes.  The camera work of the countryside is just as detailed and well done.  Although the movie is shot in color it has the feel of sepia toned black and white, at points blurring out completely at the edges.  This gives the viewer the feeling that he's looking back through time.  It's a really nicely done effect.  The soundtrack is brooding and mysterious and totally fits the mood.<br /><br />A central, although not completely explored theme of the film, is Eisenheim's spiritual challenge to the rational Victorian thought that dominated the age.  Certainly Inspector Uhl was the rational counterpoint to Eisenheim's spiritual tricks.  Eisenheim's illusions were stunning, an orange tree growing from a seed in a matter of minutes, a robed woman whose relection in a mirror was cut down with a sword, and standing Leopold's sword on it's point so that no one could move it.  Uhl and to a lesser extent Leopold were the Victorian rationalists that demanded an explanation.  It is interesting that magician and illusionists were as popular as they were in the age of Victorian Rationalism and the movie could have profitably explored that dichotomy a little better.  It was certainly used well to make a bone of contention among the main characters that really worked to fill them out well.<br /><br />The other thing I gained from this film, is that Vienna under the Hapsburg Emperors was really a police state, every bit as much as the Tsar's Russia or any monarchy of the day was.  Yes, perhaps England was not outwardly as much of a police state as the other two, but Austria certainly was.  Inspector Uhl was part of the Royal familiy's controlling yoke on the population and his motivations were well explored.<br /><br />Really an interesting film on a lot of levels, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention the acting.  I had a very difficult time imagining Edward Norton and Paul Giametti acting in a film set 100 years ago in Vienna, but they both do a spectacular job, especially Giametti.  Jessica Biehl is perfect in her role, as is Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold.  Just a very good job of acting all around.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give this movie five stars is that it moves a little slow, could have done a little better exploring the conflict between spirituality and rationalism that was central to the story, and had a somewhat disappointing ending.  It isstill, however, a beautifully shot and thought provoking film, and certainly worth watching.film, and certainly worth watching.

B00003CX96|5.0|Last Summer, the AFI was running one of their annual 100 best lists on TV.  The theme was crowd pleasers.  Trying to foreshadow what would be picked \\"Breaking Away\\" came to mind.  Surprisingly but not much so the film came in eighth.  Not having seen the movie since a network TV showing in the early eighties I was compelled to revisit the film.  It's as good as ever.  What accounts for the film's durability?  For starters, director Peter Yates and Oscar-winning screenwriter Steve Tesich fully flesh out the movies central premise of Middle-America townies and their uneasy relationship with the visiting University kids.  All of the \\"Cutter\\" kids(Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern, and Jackie Earle Haley) are complex and endearing characters and at the time most of the actors were virtual unknowns so you can accept them as lifelong friends.  Christopher's parents played by Barbara Barrie(Oscar-nominated) and Paul Dooley(criminally not nominated) are also recognizable as human beings and not caricatures.  Then of course there's the cycling sequences which are nothing less than thrilling.  If you haven't heard of \\"Breaking Away\\" I would behoove you to check it out.  On a note of trivia, In 1980 there was a shortlived TV spin-off of the movie with Shaun Cassidy playing the Christopher role and Dooley and Barrie reprising their parts.  The critical reception was pretty good but ABC gave it a killer time slot and the show was quickly cancelled.  Also, cult fave P.J. Soles(\\"Halloween\\", \\"Rock 'n' Roll High School\\") billed here as Pamela Jayne Soles has a blink and you'll miss her part as one of the college girls.

B000MCH5P4|2.0|This film is basically 4 interconnected stories that are suppose to make us walk out of the theatre and think about our social values concerning immigration, sex and gun control, i doubt many people will walk out thinking about anything other than the fact they are glad the movie ended and that they can go and do something more fun with their time.  This film will be quickly forgotten by the vast majority of the people who watch it and if it does win the oscar for best picture than i guess the fix is in with the academy that votes for these awards. the acting is fine but i cant see how 2 of the people in this film got nominated for best supporting actress unless this was a really weak year for that category. in summation - dont waste your time and money on this turkey.
B000MCH5TU|5.0|I can't understand the reviewers who didn't like this movie but suspect it has something to do with each one's polital views.  To me the movie showed how people get caught up in events not of their own choosing and the ramifications of these.  I thought about it for a long time; rented it for the first look and now will buy it. It is inevitably sad.
B00003CWL6|1.0|For you young'uns, Pauline Kael was a powerful, maverick movie critic who, aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer, often went against the grain of your Rex Reeds and Roger Eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human. And smart as hell. <br /> <br />This movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever, beautiful and enlightening.  I could not find one less-than-amazed review at Rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better. But friend, think about it just a little bit, how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds -  friggin' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less!   And the protagonist's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot, working at a fast food joint (with a cliched smiley face logo), driving a hot cherry-red Pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old (which is a crime in the US, ja? no?).   <br />Kevin Spacey's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful.  Annette Bening, given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned, in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale.   <br /> <br />Another Amazon reviewer cited Ray Lawrence's Austrailian film from 1987, BLISS as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for American Beauty.  Having seen BLISS several times, and being a huge fan of that movie, I think he is correct.  Written by Alan Ball, a TV sitcom writer, this film pushes a screwed-up message.  It entertains, that is if your brain is on stand-by.  I wish Pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision.
B000LE0THO|5.0|While Eldorado (1974), Face The Music (1975) and A New World Record (1975) are each great recordings in their own right, they are little more than demos compared to the grandiose Out Of The Blue (1978).  <br /> <br />Out Of The Blue is a tightly-focused collection that even includes a mini-suite (Concerto For A Rainy Day). Each song stands on it's own. There is no filler.  <br /> <br />One of the high points is the Beatles-esque petition to the sun, Mr. Blue Skies. But, as outstanding as Mr. Blue Sky is, it's followed by an even better song. When Jeff Lynne sings \\"everything is alright, alright\\" in Sweet Is The Night, it gets to me every time.  <br /> <br />The sound quality of the 30th Anniversary reissue is not much of an improvement (if at all) over the 1990 reissue. The extra tracks were left off the album for a reason. Latitude 88 North is not very good but, any additional ELO material is welcomed. The booklet consists of only seven small pages of text and doesn't go into depth about the making of the album. The miniature spaceship is not very faithful to the original. Also missing are the lyrics (which were printed on the LP sleeves). There are some small reproductions of posters, foreign album and single covers and pictures of the band as well. <br /> <br />Maybe someone should write a book about ELO devoting a chapter to Out of the Blue. <br /> <br />[DW]
0393317552|2.0|The obvious reason why Europeans and Asians developed such advanced societies while other did not is indeed because of geography. Unfortunately for Diamond, it's not because of guns, germs, and steel. It's because of cold winters. Cold winters mean limited food. Therefore, those members of the tribe who did not possess the intelligence and foresight to prepare for a period of no food---died. China, Japan, Korea, America, and Europe get cold. Australia, Africa, Central and South America do not. The less intelligent genes don't get thinned out, because there is an abundance of food year round. That's not racist or biased, just common sense.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|I loved this movie from beginning to end.  The acting was fantastic, the characters were all so unlikable, yet somehow endearing.  Even Dad became lovable at the end.  And Olive, so perfect and pure, was so Christ-like, so innocent and loving and accepting of each member of her crazy family.  If we could all be like her!  The fact that so many people don't get this movie is because they don't have any sense of the ironic, preferring that things be spoonfed to them.   <br /> <br />If you hated Royal Tennenbaums, then don't see this, and vice versa.  If you came from a dysfunctional family, but are not able to laugh at yourself or your situation, then don't see this.  If you can't laugh at the obsurdity of our own humanity and people taking themselves too seriously, then don't see this.  If you are amused at how funny and stupid people can really be, then this is the movie for you.  It is delightful, and sad, and infuriating, and hilarious, and ridiculous, and obsurd, and right-on-target.  It is a fantastic movie.
0060723513|3.0|Truly the most phenomenal thing about this book (to me) was its entry into the publishing world. At the time I was working in a book distribution warehouse that sold both small press titles and those from major publishers. This writer self-published her book (perhaps after being rejected by 'real' publishers, who had reputations to consider), and for months, it flew out of there by the cratefull, by the pallet-full, astonishing and baffling those who handled it and read it and watched better books dribble out of the warehouse one by one. Then, of course, it was bought by a large publisher and got even bigger. Same story with Celestine Prophecy, which was terribly written, published with typos and everything. The moral of the story? Readers, they love their fables, especially if they're prefaced by \\"this really happened!\\" And something happened in the '90s as \\"New Age\\" became mainstream. Where are we now, now that these millions of used copies of MM sell for .01? And where are the Aborigines? Did they disappear as threatened? I'd love to know if her message (or profits) helped them out at all.

1892005034|5.0|The understanding that has come to me from Marshall Rosenberg's work, Nonviolent Communication, has been transformational.  As my experience and understanding of this work sinks into my bones, and becomes part of my consciousness, I see it as a deeply spiritual practice, and one that helps me to live in alignment with values that I work to uphold .....compassion, empathy, non-judgement.    While my initial understanding focused on learning this language, it quickly became clear to me that this was far more than mastering a way of speaking, and required one to be clear with one's self about what one's own \\"needs\\" are, and to own them as such is to free ourselves of the cycle of criticism and blame that is so destructive to relationships.     Non-violent Communication offers a tool that allows one to consider what others are doing or saying  that makes it possible to actually listen rather than react.  This is like tossing a stick in the spokes of a wheel,  interrupting a pattern of reaction that often leaves both people feeling frustrated and not understood.  NVC has taught me to hear in the same way that drawing has taught me to see.    To have the experience of being treated by one who lives this language of understanding is to feel known, appreciated and to feel valued.  That is powerful.  One is left feeling deep gratitude for the gift of that understanding.  How good is that?!
B000G759LW|5.0|LOVE THIS CD!!!!   I couldn't have bought her other records because beyond one or two fantastic songs it was overly sappy and plagued by ridiculous vocal acrobatics that made me cringe. <br /> <br />Now she knows she has nothing to prove and is very adult.  I can't get enough of it.  I don't have to forward through any songs, and I see longevity in her future.  She has set herself apart from everyone too bad she has to work so hard for everyone to see that.  Nothing is handed to this woman.  It took several months for me to even consider buying her album but she convinced me!  Way to go Christina...I am now a fan.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|I give the movie 5 stars,but the sparse and yet overly p.c. commentary by producer Richard Shepherd is lackluster and annoying. Shepherd audibly squirms, moans and tsk-tsks every time someone has a cigarette in their mouth or when Mickey Rooney comes on screen as the Japanese photographer. To the absurd point when after the film comes to its perfect and poignant end Shepherd claims that although it's a good film, it could have been a great film if Rooney hadn't been in it. To Mr. Shepherd and all, I say,\\" God save us from political correctness\\". Mickey Rooney is miscast, but not because it's politically incorrect, but because his character is too over the top and cartoonish (even for a comedy). But since his character is minor and unimportant to the story he certainly doesn't ruin the movie.   <br />     My only other gripe is the fact that both Shepherd -in his commentary- and Blake Edwards -in the featurette \\"The Making of a Classic\\"- don't give George Peppard enough -or any- credit for his fine performance. Edwards goes so far as to say that he thought Peppard was miscast (this from the man who cast Mickey Rooney!).
0375831002|5.0|Coming off a poorly written book, I opened the first pages of this book and thought, \\"joy of text.\\" When one finds a compelling narrative,it is such a high. The author uses the convention of laying out the entire story in just a few opening pages, and the rest of the book fleshes out the narrative. We know from the very beginning who will live, who will die, but that doesn't detract whatsoever from the tension. I'll be using this book in a college class on adolescent literature (along with the non-fiction Hitler Youth), but I highly recommend it for adult readers, too.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Great stuff. The only thing wrong with this set is that's all there is. They only made a few episodes ever, which makes this set priceless. The extra footage on the DVDs was quite good and gave some history of the show.
B00005JPAM|4.0|What's interesting about \\"The Queen\\" is that it gives insight into the life of a public figure that's actually quite private: Queen Elizabeth II. I obviously have no way of understanding the responsibilities associated with ruling a country, but--at the risk of stating the obvious--I can imagine that it isn't easy. Every decision, action, and idea that's made will meet with praise and/or criticism on a global scale. Options must be weighed for the benefit of her people, not for the benefit of herself or her family. She must be willing to be scrutinized and ridiculed by the media, who legally have the right to attack her character, disagree with her policies, and mock her in general. These issues are skillfully examined in this film. However, I'm hard pressed to say that it's an accurate examination. Likewise, some viewers may be turned off by its consistently dry tone.    Nonetheless, there's a lot about this film to enjoy, not the least of which is Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen; here's a woman that was raised to believe that the needs of her country outweigh her own needs. While she's diligent and professional when it comes to governmental affairs, her emotions are kept under lock and key. This proved to be troublesome in August of 1997, when Diana, Princess of Wales, died in Paris in an automobile accident. The Queen's immediate reaction is deciding to keep the Royal Family out of the public eye. Part of this decision had to do with Diana's children, who needed to grieve without the press hassling them. The rest had to do with the Queen's disapproval of Diana; she saw her as nothing more than a publicity hound. Furthermore, Diana was technically no longer a member of the Royal Family (she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier). Because of that, it seemed proper to respect the wishes of the Spencer family to have a private funeral.    This does not sit well with the British population, who generally loved Diana for her humanitarianism. Public opinion soonturns against the Queen. At the same time, the popularity ratings for the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), are rising; he's been much more public about Diana's tragic death. A majority of the film focuses on his working relationship with the Queen, specifically in trying to get her to cooperate and listen to her people. They want her to make a statement. They want her to raise the flag over Buckingham Palace at half-mast. They want her to acknowledge the throngs of Diana supporters that are leaving bouquets at the Palace gates. She refuses to take part in the media frenzy. In her mind, Diana's death is a private matter; the public will simply have to accept that.    It's soon decided that Diana's funeral will, in fact, be a public affair. True, the Queen finds this highly improper. However, she also begins to understand the British people will not let this one go; they want Diana to have a proper funeral, and the want their Queen to show some degree of compassion. The pressure they put on her is increasing, so much so that long buried emotions begin to resurface. Example: while walking through a remote countryside, she cries for the first time. It's obvious that years of royal etiquette have had an impact; despite the fact that she's alone and surrounded by acres of open land, her sobs are forcefully restrained. In that moment, her only comfort is a wild buck that passes by; it's large, majestic, and clearly symbolic of strength and fortitude.     At that point, she finally begins taking Blair's advice, much to the chagrin of her husband, Philip (James Cromwell), and her mother (Sylvia Sims). She publicly walks past the piles of bouquets, reading notes written by Diana supporters (one says, \\"Your blood is on their hands\\"). She makes a televised statement (albeit a prewritten, mechanical, emotionless one). It all leads up to Diana's funeral, a full media blowout with celebrity attendance, including Luciano Pavarotti, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Elton John (who would score a hit with the new version of \\"Candle in the Wind\\"). By the time the funeral ends, the Queen's relationship with Prime Minister Blair has diminished considerably. Their final scene acts as a counterpart to their first, in which they meet: the latter is a light, pleasant moment between the two; the former is tense and reserved.    Some might think that the purpose of \\"The Queen\\" is to portray Elizabeth II as a cold, uncaring, conservative individual. Indeed, her engrained devotion to duty and honor doesn't make her especially gregarious. However, I don't think the filmmakers were attempting to portray her in any particular fashion, nor do I think they were passing judgment on her; instead, they were presenting her plainly and directly, allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions. Maybe it's best that we do no such thing; very few can appreciate the responsibilities and sacrifices required of a ruler.
B000L212HC|5.0|I own both The Prestige and The Illusionist (although the latter is in standard DVD format) and I have to say that The Prestige blows The Illusionist out of the water.  I'm a huge Ed Norton fan, and liked the job he did in his role, but the duo of Jackman/Bale was absolutely perfectly cast for this film. <br /> <br />The story is not so much one of dueling magicians, as has been emphasized so much, but one of obsession (as is constantly inferred throughout the vilm) and how far an obsession will drive a person.  Viewed in that light, this film offers some very human, and often downright frightening characters. <br /> <br />As a period piece, it does an adequate job of placing a modern storyline into turn of the century London, but the film is certainly not a period piece at its core.  The period is just a backdrop for some really good human drama, with some sleight-of-hand (the best of which is performed by director Chris Nolan) and science fiction elements, which are present simply to advance the story, not take center-stage. <br /> <br />If you pay close attention, you'll likely catch onto a couple of the 'twists' that are revealed at the end, but there is still enough going on that nearly everyone who watches the film will be entertained by all of the turns exposed late in the film. <br /> <br />As a human drama, this film is exquisite.  As a revenge story, it is excellent.  As a period piece it falls a little short.  But overall the film is a 5 star offering.  And the BluRay presentation is absolutely phenomenal.  I've only got fifteen BluRay titles, and this is hands-down the best overall presentation, especially visually.
B000AMWIVM|1.0|I was told by several people at work that this was the best horror movie that they had seen in a long while.  Based on their opinions, I went and bought the special edition.  After viewing 'Saw' I came to the conclusion that it was one of the silliest movies, horror or otherwise, that I had seen in quite some time.  Firstly, it's not scary in the slightest.  Gory does not equal scary in my book.  Also there were several unintentionally funny scenes in the movie.  The silly mask that 'Jigsaw' wears was just one thing that made me laugh.  If you're a connoiseur of horror movies as I am, I would recommend 'Saw' for a good laugh but nothing else.  I don't think I'll listen to the people I work with anymore.
B00003CWL6|2.0|A confused film with stereotypes and a self-deceiving message that confounds statutory rape with a mid-life spiritual awakening. Check out the fantastic Aussie film from 1987, BLISS, (directed by Ray Lawrence) and you will see how AB is a weak, mixed-up reworking (from a writer who cut his teeth in TV sitcoms). The very last scene of AB is the true tip-off to the reality of the rip-off, compare the camera's heavenwards pullback and Spacey's final voiceover monologue. The lovely poetry of BLISS' last scene will, if you have even a vague pulse, bring real soul-tears to your eyes. You tell me.  <br /> <br />PS -   I was moved at the final images of Annette Benning's wailing in the closet and her brief, gleeful smile on the Tilt-a-Whirl (black and white film is so underrated). So, there's a couple of stars for that.
0765315246|5.0|This is an incredible debut for a new writer. For those that enjoy science fiction as it was envisioned by the great master Robert A. Heinlein in his best years, \\"Old Man's War\\" is a real masterpiece. It has the sheer imagination, the twisted plots, the endless adventure, the engaging characters, and the sense of humor that characterized Heinlein's best production. And perhaps more importantly, John has the same \\"magic touch\\". His prose flows effortlessly, with such clarity, that he instantly transports you into a different and believable universe. 5 stars. No doubt.    As a side note, this book has two important differences with respect to Heinlein's works. John benefits from the technical progress in the last 40 years to provide a very fresh technological and scientific environment. His credible use of genetics, computing, etc., makes our suspension of disbelief far easier. Second, \\"Old man's war\\" has also very little political and religious fiction, which was a favorite theme of Robert A. Heinlein.
B00005RDRO|4.0|A rich millionaire invites the greatest living detectives to his castle (complete with fog, lightning and rain etc) for dinner - and a murder. The surviving detective who figures it out is promised one million dollars.  <br />OK, so it is not the plot or the inherently stagey nature of the movie that is classic - but the mixing of such a fine ensemble cast. A brilliant cast play similes of literatures great detectives - Peter Falk playing Bogart's Sam Spade crossed with Columbo (Sam Diamond in the movie), David Niven playing The Thin Man, Peter Sellers playing Charlie Chan (Wang in the movie), and Agatha Christies Poirot and Marples give rise to the hysterically monikered Milo Perrier and Miss Marbles. Add to that the iconic Truman Capote as the millionaire, and Alec Guinness as the blind butler as well as various sidekicks, and you have possibly the biggest set of scenery chewers crammed into one dining room.  <br />The jokes are thick and fast, always farcical, but never straying too far into slapstick. Any misses are quickly forgiven as the next joke comes along.  <br />Predictably perhaps the ending is not entirely satisfactory - a simple but clever ending would have been more effective than the over elaborate series of revelations which don't quite tie up. But lets face it, when you're having this much fun, who cares.  <br />The 91 minute running time makes this a satisfactorily tight little movie that is ideal for a rainy Sunday evening... <br />
B0002IQEHI|5.0|\\"North by Northwest\\" is an in tense film made in the concept of the wrong man at the wrong time, just like in \\"The Man that Knew Too Much\\".  Hitchcock is  amaster ofdirection and he has chosen a brilliant cast to go with an equally briniant plot.  The characters delelop well and Cary Grant offers an amazing perfomance of an innocent man chased all over the US in order to save his life and proove his innocence.  Meanwhile romance is thrown in the plot with a mystirious but gorgeous Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />A great addition to your collection.
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins reputation for being inflammatory and divisive is undeserved in my opinion in terms of providing justification to ignore him.  Dawkins in The God Delusion certainly doesn't hold back and like any good scientist has complete disrespect for ideas that are not supported with evidence or reason.  However, Dawkins has a style that is non-threatening.  Most of us can relate to an associate who was able to do and say outrageous things and remain endearing.  Dawkins has this gift in spades, making him an excellent candidate to begin the engagement of scrutinizing the veracity of religious claims using the scientific method and fostering what I hope will be the start of a productive dialogue and debate.<br /><br />Dawkins is at his best shooting down weak religious arguments on the prime-mover hypothesis.  Dawkin's own hypothesis in this area probably couldn't have been made during the beginning of the Enlightenment because humanity at that time did not understand that all evidence leads to advancing complexity.  Knowing what we know now, Dawkins is justified in putting these old arguments back in the limelight for further testing given what we've discovered over the past 100 years, especially the past 30 years in Cosmology.<br /><br />Dawkins' is at his weakest when discussing America's founding ideals and the historical understanding of the beginning of religion and its meaning.  These are areas where Dawkins' does not have the intellectual background so he merely references highly biased opinions of others that appear to be referenced because they support his worldview but are simply quite wrong, e.g., quoting Hitchens' claim that Thomas Jefferson was likely an atheist.  However, to dismiss this book for his weakness in these two areas and his admitted bias would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater since they are not an essential part of the book.<br /><br />Dawkins has several points worth consideration by all people who honestly seek knowledge and truth; some of these are as follows:<br />* Using the scientific method to seek truth about ideas where people have traditionally looked to religion; coupled with the development of his no-God hypothesis which he supports with logic and evidence, though not enough evidence to develop into a theory.<br />* Commentary on the increasing divide between intellectuals and religious people and the resulting harm both to society and the children of religious people who continue to indoctrinate their children rather than educate them; and the resulting effect that is widening the gap between the haves and have-nots.<br />* Shooting down the notion that atheism, as promoted and practiced by intellectuals, is somehow responsible for Nazi Germany, Stalinism, and other murderous and corrupt authoritarian governments and that atheism is the cause of moral decay seen in some societies. This is one of the most pervasive lies told by social conservatives, even those who claim to be anti-divisive, like Rick Warren on Meet the Press recently when he falsely charged Hitler's motivation as being atheistic.<br />* Dawkins discussion on memes and how this idea, which is his, argues why religion thrived since prehistory and why its failing so miserably now. For those unfamiliar with memes and Dawkins' groundbreaking work on this topic, this subject matter alone justifies the purchase of this book.<br />* Shines light on the fact that more atheistic societies are much more moral with happier people and provides an argument on why societies who've forsaken religion for intellectualism have less social ills.<br /><br />So while Dawkins is occasionally as stridently biased as his opponents, the book is enlightening, entertaining, and well written.  It reminds me of the most pleasurable wine-soaked dinners I've experienced where the conversation extended beyond small talk and into the realm of ideas that all humans struggle with and that most likely created religion in the first place.ollows:  * Using the scientific method to seek truth about ideas where people have traditionally looked to religion; coupled with the development of his no-God hypothesis which he supports with logic and evidence, though not enough evidence to develop into a theory.  * Commentary on the increasing divide between intellectuals and religious people and the resulting harm both to society and the children of religious people who continue to indoctrinate their children rather than educate them; and the resulting effect that is widening the gap between the haves and have-nots.  * Shooting down the notion that atheism, as promoted and practiced by intellectuals, is somehow responsible for Nazi Germany, Stalinism, and other murderous and corrupt authoritarian governments and that atheism is the cause of moral decay seen in some societies.

0345457692|4.0|Not long ago, ambitious authors led by William Gibson took concepts such as corporate ninjas, man-machine hybrids and extreme virtual reality crime-lords and set them in the recent future of a darkly plausible world. The result was a gritty and believable science fiction genre called cyberpunk.  But unfortunately, when the 21st Century finally arrived, it was conspicuously lacking in cyborgs and high-tech heists (no flying cars, either)  And so, with its plausibility stripped, cyberpunk quietly faded away.    Until now.    Richard K. Morgan's \\"Altered Carbon\\" brings back the marriage of science fiction and film noir in a story that takes place five hundred years in the future. The story telling is edgy and his hero, Takeshi Kovachs, is morally ambiguous. Graphic sex and violence is skillfully juxtaposed along side cold hard science to create a futuristic hard-boiled detective story.     His top tech-trick is the concept of being \\"Resleeved\\".  One's consciousness can be stored in \\"cortical stacks\\" that can be uploaded into another body.  It's not a new idea, having been masterfully explored in Zelazny's \\"Lord of Light\\" (and not so well developed in Corey Doctorow's \\"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\\"). Morgan takes the concept further and delves into the economic, sociological and psychological effects of this technology (other reviews will give more detail about how).    There is one thing, however, that absolutely drove me crazy while reading this book.  Takeshi Kovachs was a member of the Envoy Corps, an elite Special Forces space-marine type organization. Know how I know? Because Morgan feels the need to constantly remind the reader of this fact! There is at least one reference like \\"my Envoy training kicked in\\", \\"when I was in the Envoy corp.\\", or \\"...I looked at him with standard Envoy suspicion\\" on every other page! Since the story is told from Kovach's first person narrative, the constant reminder of his \\"Envoy\\" prowess makes him sound insecure and crying forattention.     But if you can overlook that little detail, you'll find yourself thoroughly immersed in an edgy high-tech cyberpunk detective story.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|You have to wonder why Michael Mann even bothered to call this Miami Vice. The name makes perfect sense for the movie, and yet it has precious little in common with the TV series from the 80's. Perhaps his point is, if he made that series now, this is how it might have looked.  <br />So what do we get - it is a serious and intelligent portrayal of the drugs business in Miami. In some ways it is closer to 'Traffic' in showing the mechanics of how it all happens, rather than a thriller like `Heat' for which Mann is better known. Only at the end do we get a shoot out, in full Michael Mann style. Farrell and Foxx do not make a buddy movie - these are long standing partners who barely need to speak, they know and understand each other already, and we do not see the bonding process. Otherwise, this movie is all about process, and little about the characters. Instead, the plot focuses on the team's infiltration of a large drug running organisation, posing as boat runners.  <br />The only real venture into characterisation is the wonderful Gong Li, the Cuban Chinese wife of the main villain. Although not the star of the movie, she steals many of the scenes - perhaps it is just in Mann's nature to flesh out the characters of the crooks rather than the police... Crockett falls in love with her, blurring the line of duty for him. Foxx also gets his own personal involvement later in the movie, driving the plot's run to the final shoot out where they all need to make the difficult transition from their undercover character's and their real lives as cops.  <br />It's well worth a watch - the trademark blue tinged cinematography, big boats, big guns etc. are all there telling you this is a Mann movie - and as long as you expect something a little different, and yes, not as good as usual, you won't be disappointed. <br />
B000H5TH1Q|4.0|A long time favorite of mind. There is no real porn in this movie But it does  have a one of the better performances by Melanie Griffith, Gregg Henry. I like the plot twist in the middle.
B000NA28IE|4.0|Ok, so this wasn't the greatest film of all time, and it would never win any awards, but it does what any decent movie is meant to do: it entertains. True, having read the 2 books currently released, it leaves much to be desired, and left much out, but as a stand-alone movie, it's not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Though the books are a very enjoyable read, you can tell they are written by a young less experienced author, and the movie follows that same path. However, I went to the movie, and left feeling satisfied.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons as Brom is solid as always, Rachel Weisz's voice is perfect as Saphira - although the conversations between Saphira's character and Eragon are quite limited compared to the book. Edward Seepeler's is young, and so not as experienced, but again, he's not as bad as everyone has made him out to be. This is a PG fantasy movie, it is not Lord of the Rings, nor is Harry Potter, and it does not aspire to be. It is the Inheritance Trilogy, and that is what it aspires to be. It is well worth a watch whether or not you've read the book(s).

0060922583|5.0|After I read this book, the movie \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" totally made sense, and actually seemed plausible.
0596009208|3.0|The idea behind this book has a lot of promise, and hopefully future versions will be significant improvements.  But, as executed right now, this book has a lot of room for improvement.  In particular, it feels too \\"lighthearted\\", and the editing is sloppy.  I suppose this book might be good enough if you just want help passing that freshman-level course (you can't argue with the price, I suppose), but if you're a professional looking to learn to code in Java at that level, this book won't get you there.  Particular complaints/praises of this book below:    * I think its varied presentation type (lots of graphics, mixing up the format of the information presented) on balance enhances readability, and is a lot faster to get through than other books of similar size.  However, there is a *lot* of it, to the point where the unusual becomes, to some extent, usual, so that the effect of doing so is decreased.  It might be a good idea if they toned down on this a bit.    * I've noticed a few complaints that information is hard to get if you need to get it quickly.  I don't consider that complaint valid for this book because this book is intended to be used as a tutorial and not a reference.  For the latter, you'd want to use something like Java in a Nutshell anyway.   This book isn't intended to be The Only Book You'll Ever Have On Java (TM).    * Going back to the first bullet point a bit, the differing formats for exercises certainly were interesting.  Just having exercises in this book is a plus that not all books share.  However, I found some of them were too clever for their own good (the crosswords and pool puzzles are frequent instances of this).  Any programmer (and, let's face it, that is the audience of this book) is going to need to be able to sit down and write substantial code.  By avoiding coding exercises like the plague, this book does its readers a disservice by not giving them some java-programming practice.  Let them create something from scratch.  WhenI finished this book, I really didn't feel like I had learned Java.  And it's not because the material wasn't presented, and presented competently.    * Also, there are too many references to pages that simply are incorrect (i.e. the page doesn't exist or doesn't have what the reference claims it has).  This is a serious error and is indication of editing that should be improved on.    Although I haven't started it yet, I'm going to give Daniel Liang's \\"Introduction to Java Programming\\" a try.  It's much more expensive, but I hope it's a bit more comprehensive and rigorous.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I can't resist adding my thoughts about this recording. <br /> <br />From start to finish, this is of the very best given to us on a recording. There are so many great things happening on this concert that it's amazing. First, their songs are timeless. They are great, great songs with memorable melodies, great lyrics and wonderful harmonies. Another key thing is that these guys are so tuned into the groove! Man, I can just imagine what a feeling overtakes this band when they're deep into these grooves. I find it very fascinating that, in their interviews in the bonus material, they mention factors that make them great. One of them is groove. Intonation, harmony voicing, rhythmical togetherness, blend....all key elements of this great band. <br /> <br />It takes work and a commitment to excellence to have a band be this good. These guys are seasoned and know how to do it better than anyone. Their supporting musicians are fabulous as well. The horn section really adds to the life of these songs. <br /> <br />I read someone's review that criticized Joe Walsh acting like a fool. I think his antics are hilarious,(check out the 'helmet cam'- \\"Life's Been Good\\" made me laugh out loud!) classy fun and indicate that these fellas have nothing to prove anymore. Their longevity and the sheer number of people who STILL go to see them and buy their recordings are testaments to that. They are TRULY possibly the BEST BAND EVER!!! <br /> <br />If you desire to view and/or own a fantastic recorded concert you must consider this one. Let's go 10 stars! <br /> <br /> <br />
0375757856|4.0|Would it interest readers to know that at the time that William Wilkie Collins was writing THE MOONSTONE in 1858, he was cheating on Mrs. Caroline Graves, his lover?  That same year he left her, and had the first of his three children with Martha Rudd, a woman he never married.  Two years later, he carried on a relationship with both women!  No wonder he drew the unlikable Miss Clack, the Christian evangelist, so severely.  Miss Clack wouldn't have at all approved.    And why did Collins write the character of the opium-addicted physician's assistant, Ezra Jennings, so sympathetically?  Perhaps because Collins was experimenting with opium at the time of its writing, but hadn't yet become the delusional addict he would become later in life.  Sinning always seems fun...for a season.    You and I both know that TS Eliot, who loved THE MOONSTONE, wouldn't approve of my type of critique.  He decried critics who look outside of the text.  But so what?      Tabloid-style criticism will in no way detract from the excellence of this book, even if Collins was the typical intellectual who didn't think he had to play by the rules.  Collins knows how to tell a story, and to keep the reader interested.  And he mastered the first person narration by strictly telling us, in several distinct voices, only what each character sees and knows, which makes for some great red herrings.      Did I also mention that Collins was a best selling author and that THE MOONSTONE was the last of his successes?  Who says bestsellers can't stand the test of time?
B000MCH5P4|2.0|'Babel' firmly belongs to the 'Crash' school of filmmaking: find a good, truthful aspect of society and bury it in melodrama and manipulative contrivances to get audiences swooning over your movie.  The people who profess to love the film do so primarily because they agree with the message, not because of the quality of the film itself.  And so, an undeserving, hackneyed work gets awards heaped upon it because everyone wants to look socially responsible/aware.  And all the while, the sad truth is that the movie has little to say about the issues it is ostensibly addressing so thoughtfully.  The \\"theme\\" of Babel that is so widely discussed in reviews is that communication and cultural understanding have become impossible in today's world, but the only way you get a sense of that from the film is the Biblical reference contained in the title.  Or maybe it's supposed to come out in the way that Brad Pitt's character shrieks at the Morroccan villagers who don't understand his English after his wife is wounded in a freak shooting, but honestly, any halfway-savvy traveller wouldn't dare venture into a foreign land like that without a travel guide that would at least allow them to say \\"phone\\" or \\"hospital\\" in the native language, or are we not supposed to question the movie's logic?  That's the type of contrivance that sadly defines the screenplay for 'Babel', and the viewer is supposed to mindlessly nod and accept it.  (***potential spoiler alert***)  This is a movie where travellers wander into territories unknown without a thought for their own protection, a Mexican man living legally in the US will choose to try and outrun customs officials anyway just because they made him angry, a father will encourage his sons to run from the police rather than peacefully attempt to explain the nature of their accident, and a young boy will endanger the lives of himself and his family to shoot at said police who have come to arrest him rather than turn himself in and explain what happened.  (***end potential spoilers***)  Why?  Because it's more dramatic that way.  It may make less sense, but I suppose audiences respond to senseless violence better than poignant truth.<br /><br />What makes 'Babel' better than 'Crash' is that it actually has a pretty solid first hour before the story gets overtaken by melodrama and self-importance.  But get overtaken it does, and soon the viewer is deluged by convenient set-ups and disastrous results.

(***end potential spoilers***)  Why?  Because it's more dramatic that way.  It may make less sense, but I suppose audiences respond to senseless violence better than poignant truth. <br /> <br />What makes 'Babel' better than 'Crash' is that it actually has a pretty solid first hour before the story gets overtaken by melodrama and self-importance.  But get overtaken it does, and soon the viewer is deluged by convenient set-ups and disastrous results.

630587493X|5.0|It's hard to fathom why this movie did so poorly at the box office - it's one of my all-time favorite movies!  Thought provoking, intelligent, funny, sweet, romantic, creative, engaging, sad - it has some of everything.  One of the things I've always enjoyed about really good science fiction is the fact that it isn't bound by reality, yet feeds your imagination with real possibilities.  This is really good science fiction!
B00006ADD5|5.0|It's hard for the small screen to do justice to such a sweeping cinematographic epic, but there is much more to this film than its visual majesty. The film has one of the most beautiful and recognized scores in the history of cinema, a fascinating subject in the person of T.E. Lawrence himself, one of the most literate screenplays ever written, and a wonderful supporting cast nearing perfection. It is a shame that unless you take the time to buy the DVD and invest the almost four hours it takes to watch it, you are likely to miss out on one of the best films ever made. It is precisely because of its length that it is seldom seen on TV anymore. The backdrop of the film is that the British, in the midst of fighting World War I, are aiding the Arab struggle for independence from the Turks since anything that ties up the Turks accomplishes the British goal of destroying the Ottoman Empire and thus aids in the war effort. T. E. Lawrence is first enlisted to help advise the Arabs in their military goals, but goes on to lead them in a series of stunning military victories that goes way beyond what the British expected of the Arabs, and quite frankly, way beyond what the British wanted. You see, the British had designs on claiming Arabia for themselves after the war ends, years before it was discovered that Arabia was sitting on the world's richest oil supply.<br /><br />However, this is really an oversimplification of a very complex film.  This movie is so multi-faceted that you could tackle reviewing it from several angles. To me one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the complex relationship and contrast between Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif), fellow tribesman and counsel to Prince Feisal, and T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole). When the two first meet Ali shoots down Lawrence's Arab companion who is taking him to first meet Feisel because the man is drinking from Ali's well and does not have permission to do so. An outraged Lawrence chastises Ali citing that Arabia will never be great as long as they war amongst themselves and that he is \\"barborous and cruel\\". Towards the end of the film, though, there is a reversal of roles as Ali tries to stop a massacre that Lawrence is not only allowing his troops to participate in, but seems to be genuinely enjoying. Ali is a man who has a good bead on who he is and what he believes. Not having this quality is Lawrence's greatest shortcoming. Lawrence either believes he is much less than he is or much more, depending on his latest exploits and who has talked to him last. Ali clearly sees this problem, and by the end of the film Ali is Lawrence's fast friend - in fact his only true friend. You see, Lawrence is being used by both the Arabs and the British. This becomes immensely clear when at the end of the film Prince Feisel, who has always seemed to be genuine towards Lawrence, says during negotiations with the British \\"Lawrence is a double-edged sword - We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?\\".  By the way, the role of Ali has to be Sharif's finest hour as an actor. I always thought Dr. Zhivago was that finest role, and it is still a great performance, but this one is even better.<br /><br />There are so many other themes going on in this film - the thin line between madness and heroism, the worth of a single human life versus the welfare of an entire army or a nation, the sometimes less than honorable motives behind those fighting for the honorable goal independence, the contrast between western and Arab values - that you could go on forever. That is why I strongly recommend this film. You'll probably come away with something a little different on each viewing.will never be great as long as they war amongst themselves and that he is \\"barborous and cruel\\".

B00004R99F|4.0|I won't give a summary of the movie (many reviews have already done that) but I will say this. Why no widescreen? I believe the Region 2 version of this DVD got a widescreen presentation (though I'm not sure if it was enhanced for 16X9 televisions...), but why do the people stuck with Region 1 DVD players get stuck with the full screen version? I've seen the widescreen edition and it looks much better! The full screen version just looks like the sides got chopped off... the scenes feel a bit cramped. Aside from that flaw, this is a great DVD and worth buying, or at least renting. It also has an episode of Goof Troop as a bonus feature and a few other bonus features too. 4 stars only because of the absent widescreen version. Otherwise the movie is worth 5 stars, I just wish to see it in its original aspect ratio. :(

B000KX0IOK|5.0|Teachers are long held up as beacons of hope, inspirational figures that effect and shape our lives. The spate of inspirational teacher films is many; one where a teacher is flawed and struggling are hard to come by, and this is one of those that hits this theme right out of the ballpark.<br /><br />Dan Dunne, junior high school teacher, teaches inspriationally, realistically, with realistic, bright kids. The feel of his classroom, one of discourse and lecture, is one that is supprtive, relavent and positive. Which makes it all the more heartbreaking that Dunne is a junkie, dealing with the reality of his substance abuse problem, and how it immediately impacts his role when one of his students finds him using.<br /><br />This film is real, manging to avoid the cliched stereotypes of education films, and dares to present Dunne as real. Ryan Gosliing nails Dunne immediately. His deft, sad performance is definitely Oscar worthy, and made even better by Shareeka Epps' performance as Drey. Together they make a complex pair, teacher and student, humans trying to relate to each other and the awkward circumstances in their lives. Their relationship provides some uneasy moments, ones where you might think the film is crossing a line.<br /><br />Half Nelson is NOT for people wanting an uplifting story, or a feel-good education movie (there are plenty of them out there, may I suggest Akeelah and the Bee?), but if you like a great script, human characters and the dynamic complexities of life, Half Nelson would be for you.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I have always been a big fan of classic rock but I tried to keep an open mind throughout the years. I have followed and really liked Madonna's musical transformation that had started with the album Erotica (and the Girlie Show). However I must admit that Confessions is something else. I  have no words to describe this amazing performance. She has taken the concept of entertainment to the next level. The stage, the show, the choreography, the songs; everything is filled with energy and I felt that as I watched the dvd. I wish that I had seen this live at a venue but due to the rapid sales of tickets it was impossible for me to find one. No matter what type of music/show you prefer , I would seriously recommend this DVD/CD set to any music fan to experience the next level of entertainment.
B00000I3JM|5.0|this is extraordinary elegant, sophisticated pop music. with its synthesized sounds, strings, electronics, and other exotica, much of this music would fit easily on early brian eno albums. highly creative, this recording also sports much in the way of big bass and drum sounds; however, it is the singer that really gives this its classic feel.  the vocals are stunning, emotionally charged and full of yearning. just a great, great cd. don't miss this or any of the other 3 blue nile recordings; they are all outstanding.
B000JLTRIG|4.0|This season is the culmination of several seasons' hints and story lines.  We finally see Utopia, learn about the Avatars, and the girls finally get a break in the end.  I had to knock 1 star off my rating because the ending of this season made me extremely angry and apprehensive when it first aired.  I vowed that if the \\"Charmed Ones\\" were going to remain in those young, twenty-something bodies, that Charmed had lost a lot of loyal fans including myself.  I was relieved when the girls I knew returned in the next season.  Another reason this season is only \\"almost perfect\\" is that I simply miss Chris.  I couldn't stand him at first, but by the time he \\"died\\", he was part of the family. <br />If a spin-off ever occurred, my vote would be setting it about 20 years in the future and feature Wyatt, Chris and the other 7 Charmed children.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I have been looking forward to this movie since I first heard about it 1 1/2 yrs before it came out. Unfortunately, I had a baby just as it was released and didn't get to see it until now. I bought it for my now 4yr old and we love to sit and watch it together on a Sunday afternoon. He loves it so much, we had his bedroom decorated with all 'Cars' stuff.  <br />Pixar movies are only getting better and better.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|The dialogue and the SB dialects were true-to-life for the subject matter. The Departed deals with a number of subtle issues that we see not only in the SB area, but in any big city. That both the DiCaprio and Damon characters ended up with the same shrink was a little weak, but not impossible as she dealt with specialized area of post-trauma distress. That aside, I enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />On the down-side: It was a little long. Plot was a little choppy. I never like movies that tend to portray police organizations as corrupt, but I can suspend that dislike for two hours and be give the movie a fair assessment.<br /><br />If you like the organized crime genre and dark, tragedies this is a good accompaniment for your next batch of home-made hot-buttered popcorn.  Not a family movie because of mature subject, language and violence.

Join Mr. Morrison for a quiet journey that soothes the senses.
0345350499|3.0|It is an error to call this novel a retelling of the Arthurian legends from \\"the women's viewpoint\\".  Not all women see visions and have out-of-body experiences.  Very few women have memories of earlier lives.  Almost none are fated to fulfill a preordained destiny.  This book is not about \\"women\\".  It is about \\"magical beings\\", about \\"goddesses\\". <br /> <br />The normal rules of real life do not apply to these women.  They are not \\"hallucinating\\" or \\"having delusions\\".  Magic is real for them so their actions are perfectly acceptable.  Their sexuality and betrayals are also beyond reproach because how are WE non-magical creatures to judge them? <br /> <br />The \\"Christians\\" and \\"Romans\\" as portrayed in this novel are violent, misogynist beings, and are therefore sometimes mistaken for being \\"masculine\\".  For the most part they are sadly lacking in the \\"magical\\" experiences and visions of the past & future which the women of this novel enjoy and can therefore be judged by \\"real world\\" non-magical standards.  They don't come off looking too good. <br /> <br />Personally I had trouble enjoying this novel because I think both Pagans and Christians are crazy in pretty much the same way.  Reading this book is like watching a train wreck.  Take away the magic and none of these characters are likable.
0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chbosky writes in a way that is pure and unpretentious. This book has many similarities to Catcher in the Rye, but in my opinion it's 10 times better than that classic book. As many similarities there are that can be drawn, there's many noticeable differences. For one, Holden Caulfield seemed to be a bitter adolescent to me. Yes he had morals and a social conscience, but he was too wrapped up in himself and he was very bitter towards the world. Charlie (the main character in this story, although afflicted with angst, alienation and adversity is a warm and loving character. Another major difference is that J.D. Salinger (although undoubtedly a great author, focuses too hard on giving Holden a persona. When I read about Holden I saw him as merely a character in a book who has been faced with conflict. However Charlie was written in such a way that he didn't need a persona... he was honest, he was vulnerable and he seemed to be more than a character in a book. He seemed human. Although Charlie struggles with issues in this book, he wasn't a character that I pitied but instead a character that I would love to know or I would love to strive to be like. The last difference is that this book is written in more modern times, and although I feel it's essential that Catcher in the Rye be read, I also feel that it's equally essential for teenagers in this day and age to read Perks of Being a Wallflower... being that they could easily relate to this book. This book doesn't sugarcoat or lie... it's startlingly honest and it makes you genuinely love it's characters. Your heart breaks for the characters and it left me wanting to know what happens to them once the book ended. I could read this book over and over and not get tired of it. My only gripe is that perhaps Charlie is too forgiving, but that's just a testament to how loving a character he truly is.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I'm not much of a fan of musicals but this movie was good to watch because of the cinematography and the costumes. Ms. Rossum stands out as a opera singer who is the object of the phantom hidden in the museum.  <br />The phantom was a hideous person forced into hiding by a young girl to protect him from being further villified. He was ostracized by the public for his distorted image and used as a sideshow for entertainment. He is vengeful but has a soft heart for a beautiful opera singer.  <br />This is a beautifully dramatic movie.
B000005IU2|5.0|I bought this album about 10 years ago. I hadn't heard \\"1970\\" for a while (until earlier this evening) and almost forgot what a perfect piece of chaos it is. The sax player deserves serious praise (as well as whoever suggested putting sax on a Stooges album in the first place).  <br /> <br />Funhouse is one of the most compact, cohesive, crazy albums ever recorded. The whole thing is quite an experience.
B000002GQK|3.0|Every good boy deservese favour, from 1971, by the Moody Blues, was their sixth straight psychedelic album.  <br /> <br />The album is a worthy addition to your collection. However, as the title to my review suggests, my feelings towards the album are \\"it's ok\\".  <br /> <br />It begins with a run-down of all possible music styles they can think of, which is makes for a pleasant enough track, but seems like a desperate idea for a song. The album then gets into the main body with the awesome rocker 'The story in your eyes' which has a rollicking riff and hearfelt vocals from Justin Hayward. Although really whiney, 'Our guessing game' is a decent enough song, though the only real fresh idea is some experimentation with vocal arrangements. Another smashing track follows in the really soft, pleasant 'Emily's song', a pretty John Lodge number featuring a well-timed cello riff. The album really changes pace with a hard-rocking 'The Wall' by Graeme Edge. Since it's an Edge number, the other four Moodies take turns on the vocals. Again, it's a bit negative \\"I've reached the top of my wall, I've found another way to fall\\" which kind of detracts from being a hard-rocking song, but it's a cool track. <br /> <br />The real problems with this album show up on side two. John Lodge's 'One more time to live' is really emotional and melodic, though the chorus is shouting words such as \\"Communication\\", \\"Creation\\", etc. that were first heard in \\"Procession\\". Then the album really suffers with Ray Thomas' \\"Nice to be here\\". It's not a bad song, only drags on too long, but I just feel as though we have heard this all before. It's followed by a sultry Justin Hayward ballad \\"You can never go home\\" which, again, is the sort of thing we've heard before.  <br /> <br />I suppose the reason I'm being so hard on this album is my bitter disappointment with the last song, \\"My song\\", the only songwriting appearance by Michael Pinder. Pinder's song's are usually something to look forward to, but this song is simply a note for note copy of \\"The voyage/Have you heard\\". I don't know why it strikes me so much, but because it's such a copy of such a mezmerising classic, I can't feel it can only ever be there for teh sake of taking up space. The lyrics are nice, though. But a lot of the material on this album seems all to similar to what they've done before.  <br /> <br />I think by now (1971) they had run out of ideas on the psychedelia theme and with this album they were more or less sticking to the genre as they had nowhere else to go. Their next album was a huge departure and ventured more into singer/songwriter pop and introspective folk. <br /> <br />To sum up, this album is a pleasant listen, but seems uninspiring as it doesn't take you many places that you haven't been before. That said, I hope you enjoy the album - brendan <br />

Well, the extra scenes of the approach of the planet might have been nice, but everything else deserved to not be included. <br /> <br />About the electronic music - if you listen to actual nasa data of space noise, you'll see the movie is both ahead of its day and intellectually superior to anything else since then even 2001!  That is what a space movie is suppose to sound like because that is the sound of outer space!

If you're reading it looking for an in-depth account of drug addiction or the \\"rock n' roll lifestyle\\" put it down and read Anthony Kiedis' Scar Tissue instead, its much more detailed and much better written.  If you're not a fan and looking to become even less of a fan then by all means go ahead and add to you're list of reasons to avoid these guys.
B00005R2IS|3.0|It's not altogether surprising that Mad Max got such short shrift when it came out Stateside with an unfortunate dubbing job to eliminate the `Strine accents so American International could pretend it was an American film (Mel Gibson suffered perhaps a worse indignity with his screen credit moved to last position, just before the lab credit on the trailers). Much of what people remember and love about Max is delivered in the sequel rather than this first outing. Indeed, at times it feels more like a blueprint than a proper movie and Gibson barely registers in the surprisingly little screen time he has - the villains, who all seem to be doing either premature Danny Huston impersonations or somewhat more timely German New Romantic turns make much more of an impression. Not only do huge sections of the film keep him offscreen, but he makes little impact in his underwritten role when he is on. In many ways, this is just a first low-budget draft of Max's world - civilization hasn't entirely crumbled yet and the precious juice is still flowing even if parts are getting hard to find. Still, the car stunts are good, if somewhat thin on the ground, but this is one case where the sequels are definitely better. <br /> <br />MGM/UA's special edition offers reasonable extras, but they are limited by the non-involvement of George Miller and Mel Gibson and the unavailability of any archive footage. The making of featurette and audio commentary from crew members are the best of the bunch while the Gibson featurette tends to be too much of a puff piece. Despite being listed as the Australian trailer, the theatrical trailer and the accompanying TV spots are all from the US release. Thankfully the original Australian soundtrack to the feature is included on this disc.

B000MCH5TK|1.0|I'm sorry but I just don't understand the hype of this movie. It was just plain bad. There were maybe 3 scenes in which grabbed my attention but beyond that I found myself wondering what the point was. Brad Pitt was hardly in the movie so as far as his performance goes, there wasn't enough to consider.This movie falls into the realm of yet another movie that critics fall over that has no meat on the bone (Lost in Translation) & a 90% chance you will be wanting your $30 back. My suggestion...skip this & pick up a copy of the departed.
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|I'm here to do you the favor of reviewing the HD-DVD version of \\"The Departed\\". I'm sure at this point, you already know whether or not you like the movie so let's just skip all of the plot synopsis and back and forth on whether or not this is Scorsese's best film in God knows how long and get to the point of these user reviews.<br /><br />I have to say that the quality of the HD side of the disc (the disc has a regular DVD side, which I didn't bother watching in all honesty) is simply astounding. There was a moment near the beginning of the film during a funeral where I honestly felt that I could put my hand through the screen past the bagpipers in the foreground to touch the people all the way in the far background. The picture is unbelievably clear throughout and not once did I spot any iffy picture issues or anything detrimental to the presentation.<br /><br />Sound mixes come in DD 5.1 and Dolby True HD and to be honest, I couldn't tell the difference. Both mixes are great, if not overly active in the rear speakers. Surrounds kicked in from time to time but being that this isn't an all out action picture, most of the audio activity takes place in the front speakers. Don't worry though, the mix is just right for the film and I didn't feel it was lacking at all.<br /><br />Extras are the same as the DVD edition, with a couple of interesting mini-docs on the Boston Mob, Scorsese's filmmaking influences, deleted/extended scenes and a theatrical trailer. It's not as feature packed as I would've liked (guess I've gotten a bit spoiled over the years) but what's here is enough for the casual viewer.<br /><br />So, bottom line:<br /><br />If you have an HD-DVD player and you liked the film, get this HD-DVD. As it is, there isn't much else to buy for HD-DVD at the moment and this is pretty much a no-brainer.
6304498969|5.0|this comment is a little shout out to K. Tarin \\"2hard2please2bad\\" ... all i have to say is... shut - up. OOoo, mister 300 concerts. wow. i am really impressed. Eric Clapton is amazing, and there is no gettin around that. maybe you dont like his tunes, i'm not sure, but there is no denying his talent. tense? you thought he was tense? no sir...he was singing like there was no one watching! and his solos were awesome (for example -- layla or old love. both great solos). he has excellent guitar skills all around -- original and well played. and his voice is amazing, as well as his lyrics.
B0000683DH|5.0|Now 25 years old, this movie still holds up very well.  I remember how delighted we fans were when we heard that Star Trek was going to be made into a movie.  The first film was mixed for most fans.  We were glad to see the characters on the screen, but the feel of the film was too big and the story was off somehow.  This movie was the second film and everyone cheered because it was a Star Trek story through and through, with even some of the characteristic inconsistencies (Khan remembering Chekov when he wasn't even part of the crew in the TV episode), the just in time miracles, and much more.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban is spectacular as the genetically altered Khan Noonien Singh that Kirk had left on a lush planet fifteen years before.  Kirk is now an admiral who is uncomfortable with old age and leaving his starship, a new crew is being trained to take over the Enterprise, and Chekov is on an expedition on the Reliant with Captain Clark Terrell (well played by Paul Winfield).  Terrell and Chekov set down on a waste planet and discover evidence of Khan's existence on this planet and try to flee, but it is too late.<br /><br />The rest of the film is Khan drawing Kirk into an obsessed confrontation much like Ahab and Moby Dick.  You can pretty much guess that it is just as unlikely to end well for Khan.  It is the path the confrontation takes that is so interesting for Trek fans.  And the famous denouement is either quite moving or an impossible hoot, depending on how seriously you take these stories.  I was moved by the way they played it.  It was the next movie that we all had to swallow hard to believe, but it got us back to where we needed the story to be.<br /><br />Hey, at least they didn't make it a dream or something from an autistic child, right?<br /><br />We watched this with my teenage son last night, and he enjoyed it a great deal, so new generations continue to become fans of this series.  As well they should.
1592402038|5.0|this one really is.  Lynne Truss found a way to have every page of her book about punctuation be really, really fun to read and chock full of witty humor.  If you're like me (someone who gets disproportionately upset and frazzled when I see someone using a \\"your\\" when it should be \\"you're\\", for example), you'll love what's in this book.   <br /> <br />Eats, Shoots & Leaves manages to be very informative and funny at the same time.  Read it and help save punctuation!
B00026WU3M|5.0|I kinda lost track of Bob after the SAVED album came out. I had EVERY album he made prior to SAVED.<br /><br />Then recently after reading \\"Down The Highway\\" by Howard Sounes, I went out and bought OH MERCY and a buncha the later albums. This one was at the bottom of the pile of 5 Dylans that I bought. I decided to play it last night as there was nuthin' much a-happenin....and MAN......I nearly fell out of my computer chair. This was like the OLD Bobby DYLAN from \\"New Morning\\" and that era. It blew my socks off. I've been listening to it continuously now. Lanios got a real good sound going here. Call me crazy, but as far as I'm concerned FIVE STARS.
1400049628|5.0|This book is filled with all the knowledge you'll need to be able to live through a zombie apocalypse.  Some of the information I found a little on the common sense side (maybe it's just me), but nothing in there seemed like bad advice to me.  When the zombies come clawing at your walls, make sure you've read this.  It could save your life.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I just finished watching this movie and was very pleasantly surprised by it.  Its one of those movies that runs along the same rythum as Waiting for Guffman, only with a slightly perverted but highly applicable and straight forward twist.  I would not recommend little girls see it necessarily or small kids.  However, it has a most charming ironic ending, which not only reflects what a pageant really is, but (if these words can be used together) was so awful it was hilarious!  I really liked this movie.  Haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  There was something real and refreshing about it.
1582701709|2.0|Gave this a 2 because it was an interesting read.  This is very basic self-help stuff that is repackaged.  It is also testament to the power of an \\"Oprah endorsement\\" as this material skyrocketed in sales after she gave her supreme \\"blessing\\" recently.    I had a serious concern with a couple of the authors \\"experts\\" who I can only describe as \\"oily\\"... such as the \\"doctor of metaphysics\\" (first name rhythms with 'slow') and the other (another word for back doctor?).    I am amazed at how stuff like this can be repackaged, and the masses suck it up like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  The concept of attraction has been around since eternity and has been espoused by the self-help gurus for decades.  This book is nothing new.  Hats off to the author, though, she will be (probably already is) a very, very rich person!      As an update- check out the upcoming March 5 Newsweek cover story on this book (view now on the Newsweek website).  It supports this review and all the others that point out this book is just regurgitated positive thinking trivia, albiet perfectly marketed as espousing a \\"secret\\" that was just discovered by the author.  Funny, even the author lets us all in on \\"her\\" little secret, she found an old self-help book on the shelf, written in 1910, dusted it off and retooled it with all the technological wizardry of the 21st century, got Oprah to give it not one, but two endorsements (really, to be fair, Oprah endorses the concept of the law of attraction) and PRESTO, you end up with the hottest selling self-help book of the new century.    Oh, and that \\"Doctor of Metaphysics\\" who is HEAVILY relied upon, well, looks like the \\"doctorate degree\\" came in the mail.     Newsweek (and the 2/27 Today show) does a great job in punching holes throughout this \\"self-help\\" book. In fact, it comes pretty close to debunking and exposing this circus barker from down-under.    Just this weekend, I saw a steady stream of lonely hearts approach the Borders saleperson begging for a copy of this sold-out panacea.    I first read about the subconscious mind only hearing the \\"I wants\\" instead of the \\"I don't wants\\" about 40 years ago when I read my dad's copy of Maxwell Maltz's Psycho-Cybernetics.  I fact, compare that classic self-help book with this one and spot all the similarities.  NOTHING NEW HERE!!!!
B00003CXA6|4.0|The pace was a bit slow at times - some judicious editing was needed and not applied.  There was also way too much focus on the two generals who were past friends opposing each other and too little focus on some other key aspects other than Stuart's delay in getting there, the Chamberlain's Maine brigade heroics on Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge.  It is curious that director R. Maxwell's later effort \\"Gods and Generals\\" some 10 years later [about the start of the Civil War to May 1963], is considerably worse.  See my other review on that film.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|This film is not nearly as dark or as good as it could have been, but Nicholas Cage (older Johnny Blaze)and Sam Elliot do a fiar job, along with Peter Fonda as Mestopheles.  This is a builder movie for sequals, and sets up the storyline of Ghost Rider Well.  There are parts that the movie feels a bit choppy and disjointed, but overall, I found this decent to watch, but could have been more.  Worth a matinae ticket, or a rental in the future.
B000002J1S|5.0|Have to say I was quite dissapointed with the original cd release of this album because of poor sound quality-namely tape hiss from the original master tape all the way through.Enter new technology to clean that up without losing any of the high end.Add to that a more pronounced low end with cleaner mids and this thing just sparkles coming out of my speaks.Phil's drums sound as if they are set up right in the living room.With an a-b comparison of the two-the originals are now officially tossed.
B000JCETC4|5.0|You do not have to be a pink floyd fan to pick this album up.  I have had it since the day it was first released, and have continued to enjoy it ever since.  David Gilmour teams up with Rick Wright and has an album of well written and quite memorable songs. Smile is a good slower tune, along with the title track, but my favorite is \\"take a breath\\".  This just has a haunting quality to it.  This album at times sounds like newer pink floyd (division bell, momentary lapse), but by no ways is it meant to be a floyd album, and for the most part, is very distinct in it's own right.  Sure, two of the members of floyd are playing here, but it was not labled floyd for a reason. David Gilmour's previous two solo records were good (especially the self titled one), but this by far tops his previous work.  Pick this up, you will not be dissapointed. <br /> <br />As for the bonus edition with the bonus DVD, it is well worth it.  There is almost 50 minutes of live performance here, all shot with great clarity and sound.  I purchased as second copy of the album to get it, but I would have paid the price for just the dvd.  8 total tracks, 48:30 run time, great collection of songs. Check this out.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of David Lynch but did enjoy \\"Twin Peaks\\" series. This is a most excellent film noir/suspense thriller with an outstanding cast. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring as the two leads really help drive this film. The creepy obsessiveness and erotic passion help us understand the bond between \\"Betty\\" and \\"Rita\\". The lesbian scene was incredibly erotic and sensual which is tough to accomplish. Lynch really shows what a great director he is in that scene. It does not cheapen the film, but is essential to understanding the two lead characters. Some directors throw in lesbian scenes just for the cheap thril of watching two girls kiss. Harring finally gets to demonstrate what a terrific actress she can be with the right script & director. Just so I do not giveaway the plot like some other reviewers, there are plenty of interesting side characters and twists & turns to keep you entranced and guessing. Who? What? Where? In the end, you may still be guessing...
B000ELJBAK|5.0|This is Gilmours first solo album release in 1978, and still seems fresh today.  This is probably my favorite of his solo albums, close second being On an Island.  This features tracks such as Mihalis and So Far Away, two of my more favorite songs, but this album is just good from start to finish.  It is very pink floydish for that era (animals/WYWH/the wall times, but strong without the Floyd name on it.  Check this out, you will like it.
B0007TKNII|4.0|Though not my favorite musical of all time I did get to see it twice on stage. Once on Broadway when it opened and the second time when the Broadway show was first taken on tour. Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote this as a stage musical that just happens to be set in an opera house. It is not, and never was, meant to be classified as an opera. <br /> <br />He wrote this musical with the thought of his then wife Sarah Brightman in mind. And it is one of the reason she is brilliant on stage as Christine. It is regretful that the movie took so long to arrange production that they could not keep the original cast. It was truly our loss. Yet there was a pleasent suprise in the casting of Emmy Rossum as Christine Daae. And Patrick Wilson did well as Raoul. <br /> <br />This movie does a very good job of translating from stage to screen. Some of the score has been changed, and there was no reason for it. And because he could, the director added some background that is contrary to the story and some scenes that take way from the mystery. But the movie is still worth owning if you like Broadway musicals. And even though I am not giving it five stars, most will want to see it more then once. <br /> <br />The premise of the movie is that the Phantom lives beneath the Paris Opera and terrorizes those who work there. And he demands that Christine is the star of their productions. But when she turns her back on the phantom's advances and her lover Raoul starts to interfere, the Phantom does all he can to take his perceived need for revenge and to try and capture the love of Christine. This is truly a story of a fateful love triangle. Most of the music is haunting and memorable. <br />
B000ELJBAA|5.0|This was released shortly during the hiatus Pink Floyd took in the 80's after Roger Waters departed.  This is the weakest of the three solo albums by Gilmour, and is a bit dated.  It has that 80's synth thing going on a couple of the tracks, but overall, clever and original tunes, very worth while picking up.  Favorite tracks include Murder and Let's Get Metaphysical.  all of the others are good in their own part.  Recommend picking this up and adding to your collection, whether a Floyd Fan or not.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Why do they do it? For money, of course. People have to remember that most scientists make their living from government and private grants. Global warming is hot right now so it's easy to get funding to study it. Disaster books sell well too, so there is little incentive in telling the dull truth that the earth's climate is cyclical with natural warm-ups and cool-downs occurring every few hundred years. <br /> <br />And of course the Left loves Global Warming because, being crazed anti-big business environmentalist; they can use it to thwart construction of new oil-refineries, pipelines, power plants, factories, and industry of all kinds. As added bonus they hope to scare people out of their cars and onto the mass-transit systems they so love. The C. Smokers; let them ride busses and subways if they want, just leave me the heck alone. Anyone think Al Gore, or any of these limousine liberals, ride anywhere by mass transit? I doubt it; it's just that the hypocrites want all the little people to do it.

This is a great instrumental track, very pleased with it.  Again, pick this up, you will like it.
B00000G3PL|2.0|The Lethal Weapon movies may have been appealing to action fans many years ago, but honestly, look at them.  Do you think they aged well?  I don't.  They are SO cheesy that it makes my head hurt watching them.  They are sort of overrated too.  Even back in the day they were overrated. <br /> <br />Well, if you like action films, this may or may not be worth investing.
B000J103PC|2.0|The problem I had with this film was that the plot was sadly lacking in terms of a story. <br /> <br />Meryl Streep was as beautiful as ever and she played her character perfectly. <br /> <br />The problem was that I was able to figure the whole plot out after maybe 30 minutes of the film and I didn't like that.  I knew what Andy would do, I knew what Miranda would do, and I knew where everyone was going to end up. <br /> <br />I would have liked a bit of substance to the story - some twists that would really shock the audience.  The plot as it was is really cut and dried. <br /> <br />Some ideas I came up with were - Emily really committing suicide because she had deeper problems and the trip was the last straw in a long line of disappointments? <br /> <br />Andy becoming just like Miranda and us seeing her in 10 years being the boss of the magazine and having no memory of who she used to be? <br /> <br />You get the idea - I had several more ideas on how the plot could go.  I'm sure that Meryl Streep could have handled any twists beautifully. <br /> <br />I gave this movie a bad rating because the story was so predictable and didn't have much of a point to it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002P2V|5.0|I'm tired of people accusing me of being a mindless hardcore Who fan just because I happen to think Who Are You? is a great album.  People have also accused me of not getting the Who, as well.  All because I think they can be better than \\"loud guitars and drums all the time\\".  The Who can be a great band because of emotional vocal work, which is what makes Who Are You? such a strong album.    Why is it so easy for people to ignore the great vocal melodies and wonderful vocal work *just* because the album contains synths?  The synths don't even appear that often.  I admit, once they appear, the music becomes soft and gentle, but honestly, pay attention to the vocal melodies.  Every song includes a fantastic one.  This is what makes Who Are You? such an incredibly good listen.  It's supposed to be a melody-driven album.  \\"905\\", \\"new song\\" and the title song feature melodies that just reach out and get your attention.    The bonus tracks are pretty good, though not the main attraction.  An extra version of \\"guitar and pen\\" is probably pointless.  The Who were such a great band, and they continue to impress me with this consistently enjoyable album.  It may not rock your socks, but it certainly rocks your melody socks, or something like that.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I saw this movie last year when it came out.   First I had my reservations on a new Bond movie since they've been using the same cookie cutter formula from the beginning.   But when I saw it in the theater, right from the very first scene, I realized it wasn't the same old Bond.  Daniel Craig to me is the best Bond since Sean Connery but without those who carried the Bond over the years would never leave us with this masterpiece. I can't wait to get my copy.
B00005214X|5.0|It doesn't surprise me that over 300 people have reviewed this album so far and the overall rating is a perfect 5 stars.  When some of the most emotional and beautiful-sounding vocal work combine with a spiritual atmosphere which comes together on a rock and pop album, you have yourself a really great album. <br /> <br />When some of the best-sounding guitar work and a consistent flow are also included, then this is probably the best album ever made.  George Harrison was so underrated, and here's your proof.  Absolutely own this wonderful 2-disc collection of great tracks.  You won't ever need to hit the skip button.  Every track takes you on a journey.
B000M341QE|3.0|The only reason this film was nominated for an Oscar is because of the Scorcese name and the cast of actors. I think we all have figured out by now that the motion picture academy is like the popular group we all knew in high school. They'll only let a few select individuals in their little clique. As a result, we get the same directors and actors being wrongfully praised as being the top of their fields when they aren't deserving of it. \\"The Departed\\" is no exception. Let me start off by saying that I was entertained. I liked the movie, but its ORDINARY.<br /><br />This is not an instant classic. It's not a brilliant work of art. Its generic. This is just like every other mobster movie ever made. They try to throw in several twists in the end but it only achieved making the film seem even more pointless. You walk away from the movie learning absolutely nothing. Scorcese didn't cover any new ground. I honestly think Hollywood has forgotten how to make riveting movies. I will note that I thought Leo Dicaprio's performance was really good. He took a mediocre script and did his best to still pull off an amazing performance on his part. Now, Jack Nicholson on the other hand was just plain Jack Nicholson! He acts the same in every movie he's done the past 20 years. If you enjoy hearing vulgar language every other sentence and endless violence with a stale plot, then this is the film for you...otherwise dont go into this thinking you're going to see the best movie ever made.
0812565886|2.0|Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award.  Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.  Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums.
6305949980|5.0|you could serve this movie headless and on a silver platter,  and I will still give it a five.    in fact, it would probably be even funnier that way.

B000KCHZK6|4.0|Even though her producing mentor Arif Mardin passed away last year, Norah Jones does not veer off the pervasively melancholic sound of her first two albums with her third album. The difference is that Jones composed all the songs this time and left the producing responsibilities entirely to her boyfriend, songwriter and bassist Lee Alexander. Still reflecting her unprepossessing manner and pleasingly low-key vocal style, she manages the neat trick of making her music sound familiar yet fresh enough with an effort that shows a somewhat deeper introspection and in \\"My Dear Country\\", a subtly raised frustration with the current administration. If there is any aural change directionally from her previous efforts, it may be that her sensibilities seem to be moving her more decidedly into country and blues.<br /><br />With its twangy sound punctuated by Alexander's lap steel, \\"Wake Me Up\\" is a nice, loping track. The two-stepping \\"Little Room\\" is equally relaxing with Daru Oda whistling the happy-sounding bridge, and perhaps the disc's most enjoyable song is the Kurt Weill-like \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" with Kevin Breit's assertive mandolin strumming and J. Walter Hawkes' wah-wah trombone leading Jones down a comfortably bluesy road. Her pop-jazz-infused chops are not ignored for too long as evidenced by the lovely, forlorn opener about love during wartime, \\"Wish I Could\\"; and the nimble fretwork on \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" with echoes of Pat Matheny on the open road.<br /><br />Jones gets near-virulent with the emotional nakedness of \\"Not My Friend\\", and she even picks up the pace with the help of a Wurlitzer and Larry Goldings' Hammond B-3 organ on \\"Be My Somebody\\". Not all the tracks show her off in the best light, for example, the Memphis-style \\"Thinking About You\\" lacks any real bite and suffers for its overly repetitive chorus, and the dirge-like \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" feels too much like a long-lost Linda Ronstadt ballad from the mid-70's. Finding its appropriate place at the end of the recording, the title track epitomizes Jones' emotional preciseness with the song's haunting last-call sound. It's a mostly worthwhile effort from a recording artist who never sounds overly compromised.e end of the recording, the title track epitomizes Jones' emotional preciseness with the song's haunting last-call sound.

B000LC55F2|5.0|I saw the first half of this at school twice, and that was enough to get me to buy it.  The end....well, that's an entirely different story!  What a way to wrap up such a fantastic film!  The Prestige does what a lot of two-hour films try to do: it keeps you entertained!  This one will be in my collection for a long time......I love it.<br /><br />Easily one of my top three for '06.
B0000009SM|5.0|This album is the culmination of Zappa's work of the 70's. Its predecessors: \\"Over-Nite Sensation\\" and \\"Apostrophe\\" were fabulous, but had not matured to the degree of excellence as this album did. Zappa assembled a group of veteran musicians.  The refined and consumed madness of its jazz-rock sound makes this album a monumental treasure.  \\"Inca Roads\\" transports us in Zappa's Jazz oriented mind where the lyrics and the drum-beats share the same tight-rope, then its guitar solo confirmed that once again Zappa was not only a superb musician, but he was also full of surprises and charms. The four songs: \\"Po-Jama People,\\" \\"Florentine Pogen,\\" \\"San Ber'dino,\\" and \\"Andy\\" prove how Zappa was such a sarcastic and iconoclastic son-of-a-gun.  Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson's vocal contribution in two songs makes this album even more special.  In closing, \\"One Size Fits All\\" may also be described as Zappa's signature: \\"Music is the Best.\\"
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I only saw a few episodes of West Wing when it was on TV but liked the show a lot.  When I got it for Christmas this year (2006) I was delighted. However, I had no idea how much I would love the show after seeing it in sequence.  The biggest surprise was how much my husband loves the show.  He didn't care much for it when he saw one of episodes before.  Seeing the characters develop is so interesting.  We are so hooked!!  Worth the price!  Beautiful box and folders makes it a great presentation.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|You know, it's almost impossible to not address this as a Christian work - but don't jump down my throat until you read the next paragraph:<br /><br />I truly feel like an IDIOT because I let my Agnosticism keep me from purchasing any of Neal's Christian albums. Truthfully, that was absolutely THE DUMBEST REASON ON EARTH not to buy this. (And I not only bought this disc, I bought \\"?\\" and \\"One,\\" which I also love.)<br /><br />As a fan of Neal-era Spock's Beard, and Transatlantic, I should have gotten this MUCH sooner than I did.  If one is to look at religion as an intellectual topic rather than a spiritual one, then you really should have no problem with this album. Consider also that Mr. Portnoy is Jewish, and apparently could put his own religious beliefs aside to play on Neal's Christian works. So, really, if he can get over it, why can't you?<br /><br />Now that we've gotten that out of the way ... this is perhaps Neal's masterwork, and one that should be in any progressive rock fan's library. This isn't too far off of the Spock's Beard path, nor the Transatlantic path - it's just more epic in scope. The orchestrations and arrangements are nothing short of brilliant. Neal's sense of melody and thematic development have always been what drew me to all of his work - that, and the amount of sonic diversity that you get, both within an album as a whole, and very often within the context of a single track. If this is what you like about Neal's work, then you will not be disappointed in the least. The playing here is top notch as well - when have you heard Mike Portnoy not turn in a jaw dropping performance on the drums? - and lyrically, I don't suppose you can get much more personal than this; Whether or not you care about Jesus or God or any of that, this is Neal's story. And if you respect the man and his work, you can put your personal hangups aside to listen to him.<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't get over mine sooner. And while this album has not affected my views on Christianity, it certainly made me consider the amount of cynicism and hypocrisy in my life had reached ridiculous levels when I let something like religious beliefs (or lack thereof) get in the way of listening to something that is so compositionally brilliant and truly a work of genius., it certainly made me consider the amount of cynicism and hypocrisy in my life had reached ridiculous levels when I let something like religious beliefs (or lack thereof) get in the way of listening to something that is so compositionally brilliant and truly a work of genius.
1592401791|5.0|Great insight into the Beatles creative process and the studio tricks used to pull off the impossible. An easy read that you won't be able to put down. I found myself looking forward to the next chapter and then wishing it wouldn't end. Here's hoping that the other EMI engineers will put pen to paper and give us more of this!! Yeah Geoff, great job!! (I have also seen a UFO!)

B000F4RHB6|3.0|This remind me of a K-Tel Compact disc. Where they cut most of the songs.It is sad to see this on the disc. The remixes of the following.The Heart Of Rock n' Roll, I Want A New Drug, Power Of Loce, Jacob Ladder are terrible remixes by probably a amateur producer with no ear for music. I would recomend that you buy Time Files instead if you can get a used copy. The reason that I keep  it I'm along time fan of Huey and the News and from the North Bay like Mr. Lewis
B0009S8H0I|2.0|Wow... talk about where the state of music is going. Just saw them on Saturday Night Live and checked out some of their tracks. How did they ever land that gig? Oh yeah, SNL has been tanking for some 20 years now and the only thing more amazing is how Lorne Michaels has kept his job. But I digress. At the end of a bizarre, boring, overly self-justifying song the lead singer smashes his guitar into small pieces on stage. Ho-hum. Already been done and if your 6 chord endlessly repeated melody can be modified ever so slightly by adding yet another absurd texture from your big band, then it's beyond me to say how. The opening church organ sounded interesting but the only funeral going on here is for this band. Backing vocals all off pitch, music going nowhere. Check it out before you buy.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I'd be lying if I said I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  Don't get me wrong, it looked interesting and the cast is great.  But, I'm always wary about period pieces.  Well, I sat down and watched this film and was impressed...very impressed.<br /><br />Certainly I was right about the cast.  How could you go wrong with Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, and the gorgeous Jessica Biel?  All three do an excellent job in their roles.  Biel does an exceptional job as a Duchess that would rather be with a magician than a prince.  I really felt for her as well as the other two main characters.<br /><br />The story line is excellent and very entertaining.  The special effects, although subdued, are great.  I was drawn in from the first frame.  Norton's Illusionist performs some absolutely superb magic that had me wondering if it truly was magic.<br /><br />A great film with a superb cast.  Whether you're into magic and period pieces or not, this is a very entertaining film that I highly recommend.

A Perfect Circle should be example enough for M.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|This is a visceral movie. It's one of those flicks that you spend all your time remarking on how great all of the actors were. And they are. This is a fine display of acting, but that's simply all there is. The plot itself is secondary. Babel is less about telling a story and more about showing you how people react to a situation. Basicly, you are watching to see how oscarworthy the actors are. That's the only attention grabbing thing about the movie.  <br />    Babel's plot is silly and undercooked. Some of the associations between the characters, namely the Japanese, are loose. However, I did find the storyline about the Japanese girl to be the most intriguing and complete. However, her character had NO direct contact with the central plot/characters. The connection was her father. And his character was virtually nonexistent. <br />     Overall, Bable is a good film. A slow film. An incomplete film. The dirctor's point was an excellent one. My only real problem with it is that he abandoned it for the sake of letting the actor's demostrate their chops.
B000006NUW|4.0|HITSVILLE USA is a box set that's clearly marked as a SINGLES COLLECTION-- that means these 104 tracks are in the original monaural sound. If you're looking for stereo mixes, this isn't the collection for you. That issue aside, the only real criticism of the album is one of programming-- songs tend to be clustered by artist or group. Perhaps a more thorough shuffle was in order.<br /><br />Each CD jewel case is fronted with a repro of a Gordy Co. label, including one of the very first MOTOWNs, which was pale pink in color. The accompanying 68-page long box book is quite comprehensive. Recording dates for all songs and chart positions are given. There's lots of great photos; artists and groups are given a few pages of bio each. This HITSVILLE USA four-CD box set is fairly extensive, and about all you'd ever need in a compilation of MOTOWN 45s.<br /><br />TOTAL RUNNING TIMES --<br /><br />DISC ONE -- 76:10<br /><br />DISC TWO -- 75:21<br /><br />DISC THREE -- 77:09<br /><br />DISC FOUR -- 74:10

B000GALEOU|4.0|This version of Chick Corea's popular classic comes is a well-designed mini-lp replica sleeve version which includes the lyrics to the two vocal tracks as well.  The sound quality is alright but not great as it hasn't been remastered but this doesn't detract too much from the overall enjoyment of this album which seems to predict the rise of smooth jazz and the kind of keyboard-oriented jazz as popularised by Bob James.  Great work by a collection of great musicians make this a very enjoyable listen for all jazz-lovers.

B00005Q79B|4.0|In a mostly terrible 3rd season of stops and starts but of mostly the former, it's refreshing to get a mini-revival for at least two episodes before the very end.  A combination of low budgeting and poor ratings due to a poor time slot gave the production team very little to work with and it shows here in this volume especially in the first episode with \\"The Lights of Zetar\\".  The \\"possession\\" scenes with the lights over the faces of both the first female victim and Lt. Romaine represent special effects scenes so poor that they were almost humorous instead of the horror which was the intended effect.  Still, this average episode ranks among the better ones of the 3rd season.<br /><br />In the second episode \\"The Cloud Minders\\", we get one of the best episodes of all Classic Trekdom.  We get a very good overall episode which is a fable and satire about discrimination.  The scriptwriting on this volume has improved dramatically from previous volumes and the acting as well making this episode to be overall a worthy addition to Classic Trekdom lore.<br /><br />If you are looking for one of the better volumes of Season 3, this one falls under the \\"must have\\" category.<br /><br />Recommended.

B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is a movie Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins and Memento) and stars Hugh Jackman (X-men, the Fountain) and Christian Bale (Batman Begins, American Psycho).  As story begins the two men are partners as well as rival up starts working for another magician.  You quickly see that they approach the craft differently and cause friction in how to execute the tricks properly.  Each trick has three parts the pledge, the turn and the most important, the Prestige.<br /><br />Alfred Borden (Bale) is a young prodigy and is a natural magician but lacks the flare of showmanship, what his rival, Angier (Jackman) excels in greatly.  Each man has a different approach and philosophy about magic but both share the obsession of being the best. Jackman knows he's a better showman but Borden supposedly has a brilliant show stopping trick that has never been done that he's not yet ready to revel.<br /><br />The two men first meet while both working for a magician's assistant, played by Michael Cain. Cain's character \\"Cutter\\" knows the talent of these two men and tried to coach them on the finer aspects of being a magician.  After a horrific accident on stage the two men became more than just rivals but mortal enemies.  Angier blamed Borden for the disaster and the two men go back and forth trying to not only \\"one up\\" the other but to sabotage the other mans life and career.<br /><br />Nolan weaves a sophisticated story that keeps you on on the edge of your proverbial seat and like a magic trick; He gets you with \\"slide of hand\\" and leaves you wondering how you missed it.  The entire movie is like a magic trick, you begin with the pledge and then the turn and in the finally... the Prestige!<br /><br /> One of the smartest things in the entire movie is the practical approach to showing how the tricks are performed and the idea that the trick is almost always much more simple than one would think.  The real trick is to be totally commented to the craft and to never give up the trick, the method is everything.<br /><br /> Nolan does again, a remarkable job with humanizing the characters evolved and shows how much they are willing to risk for there obsessions.  These two men grapple with love gained, lost and thrown away in many ways in this film.  The subject of true sacrifice is shown in these two bitter rivals as each man looks to push his own ethics and morality to it's limits.  It's never about money, women or even fame for these two; it's not even discussed as a goal.  Each man is obsessed with knowing he is better than the other, and will stop at nothing till he has the superior trick that leaves not only the audience scratching their heads but his rival as well.  Even if it means he will lose everything to get the satisfaction.<br /><br />In my opinion, one of the best movies of 2006 and even thou nominated for two Oscars, was over looked by most movie goes and critics.  The acting in the Prestige is brilliant without being too bold.  The two main characters are supported by some great performances by Scarlet Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo, Andy Sirkis and David Bowie as the scientist Tesla.<br /><br />The mark of any great movie is how many times it takes you to watch it and catch something new and at the same time be entertained.  This movie has these traits in spades.  This movie solidifies for me the genius that is Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who wrote the screenplay). First was Following, Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and now the Prestige, Mr. Nolan is batting a 1.000 in my book.  A master storyteller and knows exactly how much to show and when to show it.  Maybe if Christopher Nolan was born in the late 1800's he would have been a magician.<br /><br />This movie is the newest addition to my top 100 movies and my favorite movie of 2006to never give up the trick, the method is everything. <br /> <br /> Nolan does again, a remarkable job with humanizing the characters evolved and shows how much they are willing to risk for there obsessions.

1878424319|5.0|I HATE self help books. I am a nurse and well educated, and while I agree we can all use help from time to time, I think most of those self help books are either sappy or just a way for the author to sound brilliant and to make money. <br />THIS book is tiny and takes no time to read at all----it you don't pause to THINK.  <br />I read it over and over. What a brilliant view of life and how we got where we are and how to get RID of the stuff that is cluttering  up the whole world.  <br />I immediately bought three more copies and sent them out to people I care deeply about. Have recommended the book to anyone who will listen. <br />GET IT <br />READ IT <br />It WILL change you. <br />I felt like a weight had been lifted off me that I must have been carrying around for YEARS------and never needed to in the first place. <br /> <br />Our Native American traditional culture is a wonderful thing and for years I have been \\"into\\" that way of thinking and living, but I had never read anything Toltec------am most familiar with Lakota and Northern Cheyenne old ways. Now I will have to look into the Toltec ways as this book I can truly use the word \\"enlightening\\" for.   <br />
0375757856|3.0|Almost everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, whereas his predecessor Wilkie Collins has been relegated to footnote status.  However writers in the \\"golden age\\" of detective mysteries, especially Dorothy Sayers, were very aware of Collins and his influence.<br /><br />The Moonstone uses a clever device whereby the narrative is passed from hand to hand to tell the story of the massive yellow diamond called the Moonstone.  Ill-gotten spoils from colonial India, the Moonstone vanished for a generation until it was bequeathed as an 18th-birthday gift to Rachel Verinder.  The engaging characters who tell the story of the mysterious disappearance of the Moonstone on Miss Verinder's birthday, each with his or her unique background and perspective, kept me following the story until the end.  Collins also depicts the setting in rural England of Rachel Verinder's home town very effectively and without romanticizing.  Unexpectedly, the famous detective plays a minor and reluctant role.  In the end, I found the actual method of commiting the crime to be a bit unbelievable, but because I enjoyed the storytelling so much this was a minor quibble.
B000IFQLSW|4.0|For me, although I like almost every kind of music---I said ALMOST----it all begins and ends with the blues. <br />I loved Kenny Wayne on his first album because it had the grit and passion----real blues leaves you holding your breath. <br />Although this latest is very good, it didn't knock me out. But he did the right thing to get back out there and get in touch with those feelings again.  <br />I missed his amazing guitar work on this this CD-----otherwise it was worth the price, and the booklet is an excellent piece of work.

B000H7JD4A|5.0|When I first heard this album, I didn't like it very much.  Of course, the very first Iron Maiden album I ever heard was \\"Somewhere in Time\\", and I didn't like that either.  Over time, as I went back and listened to earlier albums and as time went on, they've become one of my favorite bands.   <br /> <br />With each listen, more of the nuances in this album come out, a better appreciation for how the music and lyrics fit together develops, and then I can't take if off my MP3 player or out of my truck CD player.  If I could compare this album to a previous release, I would say it's \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" quality in the 'epicness' of the songs, and \\"Somewhere in Time\\" with the sound.   <br /> <br />For those who dis Bruce on this album...he's not going to hit the high notes again like he once did and \\"Killers\\" is not going to reinvent itself.  People with small musical brains want their favorite band to stay the same over the ages, and that's sad.  If you've been a fan and have an appreciation for how they've developed, then definitely find this and get a copy.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|In my opinion, it was a long movie with alot of famous actors and a weak plot. <br /> <br />Think about it, if anyone else but Scorsese were to make this film, would it really be receiving all the hype? <br /> <br />In my opinion, this film just never really got going.  Maybe it needed a Deniro-type actor to fill the main role, who knows.  I mean if you think about this movie, it's Gangs of New York (sorta) mixed with Goodfellas (sorta). <br />The rest deals with the plot so don't read on if you intend to see the movie. <br /> <br />Basically, the plot is that there are two rats...one from the police and one from the organized crime led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  But this doesn't really come into play until near the end of the film as the first 2/3rds of the film deal with the relationships among the main characters.   <br />There's the romantic aspect which never really goes anywhere and could have really been cut out and the film would have lost nothing.   <br />After nearly two hours, there is a shootout at a storage place but there's no build up to it; it just occurs.   <br />The last 20-30 minutes, really hold all of the \\"action\\" in that everyone is killed in the last 20-30 minutes.  And unlike Goodfellas or Casino, there is no anti-climax...it just ends.   <br />After watching the film, you're left wondering...why?  What was the point of all that?   <br /> <br />In my opinion, alot more could have been done with this storyline.  It's a film worth seeing, but it's not one you'll watch over and over like Casino, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver or any other better films by Scorsese.
B00008HCCF|5.0|I must say I had to hesitate buying the DVD after reading how \\"scared\\" she looked.  How loud the drums were. How poor the sound mix was.  How Norah needs to take lessons on how to be a star front person.  The musicians don't improvise.. blah blah. <br /> <br />It sounds like your sitting in the House of Blues. I appreciate the DVD quality, both visual and sound.  Could the drums be mixed a little lower?  Yes, but come on team, it works for the setting.   <br /> <br />I wasn't a huge Norah fan, but am more appreciative of her after buying the DVD.  Love her voice, and a sweet personality displayed. If I were 15 years younger...  I will be purchasing the latest release as well!

B000A0GXGA|5.0|I bought the Warner Bro's Cheyenne-TV Favorites release when it came out last year, and really enjoyed it.Several months later Warner released the first season of Cheyenne on dvd(which I promptly bought).   This lead me to believe that the \\"TV Favorites\\" was Warner's way of seeing(or garnering,if you pardon the pun) if there was enough interest to release a first season of a classic tv show.   I don't know what the number are/were but I'm still waiting for \\"Maverick\\" Season One.   Maverick was a late 1950's western which starred James Garner and Jack Kelly and was really a well written,well acted series with a good cast(as well as good guest stars).   This dvd has three episodes(Shady Deal at Sunny Acres,Pappy, and Gun-Shy), which I enjoyed(especially the Gun-Shy episode which is a spoof of Gunsmoke).   If your a fan of westerns,James Garner or (James Garner westerns),I think That you'll enjoy this dvd.

B000K7VHQE|1.0|While I was watching this movie, my only question was \\"When will this thing be over?\\"  I found it lame, boring and very reminiscent of another movie which I found equally boring and lame: American Beauty.  I will never understand why Hollywood is so fascinated with movies about dysfunctional families.  If you liked American Beauty, you'll love Little Miss Sunshine.  However, if you detested American Beauty, as I did, you will detest this movie as well.  The characters were dull and uninteresting, as was the plot (if you can call it that).  I have no idea why Alan Arkin was nominated (let alone won) for this mess.  It must have been a sentimental vote.  His part as the grandpa was small and of no consequence.  Steve Carell, with his hang-dog face and manner, annoyed me the most playing the suicidal brother-in-law.  As far as I'm concerned, this movie was a waste of money to make and to go and see.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|great movie if you love that quirky family who's trying to keep it together thing.  the characters are great - each one is wonderful in their own, different way.  it was so hyped up that i was a little disappointed the first time i watched it - i'm not sure what i was expecting, but i didn't get it the first time.  still, very good, realistic, somewhat satirical movie.
B000005RQT|5.0|The album, \\"In Rock\\", by Deep Purple, was a milestone in early progressive rock history; a gem showcasing British hard rock at its best and an example of this particular genre that was strongly influenced by classical music.  It was the first studio album by a new line-up of the band that attained great success commercially, producing four(4) solid studio albums while touring the world almost nonstop.  The new members of the band were Ian Gillan on vocals and Roger Glover on bass, and what a difference their addition made to the sound of the band.  Just take a listen to the song, \\"Child In Time\\", a timeless masterpiece of more than ten minutes in length.<br /><br />Just prior to releasing the album, \\"In Rock\\", the first studio album for this renown line-up of the band, Deep Purple recorded a unique presentation of their work with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  The work was performed (and recorded for later album release) in September of 1969.  Entitled, \\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\\", the work reflected the band's strong initial ties to classical music, and it was a wonderful foretaste of things to come.  It certainly drew attention to the band.  With the presentation of its first work together as a band at a prestigious venue, namely, The Royal Albert Hall in London, Deep Purple began to forge something new and worthwhile in progressive rock, a path that blended the unique talents of its members, all of whom were accomplished musicians.  Specifically, the band's music was highlighted, and driven, by organist Jon Lord; by the guitar of a true guitar virtuoso in Richie Blackmore; and now, by the strong vocals of a new member of the band, Ian Gillan, who oftentimes wailed and screamed to complement effectively the sheer volume of the music that his bandmates produced.  After all, these were the wonderful beginnings of hard rock in all of its glory!  Nevertheless, and astonishingly as it may seem, the band was not alone on this particular path in rock music history.  Other bands were likewise breaking new ground in 1969 in the progressive rock music field just ahead of the release of Deep Purple's album, \\"In Rock.\\"  The Moody Blues were already well-established; King Crimson's initial line-up of that year would become a short-lived new-comer; and Yes, having had just released its second album, was still going through personnel changes.  Led Zeppelin, although not a part of the progressive rock music scene, was nevertheless establishing its name in hard rock in 1969, but the band was coming from a different direction musically, drawing its inspiration from the blues.<br /><br />Another prominent band at that time in the progressive rock music field, The Moody Blues, also had an opportunity to record their music with an orchestra, specifically, The London Festival Orchestra.  The renown line-up of the band with Justin Hayward and John Lodge recorded their initial album, \\"Days of Future Past\\", with the aforementioned orchestra in 1967.  However, the band decided to play all of the instruments themselves for their second effort, namely, the album, \\"In Search of a Lost Chord.\\"  Here, The Moody Blues played thirty-three different instruments, including the mellotron.  This relatively new instrument duplicated, to some degree, the wonderful sounds of an entire philharmonic orchestra.  Taking the mellotron into the studio, and afterwards, on the road, on the concert circuit, meant that the band was able to trailblaze, at its own pace, free from being dependent upon a philharmonic orchestra, its unique sound in progressive rock music.  As a result, by 1969, The Moody Blues had already established themselves as innovative musicians in the progressive rock music field and more, with the release of each new album, The Moody Blues continued to broaden their horizons musically and add to their ever-growing fan base.  Unsurprisingly, The Moody Blues broke new ground in 1969 with the release of two phenomenal albums, namely, \\"On The Threshhold of a Dream\\" and \\"To Our Children's Children.\\"  Both of these albums are worth a listen.  Significantly, the popularity of these two albums marked a broadening acceptance in 1969 of progressive rock music, and in regards to The Moody Blues, the mellotron became an integral part of their music.  Nonetheless, the stage was set for the following year when the well-known line-up of The Moody Blues would release their fifth album, \\"A Question of Balance\\", continuing their strong ties with classical music, and Deep Purple would release their gem, \\"In Rock.\\"<br /><br />It is important to note here that Deep Purple followed a slightly different path from the one taken by The Moody Blues.  While The Moody Blues preferred softer sounds and vocals that produced memorable ballads and love songs, and at times, the band even added passages of read poetry on their albums, Deep Purple followed the direction of ever-louder music, levels that prompted its singer, Ian Gillan, at times, to wail and scream!  While Deep Purple headed towards the branch of progressive rock music that would eventually be labeled as \\"hard rock\\", The Moody Blues embraced an entirely different vision.  The band set the controls for their somewhat mystical journey pointed towards the heavens.  On this preset course, The Moody Blues, that is, their music and their lyrics, actually became, at times, heaven-bound, especially when their music was surrounded by, enriched with, and propelled by, the outworldly sounds of the mellotron.<br /><br />King Crimson was another band that, at that time, was forging new paths in progressive rock music.  King Crimson made its public debut in the summer of 1969 at a free concert in London's Hyde Park with the Rolling Stones, and soon thereafter, the band released its five-song masterpiece, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\"  The album quickly became a true phenomenon, influencing many musicians at that time.  Like The Moody Blues, King Crimson used the mellotron; like Deep Purple, the band had a true guitar virtuoso in Robert Fripp; and like the individual members of The Moody Blues, King Crimson employed the services of a multi-instrumentalist in Ian McDonald.  Like The Moody Blues and Deep Purple, King Crimson was strongly influenced by classical music, but the band's music also reflected its ties to jazz and folk music.  Like The Moody Blues, King Crimson placed considerable weight on the lyrics of its songs, employing the noted lyricist, Peter Sinfield.  However, this initial (and stellar) line-up of the band was to become short-lived, and as a result, it unfortunately only created this one well-received album.<br /><br />During this period of time, another band was likewise beginning its journey on a path that, with the passage of time, would prove to be extraordinarily successful.  The band was Led Zeppelin.  Like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin's music was oftentimes loud, hence the label, \\"hard rock\\", but unlike Deep Purple and other progressive rock bands at that time, Led Zeppelin's music was based on the blues and, to some extent, on British folk music.  As a result, Led Zeppelin followed a slightly different path within the hard rock genre than Deep Purple, but its music had such an ever-growing appeal that its popularity influenced many bands both, established and those bands that were just starting out.  Like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin had a true guitar virtuoso in Jimmy Page who, in the early years of the band, played his electric guitar with a violin bow as a novelty and also to produce special effects.  Much like the supergroup, Cream, that preceded them, Led Zeppelin continued to electrify the blues and while the band was reformulating this process, it began to establish its own style, a style that, along with the band, Black Sabbath, and several other bands at that time, began to mold yet another branch of rock called, \\"heavy metal.\\"  Led Zeppelin released its initial album, \\"Led Zeppelin\\", in January of 1969, and its second album, \\"Led Zeppelin II\\", later in the year.  Both of these albums profoundly changed the rock music landscape forever that year.ue guitar virtuoso in Robert Fripp; and like the individual members of The Moody Blues, King Crimson employed the services of a multi-instrumentalist in Ian McDonald.

Much like the supergroup, Cream, that preceded them, Led Zeppelin continued to electrify the blues and while the band was reformulating this process, it began to establish its own style, a style that, along with the band, Black Sabbath, and several other bands at that time, began to mold yet another branch of rock called, \\"heavy metal.\\"  Led Zeppelin released its initial album, \\"Led Zeppelin\\", in January of 1969, and its second album, \\"Led Zeppelin II\\", later in the year.  Both of these albums profoundly changed the rock music landscape forever that year.
B000BT97AO|3.0|I liked this movie for the obvious special effects and the wierdness about it. It really didn't have a story that made much sense or you could follow very close. At times, you didn't know if the girl was in a dream or was she in reality. Yes, she was stressed about her mother undergoing a major surgery and she didn't like working in the circus, but at least have a \\"line of thought\\" about a story when the film was being written. The one thing that this movie did follow very closely was the \\"Alice in Wonderland effect\\". She did step into an alternate reality which did have struggles of it's own.
1400079179|3.0|This book is... ok. if you have nothing else to read. Basically, it has a lot of exciting events one after another, no in-between-get-to-know-the-charater-time, just a lot of things happening at once. The writing is definitely not up to par, and there are absolutly many other other books that get scoffed at that have better plots and are better written. I gave this book three stars though because basically, this book could be good if it didn't seem like they just decided to publish the rough-draft.

B000BB1MI2|4.0|Well, everybody kept telling me this movie was terrible and so much worse than the original. I, personally, will accept both as great movies, why do people feel the need to always choose? As a child, I enjoyed the original film. Now that I am older, I enjoy the Burton film. it's somewhat darker, funnier, and more adult. Now I am a big Tim Burton fan and I feel the same way about the Planet of the Apes remake. It's not the original movie, it's Burton's interpretation of the basic story. I don't feel like I need to pick one or the other, I own both Charlies as well as both Planet's and enjoy all four of them as seperate, unique pieces of art.
1932100660|5.0|This book is the single most important piece of health information I've ever come across.   My background is exercise physiology (BS) and I've always believed that a whole food, plant based diet was the most healthful.  I've always had a hard time heartily encouraging my children to drink their milk and eat their chicken.  One nagging question I've had for as long as I can remember is: why are humans the only animal that drinks milk past weaning and the only animal on earth that drinks milk from another species?  It just doesn't seem right and how can it be healthy?  This book gave me the knowledge and research information I needed to really put my foot down on my hunch.  No more.  I'm convinced and I'm vegan (four days now) and I really feel great.  I will not forbid my young children to eat meat or drink milk but I will put vegan meals on the table every night.  I will openly talk to them daily about the benefits and importance of eating mostly plants and whole grains while avoiding food that comes from an animal or that has been highly refined.  I will no longer feel uncomfortable amongst my friends for promoting this.  Those of you concerned about the bioavailability of nutrients in plants and certain isolated components (i.e. CLA, omega-3, etc.) are missing the forest through the trees....  nutrition needn't be as complicated or confusing as rocket science.  If you eat mostly plants (unrefined, wide variety) and few to zero animals (the less the better) you will be much healthier.  Period.
B000A7DVY0|5.0|Well, the Big Lebowski was the most quoted movie throughout high school. Pretty much anything anybody said could be replied to with some sort of quotation from the movie. This movie does just that, it offers answers for all questions in life. You know your phone is ringing? Want to go bowling? Whose toe is it? All these deep questions can be replied to with a quote from the movie. This movie is not for everybody. When I was in high school years ago, my parents watched it and said it was a \\"stupid movie about a loser who uses drugs\\". They clearly did not understand or appreciate the Dude in all his Royal Dudeness. Five stars.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Endlessly peppy, FF is a fine listen when spirits are low.   But they are as fluffy as Stellastarr* and after the 39 short minutes of the CD, I felt like I'd had enough aural cotton candy for awhile.  They play great pop, they sing well, the hooks are irresistible if repetitive and best of all they clearly have a good time without a smidgen of angst drama.  Next question -- can they keep that touching lack of self-aggrandizing while toughening their sound and moving beyond gleeful borrowing to some originality.  We'll see.  For now, keepers include The Dark of the Matinee, Darts of Pleasure, and Michael.
B000E9910W|4.0|Are you one of those people who disconnected the turntable and threw out all of your old albums when you started collecting CD's? I bet you regret it now, don't you? After all, `new' music isn't exactly what you expected, and it's painfully expensive to replace all of your old albums with digitized versions. This is especially true when it comes to baby-boomer bands like the Doobie Brothers. Back then, I'd bet that you owned at least four or five of their albums and if you're like me, you never (re) bought a single one on compact disc. Granted, the music did sound a bit dated after a while, but every now and then you'd hear one of their hits on the radio and wish that you could drag out the old vinyl and give it a listen. If you did bother, you'd have to wade through twelve studio albums to find the tracks that interest you, or settle for either of two greatest hits packages, each of which told less than half of the band's story.<br /><br /> Problem solved. In one neat little 2-CD set, \\"The Best of the Doobie Brothers\\" compiles virtually all of their best tracks in one package. Best of all, it captures the near schizophrenic nature of the band as they veer from classic rock to blue-eyed soul and then back again. The early Doobie Brothers leaned heavily on the songwriting abilities of Tom Johnston. Hits like \\"Listen to the Music,\\" \\"Long Train Runnin',\\" \\"China Grove\\" and \\"Another Park, Another Sunday\\" were all written by Johnston, and they represent some of the best pop music from the early seventies. Once Michael McDonald came aboard, though, the band's dynamic shifted dramatically toward west-coast soul, featuring mega-hits such as \\"What a Fool Believes,\\" \\"Takin' It to the Streets\\" and \\"It Keeps You Runnin'.\\" Throughout the set, permanent member Patrick Simmons provides the occasional gem and a change of pace with songs like \\"Black Water\\" and \\"South City Midnight Lady.\\" All are included here, making this a one-size-fits-all collection for fans who want to hear the hits.<br /><br />As this collection makes apparent, the Doobie Brothers were always meticulously produced, so hearing these songs without the snap-crackle-pop of old vinyl can be quite revealing. They may not have been the most consistent outfit, but they certainly did have their moments. Rather conveniently, all of those moments are featured on this collection. So you won't have to buy a new cartridge for your turntable after all, because \\"The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers\\" compiles all the Doobie Brothers music that you will ever need.

B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Some complain that Toby Stephen's Rochester is too handsome and young.  I disagee, having been read Jane Eyre for 30 years.  Rochester and Jane cannot be as ugly or as plain as the novel says they are. Today he would have been called ruggedly handsome.  Rochester was \\"one and twenty\\" when he committed the \\"capital error\\" of marrying Bertha Mason, fifteen years before trying to enter into a bigamist marriage to Jane.  That makes Rochester 36, about the same age as Toby Stephens. His Rochester is macho but vulnerable, sarcastic but charming, and underneath it all a better man than he thinks he is. <br />Ruth Wilson's Jane is quiet and modest, but passionate, intelligent, free and and quietly indomitable. Their on-screen friendship and subsequent romance is so believable.  Their chemistry just sizzles!  <br />Some scenes were a little too 21 Century in their sensiblities, but I wouldn't change a hair.  There are many versions of Jane Eyre, and even if this one is not exactly faithful to the book, I found it rather refreshing. A great alternative view. <br />I love this movie--I can watch it over and over again! <br />I will add it to my other favorite Jane Eyre productions starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, and Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.
B000LE0THO|5.0|This was the album that got me turned on to ELO. After listening to this, I went out and bought every album that they produced, and have enjoyed every one of them.

If you're not sure, I know that you're familiar with Turn to Stone, Sweet Talkin' Woman, and the huge hit, Mr. Blue Sky. Those three songs alone should tell you that the rest of the CD will be pure joy.

1582701709|3.0|I've studied many authors on the subject of the Law of Attraction.  I find each author to lean in to their own belief system, however it is their beliefs.  I see many reviews on here bashing \\"The Secret\\" because of its \\"basic\\" principles and extreme examples, but you have to understand that many people have not been exposed to this type of information and it can be difficult for western culture to absorb this sort of thing if it isn't flashed up a bit.  Even though there are many other authors I would rather read that dive deeper into this, I am happy that someone has come forth to introduce it to the public in the way they are used to.  If you are truly interested in these concepts from a non-ego based view I recommend reading some Wayne Dyer and Deepak Chopra.  This is just my opinion.
0790731509|5.0|Cool Hand Luke is the story of a good man's triumph against an oppressive environment and a social hierarchy.  The acting by Newman and Kennedy is world-class.  The themes are profound.  One that stood out to me is that many people lack moral courage under authority, and as Luke points out, \\"calling it your job doesn't make it right.\\"  While Newman's character may not be an ideal role model, Luke's courage, determination and leadership are exemplary.  The story is inspiring.  It's definitely one of my top 10.

This text will be your guide to teaching future generations this beautiful hand. I am honored to have found this book and even more honored to have the chance to learn this hand from a true master.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|I got to watch the DVD of Babel early this afternoon before the Academy Awards came on.  Though reminding quite a bit of the movie, Crash, this film proved to be a powerful drama with compelling performances by all of its actors.  I was struck in how a simple act of kindness by a Japanese businessman on a hunting trip in Morocco when he gives his guide a rifle as a gift can have such an astounding affect on four different families around the world.  This is the basis for the movie.  When the guide later sells the rifle to a nearby Moroccan family, the father of the family gives the rifle to his two small sons so that they can shoot the jackals that are eating their goats.  The boys are not very old--maybe eight and ten.  Trying to see just how far the rifle will shoot, the boys end up hitting a tourist bus and Cate Blanchett's character is shot in the shoulder.  This event has the ripple affect as her husband, who's played by Brad Pitt, attempts to get medical help for his injured wife in the middle of nowhere.  Their Mexican nanny will be affected as she makes the decision not to miss her son's wedding in Mexico and to take the two children in her charge with her.  This will have dire consequences for all involved.  There's also the Japanese businessman and his deaf daughter, who's still recovering from the suicide of her mother.  The journey that Babel takes is filled with hardship, stupidity, anger, and compassion.  There are no easy answers to the things that happen.  Even at the end, you still feel kind of empty due to the tragedies that have already taken place.  I have to say that Adriana Barraza as the Mexican nanny and Rinko Kikuchi as the Japanese daughter steal the film with their non-flinching, emotional performances.  The director of the movie, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, manages to capture the true humanity in each of the characters and how we're all interconnected in today's world.  Babel is certainly a film worth seeing and worth owning for your DVD library.  There are no extras with this DVD, so a collector's edition may be coming out this summer.  Highly recommended!!!library.  There are no extras with this DVD, so a collector's edition may be coming out this summer.  Highly recommended!!!

B000LC55F2|3.0|There's going to be PLOT SPOILERS in this short review, so don't read any further if you haven't seen the movie.  If you have seen the film, then maybe you can answer some of the questions that I have in order to end my confusion.  Since I enjoyed The Illusionist, I went into The Prestige with high expectations.  I mean it's about the rivalry of two magicians at the turn of the century.  Its director is Christopher Nolan.  The cast includes Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, David Bowie, and Scarlett Johansson.  How could a movie like this go wrong?<br /><br />The Prestige opens in London with Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) performing his greatest illusion--The New Transporting Man.  His rival, Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale), sneaks back stage in order to find out how the trick is done.  Something, however, goes very wrong and Angier is killed.  Borden is then blamed for his death and tried in a court of law where he's sentence to death.  The movie then goes back to the beginning of the rivalry between these two men and moves forward.  At the beginning, both Angier and Borden worked as assistants to the same magician.  Angier's wife was part of the act.  During a nightly performance, Borden ties off the rope around her wrists with the wrong knot.  Because of this, she's unable to escape from a water-filled tank and drowns.  No one knows--except for Borden--whether the wrong knot was tied by accident or intentionally.  Angier never forgives Borden for the death of his wife and thus the rivalry between the two men begins when each one sets out to become a world-famous magician.  As each man develops an astounding illusion, the other seeks to figure out how the trick is done and then to upstage his rival with an even better illusion.  This leads to severe injuries for both magicians as they seek to discredit the other.  When Borden creates The Transporting Man illusion, Angier is unable to figure it out.  This causes him to visit the scientist, Nikola Tessla (played by David Bowie), in the United States, hoping that Tessla will agree to make a machine for him that will actually transport a man from one spot to another.  This leads to Angier's greatest illusion and his death.  But, all is not what it seems to be as the secrets being held by both magicians are gradually revealed.<br /><br />The Prestige is beautiful to watch with its dark colors and the wonderful set designs that actually make you think you're in Victorian England.  The viewers are carried inside the hidden world of magicians and allowed to see how certain illusions are performed.  We then learn that many a sparrow was killed during the performance of a magic trick and that the use of doubles was often the answer to what appeared to be the most complex and amazing illusion.  I have to admit, however, that I was more stumped by the plot points than I was by the illusions.  To me, it seemed as though Bale's character intentionally killed Jackman's wife at the beginning.  Why?  I don't know.  He'd tied the wrong knot before and almost caused her death.  The second time around appeared to be too much of a coincidence for it not to be intentional.  Once the two men have their careers established, it seems as though each one then wants to disrupt the other's performance by causing a serious injury to his rival.  They accomplish this by always being the one called from the audience to assist in the trick.  Even though the two men wear disguises, I would've been more careful about who was chosen from the audience if it was my life on the line.  Here's a big PLOT SPOILER.  Since Bale's character was using his twin brother for the illusion, why did he allow his brother to cause his wife's apparent suicide?  I understand that each of the brothers loved a different woman, but why wasn't Bale's wife made aware that there was another brother so that she wouldn't be jealous?  When Jackman's character first uses the Tessla machine to create a duplicate,why does he shoot the duplicate right on the spot?  Was it his intention to kill all of the duplicates so that he wouldn't have the same problem that occurred with the drunken double earlier in the movie?  In other words, by killing his duplicates, Jackman kept control of the illusion so that no one could blackmail him with the secret of how it was done.  Why was Bale's character charged with murdering Jackman when the movie showed Bale trying to break the glass tank with a sledgehammer in order to save Jackman?  Questions!  Questions!  I'm going to watch the film again to see if I can make better sense of what's going on.  This might be one of those movies where you have to watch it several times in order to figure things out.  As far as the extras on the DVD goes, there's a twenty minute behind-the-scenes featurette on the making of the film, but it doesn't go into the magic tricks of the time and how they were done.  I wanted to learn more about the magic.  There was a Chinese man in the movie that caused a fish bowl of water to appear from out of nowhere.  How did he do that?  Anyway, because of the questions I have about the film, I'm giving it three stars because there's no way to do a three-and-a-half star rating.

B000F1IQNM|5.0|For those of us old enough to remember the wonderful fantasy of \\"Mary Poppins\\" when it first appeared on the screen, \\"Nanny McPhee\\" is a reminder that children still want some magic in their lives. And this movie is full of it. Every child (of every age) that I've talked to  about it has glowed as they described what they liked most. Emma Thompson is brilliant as the nanny: a stern and consistent disciplinarian in the absence of any real parental figure. She IS a supernanny, doling out the spoonful of anything but sugar, but always with a loving tone. Sure, it's a fairy tale, but we all need a little more of that in our lives. If \\"Nanny McPhee\\" becomes the Mary Poppins of a new generation, then I say SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS!

B00006JDVV|4.0|This almost-apocalyptic view of the future combines elements of Star Wars, King Arthur and other tales of reluctant heroes who arise when things are dire and the situation calls for unexpected bravery. Dragons are the new enemy, reducing the world to gray ash as they flame and feast on a defenseless and rapidly-decreasing population. While Matthew McConaughey rides in, triumphant on  his tank, to save the day in brash, armored, leading-man style (tattooed, skin-headed and oozing testosterone), it's the quiet leadership (Christian Bale and his brother-in-arms, Gerard Butler) in the day-to-day struggle to survive that gives this movie its soul.
0452277752|4.0|These stories were written by a young King, before many of his more well-known works were published.  After reading The Bachman Books, it is easy to see the talent Mr. King possessed at an early age. <br /> <br />Rage is the reason this book is sought-after, and it won't disappoint most readers.  It is a great study of social cliques, adolescent psychology, and shifts of power.  The controversy surrounding the story may lead people to misguided expectations.  This is not a story with huge body counts of high-school students and faculty.  My second-favorite story in the book. <br /> <br />The Long Walk is a brilliant character study.  Possibly a metaphor for the Vietnam War (my personal opinion there, not necessarily King's), this story focuses on a handful of \\"walkers\\" participating in a field of 100.  Rules are simple and are enforced strictly.  Characters meet sides of themselves they never knew they possessed when faced with situations you wouldn't normally encounter.  This story alone is worth seeking out this book.  I'd place The Long Walk right up there with other King short stories like The Mist, The Raft, 1408, The Body, and Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. <br /> <br />Roadwork, although my least favorite of the four, still has its place.  It is also a character study, but after reading The Long Walk any story would have a tough act to follow.  You can empathize with the main charcter even as he slips into madness and King writes him in a way that you almost root for him. <br /> <br />The Running Man was a pleasant surprise.  I'd seen the film that was LOOSELY based on the story (and by loosely, I mean the character name, the reality game show, and the future dystopia is about it) and altough I enjoyed it I soon realized that the story was infinitely better (isn't that usually the case?).  The story paints a very bleak, not-too-distant future where the haves and have-nots are separated to an extreme that frighteningly may not be that far off.  Our protagonist runs in order to help his family, and the hunters seeking him aren't rejects from the WWE.  It's about a man pushed to his limits and how he's forced to choose his victories. <br /> <br />It's spooky how King wrote two stories in this book about futuristic reality game shows, and today these shows--although not nearly as extreme as King's versions--are so popular and prevalent.  All the stories are worth reading and a couple of them are excellent.  If you can locate a copy of this book I strongly suggest picling it up.
1592402690|4.0|This is my second attempt at a review of  Here, There and Everywhere. I discovered at my own peril that this book apparently has a self-appointed watchdog set to strike anyone offering less than a 5 star entry overflowing with superlatives. This person evidently sees it as their duty to post ad hominem   attacks to total strangers, characterizing them as unintelligent, simple-minded or deriding anyone who shows any sign of critical thinking. <br /> <br />For this cause, I felt the need to rewrite my review to clarify as much as possible, my position on this book and Beatle books in general. I have read a good many of them over the years and there are very few that I would not recommend, and those that fall into that category are usually there because they nothing more than a collection of scraps culled from superior efforts. The Geoff Emerick/Howard Massey book is most certainly not in that category, largely due to its inclusion of material that can be found no where else.  <br /> <br />As to the notion that people like myself cannot handle anything falling outside of the realm of a puff piece, nothing could be further from the truth. Harsh depictions of John, George and Ringo are nothing new in Beatledom. I certainly was not up in arms because Mr. Emerick cast aspersions on my precious Beatles. That said, there are those who do not care for this kind of thing. It is their prerogative, indeed their right, to hold such a view, and to do so without ridicule. They also deserve warning on the front end before they purchase a book that may be offensive to their personal taste. <br /> <br />The purpose of my review is offer a critical and objective look at this book. Nothing more. I was taken to task for nit-picking in my first review when I pointed out that Emerick's account of the recording of Love Me do was false. Understand, it was not simple error, such as confusing one date with another. He gives a very vivid account of the September 4th recording  that could not possibly have happened (pgs 44-46) describing changes in instrumentation and vocal arrangements to \\"Love Me Do\\" that in fact were present from the very first recording with Pete Best on June the 6th. <br /> Nit-picking? Well perhaps it is. In and of itself it may not amount to much, but over the course of a book, little things like this begin to add up when weighed against the veracity of other statements, particularly where someone's reputation is at stake. <br /> <br />We have seen already in the example above that Geoff is in error about something he asserts to have been an eye-witness to. How much confidence then can we invest in his accounts, when they are secondhand information such as the one on pg. 262 where George Martin is defamed.  <br /> <br />\\"....George's attempt to embarrass Ken in front of John was, unfortunately, the kind of thing he would do- he tried to make other people look sub-servient so that he would come off as the sole authority. Possibly he saw this as an opportunity to put Ken in his place a little bit, but I thought it was completely uncalled for.\\" <br /> <br />Now if Ken Scott has disavowed much of Emerick's book and he is presumably the source for the above account, as only he, Lennon and Martin were present, then what are we to make of it? You can always turn it into an issue of Emerick vs. Scott and who is more credible, but I say forget Emerick vs. Scott. It is still a second-hand account assailing the character of the man that gave Emerick his career on a silver platter, offering him the position as balance engineer to the Beatles when he was no more than a teenager. Not only that, he gave him a standing offer of a job with his own AIR studios years later, which Geoff accepted. At the very least it raises a lot of questions such as who's attempt is this to embarrass who and why? <br /> <br />There is a price to pay for telling tales out of school. If someone's reputation is on the line, yes I'll nit-pick, and if I were so maligned, Iwould hope that others would do the same for me.  <br /> <br />So read the book. Get all the good Beatle stuff that you can out of it. But you'll need a very large glass of water if you mean to swallow it whole. <br />
B00005JP9V|5.0|Already being a fan of the book, I was eager to see how this story translated to film. <br /> <br />A wonderful cast of known and unknown actors deliver great scenes ranging from comical to tearful, frightening to heart-breaking.  With and without dialogue, these actors conveyed strong emotion throughout. <br /> <br />Cuaron is a brilliant director, and his growth shows in this film.  Great pacing and storytelling here.  Not to mention beautiful cinematography.  It's impressive how Cuaron and his crew made such a bleak society look so beautiful. <br /> <br />Mainly this film portrays a feeling of hope.  It shows how strong hope can be and how far it can carry people regardless of how bleak and hopeless the situation may seem.  There is a scene towards the end of the film where such a hopeless, hateful scenario is abruptly defeated by one sign of hope.   <br /> <br />This extremely powerful film should not be missed.  One of the best films I've seen in years.
0066620996|4.0|This book came highly recommended by my mother, who has no experience in corporate America and only limited interest in what makes corporates great. The main appeal was the lesson's applicability to personal life achievement. I find that she was right, and I do work for a corporation! Reading this book as taught me important lessons for what to look for in a company, and for what types of universal truths apply to making a person (not just a company) move from the comfort of mediocrity to true greatness. By the way, I was a little leery when I first started reading it, that it would be dry and full of numbers like earnings reports and ROI, etc. To my surprise and pleasure, the book reads much easier then I thought and it's been very enjoyable. I can highly recommend this book.
0321344758|4.0|It doesn't take much time to read this book and it will save you much more time later. After I read the book, I checked a couple of our web sites and really found a number of obvious improvements.  <br />This is NOT a book on designing web -applications- but it is still helpful if this is what you want to do.
B00005JO20|5.0|Peter Jackson takes the metaphor, if you can bring an unprecedented find to the world for the price of an admission ticket, you've got a spectacular show. And King Kong delivers on the premise in sheer scope, cenematic beauty, and bigger-than life story. The production was phenomenal in almost every way. In one instance, when Kong was sliding autos around the streets of Broadway, like a kid crashing matchbox cars, did the action look like CG creation (something in the sliding ape didn't look convincing). In every other scene, the work was awesome, detailed, and completely credibly produced.<br /><br />Watch for character nuances in the non-speaking CG role of Kong, and you'll see another reason this 3rd-generation remake justifies the hype it got. Kong is a sympathetic character with a soft spot for Ann Darrow. Worth the 3 hours of pure enjoyment.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|There are several things I really liked about this movie. First off, it really puts you in Boston. I like movies that don't seem generic in time and place. This movie places you in Boston. Scorsese's attention to detail pays off here. I liked the various dialects. I liked the fact that some of the guys were right off the boat from Ireland. That seems realistic. The screenplay is amazing. I can imagine cops talking just like that. The screenplay is VERY realistic in terms of not shying away from using \\"bad language\\" (someone counted and said that the F-word is used 250 + times in the movie). The mixing of scene and music was great. The themes of the movie: identity, class in America, personal secrecy vs. openness, etc. were well delineated. There was the classic Scorsese humor. We are watching some pretty nasty stuff, and still can laugh at it. It seems to me that this is one of Scorsese's main themes: life is violent and brutal, but still, we can laugh at it. The depiction of the many layers of bureaucracy and secrecy within both police units, and crime organizations, was good. I liked Jack Nicholson, but there were two scenes where they let him go a bit overboard, and he almost *hijacks* the movie in those two scenes. But still, he is great in it. DiCaprio is really good, expressing the multitude of emotions of someone who doesn't know who to trust, or even what his own identity should be. I liked the depiction of psychology, especially as related to police work (\\"cops see policemen on TV crying after using their gun, and then they think they have to do that too\\"). I think this movie is saturated with realism. As they say, \\"reality is weirder than fiction\\". This movie is both sad and funny, all at once. I can't say this is a masterpiece. But it is a very good movie.
B000M341QE|3.0|`The Departed,` another gangster-related drama from director Martin Scorsese, walked away with four Oscars at the 79th Academy Awards. While clearly a good film, did it deserve Best Picture? A look at the picture means that this review contains spoilers, so you may want to stop reading now. <br /> <br />The acting is excellent (with a nod towards DiCaprio) and the script fraught with tension at times. What strikes the viewer-- perhaps even assaults the viewer-- is the overuse of music. Typically Scorsese overwhelms the audience with operatic arias and seventies rock-- instead of choosing key moments to play his musical cards for maximum impact. For the first hour of the film the music never stops! Please, give us some time alone with the characters so we can see development. Music starts, and stops, and re-starts beyond the bounds of good editing. As a result the story sounds like it`s being recycled instead of moving along. However the film`s use of cell phones-- ringtones and sounds as well as as plot devices-- much like the original-- adds greatly to the tension.   <br /> <br />Furthermore the film jumps about in both the beginning and middle-- there is colorful but highly confusing scene involving copious amounts of cocaine that floats about mid-movie, disconnected completely from the rest of the plot (as we have plenty of evidence of Frank Costello`s evil nature prior to this scene, it serves only to disorient.) Only near the film`s end, when the main plot involving the two-faced nature of three of the main characters becomes clear, do the scenes finally iron themselves out and flow together.    <br /> <br />Numerous laugh-out-loud moments and solid dialogue show Willam Monahan`s Oscar to be justified (he won for Best Adapted Screenplay.) What really sinks `The Departed` are the far-too-numerous subplots left unresolved. Racism? You got it (as with every gang-related film Scorsese has touched.) It adds some flavor but also some bulk. Sullivan (Matt Damon) spends time recruiting a secret crew within the Special Investigations Unit-- what happens to them? They`re left dangling mid-movie. One scene that did not make the final cut was Mandolyn Madden`s (Vera Farmigan) reading of the secret letter given to her by Costigan (DiCaprio) in the final 20 minutes. That scene too would`ve helped tie it together.  <br /> <br />All in all, a decent film. But a colossus that pales in comparison to the sleek, driven beast that is `Infernal Affairs` (2002), the film on which it is based. If you want tension and drama in spades, and a story of deception that is stripped bare of non-essentials, rent or buy the Hong Kong original.
B000092T6M|3.0|I really like this movie, even looking past Costner's quickly discarded accent, and so when I was shopping for movie last week and came across this extended version I quickly purchased it in hopes of indulging in one of my  favorites from my teens.  Unfortunately, while the extended footage was a welcome addition (much of it deals with the Sheriff's past and his relationship with Mortiana, the witch) I found several key pieces of dialogue from the theatrical version missing from the extended version of the film.  One such missing exchange takes place when Sir Guy returns after being bested by Robin for the first time, in the theatrical version he explains to his cousin, the Sheriff, that Robin is traveling with a man who carries a Sarisan sword; this important piece of information is never presented to the Sheriff in the extended version so its a bit jarring when, in the next scene, he deduces that the painted man the witch is referring to in her vision is Robin's companion.  Another important scene missing is the Sheriff's first confrontation with Robin in the Bishop's quarters.  Its ridiculous that this film cuts the part where Robin gives the Sheriff a cut on his cheek, and I can't figure out if it was cut due to some sort of censorship or the editor fell asleep in the cutting room.  There are several more instances of missing dialogue I found, but since its been years since I last saw this film and not having the theatrical version to compare it to I can't be sure how much was altered for this special edition. <br /> <br />In my opinion there is no reason to buy this version of the movie, unless you really want to see the extended scenes or the special features. The audio is sub-par for a 2nd print, special edition DVD release, the picture quality is noticeably in need of touch ups and the special features, while a pleasant addition, really don't warrant the extra cost over the theatrical release.  In the end I wish I'd had bought the original cut.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|I started typing this review as Stone in Love from the Summit DVD concert is playing on my TV. We are on Keep on Running right now. This album is I think as close to perfect as any of the hundreds of CD's I have. Almost 30 years after it was initially released it sounds as good, fresh, energetic, etc. as I recall hearing it as a boy in my early teens. I think this was the \\"hungry\\" band at their realized peak and Frontiers was the follow up. But with Frontiers Journey was at the top and trying to stay there. Frontiers has an aged feel to me, but Escape...WOW....With La Raza Del Sol added you won't be dissiapointed either.....Journey para vida....Journey for life
0312979479|5.0|The book AND THEN THERE WERE NONE has to be on every mystery lover's list.  It started out with a curious assortment of ten, all unwilling to tell their history.  Their host, Mr. Owen, has arranged for them to come to Indian Island.  When they arrive, the sun is up, the birds are singing, and everything seems to be in order, but danger is in the air, and knowing Christie, in the air it will stay until all fates are met.  In each of the guest's rooms, is a poem hanging on the wall.  It starts-<br /><br />\\"Ten Little Indian boys went out to dine;<br /><br />One choked his little self, and then there were nine.\\"<br /><br />It ends with the five most dreaded words to all the guests... Or at least most of them.  \\"And then there were none.\\"<br /><br />This was my first Agatha.  I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!  I finished it in a day, and I think you can guess what I was reading the next day.  This book is probably more for young adults and up.  I think you need to be old enough to fully appreciate this book and Agatha's unique style of writing.  It also may be a little scary for younger children.
0618680004|3.0|Dawkins is fabulous, out there taking it on the chin while most athiests sit on the sidelines never questioning when their co-workers for instance suggest, with out irony, that a thorny business problem may only be solved by prayer. I particularly enjoy the demolition of Gould's Non-Overlapping Magesteria position. If any claim that God has an actual impact by direct intervention in the world is made by religionists, that claim is indeed in the realm of scientific inquiry and frankly scientists who claim otherwise are toning themselves down to avoid controversy avoid offense. But why should religionists be offended when they are questioned? I have never met an athiest or an agnostic that was offended by inquiry? <br />The problem with this book its repition of the same argument (or even sentence) three of four times in the same chapter or even page. Moreover this repition is used to gloss over some deeply held assumptions about God and man that I wish were explored in greater depth. Dawkins is of course a biologist not a sociologist but I would have like more in depth study of the enthographic etc explanations for the delusion that there is an active interventionist god or gods. Perhaps I am underestimating the powerful simplicity of his arguments.
1400032717|4.0|This was an extremely quick read (1 afternoon), but a very satisfying one.  The story is told through the eyes of Christopher Boone, an adolescent savant boy who is great at his \\"maths,\\" but sorely lacking in social maturity.  I loved the way that Mark Haddon captured Christopher's voice perfectly.  So, too, did he capture the essence of the love/frustration/despair that Christopher's separated parents have dealing with their son.  An interesting little novel.  Probably not for those who like action-packed adventures, but very thoughtfully and imaginatively done.
B00005JM1F|3.0|OLD SCHOOL is a comedy that stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell. Wilson portrays Mitch Martin, a real estate lawyer who arrives home early from a business training seminar to find his wife about to participate in an orgy. This break off their relationship and Mitch finds himself alone again and moving into a house on the campus of the local university. Meanwhile Frank Richard (Will Ferrell), one of Mitch's best friends, is getting married. The other part of the trio, Bernard &#34;Beanie&#34; Campbell (Vince Vaughn) tries convincing Frank not to get married right up until Frank's bride arrives at the altar. Beanie has a successful business and is married to a very attractive women and has a couple of kids, but he's feeling trapped. The Dean of the University, Dean Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Piven) threatens to seize Mitch's house, but Beanie discovers a loophole in the seizure clause and Beanie, Frank, and Mitch turn the house into a new fraternity that is open to men of all ages in the community, including those who have no association with the university whatsoever. A battle between the new fraternity and the dean ensues, while in the meantime the three founding fathers of the fraternity face relationship struggles of their own with the women they love.<br /><br />OLD SCHOOL includes allusions to many movies, but seems to have been most heavily influenced by ANIMAL HOUSE and FIGHT CLUB and seems to be a homage to both of those films. The ANIMAL HOUSE allusions are obvious, e.g. popular fraternity that the dean tries to close down. The FIGHT CLUB references aren't quite as obvious, but they are there and there are many. For example, the wrestling matches take place in the basement, club propaganda is photocopied at work, the men appear disheveled at work, in many of the fraternity scenes Vince Vaughn dresses in outfits similar to those of Tyler Durden, etc. In fact director Todd Phillips has said that he thought of OLD SCHOOL as being a comedy version of FIGHT CLUB.<br /><br />With such a talented cast and a witty script full of film references, one would think that OLD SCHOOL would be a memorable and hilarious movie. Unfortunately, it's not. There were some parts of OLD SCHOOL that I found incredibly funny. For instance, watching Will Ferrell streak through a party and run naked down a public street was hilarious. In fact, Ferrell is the funniest thing about the movie. Just about every time he is on screen I found myself laughing at the antics of his character. I also enjoyed Luke Wilson's performance. Wilson portrays Mitch as a very likeable, down-to-earth, and realistic person. However, Ferrell and Wilson are about the only two characters who work well in the movie. Vince Vaughn can speak almost as fast as an auctioneer, but his character just doesn't fit with the rest of the characters in the film. Jeremy Piven is a very talented actor, but in OLD SCHOOL I don't believe that his character used to be the guy that Mitch, Beanie, and Frank used to beat up and neither do I believe that was able to rise through the ranks of academia to become the university dean. Most of the women in the movie are only background characters that are used as fodder for comic material. There are a variety of scenes in the movie that seem funny at first, but are juvenile at best and then quickly become boring and dull. There are many sexual references in the movie that have very little to do with the plot and seem basically to have been thrown in simply to have thirteen-year-old males buy movie tickets or the DVD. The movie had a lot of potential, but it doesn't come together in a coherent manner.<br /><br />However, with the movie on DVD, one can get a better understanding of what the movie could have been. Some of the extras on the DVD include the usual director's commentary, a spoof of &#34;Inside the Actor's Studio&#34;, deleted and extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes, and a making of featurette. Most of the deleted and extendedscenes that are included on the DVD probably should have been kept in the movie because they add a great deal to the characterization and plot development. For instance, there is a scene where a college girl wants to sleep with Beanie, but he refuses. The scene in the movie makes Beanie seem like a complete jerk while the extended scene allows the audience to relate to Beanie and actually see him as a human being. I really enjoyed watching most of these scenes and they allowed me to appreciate the movie a bit more. The other special feature that I really liked was the &#34;Inside the Actor's Studio spoof&#34;. I found it hilarious; seeing Will Ferrell have a conversation with himself as two different characters is hilarious.<br /><br />Overall, OLD SCHOOL is a movie that will probably appeal most to teenage males and some college students as well as fans of Ferrell, Wilson, or Vaughn. Other than that, I'd skip this comedy and watch ANIMAL HOUSE instead.scenes that are included on the DVD probably should have been kept in the movie because they add a great deal to the characterization and plot development.

B0007GAERG|5.0|The album is like no other Mariah album.  It stands out because it is just that good.  The voice, the image, everything so well crafted!  5 stars!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me, and I had barely heard of it before.  What a surprise!  In fact, a LOT of surprises!  This is a genuinely fun movie, with great acting, a very different plot, and a completely unexpected denouement.  The term \\"well-crafted\\" is probably overworked, but certainly applies to \\"The Illusionist\\", which should have received far more acclaim.  It's refreshing to see special effects which are PART of the storyline, rather than a storyline built around special effects.
0553588486|5.0|Thus far, this series has put every other fantasy or sci fi series I have read to shame. Powerfully described characters, gripping storyline, and an a raw realism that is so rare in fiction. Better than Dune, Ender's Game, and even Harry Potter. I would give this ten stars if I could.
B00005JPBD|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Penlope Cruz but this film, I think, has changed that!  I have been, however, a fan of Pedro Almodovar for 20 years and he gives us another strong tale centered around a group of women that involves murder, incest, ghosts and much more!<br /><br />Thankfully, we see the wonderful Carmen Maura reunited with her director of \\"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\\".  She really shows her talent as an actress as the mother of Raimunda (Cruz) and Sole (Lola Duenas).<br /><br />The story is set around to Raimunda and Sole, two sisters who lost their parents in a fire about four years earlier.  Raimunda is married to a crude drunk and Sole is a lonely young woman separated from her husband.  After a tragic event occurs for Raimunda and her daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo), Raimunda is forced to keep a secret to protect her daughter and herself.  The one thing that bonds all the women is the secrets they keep.  Irene (Maura), their mother, has a secret that could give the terminally ill Agustina (Blanca Portillo), who is a childhood friend of the sisters, an answer to the whereabouts of her absent mother.<br /><br />The actresses in this film do AMAZING work.  The story centers around Penelope Cruz who deserves the Oscar nomination she received.  Carmen Maura, as usual, does a great job and another stand out is Blanca Portillo as the long suffering and loyal friend to the sisters.<br /><br />If I have one criticism about the film, it just seem to end so abruptly.  Other than that, Almodovar gives us another film about women that is well worth the price of your ticket as well as an addition to your dvd library.  Highly recommended.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I was hesitant to watch this version of Jane Eyre since the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton was, in my opinion, the best ever (this being the only reason I couldn't give this edition 5 stars :D). But, my friend and I finally sat down last night and watched it. Except for a few differences, it was absolutely wonderful! The photography was breathtaking and the acting superb! We sat in silence as we watched the credits roll. This is a movie that is definitely worthy of one's money and time!
0812550706|4.0|In Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" we are introduced to Ender a young boy, 6 or so, who is not only a genius but has the abilities necessary to be a great field commander. In Ender's world this is great news, twice the Earth has been attacked by an alien bug-like race and twice the Earth has just barley survived. Our world has just one chance left to stop this threat and it is hidden in the planet's youth. Ender is part of a world wide strategy, a game to the young, where the best of the best are raise on space stations to study and fight war games in zero gravity. Ender shows much promise. Will he be the new military messiah? Those in command think so and  the game is accelerated for him. This creates jealously and tension for Ender's bunkmates, but this too is part of the game. Ender realizes this, barley staying onestep ahead of those who wish to destroy him as well as those who hope to propel him.    All the while Ender's brilliant siblings, the emotional Valentine and the sadistic Peter, play a game of their own as they begin to infiltrate the web with slanted opinion pieces that smack of current Fox news reports. These reports divide a world numb to the alien threat and set it against it self. Peter plans to rise to the top like cream and take his rightful place that was denied him when Ender was chosen above him.    Can Ender keep beating the game and stop an invading army? Will Peter and Valentine shift the world politics in an attempt to shift themselves into power? Are the aliens even a real threat? The book does a pretty good job of taking in all of these themes and making them work. It does seem a tad ridiculous that these are all children we're talking about, Ender's not quite in his teens as the book draws to a close. However, it works. It makes sense and it ends up being a fluid and strong read. Comparisons can be made to \\"Starship Troopers\\" by  Robert A. Heinlein which is a slightly better book but takes a different spin on the whole boy against anarmy of invading insects tale. \\"Ender...\\" is more about mind games and how certain people react to opinion and pressure differently than others. Probably the worst thing I can say about it is that I feel no strong desire to read more Ender books, I think that speaks to a lack of character development. Ender's fully flushed out but he comes off as a nearly perfect human,  there are few flaws in him to draw me closer. Perhaps that will be corrected for in further volumes, but for the time being I'm happy to have read \\"Ender's Game\\". Who knows if I'll want to play again.
B000060OFT|4.0|This 1996 update of Romeo and Juliet, directed by Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom, Moulin Rouge!), is set in Venice Beach, between warring gangs  (The Capulets versus the Montagues), as two star-crossed lovers, Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Clare Danes) from these two warring gang families are brought together through their love.  This film is a series of quick camera angles, sharp cuts and cinematography reminiscent of Federico Fellini, MTV and even kung fu films.  The colors are bright and bold (this is Venice Beach, after all) and the characters feel like they could pop off of the screen at any moment.  They are truly larger than life, and it is fascinating to see them reciting William Shakespeare's dialogue, while dressed in Dolce & Gabbana, and going for their pistols at the gas station.  Some notable performances here are those of the supporting cast--John Leguizamo and very flamboyant Harold Perrinau.  Definitely worth watching and a very intriguing look at pop culture in the 1990s and how it was incorporated into one of the most well-known Shakespearean plays about young love in the face of opposition and violence.
076113719X|3.0|I heard so much about this product and finally bought it last year. But once I got it I wasn't very impressed with it. The idea is good, but needs more work. There should have been more detailed classification of tasks. and more space for customizing etc.  <br />Its okay for &lt; $5. Not worth the price.
B000002J0G|5.0|I had grown up listening to all of the old Testament material, up through \\"Practice What You Preach\\" and \\"Souls Of Black\\", but had pretty much fallen out of touch with this band (which I always considered the most talented and intelligent of the Bay-area thrash bands), so this album was a surprise to me, and is quickly becoming one of my current favorites...<br /><br />This was the first album without guitarist Alex Skolnick and the first to feature James Murphy of Death fame, and it is certainly the heaviest album attempted by this band up until this point. This album also saw Testament begin to experiment with a near death-metal vocal style, which actually works rather well with the new, heavier, more intense material. My concerns about Skolnick's departure were ill-founded; guitarists Murphy and Peterson shred all over this disc; some of the solo-trade-offs on this album are just unreal. Very, very cool style combining elements of death, thrash, and even a bit of prog-metal with some great guitar playing and some surprising twists and turns, which add an unexpected element at times (track 9, \\"Urutsukidoji\\", is a sort of instrumental fusion-metal tribute to the bizarre Japanese hentai anime of the same name; and even features foreign-language clips from the series...just plain weird)....this is much better than 90 percent of the newer metal bands out these days. Check it out!
B000IMUYJM|5.0|This is truly the original predecessor to all the horror/slasher movies imagined to date. The cast, along with that HOUSE, have forever darkened an otherwise joyous holiday and to them I say BRAVO. This movie sent so many chills up my spine that I could actually feel the cold. Don't watch it in the dark and definitely don't watch it alone.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I was really excited about this movie. It has an excellent cast and a directer known for dark, twist-filled tales. I was rather disappointed though, to be honest. Although interesting looking, the wasn't anything memorable in cinematography. the acting was good, but nobody's best work. The plot was compelling, but the \\"suprise ending\\" didn't really make up for the holes thoughout.<br /><br />I particularly wanted to know by the end of the movie how electricity did what it supposedly did, and what the wife actually thought about her husband.<br /><br />The ending makes the 2+ hours pretty much worth it, but don't expect to be blown away.
B000096I9G|5.0|there is no Cure fan that should be without this. UNBELIEVABLE!!! the only thing that might trip some folks up (as it did me) is the fact that the albums are played in order, and therefore you might find it hard to make it past the first set! (just like me. \\"pornography\\" is my favorite Cure record to begin with, and the versions of no less than EVERY SINGLE SONG from that album are wonderful, man.) <br /> <br />i hate to admit it, but honestly, i so far have not seen all of the second and/or third sets. (second set through \\"fascination street\\", and only \\"watching me fall\\" from \\"bloodflowers\\", but all mentioned are AWESOME!)  <br /> <br />that being said, i'd STILL call this DVD a must-have for long-time Cure fans, but also, i'd suggest this as a great Point A for anyone that might be interested in getting into the band, as you'll immidiately have three of their most famous and popular records for the price of barely more than one of the albums individually. (and considerably less than any of the recent re-issues.) <br /> <br />also, the re-creation of these songs (with the exception of \\"lullaby\\", which i prefer live) is so true that it really will give you a SUPERB idea of whether or not you might like to hear more of these fellows. <br /> <br />in short, worth every dime for the first set ALONE! enjoy!

B00005NOOH|5.0|This may well be the best documentary about World War II ever made.  It chronocles events beginning with the rise of the Nazis through events immediate following the war.  There are several interviews with actual participants (e.g., Traudl Junge, Hitler' secretary) which provide insights that would have been lost when these people died. <br /> <br />While our perspective on the events has changed a little since these films were made, this documentary is still relevant.

The majority of this story plays out like ones worst nightmare, worse than that.  What Beach goes through and incounters through his journey through his native country surpasses anything most of us could even imagine.  This is a story of hopelessness for a 12 year old child doing anything he can to survive, yet deep down there is another tale unfolding, the tale of the how the human spirit, not matter how battered it becomes, refuses to give in.   <br /> <br />Beah is an excelent story teller.  Using easy to understand language and great description, the story quickly begins to move and take shape.  Beah draws you in and before you know it you and him are emotionally attatched.  You want to cry when he crys, hate when he hates, and laugh when he laughs.  This is by far a book that everyone should read!
B000008DXB|4.0|I'm familiar with seven of J.J. Cale's albums so far--the first four, plus \\"Grasshopper,\\" \\"#8,\\" and \\"Travel Log\\"--and  \\"Okie\\" is my favorite, just barely edging out his debut album.  What I like best about \\"Okie,\\" aside from the fact that it's full of good tunes, is the casual, laid-back atmosphere.  You could say that about all of Cale's early albums, of course, but this one takes that sound just a little farther.  One of the songs was actually recorded on Cale's back porch, and two others were recorded in his house.  The others were recorded in Tennessee, either at Woodland Studio B or a place called Bradley's Barn.  You get the picture.   <br /> <br />These songs are also bound together by the use of an electric piano that appears throughout, helping to create a really nice groove.  A highlight is \\"Anyway the Wind Blows,\\" which is driven by a great little guitar riff that was later modified slightly by Eric Clapton for \\"Lay Down Sally.\\"  \\"Everlovin' Woman,\\" \\"Cajun Moon,\\" and \\"I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)\\" also have really nice grooves.  Meanwhile, the slow songs are not quite as memorable, but none of them are duds by any means.   <br /> <br />As usual, the songs are all short--the entire album clocks in at just under 30 minutes.  It's as if Cale thinks he would be showing off if he extended them any longer.  And he's got so many good riffs that he's happy to trot out a new one every two or three minutes.  If you like your albums longer than this, I have a suggestion:  Play it twice in a row.

B00005RDRO|5.0|murder by death has to be one of the best movies made<br /><br />in the 70's. it seems nobody ever mentions this movie.<br /><br />written by neil simon it's just as funny as the odd<br /><br />couple. one liners just keep coming. the casting is<br /><br />just brilliant. peter falk, davin niven, peter sellers<br /><br />alec guiness and truman capote make this a classic!<br /><br />of course the surprise ending is still a surprise even<br /><br />after the movie ends! i love it! highly recommended.
0143036556|5.0|Let's get a couple of things straight before I enter my review:<br /><br />1)  There is no debate on this issue.  There are the honest folk with the facts on their side, and then there are the unethical oil companies (Exxon leading the way) that have adopted the tobacco industry strategy of trying to sow doubt and turn facts into disputable theories, and the intellectual whores who do their bidding for money.<br /><br />2)  What's different today, apart from Al Gore's achieving global effect, is that the public now has a digital memory and digital sense-making.  The World Index of Social and Environmental Responsibility (WISER), under the leadership of Paul Hawkin,[[ASIN:0670038520 Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming]] is going to do what neither Lester Brown ([[ASIN:0393330877 Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third Edition]]) nor Lori Wallich (Seattle street demonstrations against WTO) have been able to achieve.  It's over.  The people have won.  See [[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]  The only question now is how soon we liquidate the dictators and corporations that refuse to attend to the people's needs for a sustainable earth.<br /><br />Here is my review, focusing mostly on specifics that are not in the other reviews.<br /><br />Published in 2005, this book is more relevant and more useful now that Al Gore has finally impacted on the public consciousness in a big way.  Climate change and global warming are now understood by all to be very real and very close to a tipping point.<br /><br />It is in this context that I am glad I have waited to read this book.  The author has been praised by many for combining an understanding of geopolitics with an understanding of environmental causes and effects.  Here are a few of the things that stayed with me:<br /><br />1.  Although the High-Level Threat Panel of the United Nations placed Poverty and Infectious Disease above Environmental Degradation, the author points out that Ecocide must now be seen as much more dangerous to the planet as a whole than either disease of proliferation and a nuclear event (which by the sheerest coincidence, Michael Scheuer of [[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]] has just told the NYT will happen soon--but see my review of Paul Williams' [[ASIN:1591022525 Osama's Revenge: THE NEXT 9/11 : What the Media and the Government Haven't Told You]] for a complete overview).<br /><br />2.  The author has conducted arduous research and lined up a number of case studies to support his five part framework of examining the topic of how societies choose to succeed or fail.  They are:<br /><br />a. Environmental degradation, whether man=made or natural<br />b. Climate change (as distinct from desertification, deforestation, etc.)<br />c. Hostile neighbors<br />d. Less friendly neighbors (loss of support)<br />e. Societies' responses<br /><br />3.  On this latter point, the one thing we have control over, the author reminds me of the book [[ASIN:193061814X Catastrophe & Culture: The Anthropology of Disaster (School of American Research Advanced Seminar Series)]], when he lists the following factors as causing disaster to turn into catastrophe and collapse:<br /><br />a. Lack of anticipation<br />b. Lack of perception once upon us (denial starts here)<br />c. Impact of a selfish few unobserved or uncontested by the majority<br />d. Insulated elite not realizing or caring about impacts on the majority<br />e. Continued refusal, or inability, to solve the challenges (denial continues here)<br /><br />The author emphasizes that the principal negative of globalization is that it assures a global collapse--there is no longer any insulation from diseases or other ill-effects of a collapse elsewhere.<br /><br />Following a detailed review of specific past case studies (you can spend the time in the middle of the book, or read all my other reviews for a more diverse overview), the author lists twelve factors challenging all of us today:<br /><br />1.  Destruction of natural habitats<br />2.  Over-fishing to point oceans and rivers do not replenish<br />3.  Loss of diversity (which is essential to balanced complexity)<br />4.  Soil impoverishment (top soil farming blows away the top soil)<br />5.  Peak Oil and declining availability of fossil fuels for the larger population<br />6.  Dramatic decreases in replenishable fresh water (aquifers down 1 meter each year)<br />7.  REDUCTION of solar energy due to climate change.  This was the only thing in the book I did not know already.  Climate change REDUCES the degree to which solar energy can be harvested.  This is HUGE.<br />8.  Toxic chemicals in the ground, water, and atmosphere (see my reviews of the marvelous books, [[ASIN:0262700840 Pandora's Poison: Chlorine, Health, and a New Environmental Strategy]] and [[ASIN:1578051576 Blue Frontier: Dispatches from America's Ocean Wilderness]] as well as [[ASIN:0060730897 The Blue Death: Disease, Disaster, and the Water We Drink]]<br />9.  Alien species (in sense of rabbits over-running Australia)<br />10.  Human activities<br />11.  Increased population<br />12 Increased per capita impact (i.e. an order of magnitude worse than just increased population.<br /><br />There are two paragraphs that in my view are priceless gifts from the author in this context, and the merit quoting here:<br /><br />Page 429.  \\"The remaining solution to the tragedy of the commons is for the consumers to recognize their common interests are to design, obey, and enforce prudent harvesting quotas themselves.  That is likely to happen only if a whole series of conditions is (sic) met: the consumers form a homogeneous group; they have learned to trust and communicate with each other; they expect to share a common future and to pass on the resources to their heirs; they are capable of and permitted to organize and police themselves; and the boundaries of the resource and of its pool of consumers are well defined.\\"<br /><br />Page 487.  \\"The public has the ultimate responsibility\\" to define the accountability of big business and the justice framework that big business must respect.<br /><br />The latter extract is part of the author's chapter-length observation that without big business on board, nothing the consumer groups do will matter.

0765316978|5.0|An advance copy of John Scalzi's The Last Colony arrived today. I sat down after class, telling myself I'd just read a few pages, and lost the rest of the work day. (More than once, a new John Scalzi book has done terrible things to my productivity. Thank God for tenure.) It brings to an immensely satisfying conclusion the trilogy that began with Old Man's War (which I reviewed here). Scalzi returns to John Perry as the POV character, this time in a story that's more political mystery than military sci fi.<br /><br />What the Colonial Union is up to and why becomes the critical question for Perry. Until he figures it out, after which stewing on a response becomes even more critical.<br /><br />Scalzi has written passionately about the need for science fiction to become less insular:<br /><br />\\"... if you look at the significant SF books of the last several years, there aren't very many you could give to the uninitiated reader; they all pretty much implicitly or explicitly assume you've been keeping up with the genre, because the writers themselves have. The SF literary community is like a boarding school; we're all up to our armpits in each other's business, literary and otherwise (and then there's the sodomy. But let's not go there).\\"<br /><br />\\"... Fantasy literature has numerous open doors for the casual reader. How many does SF literature have? More importantly, how many is SF perceived to have? Any honest follower of the genre has to admit the answers are \\"few\\" and \\"even fewer than that,\\" respectively. The most accessible SF we have today is stuff that was written decades ago by people who are now dead.\\"<br /><br />\\"Thanks to numerous horrifying lunchroom experiences growing up, SF geeks are probably perfectly happy to be let alone with their genre and to let the mundanes read whatever appalling chick lit and/or Da Vinci Code clone they're slobbering over this week (Now, there would be a literary mashup for the ages: The Templars Wore Prada! It'd sell millions!).\\"<br /><br />But not Scalzi. Instead, he's been writing immensely accessible novels (except maybe The Android's Dream, which tellingly is my least favorite of his novels to date). Despite its SF trappings, for example, TLC reminds me more of Allen Drury's novels of political suspense, with a little Robert Ludlum-style wheels within wheels conspiracy theory story thrown in too, than it does most SF. Indeed, to continue the analogy to political thrillers, there's even a subplot that's a variant on the good old sleeping killer story. All of which means that, if Tor can manage the marketing trick, the OMW to TLC trilogy ought to reach readers who ordinarily would never be caught dead in the sci fi section of their bookstore.<br /><br />Perry's solution to his political problems has considerable elegance, as does Scalzi's plotting and writing. (No hack writer he.) The pace is quick, and the plot is taut. There aren't a lot of subplots and most of them end up being essential. (There's one subplot involving spears whose purpose I haven't quite figured out and about which I won't say more for risk of offering spoilers. But once you've read it, maybe you can explain to me whether that story line is anything more than local color.)<br /><br />Do you need to have read the first two books in the series for TLC to make sense? No. As one reviewer has written: \\"John Scalzi has styled this novel to stand well on it's own. The book starts with great humor that brings the reader into the story easily and comfortably. You never get the feeling that your starting from the back of the series. John gives you two pages of intro in John Perry's universe and then blasts off.\\"<br /><br />Having said that, however, you'd be missing a real treat.

0915811774|5.0|I have read a lot of books on spiritual subjects,  and Orin / Sanaya books are so far the most lovingly written.    I love the way they are so easy to understand,  nothing too scientific or mysterious.    They have put it like it was just common sense we human beings have long forgotton.   As you read their books, you will feel that something inside has changed slightly.   The power of the book itself is amazing !   While reading Soul Love,  I feel like I am so blessed and loved !!!  Thank you !
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Intelligence is what is diminishing on this planet.  <br /> <br />Every scientist of stature knows that pollution and SUVs are NOT the cause of global warming.   <br /> <br />Warming is happening on every planet on the solar system. That's right. Look it up. You don't have to be a professor to realize aliens are not driving SUVs on Neptune's moon Tritan. And we haven't spotted factories on Mars, yet. <br /> <br />You don't need a college degree to understand that it's the solar cycle. Yes, a cycle, global warming trends happen cyclically. The last trend was from the 9th to 13th century. Then there was a freezing trend, to the point wher in the 1700s you had what was termed a \\"minnie ice age\\". Fort Tyron park in Washington Heights was denuded because it was so cold they burned all the trees they could find to stay warm. Al Gore would have had apoplexy.  <br /> <br />In the 70's everyone was ranting about a coming Ice Age. We're going to look back on Al Gore and the ilk and LAUGH at them for their groundless fears! <br /> <br />Al Gore is hard to respect in general. He claimed to have invented the internet for pete's sake, and people are listening to him? He's a lunatic. What uneducated High School drop outs would listen to a dolt like that? Prattle on and on about himself and his fears. Ahh, Kofi Annan tunes in, of course. He wants to divert attention away from all his scandals and abusing the oil for food program. So, we are trying to feed the poor, and then the head of the UN takes that money into his own pockets. Such a nobel bunch of hoodlums. And people applaud and buy their films and drool over their fear mongering.  <br /> <br />No one is advocating pollution, btw. We face a more immediate threat of being terrorized by suicidal bombers than a melting ice berg.  <br /> <br />Grow up and calm down.  <br /> <br />Personally, I enjoy a warmer climate.
0060916540|4.0|I like this type of story a lot. In old Outdoor Life they used to be called \\"THIS HAPPENED TO ME..\\" (caps intended). I always hate it when they take some hardship like being stuck in the car for a couple of days without water and make each tick of the clock seem like the end of the world. This book is the linear opposite. The hardships come through, but the writing is almost never sensational- it is understated if anything. It begins at a leisurely pace, much like the journey of Joe Simpson and his climbing partner Yates. As the tension increases we know the big Accident is around the corner, but when it finally happens it seems routine, and Simpson makes evident how fragile life can be- that a pretty simple turn of events can have disatrous consequences. I suppose it's no spoiler, since we know he wrote the book, to let it be known that he survives a broken leg and a 100 foot drop above 19,000 feet, and manages to crawl his way back to camp when everyone thought he was dead. For a first-time author he does a tremendous job of relating this story, and it is even more realistic without the touches of a ghost writer or heavy handed editor.<br /><br />It's hard to find a real weakness, other than the story itself doesn't seem to totally capture what must've been the sheer horror of the journey, and the dialogue and characters are not quite as sympathetic as one would expect, probably due to some first person modesty. In any case, this is a minor complaint, and I highly, highly recommend this book for anyone who likes adventure/outdoor literature.
0800111680|5.0|William Holden may be the star of the film but Alec Guinness leaves an indelible image as the inimitable British Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as the powerfully weak Colonel Saito. William Holden's character and predicament almost seem secondary to the central plot. The true substance of the story lies in the conflict and irony between Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and the morality of British soldiers building a bridge for the enemy to the best of their abilities. The bridge is central to the plot and it takes on symbolic meaning as both a monument to British ingenuity and the inept weakness of their Japanese captors. Malcolm Arnold's score is most memorable for his use of Kenneth Alford's \\"Colonel Bogey March.\\" This full is full of indelible sights and sounds. The unique look of the bridge structure over the River Kwai, the \\"Colonel Bogey March\\" and the scene where Alec Guinness falls on the plunger of the detonator box rigged to blow up the bridge have lived with me ever since I saw this film as a kid. That was a longtime ago, a time well remembered that only exists in my memory now. Adapted from Pierre Boulle's novel the screenplay (credited to Boulle) was written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who received their Academy Awards, posthumously, in 1985.
B000M341QE|4.0|In \\"The Departed\\" (2006) directed by Martin Scorcese, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is young police officer who has been sent undercover to work for a vicious and powerful Boston mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) was handpicked by Costello as a young boy and placed to the Police Academy with the intention to infiltrate later the Boston Police Department. One day, two young men will inevitably meet...<br /><br />\\"The Departed\\" is a very good film but sadly, it slows down in the final 20 or so minutes and leaves a viewer (yours truly) with several questions and slightly disappointed. Seems that Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello kept all parts of the movie together and after his departure, it became literally empty. As for directing, Martin Scorsese is in the top his form -the movie is well paced, suspenseful, and has a great soundtrack (as usual in Scorsese movies). The cast is the closest to perfect it could be. As much as I like Jack Nicholson, it was nothing he has not done before (his Frank Costello is a combination of Daryl Van Horne and Col. Nathan R. Jessep) but Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan played the best role of his career. About a year ago, I wrote about his acting in Scorcese's previous movie, \\"The Aviator\\", \\"Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction.\\" I am very glad to admit that in \\"The Departed\\" he is even better - the hell Billy Costigan has lived in working undercover for the devilishly evil Frank Costello was absolutely real, suffocating and palpable. DiCaprio had many scenes with Nicholson and he never got lost next to his celebrated partner.<br /><br />Not as perfect as \\"Goodfellas\\" which comes to mind while watching \\"The Departed\\", the newest Scorcese's work is a lot of fun to watch - it is an inspiring film-making, and I am happy that finally Scorsese has been recognized by the Academy for his directing.s a lot of fun to watch - it is an inspiring film-making, and I am happy that finally Scorsese has been recognized by the Academy for his directing.  <br /> <br />
B000KCHZK6|4.0|I was eagerly awaiting Norah Jones' third album, but - after reading all the negative reviews - felt a little apprehensive about buying it until I heard it first.  What I did hear was very relaxing, kind of folksy/bluesy and very enjoyable.  Norah's voice - as always - is as smooth as \\"buttah.\\" Among my favorite tunes: \\"Wish I Could,\\" \\"Sinkin' Soon,\\" \\"My Dear Country\\" and the title track.  There are some tunes that are strictly background - and somewhat forgettable - but I thought the album as a whole was very good.

B000I5X81A|3.0|Very disappointing as I expected new, fresh music but got an entire CD of sameness.  Vocals are a muddy duet.  The instrumentals are good but for some reason there is an organ/electric piano that becomes very irritating about half way thru listening.  Can't figure out why it was felt to be necessary.  Sort of like listening to a group in a lounge, who thinks they can write music.
B000MCH5TK|4.0|Babel is a movie based on a series of misunderstandings, and links the unfortunate circumstances of a Moroccan, an American, a Mexican and a Japanese family all through a rifle. A Moroccan family gets a rifle to protect their goats. The father lets his 2 sons use it while he runs errands. They want to see if the rifle can really shoot as far as they were told. They practice by shooting at the tiny cars below the hill that they are on. The youngest brother ends up hitting an American woman, on a bus tour with her husband. By the time the press gets a hold of the story they label the incident as a \\"terrorist attack\\". The same couple's children are being taken care of by their caretaker. The caretaker decides to take the kids to Mexico to attend her son's wedding. On their way back in to the U.S they face a few problems when it is discovered the women has been living in the U.S. as an illegal alien. A Japanese father is having trouble communicating with his deaf teenage daughter. The girl has been craving human affection ever since the death of her mother. All the stories are linked by the rifle. Brad Pitt and Rinko Kikuchi who plays the Japanese girl give great performances. All this probably sounds confusing but in the end it will all make sense. Brad Pitt and Rinko Kikuchi who plays the Japanese girl give great performances. BRAD PITT gives his best performance only after FIGHT CLUB. The one thing I did not like about this movie was the ending, which left me wanting to know more. The blu-ray disc of BABEL has amazing picture and sound but no bonus material what's so ever. Babel is a entertaining, yet sad movie that is worth taking a look at. Babel is up against The Departed for this years Best Picture Awards at the Oscars. I enjoyed this film but to me The Departed was a better movie and will most likely take home Best Picture Oscar.
0345479092|5.0|I recommend this book to every parent, but ESPECIALLY those who struggle with a colicky newborn, and who are in desperate need of rest, or who don't know where to turn for help. Our daughter had colic and nothing seemed to soothe her. We tried everything; nothing worked. Evenings turned into nights turned into mornings without any sleep for any of us. As joyful as we felt at our daughter's arrival, by week 4 we were all 3 miserable from sleep deprivation! (And I was trying to nurse and recover from a c-sec.) A friend handed me this book and even though I already had no time to eat or sleep, I read a couple chapters. And that was all it took to literally change our lives overnight.  After we put our daughter on the E.A.S.Y. routine, in a matter of DAYS, we had a textbook baby. She is still spirited, but she CRAVED that routine, and once she got it she was so much happier! It was like someone waved a majic wand, and suddenly there was sanity! If you are at your wits end, try this! <br />We had tried other baby books too, and for our colicky baby, we found it better to stay away from those that tell you to let the baby put him/herself into a routine, or the ones that tell you to rock and swing and bounce the baby around. That was way too much stimulation for our sensitive baby! <br />I also recommend the Miracle Blanket swaddle. It's pricier than the rest, but found it to be the only one that worked. It holds up great too.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|While I'll probably be considered a grouch for giving this Critic's Darling of a film a negative review, American movie goers have for the last few years been subjected to an ever-decreasing lack of originality on the part of Hollywood. In addition, the story of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" seems to be repeated endlessly, with the public mindlessly buying whatever Hollywood sends down the assembly line. While there are worse things than being merely boring (\\"offensive\\" comes to mind), far too many films seem to be embraced by the movie-going public in spite of their having nothing to offer. In the case of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\", the \\"original idea\\" is to make a comedy about a disfunctional family who take a \\"road trip\\". Back in 1983 there was such a comedy. It was called \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\", and starred Chevy Chase. The creators of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" are hoping that the viewer has either never seen \\"Vacation\\", or that he or she has forgotten it, because \\"Vacation\\" is the \\"original\\" idea that has been copied here. Sadly, while \\"Vacation\\" was indeed hilarious, \\"Sunshine\\" manages to be odd without being funny. If you really want to see a humorous film about a (somewhat)dysfunctional family on a road trip, check out \\"Vacation\\". If you want to see a pale immitation that fails to entertain, \\"Sunshine\\" is for you.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|I saw this movie in the theater the day that it came out. The whole point of the movie basiclly is about a group of college kids that go to amsterdam in search of a good time but instead a bunch of other stuff happens it was so far fetched violence wise the i could not stop laughing and at the part where the woman gets her eye torched and all that stuff starts comming out i just about choked on the root beer but anyway if you want a movie filled with cheap gore and lots of sex than you will probably like this

B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel is a movie based on a series of misunderstandings, and links the unfortunate circumstances of a Moroccan, an American, a Mexican and a Japanese family all through a rifle. A Moroccan family gets a rifle to protect their goats. The father lets his 2 sons use it while he runs errands. They want to see if the rifle can really shoot as far as they were told. They practice by shooting at the tiny cars below the hill that they are on. The youngest brother ends up hitting an American woman, on a bus tour with her husband. By the time the press gets a hold of the story they label the incident as a \\"terrorist attack\\". The same couple's children are being taken care of by their caretaker. The caretaker decides to take the kids to Mexico to attend her son's wedding. On their way back in to the U.S they face a few problems when it is discovered the women has been living in the U.S. as an illegal alien. A Japanese father is having trouble communicating with his deaf teenage daughter. The girl has been craving human affection ever since the death of her mother. All the stories are linked by the rifle. All this probably sounds confusing but in the end it will all make sense. Brad Pitt and Rinko Kikuchi who plays the Japanese girl give great performances. BRAD PITT gives his best performance only after FIGHT CLUB. The only thing I did not like about this movie was the ending, which left me wanting to know more. This is a great film but not an amazing one. Babel is up against The Departed for this years Best Picture Awards at the Oscars. I enjoyed this film but to me The Departed was a better movie and will most likely take home Best Picture Oscar.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|It wasn't aiming deep and it didn't have much of a strong theme, like the Matrix or Star Wars, but it was a lot of fun to watch.  All the characters worked well and it wasn't dumbed down or slowed down for a mass-audience. It was pretty amazing that he was able to jam so much plot and quirky personality into just two hours. <br /> <br />Whedon wrote this as fun, light sci-fi entertainment and it was a great success, far better than the dreck usually found on the sci-fi network.  The reviews testify - everyone liked it.  I hope he gets to make a sequel.

It is worlds better than the recent Keira Knightley version, whose weak interpretation of the role of Lizzie made me appreciate Jennifer Ehle even more.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Al Gore is a pompous, obese, mind-numbingly opportunistic sack of horsefeathers, and no amount of liberal hand-wringing is going to repair the San Andrean-sized cracks in HIS humpty skull. I would like to ask Gore and all of his band of lemming-brained, hemp-huffing tree-huggers: What Is Your Goal? To keep CO ommissions at current levels? At past levels? WHICH past? Pre-industrial revolution past? New deal past? Monica-on-her-knees past? Do we cut off all industry today or tomorrow? Do we implement Kyoto without China and India and pretend that it's okay to simply ignore 2/3 of the human race?<br /><br />A power point presentation about how we're all gonna die unless we --what? Turn over control of the world to Al and Tipper?<br /><br />Get a grip, children. Then set your blackberries on stun.
B00003CWPR|5.0|Don't discount this film because you are dismayed by Tom Cruise. This film is excellent and a must see. The symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look. Attempt to ignore good old Tom and rekindle your love for him pre-insanity. Kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie, as he should.

1582701709|1.0|I read this in 2 days, says alot about the depth of writing in this book. Before ANYONE event THINKS about buying this book I urge them to read the article in the Feb 26, 2007 issue of Newsweek magazine. You will certainly have your eyes opned very wifde after learning exactly how this book came to be and the \\"magic\\" that happened after it was named The Secret.  <br /> <br />There is absolutely nothing is this book that is new, groundbreaking or a secret fo that matter. This simply is a marketing gimmick to make money for the publisher and the author, an Australian television producer - exactly the person to tell the world how to cope with life's day to day challenges. <br /> <br />People, wake up and grow up. Just my wishing for riches or health does not and will nto make it happen - just as this books says it will. There are literally hundreds of books out there by people who have actual credentials that actually offer real advice, advice that one can use in their day to day lives to make real changes. My advice, IMHO, is to research these authors at your local library, Google, Amazon, etc. and read several of them. Then take this book and use it as a doorstop or use it to help start your next BBQ. Because in all honesty this is about all this book is good for.
1590171993|5.0|The moment I started to read this book, I did not want it to end, and I took my time to finish it. His prose is basic, masterful. It's a wonder how a book is so simple while embodying such complexities of thought and character. It's hard to pinpoint the brilliance. Upon finishing the book, I felt it in my gut and left me in a funk for the rest of the day. It's a complement of high regard.
B000M341QE|1.0|I would personally like to thank the Academy for giving out the Oscar to this year's WORST movie. I'd like to thank Jack for giving out the WORST performance in his lifetime career for being so stupid on screen, To Leo, Matt, Mark, Alec, & Martin Sheen for displaying some weak supporting role performances, and to Mr. Scorsese for winning his Academy Oscar for putting the word F**K into the vocabulary. We're so ashamed of you! Also, I'd like to thank WB Pictures for screwing everything up, And evidentally, this film should've won The Razzies Instead. also, Ooops-music cues to \\"Mr. Movieman\\" Don Lafontaine-I have to go...
B0009UC7HA|4.0|Clive Cussler's books featuring Dirk Pitt have always been a favorite of mine.  That's a bit of a guilty pleasure.  Cussler's characters could better be called caricatures.  His plots are also larger than life -- no one could suspend disbelief enough to think that the things Cussler dreams up for his hero Dirk Pitt could ever happen in real life.<br /><br />But that does not stop me from enjoying the books.  Cussler's lively imagination captures me in his make-believe world for a time.  And his almost self-parodying characters always entertain as an escape from real life people.<br /><br />The movie Sahara is the same way.  It's just as fun to watch as the book Sahara is to read.<br /><br />Yes, it's true that the movie does not follow the book.  That's probably a good thing.  Cussler's novels would not translate well to the movie screen if the translation were too direct.  Cussler's intricate plotting, his attention to detail (as in his detailed description of each classic car that appears in any book), and his rather cartoonish dialogue work in his books.  They would look foolish in a movie.<br /><br />As a movie, Sahara works best as a family picture.  Adults will probably find it entertaining enough.  Children will find it easy to understand, with enough humor and surprises to keep their interest.<br /><br />Definitely not a must-see film.  But everyone in our family liked it.  Both adults, and both children.  Everyone thumbs up.  That's pretty rare.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|This album reminds me of going out on saturday night, getting drunk and having sex with many women. There is so much influence in this music- from Elton John to Jamiroquai to even the Bravery. They keep it pumping in 4/4 time for the majority of the disc. They rock live as well, I saw one of their concerts on HDNet. This is a disc worth popping in the cd player and spending an evening with your lover, or if your driving to work and need to get psyched up for the day. Always put me in a good mood.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|I own a Playstation 3, which has a built-in Blu-Ray player.  The Terminator is one of my all time favorite movies, so when I saw it on Blu-Ray at Best Buy, I had to have it.  I was skeptical at first, considering the movie was made in 1984, over 20 years ago.  I was not sure that the movie could be restored or remastered into 1080p, High Definition.  But when I played the movie on my Blu-ray player, it totally met and exceeded all my expectations.<br /><br />On top of the amazingly detailed visuals, there are also some pretty cool bonus features on the DVD.  I paid almost $30.00 for the movie, Amazon is currently selling it for $19.99.  That's a steal.  Buy it if you're a Terminator fan.  I've already got T2 on Blu-ray and just need T3 to complete my Terminator collection on Blu-ray.<br /><br />The only reason I only gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars is because it the movie is outdated.  The special effects, just are not up to par with modern day flicks.
B00003CXD0|5.0|Dustin Hoffman is, bar none, one of the finest actors in cinema today. Talented, bold, daring and unafraid to take roles that truly challenge his abilities as an actor. \\"The Graduate\\", \\"Midnight Cowboy\\", \\"Kramer Vs. Kramer\\" and \\"Rain Man\\" all demonstrate Hoffman's fearless attitude quite well. However, none as well as 1982's \\"Tootsie\\".<br /><br />Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a struggling, arrogant, difficult but nonetheless talented actor. Surrounded by his struggling playwright roomate Jeff (Bill Murray) and his high strung friend Sandy (Teri Garr), Michael is desparate to get his breakthrough. And he will go to any lengths to do so.<br /><br />He decides to make himself into a woman, and adopt the alter ego of Dorothy Michaels. Dorothy auditions for the role on a popular daytime soap, and wins it. Dorothy becomes a tv sensation, and Michael couldn't be happier with his success. Until he starts to develop feelings for his / her co-star, Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange), who herself sees Dorothy as a great mentor to her. To complicate manners further, Julie's father, Les (Charles Durning) has fallen for Dorothy, and wants to make her his wife.<br /><br />Things unfold in a wild, hilarious and touching manner in thsi gem of a film. Hoffman is at his best and the rest of the cast lends solid support. \\"Tootsie\\" is classic if there ever was one.
1573228737|5.0|As an English major, my favorite literature was often novels like \\"Middlemarch\\" or anything by Jane Austen.

I greatly enjoyed this novel and the complicated psychology that motivates her characters.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|In 1880's Vienna a stage magician called Eisenheim becomes celebrated for his mystifying illusions. With but a single seed he can instantly grow a mature tree; he possesses a magical looking glass which shows death within it; and most jarringly of all he seems to bring ghosts back to walk among---and accuse---the living. His demonstrations of talent catch the notice of the bullying heir to the Habsburg throne, who becomes obsessed with finding out how the deeds are done. He employs his all-purpose right-hand man to investigate Eisenheim and learn what he can. Meanwhile, this master illusionist recognizes the Prince's fianc&eacute;e as a girl he had once known in his boyhood, when he was then the son of a rural woodworker. Soon the master magician and the Prince's intended renew a love they'd felt in their youths, and a dangerous affair begins.<br /><br />The Illusionist has a satisfyingly dark feel to it. It is like watching a European art film, only done with an A-list Hollywood cast. The cobblestones and solid last-century scenery in Prague are perfect for this sort of tale, the lighting effects heighten the tension and the awesome-yet-understated on-stage demonstrations of magic Eisenheim performs are well-chosen to convey the atmosphere of the production. Also Paul Giamatti is so great in the part of the corrupt Crown Prince's not-yet-corrupted investigator that he readily becomes the film's star. Edward Norton, a generally superb actor, seems concealed in his role as the illusionist of the movie's title. By saying \\"concealed\\" it isn't that the role overwhelms him, it is more that he allows the role to be of greater essence than he as the contemporary actor, and I admire that. Also I'll note that Jessica Biel gives the most solid performance of her career as the love interest of both the stoical Eisenheim and the immoral Crown Prince Leopold.<br /><br />The Illusionist was a movie I enjoyed seeing unfold before me, even as I somehow lost interest in the plot, and was even annoyed by certain aspects of it. Despite the fact I liked this film and have nothing but praise for its visuals, there were some huge holes in it and there was a requirement that disbelief be suspended almost past the point of ready indulgence. I found it entirely ridiculous that a noblewoman engaged to marry the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (among whose members politically-advantageous marriages were arranged in infancy, not adulthood) would firstly have the sort of freedom to go about unguarded that we were expected to accept that Biel's character Sophie von Teschen did, and secondly, we were further asked to believe that the death of a woman of her status would be nonchalantly verified by other than Imperial physicians, and that her state funeral would provide access for her body to be so deftly stolen. Was there no embalming, no lying in state, no grand service? Surely there would have been, and just as surely that would have made events as described impossible. Also in historical reality, though Crown Prince Leopold's death was attributed to suicide with a pistol, it was carried out with a woman, his lover, as part of a \\"romantic\\" death pact, and the Prince was not the ambitious would-be usurping reactionary The Illusionist portrayed him to be, so in the name of storytelling history is left behind without a flicker of remorse.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a fine film to see but it isn't air-tight and it doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. It's good for its scenery and some of its performances, and especially for its stage magic, but events could never have come to pass as the twist ending tells us they did.certain aspects of it.

B000EWBKKI|4.0|I bought T1 on blu-ray and got T2 (also on Blu-ray) as a gift.  T2 is much better because the movie is newer, and special effects are more modern.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who owns a Blu-ray player and is a fan of the Terminator triology.<br /><br />Only thing that this DVD lacks are special features.  Very minimal.
B00007BKVC|5.0|I watched \\"Thelma & Louise\\" knowing it was one of the most highly acclaimed films of the 1990s'. So my expectations were already quite high when I started it. By the time it was over, to say it had met my expectations was an understatement.<br /><br />\\"Thelma & Louise\\" is one of the finest movies I've ever seen. In terms of acting, pacing, writing, cinematography and soundtrack, it is perfect in all aspects. The two main characters could've easily been cliched 2-D cutout rip-offs of Bonnie & Clyde or Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, but the script injects them with enough originality and depth to set them apart. This is also thanks to the the fantastic performances of the two leads, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, who put on tow of the finest performances in all of cinema. They are backed by a solid supporting cast including Michael Madsen and the incomparable Harvey Keitel, as well as early breakthrough role by Brad Pitt.<br /><br />The plot could've also been one dimensional and uninteresting, but writer Callie Khouri again made ot sparkle with inventive sequences, a solid mix of action, laughter and drama, and crackling dialogue.<br /><br />And the direction by cinematic auteur Ridley Scott is audacious. The last sequence is one of the most beauotful images in cinema, and it brought a bit of a tear to my eye.<br /><br />The special edition of this film is a must for all its fans, and the film itself should eb seen by all true cinema buffs.
1573229725|5.0|I've now enjoyed several novels by Sarah Waters, and each one has been satisfying.  I have an English degree, and spent most of those years enjoying this type of historical women's literature.  I love Waters' complicated female characters, and the updated lesibian sensibility that defines her stories.  This was a great story for twists and turns and \\"bad girls with hearts of gold\\" or at least tarnished sterling silver!! Can't wait for her next story!
B000G759LW|5.0|Let me first say that I'm a modern/smooth jazz fan.  I've never purchased a Christina Aguilera tape/album/record/disc in my life.  I had always placed her in the \\"naughty white girl\\" genre that Madonna made so popular, oh so long ago.   <br /> <br />When I heard a snippet of \\"Candyman\\" on a cell phone commercial, I thought it sounded interesting.  Almost immediately I tracked it down to Aguilera's \\"Back to Basics\\" disc set (ya gotta love the internet).  I listened to a few cuts on Amazon and ordered the set.  WOW... She has a HUGE voice.  I won't classify her with Tina Turner or Patti LaBelle, but she's got that kind of powerful surge to her sound.  Combine that with some compelling music (despite odd contrasting lyrics - on one cut she signs about giving someone the \\"sugar below my waist\\" and a few cuts later is asking Jesus for forgiveness) and this set is BIG fun to listen to.  Buy it and enjoy! <br />
B000000OAN|3.0|I enjoy parts of this album---the guitar solo at the end of \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\" has a tendency to grab hold of my brain and not to let go, though I love actual music hall too much to enjoy the verse and the fake old-timey sound used.    Still, I can't add much to the negative reviews here:  pretentious, sententious, overblown, overserious, overdone....all-in-all, an adolescent's idea of what \\"important\\" means.  I'll still listen, but will chase it with a shot of \\"Pretty Vacant\\" (or even \\"Get Off the Air, Rodney\\") to still my gut.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|This book may not have the meat to satisfy the scientifically hungry, yet it finds common ground that I think we can all relate.  All the profits received from this book (and the movie) will be donated to support efforts to combat global warming, so financial reward was not an enticement for creating this book.  Mr. Gore has devoted a large part of his life to politics yet this book seems hardly political.  So, where's his motivation?  I believe it is through a genuine concern for our planet and in seizing an opportunity to bring this important issue to the forefront of public discourse especially in this country.<br /><br />The book presents a set of undeniable facts supported by the global scientific community together with a plea to reverse our fate.  It is a call to turn lemons into lemonade and left me felling hopeful rather than depressed that we still have an opportunity to not only change our destiny but to find opportunity in making that change.  The end of the book sites concrete and practical suggestions that allow all of us a part in this grand plan.  I believe it's an insightful and courageous book and I'm forever grateful to Al Gore for sharing it with us.<br /><br />Update:  September 3, 2010<br /><br />I recently read my old reviews and realized the need to update a couple of them, namely this one and my review on Barrack Obama's book, The Audacity of Hope.<br /><br />I have no defence for publishing my pathetic review and naïve assessment of this book.  I was duped into believing it was a labor of love, a product of altruism, a wakeup call to save our planet!<br /><br />In reality, Al Gore is nothing more than an opportunist, a scum-sucking socialist, a liar and a fraud.  &#34;Do as I say, not as I do&#34; is the hallmark of Al Gore.  Like Barack Obama and all the rest beholden to those who will not stop until the world is totally under their control, Al Gore has done us a great disservice.<br /><br />The Fourth Reich is upon us and our national sovereignty is dissolving at an ever more rapid rate.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|This isn't a review as much as it is an observation, though I would give this album 4.5 out of 5 stars for great vocal maturity and a better rock edge than her previus release. It is simply TERRIFIC and unfortunately, rather rare to see a popular female artist who can actually play an instrument! And not just play, but totally ROCK OUT!  <br />I have always thought it was ridiculus and quite stupid that artists like Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson ever even became huge, pop- culture icon artists. Why do we fall in love with \\"artists\\" who aren't even musicians, or in Britney's case, can't even sing? (at least without a synthesizer) The pop-icon thing even sucks in good artists like Lindsay Lohan, who is quite a rockin' guitarist, and turns them into mediocre pop singers, making artists with a promising future like Lindsay into just one of the other zillion pop singers and groups.  <br />It is also nice to see an artist like Avril who doesn't feel the need to make racy videos to sell her work. She simply lets the album speak for itself, which is good because \\"Under My Skin\\" is a truly great album.  <br /> <br />Keep on rockin', Avril! <br /> <br />ps: By the way, if you like female singers who can play a mean guitar, check out Krystal Meyers. I know she's technically \\"christian\\" rock, but her stuff is easily as good as anything else out there, including Avril. Her song \\"Together\\" has been featured on the awesome NBC TV show \\"Heroes\\" and featured on the NBC website.
B00064WSNM|4.0|king crimson is the byfar the greatest & one of the most creative \\"prog\\" rock bands to come out of the late 60s/early 70s next to pink floyd & ELP. this album is no less. it doesn't top larks' tongue in aspic or in the court of the crimson king, but it stands next to them, for sure & openly defines this band as a milestone in the more experimental/art rock of the early 70s.<br /><br />if you are unfamiliar to king crimson's sound, than i'd recommend picking up the latter albums i previously stated. even to this day, king crimson still does not get the recognition they deserve, but in this day in age, maybe it was better that way. they still have countless fans the world around & are one of the most influential rock bands in past 40 years.<br /><br />long live the crimson king
B0000D8HDF|5.0|It's rare that you find a pianist as good as Cyprien Katsaris who goes through the effort to produce something as difficult and pedantic as the Liszt transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies. The result in this case is professional, passionate and articulate.<br /><br />Beethoven's symphonies are as important to the field of classical music as any other set of works. They convey the many sides of Beethoven's character and unchallenged depth while making advances to the rigid style as allowed by the contemporary rules. Liszt did a stunning job of transcribing them, maintaining every bit of depth and passion. In a way, the transcriptions are a very sophisticated performance interpretation written by a man who continued the traditions of Beethoven through a line of teachers and students.<br /><br />Katsaris provides a faithful reproduction of Liszt's transcription without the dull mechanical sheen usually found in performances of these pieces. His passion and commitment to the piece is easily heard throughout all nine symphonies. His attention to detail is fanatical and he has the presence to bring these pieces to life.<br /><br />I recommend this recording to anyone who wishes to investigate the Beethoven-Czerny-Liszt heritage and delve deeper into the hidden meaning in Beethoven's symphonies.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Maybe we're lucky that Gore was not allowed the presidency in 2000 (ok, that's way too big a stretch), but look what he's done for us since.  Even Alaska's Ted Stevens is becoming a convert.  The sound you heard was hell freezing over; that can only help retard global warming. So start screwing in the right light bulbs and parking the Hummers.  Al's told us what to do; let's do it.  Now.  And let's make damn sure our politicians start enacting green legislation instead of just talking about it.  Thanks President Al, and congrats on the Oscar.<br /><br />Update, seven years later (May 29, 2014):<br /><br />Gore gave us the right movie at the right time, and we have done little to nothing. The Arctic and Antarctic ice are entering the history books and soon we may be too. Start writing and phoning your elected officials. Demand to know what they're doing about climate change, and tell them what they need to do. If any of them start the climate-change-denial spin, hang up the phone and start campaigning for someone whose pockets aren't filled with the hands of Exxon Mobile et al. And for God's sake vote. Make climate change your number one issue - because it is.
B000GY1IN8|4.0|I bought this as an unabridged audio CD.  The narrator was tremendous, a must for Follet books.  This book has many characters with various nationalities, and the narrator moves briskly and smoothly from accent to accent.  Very helpful in keeping the characters straight.  The storyline is \\"straightforward,\\" but there are so many different characters that it is tough to remember who's who.  That's where the accents really helped!  It took about 5 of 10 Cds until I was really committed and cared if I finished the book.  After that, I was very intrigued and looked forward to returning to it to get to the climactic end.
B00000IFP6|5.0|I love it! Zinman and the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich have shattered the myths that Beethoven's metronome markings had to be a mistake, or that original instruments are needed to adhere to them.  This is a truly remarkable set, outstanding from beginning to end and delivered with studied energy, irresistible momentum, plenty of lyricism, and abiding good humor.  I would describe this Beethoven as earthy (in a romantic, anti-aristocratic, folk-dance kind of way) and wiry (small, but exceedingly strong).  One can hear and appreciate all the subtleties of the orchestration and all the lines of attack without ever losing touch with melody and cadence. Plenty of personality, too: I can listen to these performances and, occasionally at least, imagine Beethoven giving the finger to the powdered-wig crowd.      This is Beethoven at his best and most accessible: never sentimental, stodgy, puffed-up, or blown out of proportion, and always thoughtfully energetic!  Very enthusiastically recommended!    PS: Read Peter J. Lawson's online review for MusicWeb International for more detail.  He paints a better picture than I could ever hope to.  I disagree with him in his faint praise for the fifth, however.
B000LC55F2|3.0|Unfortunately, I can't share the enthusiasm of other reviewers. I honestly want to, but I disagree almost entirely with their reviews. This whole movie is a sleight of hand trick, where Christopher Nolan presents you with what you think is a quality film: renowned actors, beautiful cinematography, a supposedly well-crafted script. The problem is that you begin to see the cracks in the presentation fairly quickly.<br /><br />In a story about two rival magicians, Christian Bale tries as hard as ever to pump life into this film, while Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine put forth equal amounts of intensity, but without a solid grounding there's still not much to go with. Scarlett Johansson really drags here with a wavering English accent that annoys more each time it falters. David Bowie really stands out in an unrecognizable turn as Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />The main problem with The Prestige is that it sets itself up for failure. Imagine going to see a great magician perform an infamous trick, and as he flies over the crowd, the strings holding him up become visible. You'd be utterly disappointed, and that's what watching this film is like. Each twist is either entirely predictable or so far-fetched that it belongs in the realm of science fiction.<br /><br />There's just something missing in this film that will ultimately leave audience members feeling like they've been tricked. And I guess that's the point of a good magic show, but with a good magic show, you shouldn't really be able to point out HOW you've been tricked should you?
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|There are so many reviews and opinions written about this movie that it would be difficult to add something unique. However I would like to emphasize that what really stands out from this movie is the directing the and reproduction of Titanic.  The scene of the engines was extrodinary.
B000IU3Y1O|5.0|I love this compilation. All the great songs in 1 CD!
B0002CHIJW|5.0|This movie is great. Artistic in a sick way. Sort of has a feminist flavor too it, but in a cool way. Definently a morality message underneath. also, Theres a classic scene that will traumatize any man who watches this film.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I've owned the original CD since it's initial release in the '80s, and I've always felt that it sounded flat and lifeless, so I ordered this remaster with hope of at least modest improvement. After fetching it from the mailbox, I popped it in my player, hit play, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This disc has depth, dynamics, warmth, and perfect tonal balance - all way beyond anything I had hoped for. Who remastered it? Doug Sax. He and his company, The Mastering Lab, do a lot of work for audiophile labels, and he is considered by many to be the best in the business. Apparently he was given a lot of freedom on this project, because even the volume level isn't jacked up to todays record company norms. He gave it plenty of headroom and no noticeable compression, and it sounds sweet! This is an audiophile quality disc for the price of standard admission. I wish they'd clone this guy.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|You better believe it and not just for the tykes, although they'll get it right away and the grown ups may take a day or so. <br /> <br />This one of those wonderful fables that come along and make film magic. Is Chris Cringle really Santa Claus? \\"The New York State Supreme Cout declared it and personally and professionally I agree.\\" Is Snoopy really a World War I fighter pilot ace? The Royal Gaurdsmen had a best selling single and who could argue with that? And does Old Weird Harrold really need to steal five baby coach wheels so he can have a Contiental kit on his go-cart? Heeey, heey, heeey, you wouldn't question Fat Albert would you? <br /> <br />And you won't question Nanny McPhee.  <br /> <br />The film has just the right blend of humor, action, romance and magic, on the screen and in the hearts of the viewers. <br /> <br />This is just another example of the unlimited talents of Emma Thompson. The Academy has all ready awarded her one Oscar and it won't be her last. She writes, acts and charms everyone with a grace not seen on film since the days of Cary Grant's thieves and scoundrels. <br /> <br />In fact if there is a flaw it is that Miss Thompson hides her beauty for the bulk of this film under heavy make up. She is so vital, animated and witty it is a shame that she finds characters that don't make use of this aspect of her skills. <br /> <br />Now get some kids, hijack the grandkids and load the DVD player and settle back with popcorn oozing real butter and plates of Milk Duds and Red Hots and pretend that you wanted the kids to see this.
B00009PAY9|4.0|I bought Bride of Chucky because I am a Chucky fan and a Katherine Heigl fan. If you don't know anything about the series, Bride of Chucky is the most recent of the Child's Play films starring a disturbing-looking doll named Chucky who has been possessed by the spirit of a serial killer. <br /> <br />Bride of Chucky is obviously not going to win any Academy Awards, but it does have some surprisingly good production, even though the script leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not going to write a synopsis of the movie because, if you are familiar with the Child's Play movies, then you've probably already seen it. And if you're not familiar with them, my scintillating recap won't do the film justice. Let me put it this way: possessed rubber dolls, plenty of gory violence, and the sublime Miss Heigl in all her Panavision glory. <br /> <br />The reason I titled this Who Knew is because I doubt anyone knew at the time this film was made that Alexis Arquette would eventually go full-on transvestite, or that Katherine Heigl would eventually star in one of the biggest shows on prime time television. I for one had a hunch she was destined for greatness, but I'm a sucker for beautiful women. One last Who Knew: who knew Jennifer Tilly would eventually become a professional poker player and win the WPT Ladies' Championship? Maybe she did...

B000K7VHQE|1.0|This is a film only a critic could love. You have to get paid to watch such a mean-spirited, dreary movie. It could have been fun but the writer or director, (Always suspect the Director, writers have almost no impact in Hollywood.), soon eliminated any spark of sunshine from the script. This is a road trip that makes Robin William's RV look like a serious, intellectual project. <br />Do yourself a big favor and rent this before you buy it. You could spend the same money on sweets and at least get a sugar rush. <br />
B000JJ4GW0|2.0|I have been a die hard U2 fan since, well, a long time... until their let's-play-it-safe-music-by-formula new albums All that you can leave behind and How to dismantle an atomic bomb.<br /><br />That fact that this new plot for $$$ totally misses their best music blows me away... I know, I know this one is for casual fans based on the popularity of the songs, and boy!!! do this compilation pales in comparison to their best (Not necessarily most commercial) songs.<br /><br />Missing gems: I will follow, Twilight, Gloria, October, Drowning man, Two hearts beat as one, Indian summer sky, the unforgettable fire, The fly, even better than the real thing, Numb, LEMON (LEAVING THIS ONE OUT IS UNFORGIVABLE), Dirty days, Discotheque, Gone, do you feel loved, Last night on earth, if God will send his angels, Staring at the sun and the ground beneath her feet.<br /><br />Any combination of those songs plus With or without you, one, vertigo and new year's day woulds have swiped the floor with this \\"18 singles\\" joke<br /><br />If you are looking for U2's best music driven by teenage will or experimentation buy the Boy-October-War and Actung-Zooropa-Discotheque trilogies.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />PS: Yes I know the singles are the ones that got released and were given airplay and stuff, but it still blows me away how they re-sell the same old tired (once great) songs

0553582461|3.0|*******Spoilers********* <br /> <br />Hobb is now in my top 5 favorite authors.  This is an amazing, wonderful epic story (the first 3 Farseers and the 3rd Fools books), very much worth reading.  However,  <br /> <br />I recently finished the 6th book of the Fitz's books and am soo disappointed by the hollow and emotionally stunted ending to a truly wonderful epic.  I can only imagine that she did not, for some reason(s), have the emotional space to process a more appropriate and emotionally fleshed-out ending.  How she deal with Burrich, the Fool and Molly in the end just didn't seem to fit...  I put down the book with 'oh dear' and felt like something really valuable had been left out.  I was so invested in these books, I wept over Nighteyes's passing...  I expected to feel something more than \\"oh\\" at the end of this story.  I wonder if she was just burnt out or if the publishers came down hard with a deadline to meet?  What ever the reason, the other books are a 5 and this one a 3, for it was such a disappointment.  However, she is a truly gifted writer.
0143035711|5.0|The author has a easy to read come-a-long with me style of writing that works exceptionally well given that he by-in-large avoids the politics except as they intersect in the daily life of an army pilot making these rare scenes very compelling such as Bob in is Saigon hotel on R&R contemplating the question, \\"Why don't the Vietnamese fight the VC like the VC fight the Vietnamese?\\"  We share these thought with Bob as if for the first time in spite of the many years that have passed.  The understanding that the war was not \\"winable\\" the way it was being fought  dawns on both the author and the reader and we share the author's dispair.    The air action scenes are the best ever put to pen and the best ever likely to emerge from the SE Asian conflict.  The author exhibits a rare and powerful ability to paint vivid scenes with a great economy of words that makes the text both crisp and very fast paced.    Honesty and rye humor coexist with raw human emotions of grief, injustice, fear and anger providing an authentic feel as the author spares no one especially himself a good hard look in the mirror and in spite of his defects the author becomes an unlikely hero who you can't help but like and this makes the closing lines so very painful.     Chickhawk is the best book produced for laymen on airmoble warfare and is certainly in the running for the best book ever about the Vietnam war.
B000002B5L|4.0|I remember when this first came out 11 years ago I was in 8th grade and almost half the album was hit singles, and multi million copies were sold so I had to pick up the album again (I lost my old one). Wyclef, Lauren Hill and Pras defintiely regorouped after their 1st album didn't create much buzz, and this is the best work any of them have done, before or after the album. All 3 have very different styles but they blend them so well together through the whole album. With 15 songs (2 are remixes), you get 4 ok songs, 1 I skip, the rest are mostly real good songs. Geusts are on 4 songs, and Wyclef has 2 solo's and Lauren has 1. Production is nice as well, with the Fugees doing 10 of the 15 songs, Jean Forte does 2 songs, Diamond D , Salaam Remi and Handel Tucker each do 1 song.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|Whar a marvelous little movie! It's literate and thoughtful: a dangerous cobination for Hollywood box office returns.  Similar to \\"Little Miss Sunshine,\\" it doesn't go into any preconceived directions.  We think we know where it's headed but we don't. <br /> <br />Emma Thompson looks absolutely awful--and that's a compliment! She's not afraid to go without makeup and take on the character's ragged appearance.  I loved the scenes between Dustin Hoffman and Farrell. <br />Sometimes the smartest people just get it all wrong. <br /> <br />My guess is that Will Farrell's name was enough to keep many people away from this movie. <br />

B000ICL3KG|1.0|More hysteria from the High Priest of the First Church of the Warming Globe. <br /> <br />Al Gore desperately wants folks to believe that man-made global warming is a huge problem, and that the solution is more government control over our lives (i.e., more socialism -- yuck). <br /> <br />Problem is, global warming is not primarily man-made. The last major ice age ended roughly 10,000 years ago; the earth has been in a general warming trend since then. <br /> <br />Hey Al -- how many SUVs and factories were around 10,000 years ago to kick off the lastest global warming trend?

B00006JJ2Y|5.0|Lou Reed is a genius and deserves the right to artistic experiments like this one. Remembering my vinyl copy I believe it was recorded with two microphones encased in something resembling a human head (I am not kidding) which may be what is holding back a pristine remastering. I don't have the inclination to buy this yet but the best cut is 'I wanna be black' which is totally different that what appeared on the studio release earlier. I went to the Bottom Line several times during his reign there (he seemed to play there every 6 months, one year my girlfriend's b-day, our anniversary, my b-day....)This cd does capture the madness of those days. We eventually took enough friends to capture a back table and almost got thrown out for pounding our beer bottles on the table if I am not mistaken. This release was one of those nights where it sounds like he pounded back about 5 coffees and a pack of cigarettes before jumping on stage....I am just sorry I haven't been able to follow his art like I used to, lost faith around the 'drinking in public' period. Ever hear his Rock and Roll heart release? <br />
B000M341QE|5.0|After recent dismal efforts (the ludicrous \\"Gangs of New York\\" and (who cares about Howard Hughes) \\"The Aviator\\"), Martin Scorsese came roaring back with \\"The Departed.\\" Featuring stunningly original performances from Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, the film is based on the Asian film, \\"Infernal Affairs\\". \\"The Departed\\" blasts along with curious twists and turns that will keep you guessing and exclaiming your excitement for 2 and a half hours. And it feels like 90 minutes, this film is so good. The music, both soundtrack (Stones and other great songs) and score, rocks. One of the best cop films I have seen in years. You will love it! Highly recommended.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The sheer brilliance of the trick is in its simplicity, I will say no more lest i give something away.  The fact that Borden has fooled even the closest eye, the people who watch him day in and day out, really says something about his character, and all human characters, really. The dedication to the thing is such that I have rarely seen.  The movie is about committment to love, be it for person place or thing.  The women in the movie are of litle importance.  The competing magicians are after the love of the game, the high from performing, the competition of one-upping the other, and knowing that they are on top.  The emotional investment of the protagonists IS something to work oneself for, and yes to kill for!! That obsession, the glassy eyed look when it runs through the mind, the way the heart races! It is true of all who have ever felt that they would live or die for something. That, my good people, is the magic in this movie.  Perhaps those who have thought the magicians in this movie foolish (after all it is just a bag of tricks) have never truly loved anything quite enough. <br /> <br />

B00006RY6W|4.0|My advice? Don't waste your time spending big bucks on the SACD version of this great CCR classic. I've listened to it alongside the 20bit K2 mastered version and I actually prefer the K2 version. I've got a lot of SACD's and played both on my Sony SACD player. I can't see the purpose of this realease at all. If it comes down to money I think you will be more than happy with the K2 release. Also, the SACD is not a multi-channel release so you won't find anything new with this mix. Overall as any familar with CCR knows, this is a solid gold 5 star classic. So, any fan of great rock and roll needs to own it. Just don't waste your money on this hybrid SACD release.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This CD is perfect for those of Irish heritage or for people who enjoy celtic music. Even if you you are neither, the voices and sounds of the cd will wow you and make you appreciate the music.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|\\"The Illusionist\\" is a remarkable movie on all levels.  It is the timeless story of love dashed by the caste system, but reborn again despite all odds.  The performances of Edward Norton and Paul Giamati are splendid; I'm sure their best works to date.  The cinematography is brilliant as well as is the costuming; you swear you are in the turn of 20th century Vienna. And the tale of this rekindled love and the myssterious magician who sets out to vanquish his opressors will keep you spellbound.  I must admit I did correctly guess the ending, but it did nothing to take away the suspense I felt while watching this grand film.  Having read a number of works on Houdini and his captivation of audiences in the early 1900's, I could really get a feel for the awe and yes, fright that the audiences truly had when seeing the remarkable work of the illusionist and it is captured here in splendid fashion.  I rate this a must see- do yourself a favor and rent or buy this film as soon as you can.
1582701709|2.0|There is no secret about the information contained in this book. The concept of creating your own reality is quite old. Wayne Dyer writes about it in The Power of Intention. Norman Vincent Peale writes about it in The Power of Positive Thinking. There's another book called As a Man Thinketh, which leads me to my point. This concept is in the Bible itself. Jesus said if you believe, you can say to a mountain, \\"Get up and throw yourself into the sea and it will be done.\\"
B000001FSR|4.0|if you don't already have this cd, i want to know why? who told you you don't need this? did your old lady say you don't need this? did she wake up with a wild hair up her behind and say something like, \\"Leroy, we already have sooo many cds!\\" well, don't listen to your old lady. you need this. if you don't have this cd, you definitely need it. you're gonna be comin home from work and sittin down to drink a few forties and you're gonna need somethin just right to listen to. and this is the cd that is just right for that moment. so forget what the old lady says, get this cd now.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|(I had to put 1 star because I couldn't choose zero.) <br />I rented this movie so I could see it before the Oscars but I could not find the enchantment that everyone proclaims it to have. The acting was excellent and the story's concept is very original but the style of this film left me frustrated and not because I was engrossed with the story but because I wanted this thing to just end already. The pace of this film just dragged and dragged and dragged to the point of absolute agony!!! While watching the film I felt he could have finished the movie a 1/2 hour ago. Only one other movie left me with a feeling like I lost 2 hours of my life and that was Amores Perros. Before seeing this film (Babel) I didn't know he also directed Amores Perros because the style (in the direction) of both films in my opinion were very similar. I think it's very safe to say that if you did not like Amores Perros (Dog's Love) you will not like this one. I found the overall style of the film to be overly dramatic for drama's sake. This movie prolonged to the point that I lost interest in the characters and could care less what happened to them. I was finding myself begging Cate Blanchett's character to just die so that maybe the movie would finally end, and I'm a huge fan of Cate Blanchett so this is not a good thing.  <br />I will say one positive thing about this film and that is the performance by Adriana Barraza. She was the only character I felt anything for because her performance manage to keep some ioda of interest, but unfortunately not enough to win me over to this film.  <br />I understand many people find this man a genius and he may have struck a chord with many people, but this director doesn't strike it with me and I would like 2 hours and 23 minutes of my life back. I hate to say this about any director especially a Latin director being a Latina myself and I truly hope one day I can see the genius in this director but right now unfortunately, I don't see it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Let me just say that, I really didn't have any high expectations for this movie. I saw it as a preview while I was waiting until the movie I paid to see began. Frankly, at this point, I'm thinking..right? A movie about magicians, that should be interesting. I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. There isn't too much that I can say that hasn't already been said, but this movie isn't for simple minds. I actually had to watch this movie at least 3 times, and each time, I discovered something new. You really have to pay close attention to this one because if you miss anything you will be lost. I don't wanna spoil the ending, but depending on the person, I guess it could be interpreted 3 different ways. However, I wanna get to the meat of the story. This movie is about 2 magicians, Robert Angier, played by Hugh Jackman, and Alfred Borden, played by Christian Bale. Robert is known as \\"The Great Danton\\", and he obviously has more showmanship than fellow magician. Alfred is known as \\"The Professor\\", and he obviously is known for obviously being the better magician, but with no stlye. At any rate, a magic trick goes horribly wrong, and results in the death of Angier's wife for which he blames Borden. Thus, starting the fued of all fueds, the rivalry of all rivalries. They now dedicate themselves to destroying each other's lives. That includes everything from stealing each others tricks to sabatoging each others magic shows. This movie is ultimately about revenge, and how that revenge turns into an ugly obsession, and how that obsession can consume your entire life, and that usually leads to death, destruction, and misery for all parties involved. The cast is amazing, Michael Caine is a delight to see as always. Christian Bale's character is dark as ever just like most of his roles in everything from \\"American Psycho\\" to \\"Batman Begins\\". With that being said, in the end, you can't feel sorry for any of these characters because they brought thismisery on themselves by not being able to accept a loss, and walk away. Although, it's hard to tell in the end who ultimately has the last laugh so to speak. Ultimately, they both deserved each other, and they both deserved what they got. I will tell you this..spoiler! When watching this movie keep in mind that the beginning is indeed the end, and the end does indeed explain what you see in the beginning. So, it is reversed, but if you pay close attention you'll see that hindsight is 20/20 vision, so they are giving you clues to the ending the entire movie hence the line...\\"Are you watching closely?\\" The ending also leaves you thinking about whether or not real magic does exist. I almost forgot to say that David Bowie is in this movie, and I couldn't even recognize him at first. David is always a sight to see, and he does play the great Nikola Tesla quite classy and elegant.

B000002H97|5.0|This is Metallica's most complete album. It has fast songs, slower songs, and overall, shorter songs than previous albums. It doesn't quite have the anger that defined their earlier work and they slowed things down a bit but the intensity is still present...and that's always important. <br /> <br />There are no fillers on this album, every song is solid and well constructed, especially the first half of the album, which contains a slew of hits that you'll hear on rock stations everywhere. \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Sad But True\\" are the crushing openers, and \\"The Unforgiven\\" was the most lyrically-personal song for James up to that point. A hidden gem that you'll find later in the album is a song titled \\"My Friend of Misery\\", it's very impressive.  <br /> <br />If you don't already have this album and are a fan of any genre involving rock, then buy this immediately. It didn't win a grammy for nothing.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|I truly enjoyed *Babel* as it was similar to *Crash* and *Traffic*.  The only difference is that *Crash* and *Traffic* focuses on incidents happening in America.  *Babel* focuses on how one could impact another across the world.  It was just brilliant!<br /><br />Richard (Pitt) and Susan (Blanchett) are in Morocco for a vacation, hoping to repair their marriage.  While on a tour bus, Susan is suddenly shot and is bleeding.  With limited resources, they are forced to detour to a small town which sets everyone, on the bus, on edge.<br /><br />Meanwhile, 2 local Moroccan boys realize the severity of their actions.  They bury the rifle and act like nothing has happened.<br /><br />Across the world in America, Richard and Susan's kids are being taken care by their Mexican maid.  The Mexican maid is frustrated because she is supposed to go to Mexico for her son's wedding.  With no one willing to watch the kids, she has no choice but to take the kids with her.<br /><br />Somehow, information has been brought up that the rifle once belonged to a Japanese man.  We see a Japanese widower and his relationship with his Deaf daughter, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi, who is not Deaf).<br /><br />Of course, things go wrong.  But the question is what went wrong or what causes things to go wrong?  Language barrier?  Cultural barrier?  The unwillingness to listen and compromise?<br /><br />Each of these stories are not only related but they also have their own little stories.  Richard and Susan have issues to address in order to save their marriage.  The village where the Moroccan boys live face brutality from the UN (?) in order to get answers about this terrorist act.  The Mexican maid and her family deal with the border patrol.  Chieko, believing herself to be ugly, seeks affection from men.<br /><br />The movie was just wonderful.  The cinematography was meaningful.  You have to watch it again to grab the implied meaning or symbolism.  The ONLY thing that I didn't like about this movie was that it was too long.  There were some things that could have been edited or deleted.  (That's why the 4 stars.)<br /><br />Like *Crash* and *Traffic*, I liked this movie because it sparks dialogue with friends and loved ones after viewing.  Anything that causes intellectual dialogues afterwards becomes a favorite of mine.ut this movie was that it was too long.  There were some things that could have been edited or deleted.

B000002H33|5.0|This is the greatest thrash metal album ever. Slayer had an album out the same year, \\"Reign In Blood\\", which was very solid but very short too (30 min). This album almost doubles that time but is very fast throughout as well.  <br /> <br />There are no fillers on this album, no bad songs. \\"Battery\\" is the crushing opener, and is followed by the song \\"Master of Puppets\\". Wow. This song is metal defined. Fast, angry, brutal, intense - any and all of those words apply to this disgustingly awesome song. \\"Sanitarium\\" is a slower, haunting tune that shows how great of a guitarist Kirk Hammett was becoming. The album really never lets up, as the second half continues the fast paced songs and intensity. All the songs are long too -about seven minutes each on average. \\"Orion\\" is an instrumental gem that showcases the awesome skills of the late great bassist Cliff Burton. This would prove to be his last album with Metallica, as his tragic death would ensue later in the year. As great as they've been in the years following, the band would never truly be the same. <br /> <br />If you don't have this album yet and are a fan of rock music of any kind, especially metal, then buy this immediately. It's a must have.
0767020308|5.0|I was originally introduced to Jane Austen's Emma when it was on my reading list in college many years ago. I enjoyed it, but I was then more interested in action stories than in parlor romances, no matter how well written. Even then, however, I marvelled at how Austen uncovered the emotions and motivations of her characters with such beauty and facility of language.     With the inexorable passage of time my tastes have evolved, and now I am less enamored with action and more with depth of emotion and meaning. Hence, on a day like today as I am home with the flu, I gravitate toward quality films like \\"Emma\\" to pass the time. With both the Paltrow and the Beckinsale versions of the film here at hand, I watched them both.    Though I do enjoy Gywneth's acting and hold her performance in \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" to be superb, she has less to work with in this film. Against the Kate Beckinsale version, which I am primarily interested in applauding, her's pales in comparison.    This film, which stars the Kate Beckinsale whom I first met in \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" as Hero, is rich with attentiveness to Austen's story. It maintains to a great degree the story's language with the dialogue often just as the author wrote it. In addition, the setting amongst some of the more splendid period homes in England lends to it an authenticity that helps with that all so needed suspension of disbelief. The acting and casting are solidly excellent with Mr. Knightly believable in both age and nobility and Beckinsale an ideal choice as a charmingly effective Emma. This version is the one to watch. If you enjoy Jane Austen, her language and characters, you'll enjoy this film.
B000002H2H|5.0|One of thrash metal's finest hours, this album proved that Metallica were going to put a serious dent in metal, whether fans were ready or not. <br /> <br />As earlier reviews stated, the main theme on this album is death. \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is an intense song describing the electric chair experience, while \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" elaborates on the horrors of war. Then there's \\"Fade to Black\\". Wow. This song about suicide is so haunting and yet energetic at the same time, and is perhaps Kirk's finest hour at lead guitar. (I really wish they would play this song more at their live shows). The brutality continues throughout the second half of the album as well, with the devastating \\"Creeping Death\\" leading the way. <br /> <br />If you don't already have this album and are a fan of rock music of any kind, especially metal, then do yourself a favor and buy it immediately. It's a gem.
B000GG4Y3M|4.0|Ridley Scott's Black Rain is a lavishly mounted but rather hollow affair, transporting all the usual cop movie clichés from New York to Japan: New York cops are mavericks who don't like suits; Japanese cops are team players who like karaoke. Stylishly shot, with Tokyo looking like the sets from Blade Runner with extra neon, The Yakuza it ain't despite the presence of the great Takakura Ken (who even cracks what may be his first onscreen smile), and it suffers from some outrageous 80s power ballading and serenading on the soundtrack (\\"You're so bright you could be a candle/Hold you so tight you could be a handle/Smell so sweet you could be perfume/Swept me off your feet like you were a broom\\"). But if you lower expectations and aren't looking for anything too demanding it fills the spot and is certainly better than most of Scott's troubled post-Blade Runner, pre-Gladiator films.    If the film is a 3/5, the new collectors edition DVD earns an extra star for an excellent selection of extras - a particularly good commentary from Scott, an excellent hour-long four-part documentary and the release trailer (though none of the teaser trailers are included). It's just a pity that there are no deleted scenes or the alternate ending that was apparently shot. The 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is also particularly good.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|When I first heard about Stranger Than Fiction I thought it looked like it would be hilarious. Yet, it wasn't just a light comedy. This film has a good plot and an even better ending. This is indeed a comical film yet it also has in depth meaning. The ending is unexpected, unlike most films. The writer, Zach Helm, knew what he was doing when he wrote this story about Harold Crick and Marc Forster, the director, did a great job on making it happen. <br /> The main character, Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), is an everyday, ordinary guy who has an uneventful life. Among counting brush strokes, his steps on the way to work, the time it takes to put on a tie, and going to sleep at the same time every night, he also goes to his boring job everyday as an IRS auditor. Although, despite his daily ritual, he has acquired this voice only he can hear and it's narrating his life. Almost everything he does is being announced by a british women, who he later finds out is Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Kay is writing a novel about Harold Crick, yet she has no idea that he is a real person until Harold calls her. Harold is in a panic when he hears about his death in the narration and that's why he has to contact Kay immediately. <br /> During the time of the narration, Harold meets Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who he is intrigued by. Ms. Pascal despises him because of the fact that he represents the government and is auditing her. With some persistence, Harold seems to hit it off and get the girl. <br /> With the guidance of a literature professor, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), Harold finds the author of the novel about him and tries to stop her from killing him at the end. The professor insists that the novel won't be as good if he doesn't die at the end and tells him that it's a sacrifice he must take. Kay doesn't think she can kill him so she ends up seriously hurting him but a shard of his watch saves him. The ending was surprising because as soon as that bus hits him and Kay wascrying while typing, I couldn't help but to believe she killed him. <br /> This film is witty yet full of drama. It's a very big decision at the end. If Kay lets Harold live, her novel will just be another bit of entertainment, but if she kills him, her novel will be a piece of great literature. Harold's fate is entirely in Kay's decision. <br /> This film is ingenious. It definitely has clever aspects that are quite original and funny that makes it different than other films.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|That's the only way to describe this film.  It has a talented all-star cast, but a horribly mapped out plot.  By movies end, I was left wondering why so much useless information was thrown it, while important tid bits where left out...what was in that letter?   <br /> <br />Not to mention, the amount of blatant murder that went on was too far fetched for my taste.  I mean, I am sure there are and always have been many crooked people serving in law enforcement, but there has to be many more who aren't, to sift through and figure out what really happened... <br /> <br />After spending 2+ hours watching this, you are left feeling a bit short changed!! Which means I would have to agree with other reviewers who say this isn't one I will be watching again and again. <br /> <br />Not one I would recommend...
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I am writing this review only several minutes after the Departed was named Best Picture and Marty finally won his Best Director award.  Unlike a recent reviewer, I thought this was one of the most focused films he has ever done (unlike Goodfellas and Casino, which could only be described as sprawling...brilliant, yes, but sprawling).  Yeah, it was long, but the screenplay and directing were very taut---the plot moved and there were no dull moments and everything made complete sense in the end.  (I would describe it as an extremely well-constructed puzzle where all the pieces fit by the end...unlike the Good Shepard, which was also a good movie but highly confusing at times).  Acting was outstanding all around (especially Wahlberg) and it was just an enjoyable, engrossing movie and deserving of Best Picture.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|The connection between Dunne and Drey is unique and innocent.  Sometimes, we have to look to those we have the least in common with (on the surface) to deal with the things that bother us the most.  Although, I have to say, I don't think I would be too pleased to discover that my female child was spending time with a male teacher with a drug addiction.  <br /> <br />Then again, you never know who is in crisis and needs you to just \\"be there.\\"  But the best part is when you discover, you are getting as much, if not more out of the relationship as you put in to it...  Understanding, compassion and empathy are both free to give and priceless to receive. <br /> <br />Wonderful perfomances by Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie.  I look forward to the opportunity to see them in more films in the future and highly recommend Half Nelson to others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JPCF|5.0|OH MY GOSH!  Some of the reviews, I thought this was a GREAT movie and it did point out a very hard fact about what is occurring that many people want to ignore. <br /> <br />Half of the previous reviews were from people that think that we as humans are not having any influence on this earth.  THESE people are the ones that needed to see this movie and MANY more like it.  Maybe those people need to see what will happen to this world when the polar ice melts on a large scale that will raise sea levels 20 or more feet (1/3rd of New York City will be under water). <br /> <br />I don't think that this movie got the Oscar for the Animated film of the year for presenting a nice children's only story that the complainers wanted this movie to be. <br />
B000M5AJQ8|3.0|I finally got around to watching this, on the night it won Best Picture no less.  I'm never eager to watch gangster movies, I'm just not interested.  But this movie was well made and has an interesting story-  I never felt the need to hit the fast forward button.  There is an all-star cast including Jack Nicholson, one of my favorites.  He was actually pretty subdued and not over the top for a change.  There is tension, plot twists, and no Hollywood cliche ending.  But in the end I'm rather ambivalent about the movie.  I have no desire to watch it again, and I don't think I would have missed much if I had never watched it.  HD DVD picture quality was decent, but the type of scenes were not the best to show off high def.  Just a rental (if that) for me.
B000L212HC|4.0|...that a movie about magicians that didn't include the how to \\"make the salt shaker disappear\\" trick would be so good?  One might call me the magic movie aficionado as the last \\"magic\\" movie that I watched was called \\"The Magic Video\\" and was given to me by my Aunt Grace when I was 10.      Acting/Plot:  Cutter (played by Michael Caine) describes every magic trick as having three distinct parts; the pledge (a promise made by the magician to do something amazing), the turn (the illusion part of the trick that is unusual and counterintuitive), and the prestige (the shocking climax that makes the second part of the trick the illusion).  The movie's plot seems to follow this theory to a tee.  The movie begins with the murder of a magician.  Through a flashback, you learn of two magicians's (Bale and Jackman) who grow from apprentices to full blow headliners competing with each other along the way.  The competition becomes all enveloping with each trying to outdo the other with bigger and better illusions.  Eventually, the magicians completely outdo one another in what some might call \\"the prestige\\" of the movie itself (don't worry, no spoilers here...hopefully).    It's an interesting exercise to compare the actual theatrical illusions the magicians perform in their acts with the \\"tricks\\" that they play on one another.  Some of these loose comparisons seem to follow the original premise of the 3 distinct trick parts.  The multiple intermingling of \\"tricks\\" and their parts is brilliant.    The cast does a great job of telling the story.  For some reason, Bale's English accent annoyed me and seemed to vary in strength from time to time.    Conversion/Blu-ray:  [...] The ratings applied for video and audio are 5/5 and 4/5 stars respectively.  My eyes and ears are not finely tuned, but the picture is spectacular and the audio is incredible.  Lines are smooth and the overall tones are dark, but highly defined.  The level of detail in some sections of the movie was mind-boggling.  At one point I had to pause, fast forward, and catch up.  The movie just moved quicker without losing any quality in either picture or sound.  Imagine that?!  I might just have to watch all of my movies on fast forward to save time!    Overall I really like this movie and have already recommended it to my some friends.  On the cover of the case is a quote, \\"You'll want to see it again the second it's over\\".  It's completely true.
B000HT386M|2.0|This was a great concept, however the movie just didn't reach the potential of the story.  I would like to see better screen writers re-do this picture.  This time with a little bit more imagination
0553802534|2.0|This book was a big let down for me.  Not what I'm used to from Lisa Gardner.  Too many twists and turns at the very end, it kind of ruined it for me.  The start was hard for me to get into, the middle was good, but the end was a flop.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess takes place in a dark depiction of the near-future in which both the government and society are corrupt and the streets are rampant with criminals and thugs. This is the world that Alex, the narrator, lives in, and he spends his nights stealing, beating, and raping until he is finally caught by the police. He is then chosen to undergo a new type of treatment that can reform him by making him physically adverse to violence. This leads to drastic consequences that raise important questions about human nature and freewill. <br /> <br />Alex is the perfect anti-hero for this satire, since he is immoral and cruel enough for us to hate him as a human being, while still being complex and intriguing enough for us to love him as a literary character. His seemingly contradicting traits make him even more interesting and original, since his love of \\"ultra-violence\\" is contrasted with a love of classical music, usually considered the music of the refined and sophisticated. But for people who don't like reading books with too many incomprehensible vocab words, you should be warned that in nearly every sentence of A Clockwork Orange, Alex uses nadsat talk (teen slang invented by Burgess). The first few chapters will probably be difficult to read, as there's no glossary and each nadsat word must be deciphered in context. However, once you get a feel for it, which may happen much quicker than you think, Alex's unique voice and vocabulary makes the book even more memorable and his character more real. <br /> <br />I highly recommend A Clockwork Orange as both a compelling story that explores human nature and a thought-provoking social satire. If you've already seen Stanley Kubrick's movie adaptation, this is still worth reading for the additional insight into Alex's subconscious and for the reinstated final chapter that could alter your perception of Alex and maybe the story as a whole.
0312995423|1.0|I tried to read this book while I was visiting my Japanese in-laws in Japan.  I was extremely annoyed with Brown's lack of research in Japanese.  His character names do not even exist in Japanese.  It is like naming an American character, \\"xyllsjdfd\\"  Futhermore, the little Japanese phrases he used in Japanese were completely non-sensical.  I think he just made up the words.  The one word that does exist, he used COMPLETELY  the wrong way.  He said that the 7 Gods \\"shichigosan\\" were on his side.  \\"Shichigosan\\" means 7, 5, 3.  It is a day where children ages 7, 5, and 3 dress up in kimono!!! <br /> <br />I couldn't even finish reading the book.  He lacks credibility.  And from what I've read on this site, he also did not do his research about Spain.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This one has everything:  Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and crew with a brand-new Enterprise-NCC 1701E (1701D was crashed in ST - Generations) and the new Enterprise is sleeker and more military looking with a smaller bridge as well and different design.  This story begins 6 years after the big battle with the Borg when Picard as \\"Locutus\\" had been forced to help the Borg.  Picard and crew are on a shakedown mission in the Neutral Zone when the Borg come back and are attacking earth.  The Enterprise races to help and are just in time to transport off the surviving crew of the Defiant (From Deep Space 9) including former crew member Commander Worf.  As Picard gives coordinates on the Borg ship for all the rest of the fleet to fire at to destroy the Borg cube, the Enterprise crew also notes a small sphere escaping the cube and heading toward Earth and producing some type of time warp.  Even as the Enterprise chase the sphere towards the time warp, they see the Earth change and suddenly it is 9 billion Borg and not humans inhabiting the planet!!  Of course, Picard & co. follow the Borg sphere into the past and destroy it but not before it has fired multiple times on a missile site in Montana.<br /><br />What follows is classic ST:NG with humor, action and even a touch of romance.  Some of the best scenes include Lily (Alfre Woodard) from 21st century Earth on the Enterprise and viewing Earth from space, Counselor Deanna Troi falling face down drunk on a table while trying to keep up with Zephram Cochrane and Commander Worf's expression when told he is accompanying Picard on a space walk!!<br /><br />Enjoy!!
0679446230|5.0|Read this book if you want a deeper understanding of what came before Western colonialization and religion appeared in Africa.  If more world leaders had read this book since its publication in the 1950s, there might have been fewer tragic results in the West's economic, political and cultural domination of traditional societies around the world. <br /> <br />Everyone to whom I have recommended this book has thanked me and passed on the good advice to others.  Although the beginning to Chinua Achebe's novel can feel slow, and the names difficult to pronounce, make the effort to write your own character chart and follow the narrative through to the end.  Your reward will be days, weeks, even months of deeper thinking about the results of \\"inevitable\\" change.  There are no easy answers here, only deeper understanding and healthy nuance.

B00014NE62|5.0|I thought for a long time that Latter Days was my most favorite movie until I saw Maurice for the very first time, in 2007, a full twenty years after it had wrapped.  I don't know if I can say enough nice things about this moving, uplifting, optimistic movie.  This movie is really about risking everything we know for what we believe in with no guarantees for a happy ending.  Whether or not you are gay, I think if you've ever been faced with difficult choices, or have ever been in love in an impossible situation, you will find something to appreciate in this one.  It had me cheering.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Original draft Dec.2006- Midway through my senior year in high school something magical happened[and it didn't have anything to do with drugs or alcohol] A covert friend of mine turned me on to an album called Making Movies, by a band I knew little about, Dire Straits.  I didn't have a clue what a monumental impact it would have on me in the weeks, months, and even years to come.  It was Dec. 1980 and the sounds of this incredible record were echoing down the corridors of a small Catholic high school in N.J.{along with some other choice pieces of vinyl}.  The song that did it for me was \\"Skate Away\\".  I remember feverishly doing my homework one night as it played on the radio.  I dropped everything and drove to the nearest music store...and the rest, as they say, is history.  Well, not exactly.  The obvious masterpiece here is \\"Tunnel of Love\\", a song so brilliantly composed and executed it rivals any story Springsteen or Billy Joel ever told, musically speaking.  Every album has it's little gem, and Mark Knopler delivers on \\"Hand in Hand\\".  He ends the tune with the first verse, but in a spoken drawl and only the slightest variation in the lyrics, then finishes it off with five simple strokes of his guitar, that should give you a chill as you wait for the next number.  Drummer Pick Withers is pitch perfect through out, while John Illsley holds down a elementary baseline, careful not to sabotage any melody, like the splendid \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".  It was a fantastic senior year indeed, following our winning basketball team around on cold, clear nights while keeping a cautious eye on a certain cheerleader, who I think was getting to me.  The track \\"Expresso Love\\" is soaring testimony to that.  Making Movies moved mountains, coming from an era in popular music that produced some of the finest LP's ever made- 1976 thru 1981.  Yeah, I think that blonde cheerleader got to me after all, during a long Winter 26 years ago, and listening to Making Movies today brings back a film reel full of memories I'd not sooner forget.  Post Script: I originally thought the tepid \\"Les Boys\\" didn't belong on here, but ultimately excepted the song for what it was-an unexpected surprise playing against the \\"Solid Rock\\" grain of the recording.
0553573403|5.0|I am not a huge fan of fantasy novels, but I've read several in the past and had heard great things about the \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" series. After a very disappointing attempt to get through the first \\"Wheel of Time\\" novels by Robert Jordan, I decided to give the genre one last try. Thankfully, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was the book that redeemed it. Unlike many fantasy novels, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is not overloaded with fantastical elements such as wizardry, elves, and mythical monsters such as chimeras and griffons running around. It does touch on these and makes evident that dragons and magic has existed, but the story takes place in an age where much of this has passed, so it does not interfere with the story. Some readers might be concerned by this, afraid that the lack of such elements would make for a boring story, but it is just the opposite. By putting these things in the background, it allows Martin to focus on what I think he does best, character development.<br /><br />There is good reason that each chapter in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is named after a character. This book has some of the best character development I've ever read in a fictional novel. There are many characters, but Martin does an exceptional job at avoiding the trap of confusing the reader with so many names. He can keep adding new characters with ease, as they are developed so well and so memorable, that it is not likely the reader will get them mixed up or forget them anytime soon. I feel like I know each of the protagonists intimately, and there is an emotional connection whenever something significant happens to them. And that occurs quite a bit.<br /><br />The second great thing about this book, is that Martin is not afraid to take risks. I was completely caught by surprise many times throughout the story. This is a gritty tale, and nothing is held back. People die, and many times it is a grisly death. Do not get too attached to any main character because as you will find out, any one of them can be killed off, no matter how important they may seem. I could not believe some of the events that took place, and kept expecting to find out they were dream sequences in later chapters, only to come to the realization that this is Martin's style, and it works beautifully. If you are looking for a fantasy novel that focuses on people and realism, that is loaded with action & deceit, and is filled with twists at every chapter, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is where you should go.matter how important they may seem.

B000093BDX|5.0|A nice Beach Boys hits collection. Thirty songs that capture the Beach Boys through their illustrious career. A nice remastered cd, despite original mono mixes, the original sound quality is limited, but does'nt sound half bad.

The linear notes are interesting, as I a like that the release dates of each hit are included. \\"Sounds Of Summer\\" The Very Best Of The Beach Boys\\" will satisfy most Beach Boys fans. I have Beach Boys \\"Greatest Hits\\" Volume I,II,III only because I found them at a good price.  If you really want to get more hits from the Beach Boys you could get the Capital reissue twofers cds or the 1993 released 5 CD box set  Years Of [[ASIN:B000002UR4 Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys]]Either way you choose to go, \\"Sounds Of Summer - The Very Best Of The Beach Boys\\" is great for the casual Beach Boys fan or the Beach Boys Completist.
0783219598|5.0|A fun, heart-warming movie with a quirky twist. I really enjoyed this movie as a light-hearted look at life on a farm. It is suitable for all ages. It does not contain any bad language, sex or strong violence. The basic story premise speaks to the child in all of us and in my opinion is far superior than the sequel (Babe - Pig in the City). The performances by the artists and puppeteers from Jim Henson Creature Shop, the Animatronics robotic animals and the real animals are seamless. A big plus that the film was shot on location in Australia and used a lot of local talent. A movie one could see again and again and find new things to enjoy each time.  <br /> <br />
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is a sometimes hilarious and sometimes sad book about the absurdity of war itself, and especially the running of a war machine. The protagonist suffers through one disaster after another barely keeping his life while those around him lose theirs. While it sounds like there is no room for laughter in this book what with the deaths of all his friends, the author just hints at the death scenes which are presented in full towards the end of the book. Thus the end of the book is more serious than the beginning. The description of life in war torn Italy is especially difficult to read because it is so evocative of the way life was during World War II. I highly recommend this book for both it's serious aspects and funny moments.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|I'm not a huge horror fan, but the SAW series is as good as it gets in my opinion. I won't go into a huge plot description, but figured I'd offer my opinion on the movie. First off, it's GORY. It's actually hard to watch at certain points, and I found myself taking my eyes away from the tv screen many many times throughout! However, in the end, it's the same shocking puzzle coming to a surprising conclusion. When it's all said and done, you sit back and watch the credits and think...\\"man that was scary, and as usual that was some ending!\\"

B000GCFO0I|3.0|I've never played a Silent Hill videogame in my life; therefore I'm not familiar with its plot or characters. So I viewed Silent Hill just as a normal film watcher. I'm comfortable to say that I enjoyed what I saw. I mean that literally. The visuals in this film are amazing from the beginning scene to the town of Silent Hill to its subtle ending. The dark and dreary aura that the film gave off is in major part due to the visuals. Although the first creature attack is obvious CGI, anything other than that is a great sight.<br /><br /> That being said, the plotline became a little confusing to me. Little girl sleepwalks, adopted mother of little girl thinks it deals with the town little girl was born in, mother escapes husband with little girl to visit town, gets sucked into a world of horror, screwed up religion, monsters, and confusion. Got that part. We're told why the little girl was drawn there. Got that part. What I didn't get was the results of it all (and the end sequence that takes place in the church? Awesome and very reminiscent of Hellraiser 2). No spoilers given, but why did the lives of the mother and daughter continue the way that they were? I guess these questions really didn't matter as I was too busy enveloped into the visuals and crazyness going on.<br /><br /> Radha Mitchell is beautiful. Her presence as the determined mother was evident, and the woman can play fear (also seen well in Pitch Black). JoDelle Ferland, who is the little girl, didn't really strike me as endearing. She was a little more than annoying. That's just me. It has to take a LOT for a kid actor in a horror film to affect me. I hear she's much better in Tideland. Sean Bean was Sean Bean: tough guy, caring character, very stern face.<br /><br /> Silent Hill could have satisfied a little more with a little bit of editing and more of a well-told story. But I enjoyed it.
B000FDFVZ6|1.0|Sebold demonstrates a stunning capacity to combine all the worst aspects of American culture into a single novel - materialism, cheap religion, shallow psychotherapy, and a vigilante obsession with rare and violent crimes.  The literary conceit is that 14-year-old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered, at which point she enters the perfect consumer heaven - untroubled by God or the unfathomable soul, in Sebold's heaven, we must merely say what we want and it appears.  From this vantage, Susie exhibits a mind-boggling lack of curiosity about her sudden new ability to spy on her earthbound loved ones, opting instead to relate the cloyingly transparent activities of her family as they grieve her death and hunt down the man they know killed her, even though they have no evidence to suspect him.  From the moment Sebold describes a character's smile as \\"like stars exploding,\\" I knew this would be a monumental work of emotional [...].
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I am a fan of quirky, character-driven movies such as Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, so this movie was a good fit for my taste. I agree with other reviewers--I would definitely recommend renting this one before buying to be sure it suits your personal taste. I'd read many mixed reviews of this film, so I was a bit skeptical but I went ahead and rented it anyway. Now I'm here to buy my own copy--it's that good (I rarely purchase DVD's, as I feel it's a very rare movie that is worth watching more than once or twice). I enjoyed the interaction among the family members, and enjoyed the social commentary with the beauty pageant scenes. Someone bemoaned the \\"JonBenet Ramsey flashbacks,\\" but that's exactly the point--the filmmakers aren't glorifying these kiddie pageants; they're criticizing them. My jaw dropped at the very unexpected culmination of the pageant scene, but I found it a very fitting statement about these pageants. My favorite moment? The scene with Olive and her brother sitting in the ditch outside the van. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't elaborate other than to just say it was one of the most poignant scenes I've seen in a movie. I loved this movie, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys quirky characters and pointed social commentary.
0385508417|1.0|As if we needed any further proof that Grisham's a hack, he took a break from writing formulaic legal thrillers to grind out this thinly-veiled screenplay in which a caricatured pair of middled-aged empty-nesters decide to beg out of Christmas.  Hilarity ensues with painful predictability.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I don't want to give anything away since there's quite an interesting twist.  I really liked how there were two twists in this story.  Regardless of who started out deserving revenge, the two men just got carried away & they both deserved the worse.  Yum, yum for the shirtless shot of Jackman though.  Rrrrrr...
B000FTWB7G|2.0|Item received promptly. I have played the CD both on my home theatre system and in my automobile.  The songs are great but poor recording quality. <br />thank you for the opportunity to review the product.
B000002KDI|3.0|After reading Garbageman's review, where he points out the butchering of \\"Cortez\\", I decided instead to pick up the DVD \\"Rust never sleeps\\". It is the same concert (Oct 22, 1978), and as I write this, costs exactly the same as this CD.  It includes the complete Cortez, a few extra songs (Thrasher, Welfare Mothers, Tonight's The Night), and of course, visuals (which are sometimes tacky, it must be said).  The audio of course uses a lossy codec, but I find it excellent -- with a 5.1 system it will probably be superior to the CD.  And if you want the CD anyway, it is \\"fair use\\" in most countries to rip the audio and burn a CD for your own private use. <br /> <br />I haven't heard the CD: I give it 3 stars because Amazon requires some sort of rating, the DVD gets 5 stars, and the truncated Cortez would be sufficient to take away two stars for me.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|From the opening credits to the soft visuals of the closing scene--all of it augmented wonderfully by Philip Glass's haunting score--THE ILLUSIONIST serves notice it is a film that truly demonstrates the art of entertainment.  Beautiful, enchanting cinematography; a dynamic, gifted cast; exceptional music; a compelling story--all of these components mesh and blend to create a spellbinding (pardon the pun) viewing experience.<br /><br />Edward Norton has never been better; he captures the mystery, the power, the allure, of Eisenheim the Illusionist.  Yet Norton appears in roughly half the film; Paul Giamatti carries the other half as Inspector Uhl, a man torn between his loyalty to his superiors--and his desire to know the truth.  I thought Giamatti was at the pinnacle of his talents in \\"Cinderalla Man,\\" but I was wrong.  The actor is in rarefied air in this role.  Rufus Sewell is deliciously evil as Crown Prince Leopold, and Jessica Biel is a more than worthy love interest for both the Prince and Eisenheim.<br /><br />I won't belabor the plot, as it's been regurgitated ad infinitum in previous reviews, but I am running out of superlatives.  If you're contemplating purchasing this DVD, I would recommend you do so, as it's worth every penny.  Few movies are visual and artistic treasures; this is one of them.  THE ILLUSIONIST will be a movie you'll want to watch, again and again.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON
0201485672|2.0|Fowler's book is has a lot of very good ideas, but it is poorly written, hard to follow, and incredibly disorganized.  I think it would have benefited immensely from the services of a good editor.   <br /> <br />My two major complaints:  First, Fowler tries so hard to be clever and witty that at times his point is completely lost in his misguided attempts at humor.  Second, he constantly refers ahead to material not yet covered, so that it's impossible to understand Chapter N without already having read Chapter N+1, which of course presupposes that you have read and understood Chapter N. <br /> <br />If you are going to read this book (and I concede that you probably should) then you should at the same time buy a copy of  Joshua Kerievsky's \\"Refactoring to Patterns.\\"  Kerievsky brings far more organization and explanation to the subject than does Fowler.  Read Kerievsky first, and refer to Fowler when he directs you there (which he very frequently does).  But don't try to read Fowler by himself.
1563894696|1.0|So much to draw and so little to say.  When this book isn't childishly ripping off \\"The Godfather\\" or \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" it's mucking about in a plotline that's as two-dimensional as it's overblown.  Capos spout dialogue at each other in storytime mafia-ese; characters we're supposed to care about lose all credibility and come off as dull thanks to the clumsy script; and half of Batman's rogue's gallery seems contractually obligated to make an appearance--sometimes just falling into the frame as eyeroll-inducing non sequiturs.  Batman is a wonderful character, and he can support so many kinds of stories: detective yarns, suspense thrillers, noir tragedies, psychological inquiries, even postmodern eviscerations.  But this . . . this is nothing.  This is bad writing.  There's no story here.  Kudos for the sometimes beautiful visual images, but even they quickly wear thin with nothing to support them.  Sadly, in a reader's world of hits and misses, \\"The Long Halloween\\" is something even worse: a waste.

B000M06K5C|5.0|As many of the others reviewers have noted is that this album is different from Silent Alarm and cast it aside as a disappointment, however I rediscovered the album and now I cannot stop listening to it.  People need to think of this album in its own right, and not Silent Alarm 2.  Once you do that you will certainly enjoy it much more than the first listen.  From the Song for Clay till SXRT, there is a consistent, cohesive album.  Particular favorite include: Waiting for the 7.18, I Still Remember, Kreuzberg, On, Hunting for Witches.  I think it really helps that I've lived in london.  Give this album a chance and stay with it and it will grow on you.

B0006GAOBI|3.0|If you saw this movie in the theatrical release, and liked the music, you will be disappointed by the director's cut. <br />It lacks most of the haunting score and some of the period songs have been substituted, such as the Echo and The Bunnymen song in the opening. <br />There are also entire sequences from the original stripped of a score. <br />The director cut also extends some scenes unnecesarily, such as the first night in the hotel. <br /> <br />It is still a great film, but not as cool as the original. <br />The second DVD has some good stuff on it. The #1 fan clip was funny, but not worth the extra $10. <br /> <br />I am reselling this one and buying the original.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|I am a new fan and was introduced to the band from they're \\"Pale\\" song.  I bought the CD after reading the reviews.  It's a combination of Trans Siberian orchestra/Evanescence/rock.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it as a good addition to any CD collection.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|the story line is hokey, the acting poor to fair. The CGI above average. The movie was entertaining. People around here seem to get bogged down in every detail of this movie. News flash it's a comic book. You have to suspend disbelief before you walk into the theater Lighten up.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|NOT TOO LATE is a definite homerun. Norah is on such a higher caliber playing field; she's in a league of her own. We all expect so much out of her because we know how great and talented she truly is. Maybe not a grand slam like her first album but a definite \\"leave the ballpark and waive bye bye love that voice homer.\\" Keep ripping it Norah.
0307346609|5.0|If your looking for Pulitzer prose and symbolism, this is not it. If however, your looking for a book thats a blast to read and think about, this is it. As other reviewers have noted, the interview format really  makes this book. I loved reading this book. And for me, it was a fantastic 'palette' cleanser between heavier fare.
0374105235|5.0|While I did find this book painful to read, I am very glad I stayed with it. Ishmael tells his story in casual language, almost as if he were sitting next to you, sharing his experiences over (many cups of) tea.     He relays his life to us chronologically, beginning in his home village. He and some friends took a several day trip to a neighboring village to show off their hip-hop skills at a talent show. Little did they know, that little trip probably saved their lives. For while they were away, the rebel army attacked their home village.     From there, we follow Ishmael and his friends as they try to find their families (all had had to flee the village, literally running for their lives) struggling to meet the barest of necessities. It is a long, dangerous road they walk, and they suffer countless difficulties as they try to find somewhere safe to stay. A tunnel with no light. You really feel the desperation, the loneliness and despair that descended upon this poor little boy. Much of the book is about this time of wandering, going hungry, being ill-met by other villages who suspect these young, homeless friends of being a wandering squad of rebel child-soldiers. They are met with suspicion at best, hostility at worst.     It is actually understandable when Ishmael is manipulated into fighting with the government army. He is finally in a village that feels safe, he is eating, there are soldiers protecting the village, that is until the rebels surround the village, leaving no path for escape. All males (even 6 or 8 year olds) must fight for their lives, or die.     It begins as such, fighting for the \\"good side,\\" the ones who did not kill his family, and fighting to defend himself. But, as this brief portion of the book tells us, he quickly descended into the much darker side of warfare, where the good and bad guys are not so easily discerned. When did he cross the line and become someone who kills some other little boy's family? It is so painful, so sad.     ButIshmael does not delve too deeply into the emotions behind his motivations and reactions. Nor does he tell us much about how he has come to reconcile with himself. He tells us some, and maybe this is my psych degree, but I want to know more, I hope he is able to go deeper within himself. I don't need to read about it, but I hope he can because I want him to truly be alright now. You will, too, because no feeling human can read this book and not find themselves truly caring about this young man.     And now I think of the other children still out there, still being coerced into fighting the wars of horrible adult men. I want to help them, which is, I imagine, part of Ishmael's hope.    Don't wait for the cheaper paperback, this is a book to read now - you will want to talk to people about it. Prepare to be stirred.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|This is a true horror movie in every scene of the word for those of us that love the genre. Yes, it has suspense and thrills but it also has something that these PG-13, so called horror movies don't have; graphic and gratuitous violence!<br /><br />The Movie opens with three travels (two college age guys and their Icelandic travel buddy that they befriended on during their trip) as they trek across Europe to find \\"drugs and sex\\" and they find an abundance of both.<br /><br /> What this movie is about is simple in premise but is smart in execution. I'm not going to get into plot details because I do believe the best Horror experience is when you go into a movie cold, as I did with this one. Never knowing where the horror is coming from or knowing all the reasons why.<br /><br />Unlike most horror flicks, this movie is smart, well written and directed. It has very good acting for a horror movie, and the acting really sells the brutality of some of these scenes.<br /><br />The scenes are violent and ruthless, there is some very unsettling things to watch but you can't turn away from them. This movie doesn't try to hide behind some deranged serial killer or homicidal maniac or the super natural element to explain these violent acts...better yet. They put a spin on it that makes it quite believable but still disturbing. Very new school horror<br /><br />The setting was perfect. Your in another country where you don't have friends to call for help, you don't know your surroundings and you can't just pick up a phone and call 911. That element really helps you believe the atrocities that will accrue later in the film.  About as good as you might see by today's horror movie makers, which isn't saying much
B000LC55F2|4.0|The Prestige, has a series of clever twists, and is definitely geared towards an audience that thinks about what they're watching. The cinematography is wonderful and Scarlet Johansson really shines as a somewhat devious vixen. The rivalry does get a bit old towards the end, although it was funny to see how each one would trick each other, and ruin performances. If you like magic and plot twists than I recommend it.
0780622553|5.0|This might not only the most underrated science fiction film but one of the most passed over movies of the past 15 or so years! Screen writer David S.Goyer ( Blade, Batman begins) Hits big time with a psychological thriller that keeps you guessing and has another great story line that is similar to the Matrix in the way that these people of dark city are oblivious that they are puppets in a bigger picture. The story begins with a man waking in a hotel room with no memory, which soon proves to be but one of many troubles. He is being hunted by the police, who believe him to be a serial killer, and also by a group of mysterious men with kinetic mind powers (their first meeting is very creepy). Furthermore, something appears to be wrong with the world at large: time, memory, and identity behave in unusual ways. The look of the movie is a combination of a film noir crime story and a great American science fiction film that has roots in gothic euro style of science fiction. The film has a great climax and ending that leaves you wanting to watch it again and again
B000063V8T|5.0|For Star Trek fans, ST:TNG is an incredible show.  Each season seems to get better and better, and the 5th will not disappoint.  The characters are more developed and complex.  In addition, the story lines are thought provoking.  There is also plenty of action and intrigue.  This season also contains special features, including a nice testimonial to Gene Roddenberry.
B00005JL78|4.0|A great science fiction thriller is also one of Spielberg's strongest films. It earned four Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. It also earned an Academy Award nomination for best sound Editing. A Great plot is the key to any compelling science fiction film and this one is very thought provoking. set in Washinton D.C. during the year 2054 Thanks to three \\"precogs and technology built around their ability to see murders before they happen, the city has gone six years without a homicide. The group making use of the precogs is called the \\"Department of Pre-Crime\\"; the police officers and detectives within the department are empowered to act on their foreknowledge, arresting people who are about to commit a murder, and imprisoning them without a trial in a \\"Hall of Containment\\" using technology even crueler than that used to make use of the precogs. The story asks many moral and ethical questions about what types of freedoms would you give up to live in a safe invoronment. The film has cool gadgets and weapons, and new hip looking transit system and a more rundown looking part of the city called the \\"sprawl\\". The Tom Cruise Character has depth and has a tragic past that makes his plight very believable. I love this movie and watch it often.
B000BNI90O|4.0|For starters, the packaging of this collection is brilliant.  The accompaning  companion book is also an incredible read.  Alas, the music itself, while good overall, is somewhat repetitive, and although it sounds great while watching the movie, it is not so, when listened to without it.  The previously released soundtracks contain the edited versions and are more pleasing to listen to.
B000059HAI|5.0|I saw this movie years ago, and recently received it via Netflix. It is still a classic WWII movie that depicts the suprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie traces the tale of Dec 7, 1941 from both the American and Japanese perspective, which makes it different than most war movies (except for The Longest Day). This approach adds a lot of detail, and the story becomes the main focus of the film, not the actors.<br /><br />Although the movie is a little long, the last 30 minutes of battle scenes makes up for the slow build up. Also, the movie does an excellent job showing how this tragedy unfolded, and all the mistakes made along the way.<br /><br />If you like WWII films, or want to learn about the attack on Pearl Harbor then I recommend this movie. It is much, much better than the more recent version.
B00003RQNJ|4.0|It has been years since I saw this movie, but I recently ordered it on Netflix. Butch Cassiday and the Sundance Kid is an entertaining story, but I do not think it as great as many reviewers give it credit. The cast is strong with Paul Newman and Robert Redford, but the story drags along. A classic Western does not need as much dialogue as this one to tell the story. Maybe that is its appeal to some. While the interaction between Butch and Sundance is appealing, it gets tiring at times. Personally, I like more chase scenes and gun fights in Westerns. This movie is definitely worth seeing, just not a classic in my mind. I would pick something else.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Great.  Al Gore has an Oscar now.  He joins the ranks of Michael Moore and Oliver Stone as far as responsible Oscar-winning truth tellers go.  Congrats, Al.  Melissa Etheridge also won an Oscar for singing the theme song to this documentary.  If that Indian from the pollution commercials from the 1970s had shown up to shed another tear for the planet, he would have won Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />Hollywood has really lost it.  The Academy Awards used to mean something, used to reward American filmmaking at its finest.  Now it just tosses statues at whatever flavor-of-the-month cause that struts through a \\"documentary\\" or hides behind a crappy, heavy-handed fictional story.<br /><br />Michael Crichton has an excellent speech available online about \\"junk science,\\" which I think global warming may qualify for.  I'm sure he's now hated in Hollywood for infringing on tinsel town's ability to care so much about something.<br /><br />I have to agree with the reviewer who said people will be laughing about this a hundred years from now.  According to science, we weren't supposed to last after the planets aligned in 1982.  They actually got a lot of people spun about that...and it didn't happen.  Ditto with acid rain in the 1980s...nope, we're still here.<br /><br />Can Chicken Little be the first fowl honored by the Academy Awards?<br /><br />Eh.  Why not?
0783231202|4.0|Another \\"damn with faint praise\\" review.  I liked the movie well enough.  Spielberg did take some significant liberties with the script, and at times the movies veers dangerously close to cheesy melodrama.  Additionally, Matthew McConaughey turns in an inert performance which shows him to be fantastically miscast in movies such as this.<br /><br />However --- there are enough things, for me at least, to merit a marginal 4-star rating, not the least of which is Hopkins' excellent portrayal of the most crotchety US president EVER, the esteemed JQ Adams.  Also, whatever the other liberties that may have been taken with historical fact, the scenes aboard La Amistad during the passage ring with the sort of truth which cannot easily be discounted by hair-splitters.<br /><br />Heaven knows I detest movies which play fast & loose with history, and there were times aplenty when this movie tested my patience in that arena --- but overall, the movie is worth seeing, if for no other reason than it might prompt the occasional curious viewer to seek out more information on the subject.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|This was a very enchanting film which I would have enjoyed much more had I not already known the story of JM Barrie & the five (not four) Llewelyn Davies boys. It was hard at first to accept Johnny Depp, taller than quite a number of the other actors, as the pint-sized Barrie, but he captures Barrie's whimsy so convincingly that one soon can look past this. Depp does reasonably a good job with his accents (I suppose if it is de rigeur for all Roman soldiers in movies to have British accents, then it is acceptable for a Scotsman to be played by an American) and draw you in enough to feel the pain of loss.<br /><br />I might have been tempted to give this only three stars, if not for the utterly stellar performance of Freddie Highmore as Peter Llewelyn Davies. Whenever he is on the screen, one is transfixed by his completely unaffected approach to the role. From what I have heard, Johnny Depp was mesmerized by Highmore's performance, and when it came time to make \\"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory,\\" wanted only Highmore for the role of Charlie. It is easy to see why. He is an actor of uncommon talent, and one can only hope that he continues his career into adulthood.<br /><br />All in all, an emotionally rewarding film to enjoy, even with all of the inaccuracies.

B0000024W3|3.0|I can't work out why Nashville Skyline is praised while this one is criticised.  I guess it it because of the absolute dross that Dylan put on this album - Woogie Boogie, Blue Moon, The Boxer, Take Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go), Wigwam and Alberta #2.   <br /> <br />The next group up are 'interesting' live versions of Dylan classics and some poor to ok songs. <br /> <br />But the real treat with this album are the ones that would not be considered Dylan classics but are very good and otherwise virtually unheard because of the reputation of this album - Days of 49, Early Morning Rain, In Search Of Little Sadie, Let It Be Me, Living The Blues, Copper Kettle, Gotta Travel On, Take A Message To Mary and It Hurts Me Too.      <br /> <br />This album is only for Dylan fans.
1582701709|1.0|This book (and the dvd) claim to know the secret to success and happiness.  The 92 minute film follows a secret, that many great thinkers of history have 'known' about, but us lay people haven't.  Apparently, if you really desire something enough, Heaven will be at your doorstep.  You can have anything you want by wanting it bad enough (isn't that goal setting?) - I have always wanted $1,000,000 but funny enough it's never shown up.  The secret is the law of attraction - simply invision what you want and it will come to you.  The dvd even suggests that following The Secret will cure cancer without chemo or radiation (yeah right!)  Are we really so stupidly sucked into this kind of rubbish over and over again? <br />Why didn't Rhonda Byrne show up for the interview on Today?  Is it because she can't back up anything in here?  To claim there is a science behind this, is absurd.  We ourselves create our own happiness and luck, and that comes by hard work, determination and drive.  This rubbish can't help much.  Do you remember the saying If Something Sounds To Good To Be True Then It Probably Is? - well this is a classic example of that.  In fact, believing that positive thinking will save you from cancers etc, gives false hope and is dangerous to give that false hope to people. <br />Beware of the hype - that's all this is.
B000002VRZ|5.0|This CD brings back such great memories,..I am almost in a different world when I hear \\"Green Grass & High Tides\\".  This is some great stuff,..if you are into this kind of southern rock,..you'll love this.  I have almost every Outlaws LP record,..but I can't play records in my car,.so I had to get this CD.  Not disappointed.
B00005ASHM|3.0|Another one of those recordings that puzzles me as to why people have deemed it one of the \\"greatest\\" albums ever.  Why?  Because people say it is great, the industry has proclaimed it as great, so you're supposed to think it is great, right? <br /> <br />Well, it's a good album, particularly for hard-core Beach Boys fans, but it is not a great album.  There are some great songs on it:  Wouldn't it Be Nice, God Only Knows, Caroline No, but the rest of it is mostly not entertaining listening.  For non Beach Boys fans, I can see the album being unlistenable. <br /> <br />The main problem that is rarely if ever mentioned in reviews of Pet Sounds is that it is severely handicapped by the plodding musical arrangements.  Sorry for yet another Beatles comparison, but it is a useful contrast -- the Beatles songs were constantly developing and going in new directions, but in a way that worked musically.  Part of this was due to their producer, George Martin, who helped translate their ideas into attractive arrangements.  Brian Wilson had no such help to translate his musical vision.  His musical arrangements often come off as ham-handed and contrived.  The Beatles add a sitar to \\"Norwegian Wood\\"? It works.  Brian adds harps or banjo, or whatever other weird stuff he was doing and it seems forced, often just different for the sake of being different. <br /> <br />The album has some great musical moments, but falls short as a complete package.
0451191153|2.0|There is something about \\"Fountainhead\\" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?<br /><br />The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht \\"I Do\\" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.<br /><br />2.5/5
006085880X|1.0|The Pact could have been about half as long as it was.  It was repetitious and far too wordy.  Picoult does not appear to re-read what she has written and leaves in much extraneous stuff. <br /> <br />The two teenage characters wouldn't have been so awful if they weren't so tedious and boring.  I found them and their situation unbelievable, and there was no suspense about how Emily's death occurred.  It was obvious from the beginning. <br /> <br />Picoult has written much better books.  This time she was lazy about both the story and her writing style.  I found myself thinking that even she didn't care much about the people she created.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|\\"Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values... Forget peace now. We have to show them we're strong.\\" Golda Meir, Israeli Prime Minister, September 1972.<br /><br />This movie is not a factual recount of 1972 slayings of Israeli Olympic athletes by the members of Palestinian terrorist group \\"Black September\\" in Munich, Germany even though it is based on the real events. After the murders, a group of Mossad agents are sent to Europe to track down and assassinate the Black September members responsible. What the movie explores is how in doing so with burning desire to find and punish the murderers, in following the ancient law of an eye for an eye, the searchers for justice nearly become terrorists themselves. You can't just look into abyss and stay the same because, \\"When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.\\"<br /><br />In his new, easily one of the best films he ever made (in the same line as \\"Shindler's List\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"), Spielberg looks at terrorism from many different angles. He does not justify killings, and there are many, many terrifying killings in his film and behind every death there is a human character and every character is a real person, not cartoonish villain or a super-hero. Devastating, powerful, and controversial this film will split the audiences and will have as many admirers as haters.<br /><br />4.5/5 or 9/10
B000J3EEBY|5.0|An Ancient Muse is the best Loreena Yet. Every now and then I'll hear a song that touches something deep in your soul as if it's something you remember from some long ago place and time. On this CD is one of those songs that touched me deeply. It's called Penelope's Song.<br /><br />The entire CD is equally wonderful and showcases Loreena's talent at writing, composing, and playing her music. It's a must for all Loreena fans.
B000002UB6|5.0|Say what you will about Phil Spector's production, or the flimsy concept of a \\"live\\" studio album, but this is a classic album hands down!  Any musician in the world would give his left leg to release a record that includes Across the Universe, Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road, Get Back and I've Got a Feeling - not to mention For You Blue, Two of Us and Dig a Pony.  This is a brilliant example of songcraft, which is a much more upbeat and catchy affair than it is often given credit for.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This has become our 3 1/2 year olds favorite movie. He laughs, plays with his Lightening car as he's watching, talks to the characters during the movie, or joins in with the dialog as the movie is playing. He can watch it over and over and over again. Sometimes all in the same day.<br /><br />Thankfully my husband and I like this one too. It's wonderful to see the characterization of Richard Petty, his wife and Dale Jr. along with other drivers. Not to mention the laughs that pop-up during the credits.<br /><br />And don't miss the special added cartoon at the end. The Ghostlight will make you laugh as well.
B0000UI2QY|1.0|I loved Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. Nonsense, but well acted and directed. And fun. The Black Adder series can be watched over and over again for pleasure without ever going stale. All written by Richard Curtis. I didn't expect intellectually stimulating social comment - just to be entertained. But this was awful. I wanted to turn it off after 10 minutes and only watched because I couldn't believe how bad it was. I'm amazed at the positive reviews here. Have we become this stupid? What hope have we of getting decent films made when the public go overboard for this trash. It should have been good. It was a good idea. But EVERYTHING about it was bad. We should be asking for our money back, demanding a remake that took more than twenty minutes to visualise. I can suspend disbelief and enjoy a good bit of tosh with the rest of you, but I'm afraid this was BAD. SO disappointing that SO many people fell for it. Are we this desperate for distraction?
0374105235|5.0|This book is one of those books that you know are going to haunt your thoughts for some time after you read it. <br /> <br />This book is written very well and truely does something to you after you read it, I must say how this boy did it and still kept his spirit strong is beyond me, I felt so many emotions reading this book and you really feel like you connect with him on many levels..the fear, the sadness the lonelyness, but what he ends up standing for and starts to preach is truely an amazing turn around in his life and I'm so glad I took the time to read this. <br /> <br />It's really just a heart touching book, and really makes anyone anti-war, at least thats how I felt when I was done.. <br />
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I am ashamed to say I never watched Friends when it was on TV.<br /><br />Lately with the re-runs I have watched one here and there and enjoyed it very much. I decided to buy the series because I knew I would enjoy it and seeing how it all started.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. I haven't laughed so much in ages, I am literally falling off the couch. It's the best ever. I just love all the characters especially Joey. He kills me. It's the BEST.

0553345834|4.0|This book may seem over-simplified to the consumate business person, but it is filled with parables from an extremely successful gentleman.  It was required reading when I was taking graduate courses.  When people ask about setting up a new business, I recommend this book.
B00004W510|5.0|The Unfaithful Servant, King Harvest (Has Surely Come) are among the best songs ever written in the 60's. Amazingly this album was recorded in Sammy Davis Jr's poolhouse. Again, like Big Pink reissue, the bonus tracks are totally unnecessary.  <br />
0028643151|3.0|You have to take a lot of this book with a grain of salt, but pretty much all of what you read in this book could some day happen, especially global warming, which despite what the expert below says, IS HAPPENING (and I am a conservative republican!!!). The Cyberterrorism chapter was probably the most ridiculous.  But it is still interesting and chilling to read.
B000001DQI|5.0|Elton's \\"white album\\" is still his best album collecting many different styles...prog-rock, 50's rock, ballads, sea shantys, reggae and glam rock. <br />The most underrated here is   <br /> <br />This Song Has No Title  ,Grey Seal  ,I've Seen That Movie Too  ,Dirty Little Girl  and Social Disease but it's all good and highly recommended, much more rewarding an dlong-lasting to a new Elton fan than a greatest hits. <br />
B000MQ55IE|3.0|First let me say that Beck's music and video creations are clearly the most advanced artistic expressions in rock, IMO. I'm the biggest Fan of Mr. Hansen in the Universe, and I will *automatically* Buy His Product. BUT the packaging on this \\"deluxe edition\\" is truly a train wreck, and *those about to buy* should know about this up front, to avoid disappointment. The outer box is really flimsy cardboard; it's difficult to open and I put a crease in my copy on the very first opening. This packaging is designed to fall to pieces, which makes the sticker aspect even more comical, like I'm really going to mess with this stuff. The two cds and one expanded dvd are all in cardboard slip cases, and the cases are sized wrong, it's really hard to even get the disks out of the covers! Also included is a lyrics booklet and a blank graph-paper booklet for presumed Art Fun. The four sets of stickers satisfy the curiosity about what graphics were in the other three editions (besides the one copy I bought) of the original release of the album. This package is a HUGE step down from the deluxe hardbound book edition of \\"Guero\\" , unfortunately. It really looks cheap and destined for disposability. Perhaps that was part of the aesthetic, who knows. This is another case of burning copies of all the disks and filing the fragile original edition away, rarely to be touched. Of course the music is all that matters anyway; Mr. Hansen recently mentioned on NPR that doing this kind of packaging should make the album interesting and attractive to obtain rather than just downloading the music. I don't think this album's packaging succeeds in achieving this goal.
B000006MV8|5.0|Worth the price of admission for the heartbreaking song by ...(when you consider what happened in 2 years for him)...Pete Ham, Name of the Game. <br />Take it all, Baby blue are just 2 of the other highlights to this fine album. The only confusion are the bonus tracks, which are an earlier (rejected by apple) version of the album. Was apple out of their minds?
B000LC55F2|4.0|Whether you enjoyed the movie or not, I suggest not buying this dvd version for the sole reason that it lacked good Bonus Features.  There were some photos and a brief collection of \\"making of\\" featurettes which were rather disappointing.  If you are planning to purchase this film I would suggest waiting for the special edition.
B00004W50Z|5.0|The strain of being pressured into making another masterpiece like the first 2 records, constant touring and heavy partying was starting to make the group weary and this album is a beautiful masterpiece of struggle, it's a treat that we have it forever on record. The most underrated Band record and the best of the magical first 3. <br />
1401307957|5.0|i loved it! i recived the book for valentines day and finished in a day...its very intresting to examine dannys drawing and learn about his life in nyc..
B00004W50T|5.0|Totally different from anything going on in the rock business in 1968. THis album is like from another time like (the 1920's)but at the same time it sounds like it was done yesterday. A testament to the music contained here. My only complaint about the reissue is the bonus tracks sort of are unnecessary and destroy the flow of the original album. <br />
B0009VRHLK|2.0|This is a slow paced, dreary and dull film.  For almost an hour, I was trying to figure out who this Bud Clay fellow is and why all these women are talking, or lack of, to a complete stranger.  Once he gets to his destination, we see the real reason for this film.  By that time, it's too late to even care.  Vincent Gallo is a poor filmmaker.  His previous effort (Buffalo '66) was in the same vein of work.  This, however can be considered pornography!  With that thought...<br /><br />Who is the first Academy Award nominated actor/actress to perform actual oral sex on screen?  The answer to that question is Chloë Sevigny (Best Supporting Actress Nominee for Boys Don't Cry, 1997).  And in this film, nothing is left for the imagination.
B000J103PC|5.0|DVD: The Devil Wears Prada. It arrived in perfect condition, as my title describes the item.  <br />A pleasure to do business with and at Amazon.com.  <br />Total satisfaction. A+
B000FVQYZY|5.0|I got the cd by itself for a gift...I bought this copy with the DVD because I absolutly HAD to see how the heck they get all that music out of just 3 guys.  I am not usually into concert DVD's, but this one literally ROCKS!!  If you are a Muse fan, this is a must have.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I found myself completely disconnected with the characters throughout the movie, because, unlike \\"Crash\\", there was never any sensible connection or resolution. And when Brad kisses Blanchett really hard, who is suffering from a rifle bullet in the neck or shoulder, and he bends her all around, that just did it for me. Not a shred of reality there. At the conclusion, I realized I had wasted a lot of time and seen a really bad movie.
6305291446|5.0|I collect all the Halloween movies and liked them but Halloween 1,2, and H2O were the best. Like many people said that halloween H2O picks up right were 2 left off is true.

B000E6UWE4|4.0|Fantasy, for the discriminate reader, is a chancy prospect at best. For every anomaly of quality in the genre, one must wade through the quagmire of the less-than-adequate, with industry hyperbole championing such dire `masters' we all know and love/hate: babbling Brooks, broken Wheels, entropic Eddings and, objectively speaking, fervid Fraudkinds of lowest-common-denominator wish fulfillment. So let us celebrate the advent of the Internet, which warns us away from the so-called bestseller hype of diminishing returns, an Old Comb justifiably scorned while true talents like Erikson, Baker and Scott Lynch claim the epic throne.     The genre of fantasy fiction has, of late, undergone a painful but necessary maturation, with themes that touch the darkness of the human condition and authors happily subverting the clichés and archetypes so rote and hoary and, it must be said, *comfortable* for the epic-inclined reader. Steven Erikson is among these new voices adhering-to yet also deconstructing the stalwart tapestry set forth by the good Professor five decades ago; and he does it better than most.    *Gardens of the Moon* is the first of a 10 volume mega-saga called `The Malazan Book of the Fallen.' Originally written as a movie-script, with characters and events taken from Erikson's RPG campaigns of the 80's, GotM has been both hailed and derided for its complexity, hyper-epic storytelling and voluminous ambition. Although GotM's reputation is perhaps exaggerated - its complexity doesn't approach the more difficult hallmarks of literature - it is quite a bit more to chew than the standard bog-standard the industry pumps out every month.     The story, in brief: the reader is thrown right into the middle of an ongoing campaign of conquest by the aggressive Malaz Empire, with multiple POVs dictating the action and events. I can honesty say this is the first fantasy book I've read where a major battle of sorcery occurs in the second chapter. The Dungeons and Dragons influence does come off rather strong; GotM often gives the impression that one is reading an ongoing RPG game rather than a traditional fantasy novel. Thus it is credit to the author that it all works: in lesser hands this book would come off incredibly messy and chaotic, but Erikson obviously knows the where and why of his cast of hundreds and tangled plot-threads.     The worldbuilding is vast in scope and infused with impressive vitality, and the writing... well, here we come to a quandary. Perhaps the problem stems from the lengthy period in which this novel floated in limbo, for GotM strikes me as a bit of a paradox: although the prose is usually polished, certain sections stand out prominently in their awkward construction (the first paragraph of the prologue, for example, suffers from an overabundance of passive verbs), and the plot, fragmented as it is, sometimes exposes inexplicable flaws (the sudden emergence of an entire new group of characters at the climax to save the day). There are a half dozen other nit-picks I could ramble on about, and the cover is amusingly terrible (should have stuck with the UK cover), hence the subtraction of a star, but the end result - a challenging, immersive epic that is really unlike anything else on the shelf - gives me hope for a genre long stagnant by LCD formula. Kudos, SE, I look forward to reading more.     POST-SCRIPT: I read up to volume 4 of Erikson's series before deciding on a long hiatus from Malazan. Both the good and the bad listed above magnify to a level that I decided not to continue until 1) the series is finished 2) the final verdict on the overall quality is established.
0060245867|5.0|I used to read this book to my children so often when they were small, and they always loved it. What was great was that I also loved reading it to them.<br /><br />It's a nice, safe feeling book, makes for perfect reading to a child at any time.

B00020HEL6|5.0|Great voice...teenager...sounds years older & wiser.  My wife & I love this CD!
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I love all styles of music, but this... wow. Bought it after all the great reviews I read about this being the future of hard rock. It sounds like a Limp Bizkit cover band decided they were into Jon Bon Jovi and Guns 'N' Roses, changed styles but didn't have the chops. The \\"heavy\\" parts of this CD sound contrived, if you've heard any metal album in the last 20 years, you've heard all there is to be offered here. The \\"melodic\\" parts and solos sound like they were copied note-for-note by an ice cream truck. Overall, this is a bad hybrid of Bon Jovi and King Diamond; basically a re-hash of the past 20 years of hard rock/heavy metal, but without any fire, passion, or good execution to make it essential, or even worthwhile.
B00005JPDS|4.0|\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is not an exceptional film because of special effects or script. It is exceptional because of Will Smith. Smith's performance as Chris Gardner, a good man who has found himself at the wrong end of the financial ladder, is exceptional. Gardner decides he wants to be a stockbroker, despite having no college education, and pursues this dream doggedly. Smith's moving performance perfectly captures this air of perseverance and determination. As we watch Smith descending into the bowels of society, we are heartbroken along with him, and later elated when successes come. Also turning in an excellent debut is Smith's real life son, Jaden, who is charming as Christopher Gardner. Overall, the chemistry between Smith and his son and his fantastic portrayal of a man who refused to quit or hang his head makes The Pursuit of Happyness a great film.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale work together again bringing us a film about two men who start as professional rivals and begin a steady decline into obsession and revenge.  Visually the film is dark, mysterious and filled with a Victorian mystique that serves the film quite well.  Sound work matches the visuals, especially during the magic scenes and moments later in the film when electricity comes into play.  The score, unfortunately is fairly mediocre and doesn't make much of an impression.  Luckily it's not bad enough to be noticed either.    Acting is solid all around.  Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman carry most of the weight around in the movie.  Both men are convincing and as they both begin to escalate the affairs, become more intense and disarming.  Michael Caine plays a solid supporting role that he seems to carry off effortlessly.  Scarlett Johnansson's part is key but not very large, and she plays it well.  It was also nice to see Andy Serkis in a small but memorable role (and not covered up by digital effects).  Samantha Mahurin also does a great job as Bale's beleaguered wife.  The actor playing Nikola Tesla (its a fun bit of casting that I won't spoil) also does a very good job.    The script is deceptively simple, but Nolan's knack with editing makes the movie twist and turn upon itself.  At first its a bit disorienting, but once you catch up with the film its a great ride.  My only complaint is that the number of twists and turns can be overwhelming to anyone not ready to invest more than the normal amount of thought in a \\"summer movie\\".  Anyone else familiar with Nolan's previous work (Insomnia and Memento) should be right at home.  Overall, a very entertaining film and one that could be more rewarding with the second viewing.     ***  A side note - It's a shame that this film and the Illusionist were released so close together.  Neither film really benefited from it.  While I enjoyed The Prestige more, I think that both films would have founda large audience if released further apart.  They are different enough in plot and tone to be equally entertaining.  In the end I think The Prestige suffered more, but was a better written and executed film.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|As I watched the opening of this remake, with the beautiful scenery and fantastic special effects, I thought this might work. 30 minutes later, as I winced at the horrible lines and unnatural screenplay, I remembered that big budget effects does not always equal good movie. The film starts out fine, as men and women aboard a cruise ship prepare to toast the new year. Then, a huge rogue wave appears on the horizon and flips the ship. A band of people led by Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russel) and Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas) sets out to escape. Now this film would be just as enjoyable on mute as it is with the sound on. The spectacular lighting and special effects are interesting, but in the end, the script and plot just don't make the cut. I mean, a rogue wave that huge just doesn't randomly appear without detection. The characters are boring, with all the stereotypes being filled, but nothing being learned about those characters. An example of how bad the script is: \\"You just don't get the nickname Lucky Larry. You gotta be lucky\\".
B00003CXIY|4.0|I found that this movie was very funny. Everyone knows that it isn't the goal that is really important, it is the journey there and that is what is very funny about this movie. It is the changes in the \\"nerd\\" of taking chances to stealing a van to finally standing up to his father that I found most vindicating. It is also the changes in the guys girlfriend that he is getting the tape from and how thier relationship has changed too. What is very funny is the physics student making a calculation in speed of the car so they can get across a washed out bringe. I do recommend the unrated version of this movie to anyone that a good laugh in a movie.
0399134204|5.0|I really loved this book. I was so close to buying all of Amy Tan's books, but I read the plots of her other books and they just seem like this book. I haven't read her other books but this book is so different from any book I have ever read. It's like 8 women's short stories placed together by one theme. If you are a college student majoring in English, you'll love it, a daughter you'll love it, and I think almost anyone can enjoy this book. <br /> <br />It showed me so many things about a culture I'll never be lucky enough to be apart of, and so many things about my own relationship with my mother.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I stumbled upon the movie Serenity by chance after which I just had to watch Firefly the Series. <br />Firefly brings to the screen the story of a Firefly class spaceship and its crew consisting of an unlikely, yet lovable, group of people and the adventures they find themselves in. <br />Nathan Fillion, Morena Baccarin, Sean Maher, Summer Glau, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast (including Christina Hendricks as a GORGEOUS villain!) have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking series that can be watched over and over again!   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Firefly, along with Serenity, is definitely a series worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your DVD collection, as it will surely provide for hours of entertainment!  BRING BACK THE SHOW!!! <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|Great movie; touching, sweet, well-made.  Starts out a bit slow, but picks up soon enough. Great acting and makes you think, if it's true love, it's worth the sacrifice. Buy it; you'll like it.

B000M5AJQS|3.0|For the record, the only two films of Scorcese that I have enjoyed were Raging Bull and Last Temptation. I think he is hugely over-rated and typically Italian: everything is the mob mix of gratuitous violence, sex and religious chicanery. Whaddaya want from an ex-jesi? Maybe not The Aviator - that was more like gratuitous boredom, possibly the most insufferably dull film of all time.  So we have here in this Oscar winner the latest imaginative turn in Hollywood gangster films: acknowledging that everyone has seen all the Italian mob stories they can stomach, make a movie with an Irish mob! Quel Intrigue! This is almost as stupid as Gangs of New York. Jack Nicholson does his rote version of Evil Jack, just back from The Shining Retirement Home. Leonardo continues his spin with as nearly fake a Boston Irish accent as you can get this side of Johnny Depp. Martin Sheen is adrift - what happened to him? Did the West Wing suck all the believability out of him? Wahlberg is pretending to be Matt Damon. Again. And Matt Damon looks like he is hoping there's another Bourne film in his future. You do a Scorsese Film for the same reason you do a Woody Allen film - it buys you respect among your peers - see, more Italian mob brio - not because the film is any good.  It's not that this is a bad film (that was Aviator & Gangs - anyone who casts Cameron Diaz in a drama should have their Kodachrome taken away), it's just that it nips every mob cliche in the book and re-casts them with a Boston accent - WOW! Like a dead horse head? how about a severed hand? Like Marlon Brando's mumbles? how about Jackie's leers? Double crosses and snitches? we got 'em. The only two good crime films I have seen in the past 10 years were Usual Suspect and Layer Cake, and this film is real rubbish compared to them. It is as pruriently violent as Passion, and that's not a compliment.   If you are worried about your Jersey or Little Italy credentials being taken away, you better say you think this is great. For the rest of us, yawn.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I love this show, and having every episode helped to fill in the gaps that I had missed during the season.  Can't wait to see what happens next!!
1400049628|4.0|I'm guessing that Mr. Brooks initially sketched out the idea for this book as a humorous play on the \\"Worst-Case Scenario\\" guides.  It's clear that the author has so much reverence for the subject matter that his attempt at parody upgraded to a respectful homage at some point along the way.  The result is a terrific tome for Zombie fiction fans who wonder about the \\"real world\\" mechanics of responding to a Zombie incident.  I enjoyed it.
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of the Holy has some special songs that bring back memories for me.  Ocean is one of them but so is Over the Hills and Far away.  No quarter sounds just as good as it did back then.  That song is so mystical/magical in the first part of it but then it takes on some pretty good chops from Page that cannot be denied.  I also like the song Dancing Days, it has a very good beat to it but it also blends in rock, blues, and folk styles.  Robert Plant's singing is exciting.  Although a lot of people always like the fourth album the most, I think that this one is my all time favorite from the band.  They were all good though, so with this being a remastered CD you are getting a great deal.  Another good song on this one is the first one, The song remains the same.  Jimmy Page was always a spectacular guitar player and he has some interesting sounds on that track.  Mystical and Magical and Rock and Roll, this album has it all.
B000L212HC|5.0|This is one of those movies where you simply need to turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. Enjoy the magnificient acting, the superb cinematography, the pacing, the soundtrack and do your absolute best to ignore the plot holes, because there's loads of them. In all aspects save for plotting, this movie is a brooding work of art.<br /><br />Depends on your cerebral make-up, I guess, whether or not you are able to engage the \\"Suspension of Disbelief\\" button and ignore the obvious errors in the plot. If you are a right-brained plot fetishist, this is probably not the movie for you. But if you enjoyed Chris Nolan's previous works - Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins - odds are, you'll enjoy this one too.<br /><br />I had the chance to compare the normal DVD vs the Blu-Ray release and...well, if you are looking for a movie to show off your HD system, look no further. Batman Begins on HD-DVD was a great transfer, but I feel The Prestige eclipses it.
B00006IUL7|4.0|This is a great film because it installs the elements of cops vs. crime into a different setting.  Instead of being on the streets of Los Angeles or Chicago or New York, it all takes place in the fictional town of Nightmute, Alaska.  This is a great suspenseful show that has a lot of good action scenes.  Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors and I liked the way that he was able to bring out how stressful things were for the policeman he portrays.  The film starts out with an investigation in Nightmute followed by a tragic event.  There are some skeletons in the closet back in the states for Pacino's character which are now making the stakes much higher.  Hillary Swank plays a rookie officer who goes the extra mile, but might not like what she finds.  Robin Williams is in this to, and wow, what a performance.  Robin plays a diabolical guy who is in the shadows toying with Pacino's character, and he really adds a lot to the film.  The rain and forests are beautiful but add a good solemn backdrop to this crime thriller set in Alaska.  Not a ton of plot twists but enough to keep you wondering how things will turn out.  Pacino gives a great performance in showing how an outsider could have a hard time adjusting to this environment, where it is light all the time in the summer months.
1582701709|1.0|Its kinda sad how much money you can make off the true unhappiness in America.  <br /> <br />The old saying is true, money doesn't buy happiness. America is the richest and probably the most unhappy country in the world. Is it really a surprise a book like this would sell so much here and not in Australia, where it was made, and not even popular enough to be shown on T.V. there?   <br /> <br />When are people going to understand that all the possessions they try to get their hands on won't take away the sheer emptiness they feel inside. <br /> <br />I wish more people in this county would've gone to college and taken at least one psychology class, this is nothing but pure pseudoscience.  <br />
B00005ASQ1|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until it was given to me this past Christmas. I was intrigued by the stellar cast, but suspicious of the story as it was described on the jacket - man, was I fooled. <br />It was a marvelous experience with superb acting and story line and I particularly enjoyed the music, especially the singing as the ending <br />credits rolled by. Don't stop watching until there no more picture.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The hard science behind global warming should be common knowledge to most everyone. Unfortunately, it still isn't, and the oil interests wouldn't have it any other way. As an optimist, Gore thinks there may be enough time to prevent extreme global catastrophes. I sure hope so, but as a pessimist, I think we all may be heading to disaster. Rising CO-2 (carbon dioxide) levels are causing record high temperatures all over the planet. In the last 14 years, scientists have noted that we have had the 10 hottest years on record since the 1860's. About 35,000 Europeans died from the heat wave of 2003. We may all be at risk of slowly baking to death, creating a literal hell on earth. You can thank the oil companies, oil lobbyists and primarily the Republicans who have successfully put greed before the environment for over four decades. They have quite successfully suppressed the message of global warming for over 30 years. To paraphrase Gore, without an earth, how will they be able to enjoy their mountains of ill-gotten gold, anyway? Stupid, greedy people will be the death of us, themselves, all our children and perhaps all life on this planet. God help us. Gore offers way to reduce CO-2 in the atmosphere, if you want to do something about it.

B000056KQN|5.0|Oliver Stone is one of my favorite \\"Hollywood\\" filmmakers, and I have enjoyed many of his movies over time.  While I haven't seen a few of his works, he has given more than his share of fine cinema from his beginnings, and I count \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Born on the Fourth of July,\\" \\"JFK,\\" and \\"Nixon\\" as among his better efforts, and I applaud and repeatedly watch parts of all of these.  However, to me, Oliver Stone's \\"Wall Street\\" is, overall, his best.<br /><br />For one thing, it avoids a lot of the overlength and filler in many of his other films, as well as his sometimes uncomfortable mixture of fact and fiction/speculation.  \\"Wall Street\\" is pretty much a standard length and mainstream studio production, and while, as in almost all Stone films, it has a message to preach, in this one, he goes for a much lighter, more obscure, and subtle but just as powerful approach.  And while this is fiction, and does not really deal with actual known historical or present-day people, the message here, both moral and profound, seems as timely these days as when the movie was first released in the 80's.  That \\"morality\\" message posits that pursuit of profits and materialistic riches above any/most other considerations, especially above individual human integrity and decency, is an eventually losing proposition for any truly decent, thinking person, with true integrity.<br /><br />Being a more \\"conventional\\" film, the \\"morality message\\" here may pass way over a lot of people's heads, especially those Oliver Stone haters who've never seen this and/or who are automatically turned off to any Oliver Stone effort, but the message remains Stone's most powerful, if obscure.  And this is a must see, and Stone's overall best movie.<br /><br />Charlie Sheen, (and to a lesser extent, his real life father and cinematic icon Martin Sheen, who amazingly enough plays the main character's real life father), as well as an outstanding performance by oscar-winning Michael Douglas, and other acting gems, as well as a fast-pace, little filler, linear plot and execution, add up to something really special.<br /><br />The junior Sheen plays an up and coming and hoping, Wall Street, poor, \\"player\\" wannabe, who works as a going nowhere fast financial investments seller within the legal stock market system, whose main goal is to get close to one of the real players in the American financial market.  After much effort, he finally and with dogged persistence, gets a short \\"meeting\\" with an all powerful, super-rich, almost legendary established player in the form of Michael Douglas.<br /><br />Selling his soul early on, \\"Bud\\" (Charlie Sheen) soon begins to throw aside all of his roots and basic decent, moral upbringings, as well as the fate of his father and many decent working folks, in order to happily fall under the spell of his sociopathic leader/teacher (Gordon Gekko - Douglas), and enjoys enormous financial \\"success\\" within the philosophy of his indecent mentor.  For awhile, the almost religious mantra of Gekko's \\"greed is good\\" more than succeeds, but for a short time only.<br /><br />Before long, Sheen finds himself in a swank upper-east side Manhattan apartment, with money and the company of a beautiful, intelligent, but shallow girl (the best that can be bought), and sees a promising future as a true Wall Street player and wealthy corporate parasite. Trouble is, he loses his soul and moral fiber somewhere along the way, and realizes that for all his material gains, he has hurt the real people closest to him, and has betrayed them and his own self as well.<br /><br />While Oliver Stone could've resolved and ended the film in a way he might've these days (strangely and sadly and even more so the same as it ever was concerning rich versus poor, haves versus have-nots, etc.), when corporate interests and money hunger rules over substance, he gives us instead a character who finally and deeply realizes the evil he has helped create, and does something about it.<br /><br />If only the true humanitarian message and morals of this film could be realized and understood by our present day corporations, CEO's, power brokers, and by our indecent PTB and politician/law-makers (and the superficial and sensationalist-driven mainstream media and Hollywood elite), this world would be, I believe, a lot better one in which to live.<br /><br />This is a film as topical as anything since, unfortunately, but the lessons have yet to be learned, and if anything, the PTB (powers that be) have only since gained more and more, at the expense of others less fortunate.  For those viewing this as simply a pretty decent flick, without any heavy moral undertones, it is still Stone's most satisfying and easily understood filmic experience.  In addition however, for those who read between the lines, and truly get the under-the-surface morality message here, it simply but powerfully renders upon the viewer a deep questioning of what \\"success\\" really is, and at what acceptable cost.<br /><br />\\"Wall Street\\" was produced in the 80's, but its message and power, seem as true today as ever.  Unlike so many other murky or over the top Oliver Stone films though, it remains, and probably will for some time, the definitive cinematic morality play from one of America's greatest filmmakers.  Its message is clear, upon repeated viewings, and that is that reality is, we are all in this together, we sink and/or swim together, and harming others in the pursuit of selfish gain, is a moral philosophy doomed to spiritual and individual failure, in the end.  No matter how great the temporary materialistic gains.<br /><br />If you only see one Oliver Stone film in your life, let it be his best, in my view, this one.  If its subtle but sublime morality message does not grab you at first, it probably will eventually, as you think about it more and more later on.uld be realized and understood by our present day corporations, CEO's, power brokers, and by our indecent PTB and politician/law-makers (and the superficial and sensationalist-driven mainstream media and Hollywood elite), this world would be, I believe, a lot better one in which to live.

1400034779|5.0|What a charming book! It had been on my to-read list for some time, and I regret that it took me so long to get to. Precious Ramotswe is a clever, plucky woman in her 30s who decides to open a detective agency -- the only such agency run by women -- in her native country of Botswana. Although business is initially slow, the locals soon warm up to the idea and Mma Ramotswe takes on cases ranging from missing husbands and stolen cars to false fathers and fraudulent doctors.<br /><br />Getting to know Mma Ramotswe is a hoot, as is meeting her friends and clients. Throughout it all, Botswana's beauty and charm subtly take center stage.
B000GDH9J6|5.0|This film is a wonderful cinematic experience. The story is real, and the Nepalese high mountains are the perfect backdrop for this dramatic, amazing story about the clash of honour, sacrifice and greed.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Another action-filled Guy Richie flick set in England and starring the lower class.  Brad Pitt makes a particularly amazing showing as a gypsy.  Like \\"Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels,\\" this movie is full of cinematography that makes me catch my breath and stare in amazement, as well as terrific dialogue and wonderful characters.  Fans of the ultra-violent should enjoy this one as well as those who just enjoy a great action flick!
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|I bought this and \\"The Prestige\\" at the same time with the intent of a double feature.  I have yet to find time to watch The Prestige, but, I suspect, it will be the better film.  This Illusion in this film, is that is great.  It has all the making of a great movie: the cast is stellar, the cinematography is impeccable, the story is a good one; but it manages just more than mediocrity.<br /><br />Don't buy this movie.  Add it to your Netflix list or watch it when it hits the free section OnDemand, but don't own it.  It isn't great.
1582701709|3.0|This information has been out there for years and years and regurgitated ad infinitum in different books, movies, journals, and new age movements.  Worth a read if you have never been exposed to the law of attraction, but read it with a balanced perspective.
1415926697|5.0|The author spins an incredible tale with vivid descriptive language and a comfortable style.  The messages about faith, belief systems and the universality of religion are life changing.  I found the book authentic, humerous and worth sharing with everyone I know.  I am a 60 year old woman who has been in a marriage for 40 years and yet I could identify with the author as she tries to recover from her divorce and search for God, inner peace and love.  There are lovely messages about tolerance for differences and embracing bits and pieces of every culture we encounter.  That has always been my feeling about life and so this author hit a homerun with me.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Very cute movie for adults and children.  My 18 month old son loves the shake & go cars.
B000031WBQ|5.0|Artur Rubinstein was one of the most extraordinary colorists of the piano&Ntilde; owner of that prodigious ability to remark, depict and describe the inner tensions without losing the formal structure, elegance and lyricsm of the work he played, he hovers his Rachmaninov's performances of a very unusual noblesse and sense of grandeur (as Walter Gieseking or William Kapell, for instance).<br /><br />This Rachmaninov's second. although it lacks of required fierceness in some passages, it's elegant, sensitive and romantically scented.<br /><br />The Variations on Paganini's theme to my mind are less impressive respect to the other not so well known version recorded with Victor de Sabata, which is much more incisive, mercurial and imaginative.<br /><br />A worthy to collect album!
0399143793|4.0|I love Jack reacher books because they are direct and to the point.  Easy read and not too much narration.
1577312082|2.0|The beginning of the book talks about how he, at 29 years old, basically had a MASSIVE panic attack (read, a nervous breakdown) and then remembers nothing.<br /><br />He then continues to say how he spent the next 2 years living on a park bench in complete bliss.<br /><br />Think about this, he has a nervous breakdown, becomes homeless (happily) and now writes a book how everyone in the world is thinking in incorrectly about their \\"inner being\\"???<br /><br />He talks about listening to the voices in your head and stepping back from them.<br /><br />He talks about seperating one's self from the mind because it's just a tool that causes pain, etc.<br /><br />I can't even finish this book.  What this book tells me is there is a guy who went clinically insane, blacked out, became homeless and lives in an alternate reality because he can't deal with the real reality and, to top it off, he hears voices in his head.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm not enlightened or spiritual but if being \\"enlightened\\" is changing my reality so I disconnect from the world whilst listening to voices in my head....I'll stick to being corrupted.
0763627410|5.0|My daughter has loved this book ever since her grandma bought it for her.  She was 5 months then, and is 11 months now, and we still read it for her every day at least 3 times!!  She loves the colorful fish and she points to them as we count them.  The pages are heavy duty and have stood up to many, many readings and lots of drool!  Definately recommended.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Awesome!  That's all I need to say. I'm sure others will write a long detailed review.
B0000CAXID|4.0|I'm not a huge Foo Fighters or Nirvana fan, although both of those bands are/were great at combining heaviness and pop accessibility.      However, I think this album deserves a certain amount of consideration apart from both Nirvana and the Foo Fighters' later releases.  The production is relatively lo fi and there are a lot of songs, in the second half of the album, which emphasize mood, texture and heaviness rather than the hooks and catchiness that would exclusively characerize later Foo albums.  As such, many Foo Fighters fans wrongly see these songs as filler.  They are not.  They are the essence of a different musical vision that David Grohl did not ultimately pursue.    The essence of that vision is ghostly, slightly muffled, yet catchy vocal melodies mixed into super-fuzzed out, heavy soundscapes.  Basically, it seems to me that the idea is a gentler, more melodic variant of the post-stoner sound later adopted by QOTSA.  Indeed, this album is more similar to QOTSA's split EP with Kyuss than it is to later Foo Fighters albums, where the vocals are way up front and there is an ultra-polished pop-punk sensibility designed to dominate alt-rock radio.      Although this album has a few radio gems (i.e. the first three songs), the most interesting songs on the album are songs like Good Grief, Floaty, X-static and Exhausted where this \\"early Foo Fighters\\" sound is fully realized.  These songs have a great, understated, trippy sound, and I personally wish David Grohl had explored it a little further.  But, of course, he went on to do just fine for himself and that's okay too.
B000L212HC|5.0|Whilst some reviewers will only give you their opinion on what they thought of the ending and the twists and whatnot, do not miss the important point of film. <br /> <br /> the proverb that \\"its about the journey, not the destination\\" definately applies here. I for one enjoyed the ending and found it justified. Films that can entertain you AND get you thinking are very important. If you like to piece together puzzles or play puzzle games in your head, then this film will definately delight you whilst watching it, and even after its over and you know the answers.... you will be tossing around the moments that have happened all throughout the film upon rewatching it. <br /> That will free your mind to enjoy the amazing cinematography and direction that this film recieves. I believe the best compliment that i can give this film is that if a book had been written of its plot first, no one would have believed that a film adaptation would be possible.  That should be a testament to the Nolan brothers' talent, who are quite intelligent and far ahead of their time. <br /> <br /> As far as the Blu-Ray, whether you like the film or not, its encoding at 1080P at AVC-1 are outstanding. The picture is alive and breathtaking. i do not use the word breathtaking lightly, i mean the picture, if it could phsycially do it, WOULD jump out of the TV and punch you in the chest, knocking all wind out of you, its so delightfully vibrant.  <br />  <br /> The sound is equally amazing, and can be best experienced on a 5.1 surround system.  <br /> <br />This flick really has more to it than any old flick you can pick up at your local blockbuster. Whether you're a thinker or not, its important to give this film a thought to come up with your own conclusions on the matters that the film addresses. Films that make you think, whilst entertain you at the same time, WITHOUT BEING PRETENTIOUS is a quality and an asset to a great film maker. <br /> <br />  Do enjoy THE PRESTIGE for what it has to OFFER, its a film that definately meets your expectations at the door, and invites you into its house, rather than yours. <br /> <br /> If that is too intimidating for you, then please skip it and do not bash this film, because with any good art, it is meant to bring something OUT of you, not please your editorial whims. Having said all that, i was delighted by the overall presentation of the film, and enjoyed it very much.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended with 5 stars.
0763631205|5.0|I've been shopping on Amazon for years and this is the first review I've ever left for a purchase I made; that's how impressed I was with this book.  I also collect versions of the classic story and I agree with the other reviewer that this is positively one of the best, ever.  A majority of the pages have beautiful illustrations that wrap into the text or take the entire page, the binding and cover is understated yet perfect for this book.  This is the unabridged version, the original text of the author.  If you were to own just one copy of A Christmas Carol, this would be it.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|<br />Nominated for six Academy Awards (and winner for Music Score), producer-director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's BABEL is a complex and challenging treat for adult moviegoers.  It demands full concentration, running 143 minutes and often with English subtitles.  And it thrillingly intercuts related stories taking place along parallel lines in Morocco, Tokyo, and the Mexico-California border.  It is a masterpiece that engrossed me while I watched it on DVD, and that haunts me one day later. <br /> <br />We start in Morocco with American tourists Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.  A nomad family has received a powerful rifle as a survival present.  Using it for fun, one child seriously wounds  Blanchett in a distant tour bus.  While she is taken by helicopter to a hospital in Casablanca, the incident is treated as an international terrorist attack by the media. <br /> <br />Cut to Tiajuana, where a birthday party is taking place.  The guests include the kids of Blanchett and Pitt, plus their loyal long-time Mexican nanny (and Oscar nominee) Adriana Barraza.  At dawn, the party breaks up and Barraza and the two children head back toward California.  (They live in San Diego.) <br /> <br />Cut to Tokyo, all bright lights and neon signs at night.  (The cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto.)  Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi plays a sex addict deaf-mute teenager who is frustrated at not being able to communicate with her businessman father.  Linking the Tokyo scenes to Morocco is the fact that the murder weapon was apparently sold to the Moroccan father by Kikuchi's father.  Critics who complain that the Tokyo scenes are irrelevant must have missed this crucial point. <br /> <br />So, we have a long movie that excitingly intercuts scenes in Arabic in Morroco, in Spanish in Mexico, and in Japanese in Tokyo.  The yellow English subtitles on DVD are a huge help, and both Barraza and Kikuchi richly deserved their Oscar nominations.  So did editor Stephen Mirrione.  The brilliant common theme for Oscar nominees Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga is a lack of communication in a chaotic modern world.  The Moroccan family cannot communicate with the English-speaking media.  (Amusingly, a frustrated Pitt swears a lot, as if that would help expedite matters.)  Kikuchi, as a deaf-mute, perhaps takes off her clothes (the film has full female frontal nudity) to gain her father's and others' attention.  Most troubling of all, Barraza's illegal alien nanny character has a powerful pre-dawn confrontation with a Mexico-California border guard. He speaks Spanish, so he seems to be nasty with her just to set an example. <br /> <br />Editor Mirrione cross-cuts these three beautifully written and acted subplots faster and faster as we pass the two hour running time mark, with twenty minutes or so to go.  BABEL is a masterpiece of filmmaking with a lingering power for me.  It is the crowning achievement for Inarritu,. who previously made AMORES PERROS and 21 GRAMS.  This is definitely his best film.  Does Barraza's Mexican nanny get deported or sent home to San Diego?  Does Japanese teenager Kikuchi make contact with her father?  And does Blanchett's American tourist survive her gunshot wound?  I will only say that the stories are satisfyingly and optimistically wrapped up for me, and that the final shot in nighttime Tokyo is haunting.  BABEL is not to be missed. <br />  <br />
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I had never seen \\"Gran Prix\\" until yesterday (I was catching up on some former Oscar winners on the day the 2007 Academy Awards were to be presented).  I hadn't felt a great need to see a racing movie because I'm not a fan of any class of auto racing.  However, I came away from this movie with an impression that I had seen an outstanding technical achievement with at least an acceptable storyline.   <br /> <br />I am still rerunning many parts of the movie in my mind because of the many innovative scenes of Gran Prix racing.  We are treated to an ample amount of the speeding race cars and from a variety of angles.  There are shots from cameras mounted on the race cars, overhead shots, side angles etc.  this variety of perspectives keeps the racing action from becoming overdone.  Frankly, I'd guess that half the film is of the racing competitions yet, even though I'm not a racing fan, I did not tire of the action.   <br /> <br />The other half of \\"Gran Prix\\" does not match the quality of the racing.  There are a mix of romances that are of moderate interest.  It's actually the cameraderie of the racers, the motives and perspectives of the auto-makers, and the \\"candid\\" thoughts of the racers that keeps the relatively slow-motion part of the movie on track (sorry).  James Garner does better when he's alowwed to be his mischevious self but his all-serious demeanor seemed to work all right after I got used to it.  Yves Montand was strong in his role but Eva Marie Saint came across too much like Leslie Stahl on an extended assignment; too little emotion but all the right questions and observations.  I was impressed with the Japanese Auto-maker but didn't realize, until the final credits, that it was Toshiro Mifune.  His moustache and neatly combed hair seemed like a camoflauge after all those Samuraii movies.   <br /> <br />This movie is a long one but I only realized that when it still wasn't finished in time for the Academy Awards show.  I was caught up enough to stickwith the movie instead of the awards.  This movie grew on me as the evening and the next day wore on.  I believe the excellence of \\"Gran Prix\\" lies in its' outstanding technical presetation and the way the action and the story alternate while giving us frequently changing perspectives.  I'm not sure I've seen that many movies that put as much successful effort into making us feel a part of such an esoteric society.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I never read the comics, but the movie was awesome. Gotta read the comics now.....
1582701709|1.0|The very premise of this book is totaly out of touch with the real world.  By simply thinking about something you receive it?  Hmm.  Sounds like some sort of fairy tale, genie-in-a-bottle philosophy to me!  <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|2.0|The fact that this movie was nominated for so many awards is mind-blowing.  It had its (few) funny moments.  The sarcasm scene between Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear in the van comes to mind.  However, save for the disturbing sexual content and the awkwardness that came from it, this movie is scarcely memorable.   <br />Not only did it move slowly, but many parts that were supposed to be funny ended up being painful.  What is funny about subjecting a little girl to sexual ideas anyhow?  And other things about the movie were just plain obnoxious.  The parents and all their bickering were just too annoying to appreciate.  Though I will say that the mutual understanding and the relationship between the son and the uncle was well done and probably the only realistic thing about this movie.  Their characters, in realizing that sometimes life isn't so wonderful and the only thing you can do about it is just deal, were the only characters that seemed to have been developed.   <br />I just don't see what the message was here.  At the end of the day, they still have problems.  So maybe the whole point was that they were brought closer together by Olive, but that's something the audience has to assume.  There are tons of decent movies out there that succeed in trying to communicate a message.  This one was just messy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For all of you out there who haven't heard of Firefly, well, you should.    I never saw Firefly aired on television. Actually, I saw the movie, loved it, and decided to watch the series. If you only saw the movie and think you've seen everything the series has to offer just by that, think again. The movie doesn't come close to introducing the characters the way the show does, and I have to say, contains some of the best characterization I've seen in years.    From the fiercely protective Captain Malcolm Reynolds; Inara, the registered companion; would-be doctor Simon Tam and his sister, River, the genius who went crazy after her head was messed with by the government; Shephard Book, who seems to know more about the world than a man of the cloth should; the sometimes cowardly but hilarious Jayne; polar opposite husband and wife team Zoe and Wash; and Kaylee, the ship's mechanic, the show is more than just a sci-fi space spoof.      They steal, they fly, wear brown coats and combat boots, and curse in Chinese...I don't want to give plotlines; it isn't needed. But it isn't just the action or the cool comebacks that make this series truly special; it's the underlying meaning and fierce bond between the characters. They are intensely loyal to one another, and with each episode comes something new learned about every one.    With excellent dialogue and engaging characters and tales, Firefly is in a genre of its own, mixing cowboys, a future stuck in the old west, moral dilemmas, and outer space. Seriously people, Firefly is a one-of-a-kind show, and there will never be another like it, ever. I don't understand how this didn't make it for longer, what with all the trash flying around, like One Tree Hill, America's Next Top Model, Gilmore Girls, and everything else, you'd think something as genius as Firefly would have been given a chance. When I think about all of the shows I've seen, I can't seem to remember one that tops Firefly, at least, not for me. So, to undermine myearlier comment, 'one of the best television shows of all time,' I'm going to correct myself and say that, for now, and after all the years of watching shows last and last, season after season after season, Firefly, a television show comprised of only fourteen episodes and three extras that never even aired, in my opinion, beats every single one, hands down. Now, what does that say?    Have I said how much I love this show? Probably, but I'll say it again. I love it. I love the characters. I love the stories. I love the dialogue, the jokes, the outfits...I love everything about it. Firefly feels like some long lost friend who I spent my entire childhood with, that's what. I watch it and I want to watch it right over again, and then, maybe a third time, too.     Now, we're all left to enjoy and mourn what was and what might have been.  Oh, yeah, and if you've seen this, or even if you haven't, check out the movie; it's awesome.    I'll give you a challenge; watch this series. I'm not saying it'll be your favorite, but I am saying, whoever you are, where ever you are, I think you might just love it, and if you don't, feel free to comment as much as you want and argue with me. But, please, just watch it, because if you don't you are seriously missing something tremendously great.
B000148KK2|5.0|In this album Diana moves past the stilted hero-worship and bland retro-staged recreations of years past, and creates her own sound. If your idea of ideal jazz is that which recreates the same arrangements, with the same songs as 1950, then you won't like it.   <br /> <br />As a jazz musician and composer there's nothing more stifling than the idea that the genre stopped 40 years ago. Its funny to hear comments like the songs on this new album are just \\"pop music\\", when in the golden years of jazz, it *was* popular music!  Jazz artists through the decades have always taken the best current songs and made them their own, even in the bop years.  <br /> <br />Sure, there's lots of modern jazz that is \\"smooth\\" pap, not worthy of the name, but this is the opposite of that trend. For all of the complaints this album has a traditional acoustic jazz combo orchestration and sound, but with an energy and push that is lacking in her other albums. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|If you like Tool and don't already own this disc, you're missing out. It is the greatest compilation and a standard for any CD collection.
B000021Y77|4.0|When the film first started, I have to say I was ready to write the film off. I notice a lot of films who use wild filmmaking techniques to cover up the lack of substance in the film. With this it seemed as if anything and everything was used to tell the story for wild, fast-paced editing to animated sequences to split-screen. But whereas Requiem for a Dream also had a myriad of visual tricks to make up for the lack of substance, this film is a rollercoaster and knows it and uses it because it needs it. This was not meant to be some tearjerking drama; it's just good energetic stuff. <br /> <br />Manni is in trouble because he lost 100,000 of a mobster's money and he isn't happy and he gives him 20 minutes to find it or else. His girlfriend Lola isn't going to just sit around and has to run all over the place in order to help find it before Manni robs a supermarket. But this 20 minutes is told a couple of times over as possible alternatives. Instead of not knowing what will happen but rather where the same story will branch off into different outcomes. <br /> <br />Now I should mention the opening sequence which is as kinetic and obvious MTV influenced than anything. By this time I was thinking \\"I don't think I'm going to be into this very much\\". That is until the film jettisoned that idea and it becomes more energetic and it works better. One of my favorite ideas is at times Lola will bump into someone in a scenario and a series of photographs will show you where that person's life will lead with different outcomes. Example: one guy on a bike will crash and meet a woman and get married while in a different scenario he becomes homeless. It's basically kind of like a butterfly effect and it helps the idea of unpredictability and if different actions would bring different outcomes. <br /> <br />Acting is spot-on and no better heroine than Franka Potente. Physically fit with big red hair, it's a good main character as anyone but I have one annoyance. At certain times (3, I think) Lola basically screams her head off and shatters glass and it just seemed unnecessary. Yeah we want to win at Roulette but screaming over recommended decibel levels. But other than that, she's as solid with everyone else pulling in respectable performances. <br /> <br />Don't mind the 8-year-old-on-a-placebo-kick opening and you'll find a good example to kill an hour and 20 minutes.
B00005QW4K|3.0|I got this one mainly for the commentary track.  The quality of the print was hit and miss.  Yes, I know they added 15 minutes of footage from various sources, and that would account for some of the inconsistancy of the quality of the print, but there were other parts that are in the standard 82 min. version that just looked awful here.  The Universal release isn't the long version, and there are no extras, but IMO the print was better.  I understand the Boomstick edition looks even better, though I haven't seen it.  Anchor Bay seems to have a history of using bad prints for their DVD releases, and this one would seem to fall into that category.  I would recommend this for extreme fans only - just for the commentary, which is pretty good.

My thoughts are, if this really works than every swinging Dick since the time of Caveman should have been layed by a beautiful women! 90% of all men sometime in their lives have thoughts about and desired this. How often did the really really ugly guy find success? Was it because he was thinking about truly ugly women? Hell no! magazine, movies, porn industry etc. fills our sences. Poor Joe 250 pounds overweight, does not bathe regularly, yellow teeth, shy, thick glasses, all he has to do put down the magazines with the gross girls in them and pick up the ones that are hot!

B000BO0LKY|4.0|Mariah stepped her game up from her last 2 albums and the buzz was definitely worth it. The first half of the album is good and the end was good, but the middle is a bunch of fillers. \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is definitely the best track you kinda get a feel of the old Mariah back it the 90's. Great job and can't wait for the next album.
B000M341QO|3.0|First of all, let me make it clear that I was jazzed about seeing this movie, and was surprised that I didnt love it.  Some performances were great, like DiCaprio, some were, uh not great, like Marky Mark and the debauched, deranged, Nicholson, and some were just annoying like Damon's,  I mean all he did was his will hunting again, and his character was so obvious, I just sat there thinking, who would not suspect him..I mean he lives in a multi million dollar penthouse in Beacon Hill with a commanding view of the state house and he's a bleeping cop, ..uh this is not a red flag, and he grew up in the same neighborhood as Nicholson's character and they were close as he grew up..and nobody knew this?  NOBODY?!!!  Baldwins character must be the biggest idiot on the eastern seaboard, he keeps promoting the corrupt Damon.  As for the love connection between Damon and the psychiatrist, I did not buy it at all, I mean a woman with an M.D. and is a shrink is going to fall for a classic sociopath, not to mention Damon's mysoginistic faux charm, it's all to rehearsed and too smooth, it does not resonate, Damon has no sex appeal, he seems like a narcissistic bore, and that good will hunting faux bastin accent, lord, he seems so impressed with himself that he can imitate a south boston accent, I know Damon is from Boston..but it seems so fake, he should have consulted Marky Mark..who grew up in South Boston, not Cambridge, like Damon,  but, I did totally understand her feelings for DiCaprio, he is just naturally so much more sexy and interesting than Damon, I have a feeling if you met them in real life you would feel the same way...hummmm.   I loved DiCaprio in this, he is the only reason I gave this film three stars, that is why i hated the ending so much, it was unfair to his character, shocking really, it's like Scorcese, just wanted to stun his audience.  I do recommend seeing this film, Scorcese is a great director and the film is art, but it's not Goodfella's or Raging Bull. I would like to know who is reading all the neg. reviews for this and giving an unhelpful..are you related to Scorcese, is Damon your secret crush?...I have seen this movie and this is a fair synopsis, well articulated, thoughtout and whether you agree or not: valid.
1582701709|1.0|The Secret is the worst book ever published. The Secret is also the worst DVD/television programme ever made. It is worse than lowest common denominator - It is Divide by Zero error.    What is the secret ? - there is no secret.    It is all fluff and filler and no facts.  The TV show is 2 hours of nothing to break up the commercials.    If you like to be handed everything on a plate very slowly, and then get to the end and find out it was all building towards nothing then you are going to love this.     The production values are slick, but the message is empty and trivial to the point of non-existance.    Your life is too short.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Walt Disney's 1953 animated version of \\"Peter Pan\\" holds a jeweled place amid versions of Sir James M. Barrie's story, read, viewed, and in young Walt Disney's case, acted in during its first 50 years.<br /><br />Disney gave Tinker Bell, formerly a glow and offstage ring, the human face, emotions and shape to become a model for \\"today's woman,\\" and Disney's TV co-hostess for 30 years. (Disney proved Barrie's wisdom in saying, \\"Temper is a weapon we hold by the blade.\\" Female jealousy  threads throughout the film's pirate and Indian adventures.)<br /><br />Disney gave off-stage ticking the darting eyes and hilarious snap of the crocodile, whose teeth Pan's nemesis Captain Hook feared more than his opponent's sword. Through artistry from Disney's \\"Nine Old Men,\\" Barrie's stage directions became animated, other-worldly wonder. They drew the magic of flying over London and away from family cares to every young boy's heroic dream and adventure. Best of all, Barrie's story of a boy who wouldn't grow up, charms mermaids, Indian princesses, fairies and children, and confounds Hook, became Disney's mission statement of sorts. Its entertainment would, like Barrie and his Pan, aim to make children feel brave and grown-ups feel young.<br /><br />This two-disc \\"platinum edition\\" DVD is welcome even amidst Disney's constant stream of sequels and re-releases. Its restored picture is  vibrant and 5.1 theater-style sound deeper and richer; you hear the exhilarating wind-rush of the film's signature song, Oliver Wallace's \\"You Can Fly.\\" (Also listen close for cameos by legendary voice actors June Foray and Thurl Ravenscroft.)<br /><br />\\"Peter Pan's\\" generous bonus features include two music videos and a black-and-white promotional film made for the theatrical release, featuring Disney's artists and sound engineers in action. It also examines alternate songs and openings (with storyboards), and a touching re-recreation of Walt Disney's personal rationale for making the film. DVD audio commentary features Roy Disney, Kathryn Beaumont(voice of Wendy),legendary animator Ollie Johnston and \\"Tink's\\" live model, Margaret Kerry. The DVD also demonstrates Tinker Bell's different portrayals up to her own upcoming DVD.<br /><br />Barrie once said, \\"I'm not young enough to know everything.\\" His yearning to consistently capture childhood's sense of discovery influenced the world for more than 100 years, from Mary Martin on early, vintage TV to Michael Jackson and his infamous \\"Neverland Ranch\\" to Johnny Depp in Barrie's filmed biography.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is one of the best Bond films in many, many years, harking back to the tough, down to earth adventures of the 1960s. Producers and director Martin Campbell have smartly toned down the ridiculous gadgets and tongue-in-cheek humor to bring Bond back to reality. And Daniel Craig is the most charismatic, tough and believable Bond since Sean Connery. Much of Bond's signature personality is not quite established yet, because he has just become a \\"00\\" agent in this film. So he is cocky, rough- around-the-edges and not quite as polished as in later years. <br /> <br />If you prefer the outrageous, over-the-top Bond films that plagued much of the Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan films, then you probably won't like this movie. But if you prefer a more realistic Bond that underscored most of the Connery films and Lazenby's single outing, then you will be pleasantly surprised by Casino Royale. In addition to Craig's strong performance, we get an excellent outing from Eva Green as the \\"Bond girl\\" in this particular movie. Green is very believable as Bond's love interest who ultimately double crosses him, making him a bitter man. <br /> <br />The action sequences are quite good, as are the fight sequences with Craig. He is very athletic and brawny, which makes him quite believable in the role as a secret agent and someone who could be in the Royal Navy. And Craig's performance during the infamous torture sequence is both funny and intense at the same time. He gets it right on the money. I was glad to see this film rewarded with big box office receipts worldwide. It certainly deserved it. This is one of the top 5 Bond films of all time. <br />

B000NA1VIW|5.0|I am entirely disappointed with the CASINO ROYALE DVD. The DVD image is not especially detailed to my eye and there are visible digital artifacts present. What's worse, the entire film (with the exception of the black and white scenes and main title credits) has a yellowish haze over it. I found this yellowish haze very annoying and was not present in the theatrical release of the film. Also I find it incredible that there are there are no trailers for CASINO ROYALE on the disc! The teaser trailer and the primary trailer were two of the best ever designed for a James Bond film. Where are they? There is also no audio commentary of any kind to be found. Nothing! The extras on Disc 2 are a major disappointment. I thoroughly and wholeheartedly believe that CASINO ROYALE is one of the best James Bond films but of the 21 Bond DVDs, this is the worst from a technical and esthetic standpoint. When I think of the original DIE ANOTHER DAY 2-Disc DVD that was issued and compare it to this one I cringe. The DIE ANOTHER DAY 2-Disc DVD was one of the best ever issued regardless of the merits of that Bond film. The extras covered many aspects of that film from many perspectives. The CASINO ROYALE 2-Disc DVD pales in comparison and that is very unfortunate and disheartening.<br /><br />As for the actual movie, I think CASINO ROYALE is excellent. If there was any doubt that Daniel Craig could portray or even be James Bond on screen, and there was plenty of skepticism, view CASINO ROYALE. Daniel Craig surpasses the competition with unique aplomb, wry humor, his physique and absolute sincerity. He is the perfect masculine specimen and the thinking man's Bond at the same time. Daniel Craig does have that certain screen magnetism that Sean Connery had in the role but you have to see him in motion to appreciate him. Yet, Craig has incredible attributes that none of his predecessors possessed. David Arnold composed one of the best and simultaneously a very controversial score referring to the James Bond Theme in the most ethereal sense until the final scene of the film. His score is inspired by the essence of James Bond, his motivations, his skills, his strengths and weaknesses as a living breathing man. Arnold's score is a reflection of the world that James Bond and his adversaries move and survive in. This score is one of the highlights and strengths behind the success of CASINO ROYALE. There are many other elements too numerous to mention when combined with actually basing the film on Ian Fleming's novel make CASINO ROYALE one of the best James Bond films ever made. The metaphorically titled LAYER CAKE is a refreshing crime thriller that intelligently examines the levels of deception and treachery found in the drug trade as well of the levels of pipeline distribution and control of the trade. Visually brutal it relies more on its intelligent scripting and dialogue to spin its engrossing tale.es Bond Theme in the most ethereal sense until the final scene of the film.

B000M341QO|1.0|Jeers to the director, the producers,  and the businesses who sell the DVD \\"The Departed\\".  I purchased this DVD expecting to see stellar performances of all the excellent actors involved in this award winning film.  Much to my dismay however, my wife and I both could not endure the profane, fowl, and unwarranted continued use of the \\"F\\" word and several derivatives thereof.  Approximately 10 minutes into the viewing of this movie, we gave it up.<br /><br />  This movies is, in my opinion, one of the worst examples of how to destroy what was probably a very good movie.  Hence forth and heretofore we will think long and strong about purchases of DVDs that include these actors.  In all of my almost 72 years, I have been around a lot of people from all walks of life and try as I may, I am unable to remember anyone that uses such despicable language as was used in this movie........Please, don't patronize people that are involved in the production of this type and for sure, don't waste your money on this one!

Love is universal and equally beautiful no matter the circumstances. <br /> <br />It really goes to the core of what it must be like to outwardly deny that love that you want the world to see. <br /> <br />Makes you think.

0792843584|4.0|It is hard to believe that this film almost took down a major film distributor. It virtually bankrupted United Artists and destroyed the career of upcoming and then \\"golden boy\\" director Michael Cimino for excessive expenditures on this production. I do not think HEAVEN'S GATE is a bad film. The negative press that Michael Cimino endured and the fact that the film was generally released in a heavily edited version actually hurt this film's acceptance on any artistic level. The diverse cast looks very seasoned, the detailed production designs are highly convincing, the photography is lush yet gritty and the script is visually enthralling and captivating. This is a big budgeted low key telling of a struggle for land, a place to live, yet where ideologies clash over the ownership and use of the environment. Some images of SHANE come to mind. It is the same ideological struggle of the West but devoid of the passion that George Stevens injected into SHANE. Cimino's vision is a bit muddled and seems rather self centered on some individualistic higher moral standard. The film is emotional but Kris Kristofferson's central character lives in an artificial world. This is metaphorically represented at the film's conclusion as Kristofferson is depicted living out his days in a mundane existence shown aboard an opulent steam launch in almost surrealist looking tranquil New England waters. The film never seems to come to a satisfactory conclusion or resolution of the conflict in the traditional sense of the Western. Kristofferson is a flawed character somehow having taken up a cause with never really understanding the fight.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I tend to view biographical movies about recently deceased music celebrities with some trepidation because they tend to turn into overly reverrential epic sagas bordering on hero worship.  Worse, there have been such a slew of them over the years, Glen Miller, Buddy Holly, Jim Morrison, Richie Valens, and mostly recently Ray Charles have all had their lives re-interpreted in celluiloid.  Did we really need another about Johnny Cash? <br /> <br />After watching the movie, I have to say that this is by far the best of the genre I have ever seen.  Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job in his protrayal of Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon is transcendent as June Carter.  The film covers the period of Johnny Cash's life from his days of growing up during the depression on a cotton farm, to his service in the Air Force in the early 50's, his first records on the Sun label, to his prominance as a country music and American icon in the late 60's. <br /> <br />Phoenix portrays Cash most appropriately as a simple man with a surprisingly complex edge.  Cash wanted to be married, wanted a family, yet probably never loved his first wife.  June Carter was also trapped in a series of doomed marriages when Cash first met her.  Their love for each other has to be one of the true great love stories of the 20th century.  The film ends with June Carter finally agreeing to marry Johnny Cash on stage in Ontario, Canada in 1968.  They stayed together until they passed away within four months of each other in 2003. <br /> <br />The movie does a good job of capturing why Cash was so likable and became so loved by the public, and also why he was so unlikable and destructive to himself and the people around him.  A lot of that had to do with his addiction to amphetamines and barbituates, but a lot of it had to do with his childhood, and the death of his older brother. <br /> <br />I have to mention the music in this movie, Cash was a contemporary of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins at the dawn of Rock and Roll and often toured with them.  Cash drew some influences from that, but was also deeply influenced by his mother's love of gospel music.  In the end Cash's music stood on it's own above any categorization of rock, country or gospel.  Something about a Johnny Cash song, the deep growling vocals and the incessant driving country beat just transcends labels, and the movie does an excellent job of making that point. <br /> <br />Just a compelling movie about a simple yet complex man.  The movie doesn't make Johnny Cash into any more than what he was, a man with a gift to put hard feelings into song, but still a man with the same susceptablility to shortcomings as any man.  Great, well acted film with a good story.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I would be able to take Al Gore Seriously if he wasn't such a hypocrite.<br /><br />He is telling us to change our light bulbs in our houses, \\"make small changes\\". The average household uses 10, 056 KW of energy a year, and Al Gores house averages 221,000 KW per year, more than 20 times. He paid over $ 30, 000 for electric and Gas last year alone. He and his wife Tipper live in two properties: a 10,000-square-foot, 20-room, eight-bathroom home in Nashville, and a 4,000-square-foot home in Arlington, Va,  And he is barely at either!; God knows how much he wastes taking the private airplane around to lecture on conserving energy. His \\"carbon\\" footprint basically equals out to 5 normal peoples \\"footprint\\".<br /><br />He just won an Oscar last night, from Hollywood, which is also full of hypocrites. I bet you that if he asked the crowd to give up their Hummers and private planes and gigantic energy sucking mansions they would all turn away and sip their star bucks, but to ask \\"America\\" to conserve gets applause. It boggles my mind.<br /><br />I personally agree that we all need to do our part to conserve energy, use less resources, blah blah blah, but I cannot take Al Gore seriously, I couldn't take any politician or movie star seriously when their own private lives are the direct opposite to what they preach.

B000M341QE|4.0|I didn't see this movie in theaters, but did rent it the week it came out.  My girlfriend and I both enjoyed the movie, both the characters and the plot were well presented.  Some of the people I've seen posting have complained about the language, but for anybody that's actually been to South Boston, they'll know what's how most of them really talk (my Dad's from Boston).  My only complain about this movie is that I think I actually liked it better when it was Infernal Affairs.  For anybody that didn't know, The Departed is an adaptation of a 2004 Asian movie. <br />While The Departed stays true to the plot, characters, and story, I almost felt that they just refilmed the same movie but with bigger names.  Other than that, an excellent movie.

However for me I feel this was a bad move because I did not quite catch on to some things in the book. I like the way it shows how the scale patterns all connect together and how the chords interact within the scales. It is a good book, but it does not fit extremely well with my learning style. I encourage you to give it a try and see if you like it. The info is there and if you are like me you can find the info you need that fits your learning style or it can be a great supplement.

B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of the few movies that I've had to limit my watching experience with.  Often, when I love a movie, I'll watch it with different friends, maybe 3 or 4 times a year.  I've seen Eternal Sunshine twice now, with two girlfriends, and I cried through many portions of the movie.  \\"Plucks at the heartstrings?\\"  This movie tears them out and bends the neck of your heartguitar so badly you'll need to see a luthier.  This movie prods at the very core of the definitions of what love and attraction are based on, and forces the viewer to question many things about themselves.  Discussing this movie without spoling it is difficult, but suffice it to say- if you've ever been in love, and lost, or had difficulities, this movie will almost certainly offer you something.  I've never had a 'romantic' movie affect me so deeply as this.  It's genre - and mind - bending.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I saw the first Rocky movie in the theatre. It impressed me enough to see the next four sequels in the theatre. And with ticket prices what they are, that is saying alot. So now I am in my forties and Rocky Balboa hits the theatre. I took my son wanting him to share the same feelings I did when I saw the original. I was hoping it wouldn't be a Rocky V and I got my wish. Sly got the character right! My eyes welled and a lump in my throat, I smiled that I got to share this movie with my son. Thank Sylvester Stallone.
1582701709|1.0|Because frankly, this is the kind of self defeating, harmful books that shouldn't even be published. I am a scientist who has studied subjects such as Quantum mechanics at length. I am completely baffled and disappointed that people could manufacture this in the name of science. There is no secret. There is only a whole bunch of ridiculous lies with no factual basis. Please don't buy this book and continue to make these people rich. They are earning money at the expense of the public's knowledge. That is the worst, most horrible secret possible.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|It's ok, but like anything else that's overhyped, it doesn't live up to the hype. Yes, there are varied instruments, and there are some great songs on here, but there is a decent amount of filler masquerading as 'art'. As sophomore efforts go it's no better than Sam's Town, or October; it's certainly no Heaven Up Here.  <br /> <br />Kinda reminds me of Kid A, so many people claimed they loved it and it was the greatest thing ever; but before you knew it the used CD stores had more copies than you could shake a stick at (remember CD stores ?). This one isn't that bad, it's just not all it's being cracked up to be.  <br /> <br />I'm sure it'll be a great college-age hit, a Bauhaus for the 2K's. <br /> <br /> <br />
0596009208|1.0|Im not sure how useful my review is, since I am reading three other computer programing books with this one.  <br /> <br />Head first Java tries to focus on the \\"right side of brain\\" by offering humor, illustration, footnotes and side-notes... They believe that we need to exercise the the right side of brain while learning programing (which involves the left side). I am not going to focus on whether that's really accurate or not. Also another strategy is to keep repeating stuff over and over hoping that it will finally sink in. <br /> <br />Having said that let me say that if your intention is to get exposed to the programing world this book is a fun way to go. Especially, the crossword puzzles and other jokes makes it funny. My review is based on the fact that I didn't want to just get exposed to programing, but actually learn basic Java programing.  <br /> <br />Here are my criticism of the book: <br /> 1. It is difficult to write a book on Java. In many cases authors ask the readers to dismiss things that don't make sense and focus on parts that are familiar (which means just don't ask why). One way to avoid this is build an example along with chapters... In Headfirst this happens too often: \\"as we'll discuss more in later chapters\\". The beginning of the book offers too much details (in my opinion) as to how Java works and then suddenly overwhelms the user by the third example. As a result chapters build up rapidly after the first few chapters.  <br />  <br /> 2. The page is cluttered. There is too much notes referencing the code. Sometimes a code is flanked by side-notes that say the exactly same thing. Since the book is big and heavy (like a reference book) I always think how smaller the book would have been without the fun, irrelevant, right brain stuff, which brings me to the third point. <br /> <br /> 3. Too much humor. A good sense of humor is embedded within a book and actually doesn't distract the reader. Authors sometimes have footnotes just to be funnyand sometimes you might not even be sure whether they are serious or not. And I'm not exaggerating here. The whole book is written in a whimsical manner at which point I couldn't take it seriously anymore. Sure a picture of a dog in the beach is funny, but nothing is more frustrating than not getting the stuff and feeling like the author is fooling around. I believe learning is fun and it is own reward.  <br /> <br /> If programing is THAT painful that has to be spiced up then maybe its a bad idea. But maybe for someone who wants to have fun, with dogs, remote controls, funny pictures... to keep you smiling along the way.
B000002KK2|5.0|I was 18 when this was released and latched on to it like a need for speed. rlj never really knew how great she really is. Can't wait to turn my kids on to it.
6305922756|4.0|not a bad mockumentary, if U like this type of movie......It seemed a bit long but comical. Interesting mix and the cast was good.  I know this isn't the best review on here for this movie, but just my quick and basic opinion on a interesting movie.  BTW, I like the songs in this movie as well
0784011176|5.0|Since the storylines of this fourteen-year-old film must surely be well-known, let me say that The Piano, one of my favorite movies, is a unique production whose makers went out of their way to truly give it the appearance of the mid-nineteenth-century. It strolls forward with an anti-modern slowness in order to accentuate the unspoiled scenery of New Zealand, and successfully bring certain moments to prominence with a pace that matches that of the pre-electronic era in which it is set. The quality of the visuals is heightened by the performances given by Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and most especially Anna Paquin, whose skillful portrayal here won her an Oscar at the tender age of eleven. The plot of The Piano is highly unusual, even unique. For filmmakers to have accomplished the release of a tale concerning a woman of the 1800's, who went from Scotland to the most remote of British colonies in order to marry a stranger, for this woman to be one whose self-imposed muteness is compensated by her lovely playing of a piano...I'm daunted by the courage of those who brought The Piano into reality. For the wealth of feeling in its story, for its setting, for its cast and for its sheer brave inimitability, it is a fine motion picture.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|It's sexy, it's smart, it's cheesy, it makes you move--I f*ing love everything about how this album makes me feel. It's just great music.
B000002AV5|5.0|When I decided to purchase the CD, I had a mild interest in Sade after hearing her classic hits like Smooth Operator and No Ordinary Love. I knew nothing of her, with the exception of a few of her songs. My motivation for buying this album consisted of the facts that it was cheap and she was strongly recommended to me by a friend. Thus, I figured I might as well buy the album, because if it was bad I wouldn't have wasted much money on it at all.    After listening to the entire album, I have become an unmitigated Sade lover. Helen Folasade Adu, better known as Sade Adu, easily became my favorite singer after this album. Her undeniably sultriness and the sensuality that emanates from her songs give her a unique singing presence. Let's not forget her incredible voice that breathes life into the aforementioned qualities. I like almost every song on this album and I was never a Sade fan. The album has its strong points like the smooth opening song \\"Your Love is King\\"; the bounciness and appeal of \\"Smooth Operator\\"; the seriousness of \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"Pearls\\"; the beauty of \\"Kiss of Life\\"; the sensual nature of \\"No Ordinary Love\\"; the playfulness yet longing of \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\"; and the heartfelt emotion of songs like \\"Is It A Crime\\", \\"Love Is Stronger than Pride\\", and the undeniable hit \\"Cherish the Day\\".     I bought this album looking for a few songs, only to have most of them resonate with me. Some of the less popular songs may even resonate with you and or enamor you more so then her most popular songs. My personal favorites besides those that most already love are \\"Love is Stronger than Pride\\", which I liked after first hearing it and still do now, and \\"Is it a Crime\\", which grew on me. Sade's soulful, graceful elegance is definitely discernable through out the album.    If it isn't conspicuous by now, I definitely recommend this CD.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I've heard mostly negative comments about this movie.  I finally rented and watched it. The movie is long, but I was never bored for a moment. <br /> <br />This is a well acted, well written movie that was in a much higher league than Little Miss Sunshine, a film I liked, but was a pretty good little movie.  The Queen?  Boring.  Departed, nice movie, Leo was great..Departed was not near the quality of say, Goodfellows.  Again, I liked it, but it wasn't great. <br /> <br />If you like a movie with a different approach, and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.  This is the movie for you.  The three stories intertwine and come together at the end. <br /> <br />I was slightly confused at the end, when Brad Pitt's charater was talking to his nanny on the phone and it didn't make sense.  Then someone explained to me that the conversation took place a day or so in the past.  Just a slight misfire on my part.  You really have to pay attention anc concentrate on what's going on.  A pee break in the middle might lose you...I loved this movie, and I thought I would hate it!
B00005JNTX|3.0|This is one of the few stories adapted from print that comes off better on the screen than on the page. The only other one that comes to mind offhand is \\"The Beach,\\" an uninteresting, shallow book turned into a charmingly trashy film about thoroughly unlikable characters. <br />\\"Sin City\\" (the film) stands in a more complicated relationship to its source material, however. Miller's original comics are breezy reads that function more or less as summaries of Dashell Hammett (and hence have their parallels not in Hammett, but in flatter exploitations of Hammett's innovations such as the Mike Hammer novels). Graphically, Miller's books look more or less like a series of stills from cheap old Warner Brothers movies. <br />\\"Sin City\\" (the film) hence is several steps removed from its noir spring, an imitation of an imitation of an imitation; without having read the original comics, viewers will find little of interest here: there are no plots as such (only set pieces), no motivation, no background, nothing but ritual evocations of noir archetypes. Hence, there is nothing to invite casual, uninitiated viewers into the evocations. Viewing this film without context would be like listening to prayers in a religion one has no background in: there wouldn't seem to be any purpose or grounding to any of it. <br />Viewers, however, who have either familiarity with noir stuff or, specifically, Miller's comics, will find the film enjoyable and satisfying. The moving images (many of which touch in passing on compositions identical to those of the comics) are more appealing than the comics' images, inasmuch as the movie's pass too quickly to allow the staleness prolonged viewing of any given image (as happens when viewing a comic) that's simply an imitation of earlier moving images to develop. (This implies, of course, that watching \\"Sin City\\" in theater is probably more satisfying than watching it in a form in which the view can control the image delivery rate). <br />The performances of the players, for what it's worth, are sometimes fairly good, sometimes excellent, and sometimes bad, though for me \\"good\\" means that I'm not constantly aware that \\"oh, that's Actor Y.\\" Hence, here, Mickey Rourke is excellent and Bruce Willis poor. <br />The film is striking visually, and use of color is better than with the heavy-handed print version of the same stories. This difference is, I suppose, one imposed by medium. Likewise, the other differences in treatment may be largely to do with medium as well. <br />Now that I think of it, I'm happy for Frank Miller with this work: he does a better job the second time around with the \\"Sin City\\" stories and milieu. In summary: a decent way to pass a couple of hours. Trade your \\"Sin City\\" comics to someone for the DVD, watch it, be happy, and then trade the DVD for something else.
0711225176|4.0|This book is great for those who do not have a great book on Mucha. The book contains a superior history of Mucha's life and intro the Art Neuvou period(Art Nuvo). Mucha should be credited with the entire period in my opinion.<br /><br />There is wide sampling of his works, beyond that in other books. There are examples of jewelry, metal works, paintings, prints, furniture, and architecture. The images are printed very well.<br /><br />All in all, this is the second best book; The best book was purchased in Prague at his museum (can't find in US...or remember name). This book had mostly paintings but I miss the superior color quality and few pictures run across two pages (a pet peeve of mine and occasional issue in this book)...this book seems to be as good as it gets here.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well like all Tool CDs, this is absolutely amazing. Its more of a laid back type CD, I find it very relaxing and inspiring.
1582701709|5.0|The idea of this book is so simple, it is easily misinterpreted. <br />     I find it amusing how some reviewers immediately do exactly the oppoosite of what this book suggests. <br />     Of course you can't just think something and have it appear.  That is not the message.  The idea is, you attract what you think.  Of course, if you are a slovenly and unkempt man, mere thinking will not attract to you some glamorous woman.  But sustained positive thinking makes you change, clean up and work on yourself until you are indeed the man who could attract such a woman, if that is your goal.  Or, if you are morbidly obese and wish to attain a healthy weight, just thinking positively does not instantly drop pounds off your body.  But thinking positively, visualizing what you want your body to look and feel like, cuts through teh negativity and clears your mind to focus it on this goal. <br />     The idea is to change how you think and envision what you want, banishing negative thoughts and replacing them with positive thoughts.  Not just for a minute, or 5 minutes a day, but consistently, to change the way your mind processes thoughts and expriences.   <br />This is not a quick fix idea.  This is an idea that alters how we perceive ourselves and the world around us.  Artists are attracted to other artists.  Football fans are attracted to other football fans.  So if you think you hate football and shy away from it and those who play it or like it, you'll obviously not be attracted to football fans, and they won't be attracted to you. <br />     You have nothing to lose by trying these techniques, and much to gain.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|I started my day with 2046. I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung, Li Gong, and Ziyi Zhang. The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow.<br /><br />I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film. I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite, but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version.<br /><br />I just couldn't wait any longer, so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really a bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an Oscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work.
B000AADYYO|5.0|After falling in love with Blackwater Park, I bought every Opeth album I could find. I now own all of their albums except for Still Life (which I can't find anywhere). Opeth is quickly becoming my favorite bands, and this CD is no less incredible than their other works. Ghost Reveries also has some nice touches that I couldn't find in Opeth's other albums. There's a stronger growl from Mikael, more guitar solos, more audible (and better) bass (although their best bassist will always be Johan Defarfella who played on Morningrise), and some other stuff I can't think of. This is also their heaviest album since Deliverence, and the keyboardist that played with them on the Blackwater Park, Deliverence and Damnation tour is now an official member and played on this album.<br /><br />Ghost Reveries, as many people seem to miss, is a concept album, like My Arms Your Hearse and Still Life. Don't believe me? Read the lyrics. As a reviewer stated below me, it's about a boy's turmoil after killing his own mother. Mikael Akerfeldt said he wanted to write the album with occult themes in it. It's actually quite interesting, really.<br /><br />In Ghost of Perdition, the boy has killed his mother, and he is haunted by her ghost (\\"Ghost of mother!!!!\\"). The song is already fortelling the horrors he is going to face in the future (\\"To see a beloved son in despair of what's to come\\"). The song clocks in at just over 10 minutes. There is also some creepy moaning by Mikael near the end of the song over some bleak-sounding acoustic guitars.<br /><br />Baying of the Hounds marks the point where the boy goes insane. After killing his mother, he sees the people around him as evil beings (\\"Pest-ridde jackals of the earth!\\"), as demons that want to kill him. A very cool intro combines with great musicianship makes this an awesome song.<br /><br />In Beneath The Mire, he falls into depression. He thinks about the horrible thing he did (\\"Lost love of the heart in a holocaust memory\\"), and he sees himself as an evil thing that must be killed. I LOVE the middle-eastern sounding keyboards in the beginning, as the suit the song very well.<br /><br />Atonement basically continues his depression and he states \\"Suddenly I can't justify what I had become.\\" This is the first completely soft song on the album, with some tingling keyboard sounds.<br /><br />In Reverie/Harlequin Forest, he leaves his home, feeling he can't trust anyone there (\\"Into the trees, past meadow grounds, and further away from my home. Baying behind me, I hear the hounds [the people from his village], flocks chasing to find me alone\\"). He isolates himself from the world, afraid to see what others will think of him, afraid that he'll be rejected (\\"I'm hiding away from the sun\\"). He gets stuck in the delusion that he's an outcast and is hated by others (\\"You are the laughing stock of the absent minded\\"). While out on his own he tries to find comfort in someone or something (\\"Nocturnally helpless and weak in the light, depending on a prayer, pacing roads to find a seed of hope.\\"). Very heavy, and one of my favorite off the album.<br /><br />Hours of Wealth is when he finally feels some joy, or relaxation (\\"found a way to rid myself clean of pain and the fever that's been haunting me has gone away\\"). This song is very jazzy sounding - it's basically Mikael singing softly over some keyboards. Very relaxing, until.....<br /><br />...The Grand Conjuration! Definitely my favorite song off the album and the first song Opeth made a music video for. Mikael's voice is clean in the beginning, but later lets out his demonic death growls from hell. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what to make of this songor how it fits into the story. But based on some of the lyrics, I'd say the boy sees himself as a soldier of satan, on Earth to do cruel things to people. He wants someone to tell him otherwise, but no one does (\\"Say my name, ease the pain\\").<br /><br />As Mikael said in an interview, Isolation Years has nothing to do with the story of the album, but he wanted it on the record. I personally think that this should have been a bonus track later released on a special edition of Ghost Reveries since it doesn't add to the story, but it's nonetheless a very good song. It's another soft song on the album, and talks about a woman named Rosemary who sends her lover a note that says she's going to die.<br /><br />Ghost Reveries, while not my favorite by Opeth (that would probably be Morningrise), is a masterpiece of an album and should be recognized as among the best albums of 2005. Deep lyrics, bone-crushing instrumentation, and beautiful melodies have always been in Opeth's music, and they continue that trend here. They've never fit into a musicaly category, they still don't, and I hope they keep it that way. If you let the death metal growls keep you from listening to Opeth, I feel bad for you because you're missing out on some truly unique music. So go to your local Best Buy and buy Ghost Reveries, along with the rest of Opeth's catalogue.I personally think that this should have been a bonus track later released on a special edition of Ghost Reveries since it doesn't add to the story, but it's nonetheless a very good song.

0385040253|5.0|I've had this book on my wish list for nearly 20 years, I just couldn't justify the cost. Now, I'm sorry I didn't. It has allowed me to keep my hands busy for weeks. If you have a passion for knotting or know someone who does the cost is well worth the material.l
B000NA28IE|4.0|True, there is no way the movie can compare to the book. But for the haters out there- you'd all be complaining about having to sit through a three to four hour film if they were to put in EVERYTHING! This does not compare to Lord of the Rings at all, true, but it was a good, and unlike Harry Potter, faithful adaption of the book. They didn't add extra things in and sacrifice the plot, and did what they could to move things along. <br /> <br />Jeremy Irons is wonderful as always, and Rachel Weisz was the perfect choice to voice Saphira. Edward Speleers, in his FIRST film role, did a great job too. People need to remember he's not a seasoned actor, but he did a fine job! <br /> <br />If you have read the book, it's true you may feel a little put out as to how much was cut. But at the same time, it's a great way for people who have NOT read the book to see what a fantastic series Eragon is and perhaps will pick up the novels after seeing it- as I did!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This world is full of dead-beat dads and the media and movies love to show them all over our screens. This movie is refreshing because it finely shows Dads in a good way. Instead of a movie in which the Dad ran when times got hard, it showed a man sticking by his son and always being there. There needs to be more movies like this so that men now a days will think its normal to be a good and dedicated father. Some of the scenes are kind of emotional and uplifting. This is a movie that will have you cheering at the end. A great movie depicting African Americans and men in general in a good way... rare for our society. Five stars hands down!!!
B00005YU1O|4.0|My son, who is a film student, thought I might find this interesting, and he was right!  \\"Waking Life\\" just may be the most original filmic work of art that I've seen.  There was so much going on, that I'm sure I will enjoy watching it again. I experienced it on three levels: the art work, the philosophical discussions, and the \\"story line\\"--which is basically a boy sort of floating through his lucid dreamy/dreamy awakeness experiences. Some of the vignettes were confusing and the flow could have been better, but it is a great film for those who are ready for a fresh creative and intellectual trip.
0743454537|5.0|This is my first time reading a novel by Jodi Picoult, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I've watched how others have been reviewing, and I'm a little surprised. I actually think the ending fit the book. Just the way life seemed in the book, it seemed like it worked, to me, anyway. It's a big shock, yes. But it worked well, and I think it went exactly as the author wanted it to. I will definitely be reading the rest of her novels!!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|We throughly enjoyed this DVD.  May the CATS live on forever.

B00005JOCU|5.0|Jennifer, <br /> <br />I don't cry at movies, but your voice rips to the very soul and I found myself bawling uncontrollably when you sing. You are a natural actress and although a bit overwhelmed it seemed from all the acclaim, god gives to those who deserve and you do. <br /> I look forward to a long career from you and many new cds. You are an entity; a long awaited original. You carried this movie and everyone in it knew it. You can read it in their faces and in interviews. <br />You showed up the big brass but good. <br />Thanks for being so humble. <br /> <br />Congratulations on the academy award. Hattie McDaniel and Florence Ballard are smiling today. <br /> <br />Buy this dvd when it is released. It will stay in your player for a long time. <br /> <br />Thanks for being so humble

B00004VVND|4.0|James Cameron was sued by Harlan Ellison for taking the Outer Limits episodes \\"Soldier\\" and \\"Demon with a Glass Hand\\" and tuning them into the Terminator series. Michael Crichton could've got a piece of that, as his story involves a murderously minded robot that relentlessly pursues our hero. Even the poster for the films have torn-faced robots menacing the viewer.<br /><br />Crichton first try at an amusment-center-gone-amok story, used again in Jurrasic Park, was this terrific tale of robot revenge. He not only wrote but directed the picture, and with solid filmic storytelling at that. If you enjoy the genre referred to as \\"steampunk\\" (mixing historical and SF elements) than this movie's for you.<br /><br />Interestingly this film was made during the height of the \\"revisionist\\" western film cycle of the early seventies, best exemplified by Philip Kaufman's \\"The Great Northfield Minnestota Raid.\\" This was a period where the classic approach to the western was no longer in fashion. Ford, Hawks, Wayne, and even the Italians, were pretty much done with the genre. By the end of the seventies the cowboy was replaced by the space cowboy, such as Han Solo.
1582701709|5.0|I just watched the DVD last night for the first time and have been inspired by it. The inspiration came not from the quality of the DVD or those in the DVD, but from the message contained therein.    I am somewhat amazed by many of the reviews that I have read here. For the life of me I cannot find anything negative about The Secret at all.    I started applying the power of positive thinking to my life this morning in acknowledging the things that I am grateful for. As I searched my heart and soul for all that I am grateful for I realized that I am truly blessed.    At this point I have no desire to ask for anything materialistic but I have no doubt that anything that I do choose to ask for will be received.    My interest in The Secret really has nothing to do with outward gain, as there is much more needed inwardly. This realization alone has improved my life already - imagine the potential..................
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|First off, the movie was great. And I'll definately be picking it up once it's released on DVD. <br /> <br />Regarding the music - The songs from the movie could easily be hits on their own. I could definately imagine a song like \\"POP Goes My Heart\\" being released in 1984. \\"Back Into Love\\" should be a hit song today.
B000HBK3MM|3.0|Not really my cup of tea, but its alot better than alot of the other stuff thats out there now days. On thing is for sure she truly sings from her heart and soul.
B000001FS3|5.0|The best album of all U2 has produced.  Every song but one worth listening to over and over again.
0740748475|5.0|...but I think that they did not include all the strips in this collection.  One that comes to mind is when Calvin loses a quarter in the snow and uses a blow dryer to melt the snow to find it.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Disappointing film ... the cinematography was wonderful, the costumes were fantastic. Emmy is beautiful and a wonderful actress, but she's NOT an opera singer. Patrick is pretty to look at; too bad he can't act or sing. Gerard was perfect I think; great actor, just the right 'edge' to his voice to be convincing. The new orchestrations are lush and just right. I was most impressed with Miranda and Minnie, and quickly got over the fact that Minnie's voice was dubbed for the singing; she's a marvelous comedic actress and has been overlooked for far too long.
B00005S6K8|4.0|I am not a fan of classic films being remade but this one was not bad.  Greg Kinnear was particularly good.  Some of the innocence of the original was lost in trying to \\"update\\" the story, which is too bad.  But the story stayed true to the original which is something that usually cannot be said about remakes.  But, don't miss the original because there will never be another Audrey Hepburn and she was brilliant as Sabrina.
B00005JPGO|4.0|Blood Diamond is a political thriller about one of the ugliest industries there is - the diamond industry.  The movie itself isn't the best-made film there is out there but it's a shocking and very often nauseating look at the war-ravaged third world nationals forced to produce \\"blood\\" diamonds (diamonds which encourage conflicts and wars) for the wealthy and influential diamonds merchants in developed nations.  Take heed, this film is NOT FOR CHILDREN.  It's practically not even for adults!  The violence almost made me sick.  But it's the kind of violence which actual blood diamonds bring about and to discount that by sugarcoating or censoring it would have done this film a great disservice. <br /> <br />This is a very powerful film with a very powerful message and one I feel everyone should see.  I will definitely NEVER look at any diamond the same way ever again.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Most of us know Will Ferrell as a kooky, often hilarious comedic performer who excells at creating funny and memorable characters (such as Ron Burgandy in \\"Anchorman\\", or Ricky Bobby in \\"Talladega Nights\\"). However, the brilliant and heart-warmingly *normal* man he portrays in this film is a testament to his versatility as an actor!<br /><br />Quick Synopsis: Harold Crick is an IRS agent who leads a very boringly predictable life each and every day. He counts out everything, from brush strokes while he's brushing his teeth, to how many steps it takes him to get to work. What Harold didn't expect in his mundane existance was to one day start hearing a woman's voice in his head begin to narrate his life. As he frantically tries to figure out what is going on, the woman's voice (belonging to a local author who is known for her tragic stories) say in a nonchalant voice that Harold Crick was going to die.<br /><br />This film is engaging and imaginative. It is a far cry from Will Ferrell's usual role, but he manages to bring a vulnerability and a very real personality to his character. He performs in a sense that not many thought he was capable of, and gives Harold Crick a down-to-earth and completely believable vibe. His character reacts in the same way one might imagine *anyone* would react in this insane situation, and he navigates the strange plotline with ease.<br /><br />Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal each turn in equally unique and 'right-on-the-money' performances, and I would expect nothing less from any of them, but this film is still awe inspiring due to Ferell's turn as Harold Crick.<br /><br />While the idea that one could hear another person's voice in their own head, and not only have zero control over their fate, but to have to realize that no matter what you do, you either can't change the outcome or you shouldn't change the outcome, is an insane and completely unplausible concept. However...it also completely works for this film. I know that none of us watch a movie expecting to see anything that would happen in real life (that would be boring), but \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" takes an average man in need of a life change, and gives it to him in a uniquely thinking-outside-the-box sort of way. I think most of us fear change, and often fear the uncertainty in life itself, and these fears manifest to their fullest in Harold Crick's strict and rigidly controlled lifestyle that can't really be called living. He does the same thing every day. He eats the same, takes his breaks at the exact same time, walks the exact same number of steps to the bus stop, and goes to bed at the exact same time. When time begins to work against him, and his life spirals out of his control with the emergence of this voice inside his head, he actually begins *living* for the first time. While there is an air of doom ahead of him, he tries to find out how and why, while at the same time altering his rigid routine to include things he actually enjoys, and to take a couple risks in life, such as asking out the beautiful woman he is falling in love with, even with the fear of rejection.<br /><br />The cinematography and set design in this film work beautifully together. The appearance of numbers to help illustrate Harold's numeral obsession, and the bland whiteness of the author's walls indicate a blank canvas on which to create a masterpiece of fiction...that just happens to turn out to be fact. Harold's apartment consists of pale and boring yellows and greens, with little or no decoration. It all flows and works together, and it's interesting to relate it all to the mood and growth of Ferrell's character.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a must see. It's orignal and uniquely interesting. A word of caution -- the film is *not* going to explain how Harold is hearing the author's voice in his head, or how everything the author writes on her little typewriter comes true, but if you can ignore these burning questions, you will enjoy this story for what it is, and not what you might want it to be.might want it to be.

B000K7VHQ4|1.0|I just was not that impressed with the actual story.  This childhood love did not feel deep enough to carry over all those years, and while Jessica Biel may be good to look at, she just isn't a great performer.  I also did not care for any other actor except for Edward Norton whose performance was just ok. The acting and directing were just weak than other performances that I have seen and there was no chemisty between Edward and Jessica.  The ending was ridiculos and overdone as well was the acting of the evil prince. The only nice thing about this movie was the scenery, not for an hours view on screen though.  If you want to see an excellent movie about magic rent the prestige.  Edward better get a new agent.
B000KX0IOK|2.0|A movie that had fine acting but little story.  It took me 5 watchings to get to the end.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The best verzion of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen.  Who has been hiding these incredible actors?  The story, directing, camera shots, the chemistry between Ruth and Toby as their characters was outstanding.  Such an engaging, entertaining, and romantic make of this classic.  No other verzion has done justice to what Charlotte Bronte was feeling and thinking when she wrote this amazing novel.  See this.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|I had nothing but high hopes for this movie.  I love a wide variety of movies from Hollywood blockbusters to independant and foreign films.  This film, unfortunately, was about as entertaining as an afternoon movie on the Lifetime channel.  I'm sorry but all the other reviewers that exclaim how \\"wonderful\\", \\"magical\\", \\"spectacular\\" this movie is are either retarded or brain-dead!  Consider yourself warned.  The movie is just ... OK.  Nothing more.
1582701709|3.0|This is an interesting book; However, every page pretty much says the same thing.  I read about a quarter of the book and had to stop. I skimmed through the rest because it was the same information over and over again. VERY REDUNDANT!! Some of it is useful though-- it gives the reader a lot to think about. For example, being positive.  Going after what you want in life. \\"Thinking\\" your way through life in a positive way. If you think positive, you will get what you want.  BUT-- all of that could have been said in a FEW PAGES... not a whole book.  After a while the book becomes boring.  Whats worse, I paid full price for mine at a local bookstore.  For those who need a serious \\"pick me up\\", this is a good book for that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
6305907145|5.0|I was enormously entertained by the film. Fanny Price as depicted here is a fine woman, a female hero. She is not as assertive as she might be, it is true, but a realistic look at her background helps to account for this. She does, however, show the courage of her convictions by never stooping to the moral and intellectual levels of those around her, even when expedience demands it of her. She is a thinking individual; I'm convinced the author identified with her in many ways.    This film, in spite of what the previous reviewer wrote (Bea Bea must be great fun at a party) is not racy. It stays within the boundary of excellent taste throughout, and it is a tribute to the director and producer that they found a way to utilize the period homes of England to such great advantage-an intellectual and visual feast it is.    Finally, Frances O'Connor is terrific as Fanny. Her depiction of the integrity-driven Ms Price colored by a diffidence easily excused by her poverty tinted background is absolutely convincing. I can imagine no one else accomplishing as effective an interpretation. Nice job, Frances!    Yes, this version of Mansfield Park is a meander away from the original story, perhaps, but it is effectively done, nay, it is superbly well done. I recommend it!
B00004R99F|5.0|I used to watch the VHS copy of this with my son when he was very little. Now that he is 13 we still enjoy watching this movie. It has a great story and is very funny. A lot of parents could learn how to be a better parent by watching this movie.

B000JKA0B0|5.0|I waited until I found Voelkerball: Bildband at a price I could afford. It was worth the wait. I would definitely recommend it for Rammstein fans. The book alone is worth the price that I paid for the whole package. It is an excellent collection of tour photos. The cd's and concert dvd contain great recordings. I am sure I will be listening to the cd's and watching the dvd's mouliple times. I never get tired of their music or watching their concert footege.
0446613444|4.0|I like reading Michael Connelly because typically he writes his characters as free-speaking without being too over-the-top. There is a certain irony with that feeling and this book, but I still enjoyed it. Harry Bosch is Connelly's serial character and he is a misfit detective in Hollywood because...well, because cops who get along with other cops are no fun to read about.  <br /> <br />I found myself thinking that, in The Black Ice, Harry Bosch was a little too \\"rogue warrior action hero.\\" Some of the things he did and situations into which he was written were maybe a little extravagant. I wondered if after the book was released if anyone considered optioning the character for the Harry Bosch Action Figure.  <br /> <br />Normally when you read detective fiction you should expect to read about cops who have seemingly endless supplies of both cash and contacts which move their cases along with the greatest of ease. I have come to accept that. It doesn't bother me anymore, and I definitely know that it is not how things really work (most of the time); it just makes good books. This was a little different from that, but while it stood out in my mind, it did not bother me.  <br /> <br />Rather than read the Harry Bosch books as they come out and skipping the earlier books because I found the series late, I have decided to read the series in order. The Black Ice is the second installment. It had the unfortunate duty of following a very highly praised novel in The Black Echo. The Black Echo lacked the commando vibe I tried to describe about The Black Ice, so I had not expected it. Sophomore slump? I don't think so. I think I liked The Black Ice a little more than The Black Echo. So who knows, maybe there will be more of that feeling, or maybe not. I am not done with this series, not by a long shot.  <br /> <br />I love a good mystery/suspense novel. Sometimes the lengths to which the detectives go are a little unrealistic, but that is part of why it is on the fiction shelf. The Black Ice was a little unrealistic at times, but it was still a fast-paced story that I enjoyed greatly.  <br />

B000H7J9S0|3.0|This movie follows the Grimm brothers thru Europe during their heyday.  Although don't look at this movie as a real representation of the two brothers.  If you don't know who the Grimm brothers are they have created some of the greatest fairytales.  Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood are just two of their many fantastic tales.  This movie creates a less than stellar tale.<br /><br />First off trying to capture what the movie is about.  Is it a whimiscal tale or a tale of two cons.  You eventually find out this story is a little of both.  The Grimm Brothers have been captured by the French and it's up to them to reveal the mystery of why so many children are disappearing from a Germanic village.  The brothers are portrayed as conmen trying to deceive people of precious money in order to rid them of fake ghosts.  Now the brothers must find the real answer as to why these children keep disappearing.<br /><br />This movie attempts to thrill but doesn't do a very good job of it.  It seems like a cross between a childrens tale and an adult movie.  Unfortunately it fails at both.  I believe this movie would have been much better if it was geared towards children.  Although many of the Grimm Brothers tales were violent they have been sanitized over the years.  Not to say this movie is awful it just misses it's mark.  Very little suspense or scary scenes here.  It's hard to hang on any characters since known seem very endearing.<br /><br />Now the movie looks great on Blu-ray.  It sounds great on Blu-ray.  Generally if you like fantasy type movies with mystical environments this movie may be for you.  Although it's hard to justify the purchase.
1416523359|4.0|Scott Landon, deceased husband of Lisey and focal point of her story, may be the closest thing to Stephen King's alter ego to be found within his vast body of fiction.  Sure, Scott's a measure nuttier than Stephen (we hope) and more literary in his writing accomplishments, but I felt the same sense of peering into the writer's lair while reading \\"Lisey's Story\\" as I did while reading King's autobiographical \\"On Writing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Lisey's Story\\" represents a marked stretch for King; his most literary and sentimental work, as much love story as horror fiction.  I respect him for expanding his boundaries in this way, given the pressures publishers place on their writers to stay within genre so as not to alienate their core audience.  And writing about a character so much like himself, from his wife's point of view, must have been a real challenge.<br /><br />The novel's pace suffers somewhat from unnecessary repetition, especially the parts involving Lisey's present-day interactions with her sisters, yet there are some outstanding passages to reward the patient reader.  In addition to the assassination attempt, I found the story of Paul's possession by the Really Bad Gunky and young Scott's interactions with his father to be as powerful as anything King has written.  The concept of a parallel fantasy world, where a writer retreats for inspiration and refuge from harsh reality, serves as a compelling foundation for the story.  The symbiotic relationship between genius and madness, a reoccurring theme in King's works, is also well-developed here.  Some have criticized the made-up language Scott uses to describe his fantasy world as a hokey distraction, yet I found that some of these phases (blood bool, Bad Gunky and Long Boy) contributed to the suspense factor by somehow making the fantastical feel more tangible, much as the repetition of \\"Redrum\\" did in \\"The Shining.\\"
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Little Miss Sunshine does very little to piss you off. It is a small budget film about a road trip a family takes so that the youngest member can participate in a fancy competition. The film has an impressive start and by the tenth minute, all the characters are introduced in a very effective way. Then on, it is really the discomfort between the characters that helps the storyline proceed.<br /><br />I felt there was a slight miscasting since Greg Kinnear made me want to sock him in the eye. I mean, his character was quite interesting but there is this one dimensional \\"80's hangover\\" look on his face that doesnt do much to bring out the unpredictability of the film. Not in one scene did I feel surprised at what his character does. Maybe it's just me but please, how can someone with the same haircut (since As Good As It Gets..) get the particular role. I do understand this was a low budget film with limited aspirations but...<br /><br />Alan Arkin (grandpa) has a short yet mutilatingly effect cameo. His dialogues are to the point and hilarious, his quotes are unforgettable. I carried one with me after the movie ended. \\"A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try.\\"<br /><br />Coming to my favourite character, Steve Carell was very good. He seems to lend the film more purpose. His run is funny, his silent un-accusing looks, his way of hiding himself from his love, the fact that he plays someone gay so nonchalantly, his scenes with the character Dwayne and the grandfather were quite funny. He has this guilty look on his face as if he's an escaped convict of some sort. Funny.<br /><br />Paul Dano (the 15 year old kid) is actually 23 and his character was very interesting as well. My favourite scene in the film involves him and Olive in a ditch while the bus has stopped. He speaks in that scene.<br /><br />Overall, I feel Little Miss Sunshine deserves three stars because of how it doesn't dig deeper into issues it dramatizes. It doesn't have a huge scope and there is no one single OUTSTANDING performance. Paul Dano could have had a better role.<br /><br />The last scene is absolutely HILARIOUS, though.ngle OUTSTANDING performance. Paul Dano could have had a better role.    The last scene is absolutely HILARIOUS, though.
0307237699|2.0|Obama's previous biography, \\"Dreams from my Father\\", was a powerful, honest, and moving story; this book, by comparison, is a cold, empty and carefully calculated piece of PR. One gets the feeling that once he became a national figure, he consciously decided to go back and write a political biography, carefully reviewed to make sure it had nothing contentious whatsoever in it. About the only contentious statement here is the implication that the young- his generation- should be seizing control of the country from those who currently are in charge. (The only people who have found that troubling so far are his elders in the Democratic Party leadership.)<br /><br />His \\"thoughts on reclaiming America\\" are pretty much the same generic list you might read in any campaign brochure: We should all be happy, healthy, and have satisfying jobs, and feel totally self-actualized. The result is something that might have been written, with minor changes, by almost any candidate. And that's a pity, because as we have seen in the past, when Obama writes from the heart, he tells a very good tale indeed.
0877180121|5.0|I love it. Students learn the notes one-by-one in songs with duet accompaniment. There are work pages to do along with songs to play. The book is colorful and fun to look at. The progression moves along slowly so that each concept is learned; while at the same time students are playing songs each week and feeling much success. I like it a lot better then the old Thompson series.
1582701709|1.0|If you look beyond all the hype, the promotion, the Oprah endorsements, what you find in this book is an age-old message- the very same message that seems to be repackaged at least one in every generations.<br /><br />In the 20th century, it was Norman Vincent Peal's famous \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\" . Back in the 19th Century, the great psychological pioneer William James wrote, \\"The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude\\", and \\"To change ones life: Start immediately. Do it flamboyantly.\\" And over two thousand years ago, Aristotle wrote \\"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\\"<br /><br />We all do this to one degree or another, unconciously. The process of moving from childhood to adulthood is the process of imitation, learning a new role, and the reinforcement of that new role. We all become a new person continuously through out lives.<br /><br />None of this requires a book, a DVD, a trainer, a TV show, or a celebruity endorsement. Whether it's quitting smoking, become more relaxed in social settings, or becoming a better student, if you begin every morning by staring in a mirror and repeating a few affirmations about the kind of person you want to become, and your repeat those affirmations and goals to yourself, you will, over time, become that person.

B0000DCGT0|3.0|In this feature film about horseracing and one champion, we vicariously travel back in time to see the beginnings of a rich pasttime.  In New York City 1910, the Ford Model T, off the assembly line developed by Ford Motors, competes with all the pretty horses for the attention and money of those who flaunt their status.  The horses are on a ranch, encirled by something new then, barbed wire fence. <br /> <br />Across country, it is till a varied transportation in San Francisco where the horse and carriages races bucyckesm the Stanley Steamer and a very small locomotive.  An optimistic repairman became a car salesman for Buick.  The old race cars were something else.  The future is in the finish line. <br /> <br />In Alberta, Canada, the sky is the limit!  Betting on the horses was the thing to do in Tijuana, Mexico, as a mariachi band plays and the liquor flows where gambling proliferates.  There is a Spanish bullfight, matadors all decked out for the kill.  The 1929 Crash on Wass Street causes unemployment, homelessness, and the Great Depression is born.  Tor those who have them, there is a national migration in their automobiles. <br /> <br />This is a disjointed story but, finally, the stars Sea Biscuit and Tobey Maguire, too big to be a jockey, are there in all their glory at the famous racetrack in Kentucky.  Tom Smith made a good medicine man. <br /> <br />Red is all grown up telling his stories about Sultan.  In Saratoga, New York, we've come full circle.

Thank goodness, he didn't have the same fate as Barbaro.
B00005JO20|1.0|The first hour in this movie is maybe the most boring hour in any movie, ever. Did really Peter Jackson direct this movie? Is the same Peter Jackson that directed Heavenly Creatures and Lord of the Rings? My God it looked like one of those cheap videos in youtube. The dialogs were so cheesy. Again, Is Adrien Brody an actor? Jack Black is a good comedian, but here is out of place. His face is just so funny, when he wants to be serious in a scene you can avoid to laugh as hell. Naomi Watts looks like a rookie driver in his first day driving the beltway. The character is too much for her. Being the first King Kong a classic, even the second is much better than this and yes, Jessica Lange is way more enjoyable to watch than Naomi
B000E9910W|5.0|THE VERY BEST OF THE DOOBIE BROTHERS is more thorough than GREATEST HITS, yet less exhaustive than the boxed set, making it the very best anthology yet, as it even-handedly shows both the guitar-based country-boogie and keyboard-based jazz-funk sides of the band. It includes obscurities such as \\"Nobody\\" from the self-titled debut and \\"Wheels Of Fortune\\" from TAKIN' IT TO THE STREETS, making it truly comprehensive. Of course, you also need the group's 1972-1975 studio albums, and, true, the cut from SIBLING RIVALRY is rather wimpy, but this double-disc set, as far as Doobie Brothers anthologies go, is as good as it gets.

B0001BKAEY|3.0|Revolutions was not a great climax to the Matrix trilogy. The first was sensational. It was stylistic, original, and thought provoking. The first time I watched it I was captivated the entire time and wanted more. Many people did not think much of Reloaded, but I personally loved it. It was not mind-bending like the first, but that wasn't its purpose. The Matrix asked the questions; Reloaded set the stage for a final resolution. I felt it did so with continued originality and style. The fight sequences were artistic and compelling. I don't know how Matrix fans could not have loved watching the result of Neo realizing the potential of his abilities. I can't help overusing the word, but the movie just overflowed with style. The architect scene was odd, but it had good dialogue and was a pretty fun change of direction.  <br /> <br />Revolutions almost completely dropped all of those aspects that I enjoyed about the first two. Instead of original, it was filled with cliche. Most of the Zion battle seemed like it could have been made by cutting and pasting from dozens of war/action films. Other than the visual aspect, there was nothing original about the entire Zion portion of the movie. Amaze some people by how well you can pilot a ship. Can an unlikely character somehow find it in him to overcome all when nearly all hope is lost? I need not mention the overdone yet cliche Neo/Trinity scene. The Merovingian fight scenes were fun but basically a hybrid of the security guard fight from I and the medieval weapons one from II.  <br /> <br />On the whole, I liked the culmination of the Neo storyline. The machine city, along with the train station, was one of the few aspects of the film that was original and interesting. On a fairly superficial note, I just did not enjoy the fight scenes with Smith. The stylistic choreography was replaced with two guys flying all over the place. Even more superficially, I always loved Smith's wisea-- lines from the previous films, but we didn't really get any more of those. Again, I thought the concept of the Neo storyline was good. It just felt like it was delivered a little less thoughtfully, almost as though that plot was the last to be worked out before some sort of deadline. The Oracle's eyes were thrown in as being important to get then barely played any part in the story. The Merovingian didn't have anything interesting to add this time around. Generally it just felt like the actual plot of Revolutions was thrown together somewhat hastily. <br /> <br />The movie wasn't terrible, it was just quite mediocre. Visually it had many great moments including the batman bouncers at the coat check, much of the Zion battle, and the Source. However, it mostly lacked originality and didn't fit together that well. As the final act, Revolutions could have been the culmination of an exciting, philosophical, and compelling trilogy. Instead it was just the last movie.  <br />

0751532711|5.0|Radical thinkers are in a class by themselves, and thankfully, we can join them. This author invites all of us to learn and embrace logical ways to earn, invest, and save money over and above anything we learned through traditional education.<br /><br />The knowledge unfolds in a way that's not overwhelming or pretentious, shifting your mind by 360 degrees to realize your potential for building wealth outside of working a traditional job. It's not a hard sell, it simply makes sense. What I also appreciated are insights on showing children, through word and deed, how to accomplish the same in their lifetime.<br /><br />You may not be ready to accept everything stated in this book, and that's okay. It often takes time to change years of the \\"go to school, get a job\\" mentality.<br /><br />It's easy to identify with statements the author shares regarding other people's negative opinions about wealth and investing. There's a healthy dose of examples sprinkled throughout the book as well as counterpoints that persuade you to continue moving forward toward your goal of financial freedom.<br /><br />Once I began reading Rich Dad, Poor, Dad, it was difficult for me to put this book down. Like me, I believe that if you read it once, you'll read it again as a blueprint for your own financial success.

Anyway, they play up the imperious nature of this Miranda to the hilt and beyond. If you'd been stabbed with this sword, the swordsman's elbow would be stuck in your spine. The only thing that saves the ridiculousness of it is Meryl herself. Anyone else would have surely overplayed it, but she toned it down and was so consistently believable that I forgot that this woman doesn't exist. That's why she was up for an Oscar last night despite a just-okay movie. That icy \\"That's all\\" of dismissal will stick with you after this movie has quite faded away.<br /><br />Miranda takes a chance on the dumpy Andy because all of the fashion plates she'd hired before were a disaster. Maybe someone with more brains than bulimia would do a better job.<br /><br />Of course, size 6 Andy is immediately singled out as fat. Whatever. She's hotter than rocket fuel, and certainly way hotter than Emily.<br /><br />So after getting run through the ringer and verging on failure, she gets a little help from the other bright spot in the movie, Nigel (Stanley Tucci.) Stanley is pitch perfect as the effeminate yet manly Nigel, Miranda's second-in-command at the mag, and Andy's mentor-figure.<br /><br />So what's her first step? Nigel turns her into a fashion plate. Amazing how that happens in these movies. Suddenly she's a damn runway model herself. All you need is to blow $15K at I. Magnin or whatever the heck. As soon as she's wearing Chanel and some pin-thin pumps, she's a perfect assistant.<br /><br />The rest is the natural and somewhat predictable progression of getting to know thyself and deciding what to do about it. I won't blow the plot, but if I did, you wouldn't be surprised.<br /><br />This movie could have been a lot more, could have been a little deeper look at the fashion world and the personalities without losing its funny-bone. Instead everything wraps up a little too neatly all around.<br /><br />That said, it was certainly enjoyable and the ending does make you feel pretty good. I can't stress enough that Streep's run in this film is brilliant. The one moment of weakness you see in her character is captivating and very revealing. Of all the parts, Miranda rises above the level of caricature and finds real believability. If the rest of the movie had been written as well, and acted as well by the rest of the cast, this might have been a very different movie.<br /><br />I would prefer to rate it as 3.5, but I give it a 4 because it was too good for a flat 3.hired before were a disaster.

0618680004|5.0|Chances are that if you ever looked around at the nature of reality and aren't afraid of asking questions then you already came to the conclusion that religious claims are complete fiction.     With this book, Dawkins simply fills the blanks in and offers a wide range of reasoned arguments against the existence of a God while providing the reader with a insights into how religion has evolved and what its purpose might be. Dawkins shows clearly why he takes the position he does as a card carrying atheist by looking at the evidence and demonstrating that the probability of a God existing is infintesimally small (certainly much smaller than the probability of an eye evolving over hundreds of millions of years).    Dawkins looks at the supposed \\"reasons\\" and \\"proofs\\" for the existence of God, as they are currently thought or have been proposed down through history. He strips these arguments down to their undergarments and shows how vacuous they really are.    His arguments are so good, that anyone reading without bias and a completely rational approach will have a tough time denying them. I say this because there are people who assert confidently that there is a God and it cares about what we do in the privacy of our own mind. This flies in the face an avalanche evidence that show clearly there are natural mechanisms that create and sustain life and the universe.       Faith, it seems, precludes people from engaging in sensible and honest conversations about the claims of religions and its consequences. Faith is why, sadly, many will not read the truths in the God Delusion.
0375759174|5.0|Being the first novel that Jane Austen ever wrote and the last that was ever published (posthumously at that); \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an interesting specimen of a book. Though the plot itself is a little unpolished when compared to her later books, her sparkling wit is still firmly intact. Poking fun at the Gothic-Romantic novels of her time (and the effect that they have on impressionable young women) Austen crafts a satirical treatise on the dangers of the unbridled imagination and the real `horror' of the time: the hypocrisy and two-facedness of the society Catherine lives in.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is an ordinary young woman, who thrilled by the excitement and intrigue that she finds during her holiday months in Bath. The fact that she is given quite a free rein by her foolish guardian Mrs Allen is just the ticket she needs to have a good time. Catherine enjoys the friendship of the glamorous Isabella Thorpe and her brother (whose attention is perhaps just a *little* unwelcome), the sights and sounds of the resort city and two new acquaintances: Eleanor and Henry Tilney. Quickly falling in love with the intelligent and well-read Henry (a character based on Austen's favourite brother of the same name), Catherine struggles with her innate sense of right and wrong, and her romantic delusions concerning the Tilney family. Marilyn Butler (the author of the introduction in my edition) describes her perfectly: \\"she is always capable of saying a good thing, which is either to the point, or refreshingly honest, or naïve but disarmingly loyal to her parents and brothers and sisters.\\"<br /><br />Unlike heroines such as Elizabeth and Emma, Catherine is quite an immature young woman, and remains so for most of the novel. Her mind is filled with the fancies of romance-fiction, and as such Catherine is often criticized as being the weakest of Austen's heroines. But dismissing the novel on the basis of its weak protagonist is missing the point of the story itself (besides, I found Catherine to be Austen's most amusing heroine in light of her flights of fancy). Unlike \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Emma\\", \\"Northanger Abby\\" is not a character-study. In fact Austen makes it clear from page one that Catherine is not to be considered your typical heroine: \\"No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be a heroine.\\" Austen douses Catherine's romantic ideals with a glass of ice-cold water, continually reminding the reader how ordinary she is, and - far from the romantic entanglements of her other protagonists - how simple and unaffecting her relationship with Henry is. In fact, Austen ultimately commends the major villain of the novel - his interference in the couples' plans extend their engagement and ensure that the two get to know each other better before they marry.<br /><br />Of course, Austen also has plenty of room for her other great literary technique: poking fun at the restrictions and regulations of her society. However, its treatment here is somewhat darker than it is in other books, as many of the decisions made by characters have very grave effects on others and aren't at all meant to be considered amusing by the reader. Catherine's mind is full of the horrors to be found in Gothic-Romanticism, and as a result is blind to the real nastiness going on around her; whilst she dreams about murders, secret passages and other sinister goings-on, she is completely unaware as to the cynical machinations and games being played right under her nose.<br /><br />The mastery of Jane Austen is of course that her work has aged magnificently, and is just as relevant now as it ever was. Just try and tell me that you can't relate to this following passage, as Catherine tries to avoid Mr Morland and find Mr Tilney at a crowded ball: \\"Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every young lady has at some time or another known the same agitation. All have been, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the pursuit of some one whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious for the attentions of some one whom they wished to please.\\" First published in 1818, and these words are as true now as they ever were.least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the pursuit of some one whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious for the attentions of some one whom they wished to please.\\" First published in 1818, and these words are as true now as they ever were.
B000LPR9ZS|3.0|I've seen all the Saw movies and this one is much like the first 2, but with more gore and less suspense or mystery.  So I would have to say this was the least interesting of the three.  But the movie provides closure, I just hope they don't make another-not sure what is left to tell.  This was the first Blu Ray disc I watched on my PS3.  I also own the Toshiba A1 HD DVD player so I've seen a lot of high def movies.  As with most high def movies, the picture was very sharp and saturated in brighter scenes.  In darker scenes, the picture was more noisy and looked like regular DVD.  But I have seen this on all high def movies so I don't think Saw 3 was a bad transfer.  If you liked the first 2, then you'll probably like this one too.

I HAVE JUST BOUGHT THIS MOVIE AND WHILE IT TOOK A MOMENT TO GET INTO IT I FIND IT A FANTASTIC FILM. WITH ALL THE REVEIWS SHOULD ANYONE READ THIS, GO NO FURTHER THEN MY REVIEW AND JUST GO OUT AND GET IT. THE Illusionist I ENJOYED BUT I RENTED THAT MOVIE AND AT THIS TIME DO NOT SEE THE NEED TO OWN IT. IN THE CASE OF PRESTIGE I FIND IT A MUST OWN. WELL ACTED AND REALLY A MOVIE WITH TWO PATHS. ONE THE FIRST HALF, THE SECOND THE SECOND HALF. HOW WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IF THE SECOND HALF HAD BEEN THE MAIN FOCUS. WATCH IT AND YOU DECIDE. BUT PREPARE YOURSELF TO BE SURPRIZED, AND LEFT TO WONDER.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As much as I enjoyed Serenity, the series from which it was taken blows it away. The decision to cancell this series was a major mistake. All Serenity fans will want this series as it devotes much more time to developing the individual characters, ( YES ... the same actors and characters as in the movie! ). You follow them as they proceed logically from one escapade to another outwitting all comers.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Every body compares the two movies,The Prestige and the Illusionist.You will not be disappointed with either. The Presige is more action/drama with a great twist at the end.The Illusionist is more romance/drama with a great storey that even guys like!,with a great twist at the end too. I give both movies 5 stars.
B000H30B2C|5.0|Because I was thinking the same thing, no, not another King Kong movie!!  However, I finally saw it, or most of it, on HBO last week and I was thrilled.  It really IS good.  I liked it so much I want to have the disc to watch it quality video, as compared to cable.  I also want my wife to watch it.  The only problem with this movie is that it is long, and you really should have uninterrupted time to enjoy it.  The romance of this movie really comes to life, and you will be heartbroken for poor Kong long before his final demise.  Don't let Jack Black scare you away.  He plays the role of a real jerk, and is perfect for it.
B000083C49|5.0|This movie begins in deep space where a probe making strange sounds is draining the power from any ship or space station it passes on its way to Earth.  The ships are reporting to StarFleet and the United Federation of Planets for help but no one can decipher the messages and the probe is not responding to any other types of communications.  We also have the Klingon Ambassador \\"venting\\" about Admiral Kirk killing the Klingon crew from the prior movie (In Search of Spock) and \\"stealing\\" the Bird of Prey ship.  He wants Kirk extradited to the Klingon home world.  Ambassador Sarek, Spock's father, tries to calm things but he is accused of being not objective since Kirk saved his son.<br /><br />We also go to the planet Vulcan where Spock is recovering his memory and undergoing testing while the former crew of the Enterprise are renaming the Klingon ship (USS Bounty) and preparing to go back to Earth to face trial.  Spock decides to go with them.  As they near Earth, Uhura is picking up on the communications about the probe and the crew begins listening as well.  Spock has an idea and they have Uhura alter the probe sounds to mimic how it would sound under water.  Spock then identifies the sounds as the whale song of humpback whales that are extinct on late 23rd century earth.<br /><br />As Kirk and crew get close to Earth, Earth is in crisis as the probe has arrived and is literally stirring up the oceans in its search for an answer to its communications.  Clouds cover nearly 90% of the planet's surface and power outtages abound.  Time for the old \\"slingshot\\" around the sun back to late 20th century Earth and a search for humpback whales.<br /><br />As Kirk and crew split off and have their various both funny (Scotty trying to address a 1986 Apple computer and then picking up the mouse to talk into!!) and dangerous (Chekov accidentally falling and being critically injured) adventures, the viewer feels like they are back watching some of the best of the TV series episodes as their is comic relief, action, danger and all the really fun elements that make up Star Trek.<br /><br />A MUST SEE!!

B000JBWWRY|5.0|NOTE: As of this moment, the Two-Disc Platinum Edition of Peter Pan is in limited distribution (I have seen it) and most of the reviews that appear now refer to an earlier version. The Two-Disc Platinum Edition version can be pre-ordered from Amazon and Borders and offers new special features which include a restored original theatrical soundtrack all-new digital restoration with enhanced picture and sound, \\"Camp Never Land: Explore Never Land\\" with all-new multi-level games, deleted songs, a feature during which Walt Disney explains \\"Why I Made Peter Pan,\\" \\"The Peter Pan Story: 1952\\" featurette, a sneak peek of the all-new Tinker Bell movie, another feature \\"You Can Fly: The Making of Peter Pan,\\" a T-Squad music video: \\"The Second Star to the Right,\\" a Peter Pan virtual flight,  Peter's Playful Prank DVD storybook, and a never-before-seen alternate opening.<br /><br />Over the years, I have seen various versions of this delightful film and enjoy it at least as much now as I did when it was first released in 1953. On several occasions, I have also visited Disneyland and vividly recall the excitement of the ride when my companions and I departed the children's bedroom and flew above London at night en route to Neverland. The so-called \\"magic kingdom\\" is more a state-of-mind than a location because the genius of Walt Disney and his associates is that, in ways and to an extent no one else ever has, they activate and engage imagination.  This is especially true of this film that, unlike most of the other animation features, involves a journey by air as well as by land. Literally, one's imagination soars above and beyond human concerns, at least for 77 minutes.<br /><br />Unlike other Disney villains (e.g. Honest John and Stromboli in Pinocchio, the Queen/Witch in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), Captain Hook is at least as amusing as he is threatening. The fate of the Darling children is never really in doubt. We know that eventually, theirs will be a safe return to their home and family. (I had no such confidence - as a child -- when first viewing Dumbo, Pinocchio, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.) Although for most of us, \\"there is no place like home,\\" we enjoy and appreciate opportunities to travel far and wide - at least in our imagination - and become involved in adventures of various kinds, as the Darling children do.<br /><br />Those who already have an earlier version of Peter Pan can continue to enjoy it, of course, but at least some of them will welcome this Two-Disc Platinum Edition because of all of its special features, previously unavailable. I only wish other DVDs offered special features of comparable variety, quality, and entertainment value.amily.

0007141424|5.0|Why this book is pigeonholed as Children's Literature is a mystery to me, perhaps merely because the protagonist is a twelve-year old, perhaps owing to the author's past works--I'm just glad to have found it.  \\"The Giver\\" treats the most profound issues in a manner that speaks of deep understanding; the book will ring you like a bell, the ideas resonate and can not be forgotten.  For this reason I call this the rarest of books; once read it will immediately and forever be a part of the reader--in a sense, our author becomes her own creation, she becomes the Giver of memory and her reader a Receiver.<br /><br />It is a spare presentation of a dystopic future world where the \\"problems\\" of humanity have all been neatly resolved; everyone is polite, happy with their job, unthreatened by pain, sickness, conflict and even death.  Though it becomes quickly evident that what the author really gives us is a rather convincing rationalization for the fact that evil, pain and suffering are necessary.  Foes of religious belief often claim that the idea of pain and suffering is inconsistent with a loving God; but, even for the secular among us, Ms. Lowry shows how suffering and joy are linked.  \\"The Giver\\" argues that granting unlimited license to those who would sacrifice individual choice in their attempts to achieve relief from war, famine and economic inequality could very well eliminate that which makes life worth living.  \\"The Giver\\" says much about the danger of placing the interests of the community above the interests of individuals.<br /><br />To say much about the story risks spoiling the slow exposition of the underlying flaws in the utopia, which was exceptionally well paced.  At first the \\"community\\" seems vaguely creepy, by the end of the book it is horrifying.  \\"The Giver\\" is a novel of ideas that begs to be discussed and argued over as the part of any moral education.  It is powerful beyond my ability to express and like any truth, it offers something of value to any reader at any level.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation.any level.    Highest Recommendation.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|Like her 2004 sophomore effort, \\"Feels Like Home,\\" Norah Jones' latest maintains the sound that brought her national acclaim while still furthering her artistic endeavors.<br /><br />\\"Not Too Late\\" proves she is not given to relying on a cash- cow formula; she not only continues to add inflections of country like last time around, but she eschews the American songbook in favor of a uniformly original array of songs -- all of which she co-wrote. This aids the record's warm, intimate atmosphere, which glimmers and glows despite the absence of the late legendary producer, Arif Mardin.<br /><br />The slinky blues of \\"Thinking About You\\" is the ideal lead single. With its plaintive melody, organic jazz horns and restrained yet expressive vocals, it is musical chocolate cake. \\"Sinkin' Soon,\\" meanwhile, is the most perplexing track. With its curious lyrics (\\"Like the oyster crack in the stew/The honey in the tea/Like the wheel of cheese high in the sky/We're gonna be sinkin' soon), the song sways and jerks with Jesse Harris (writer of her monster hit \\"Don't Know Why\\") on banjo and drummer Andy Borger working pots and pans. It continues the theme of fame's fickle nature that began with \\"Carnival Town\\" on her last LP.<br /><br />In spite of her popularity with white collar right-wingers, Jones is not afraid to infuse her music with passionate liberal beliefs. With its lush, nervous mix of pianos and guitars, \\"Wish I Could\\" is the story of a lonely war widow and even lonelier other woman (\\"She says love in the time of war's not fair/He was my man but they didn't care/I don't tell her that I once loved you too\\"), while \\"Broken\\" finds a soldier irrevocably hardened by war (\\"He's got blood on his shoes and mud on his brim/Did he do it to himself or was it done to him?\\").<br /><br />\\"My Dear Country,\\" with a cabaretlike interlude, waxes on a terrifying election and a \\"deranged\\" politician without naming names:<br /><br />\\"I cherish you my dear country/I love all the things that you've given me/And most of all that I am free/To have a song that I can sing/On election day.\\"<br /><br />The soothing \\"Wake Me Up\\" appropriately follows with its resigned, world-weary attitude, bringing in sounds of the heartland that continue in \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" and the fun-loving \\"Be My Somebody,\\" the latter marked by cheeky lyrics: \\"Last night was a record to be broken/It broke all over the kitchen floor.\\"<br /><br />\\"Little Room\\" attempts to shed her fuddy-duddy image with sexual undertones, while \\"Not My Friend\\" finds her safe in her own company -- not content to maintain a relationship with someone who wishes her unhappiness.<br /><br />\\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" and \\"Until the End\\" are full of grace and character, and \\"Not Too Late\\" closes the disc with spare piano/vocal simplicity. Its optimistic message provides a perfect conclusion and its overwhelmingly pristine melody makes it an instant classic.<br /><br />If \\"Come Away With Me\\" was rich, delicious comfort food, \\"Not Too Late\\" is more complex and sophisticated.

1582701709|2.0|There is a kernel of a wonderful idea in \\"The Secret\\" that is, unfortunately, presented in this book and DVD merely as candy-coated, imaginary thinking that perfectly suits American tastes. It is interesting that producer Rhonda Byrne is Australian, and yet she chose twenty-four Americans to serve as teachers of \\"The Secret.\\" The \\"teachers\\" are most notable for their impeccable marketing credentials rather than logical heirs to the intellectual tradition of luminaries such as Shakespeare, Da Vinci, Newton, Emerson, or Jesus, all of whom are referenced as historical bearers of \\"The Secret.\\"    Fortunately, there are teachers who tap the same vein as \\"The Secret\\" but provide more substance and depth. Great faith traditions are one place to look, but if you are interested in a more secular and specific course, I would like to point you toward \\"Napoleon Hill's Keys to Success: The 17 Principles of Personal Achievement.\\" Napoleon Hill's work was recommended by Donald Mitchell in his Amazon review of \\"The Secret,\\" so I can say that I learned something as a result of \\"The Secret\\" that I wouldn't have known otherwise (thanks to Mitchell, that is; as far as I can tell, Napoleon Hill is not referenced in \\"The Secret\\" itself).    What is lacking in \\"The Secret\\" can be found in Hill's \\"Philosophy of Achievement.\\"  Hill talks about having a positive mental attitude and visualizing one's goals, in addition to a burning desire to reach a definite purpose, the will to do the hard work needed to get there, and the ethic of working in service of others, among other qualities.  A far cry from \\"The Secret\\" telling readers that \\"The only thing you need to do is feel good now.\\"
1400102154|1.0|When I first read Darwin's Origin of Species, although I was fascinated, it took me a long time to get through it. Darwin writes well, but frequently seems to use grammatically complex sentences which stretch to entire paragraphs, and it is hard to read it with anything other than total concentration.  <br /> <br />Hence when I saw that an audiobook version of OoS was available I was excited. I hoped that having a human read the book would give it extra clarity and emphasis, and make it more enjoyable.  <br /> <br />I was wrong.  <br /> <br />From the first track, David Case's smug and nasal tone was overpowering. Case manages to butcher phrases and passages that originally set my mind on fire when first read. I abandoned listening after the first disk.  <br /> <br />To confirm I wasn't being oversensitive I played the starting paragraphs to a family member, and their response was a low groan.  <br /> <br />To conclude; if there are any rougue millionaires/publishing companies out there, please hire someone better (Stephen Fry?) to read this work.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|If you hate romantic comedies then you will hate this movie because The Holiday is everything a good romantic comedy should be: funny and romantic (of course), sweet, sad, beautifully photographed, brilliantly scored, perfectly casted and very well directed.<br /><br />Kate Winslet and Jude Law on their own are enough to make me watch anything... seriously, I go to see everything they are on. Nancy Meyers directed \\"Something's Gotta Give\\", one of my favorite romantic comedies so that was a bonus. So let say my expectations were high with this movie. But The Holiday was even better than I thought it could be.<br /><br />Everything works perfectly in this film: Jude Law looks gorgeous, he and Cameron Diaz have a great chemistry, Cameron is funny as always, Kate Winslet is hilarious (she should do more comedy)... even Jack Black is adorable! And besides your boy-meets-girl kind of story you have a beautiful full-of-heart story between Iris (Winslet) and her L.A. neighbor Arthur (Eli Wallach... brilliant!).<br /><br />And please pay attention to the enchanting score by Hans Zimmerman. That's another must-have.<br /><br />And if you don't like romantic comedies, maybe you should give this one a chance. It's totally worth it.

B000M5AJQS|1.0|I've seen a number of scornful and disrespectful things over the years, but Martin Scorsese's prophecies really take the cake. It may help if I begin my discussion by relating an innocuous story in order to illustrate my point: A few days ago I was arguing with a particularly possession-obsessed vagabond who was insisting that our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups. I tried to convince this blinkered bohemian that Martin's latest statements have arisen like a phoenix out of the ashes and failures of their disdainful forebears. For proof of this fact, I must point out that every time Martin utters or writes a statement that supports revisionism -- even indirectly -- it sends a message that science is merely a tool invented by the current elite to maintain power. I, for one, decidedly contend we mustn't let him make such statements, partly because he is like a parrot that makes noises for attention without any kind of clue as to what it is saying, but primarily because his hijinks are destructive. They're morally destructive, socially destructive -- even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren't enough, what I have been writing up to this point is not what I initially intended to write in this letter. Instead, I decided it would be far more productive to tell you that Martin wants to become an intellectual without the hardship of study and serious thought. We can therefore extrapolate that the central preconception in Martin's paranoid style is the belief in the existence of a vast, drugged-out, preternaturally effective international conspiratorial network designed to open the floodgates of alarmism. I don't think anyone questions that. But did you know that he slaps his message of inaniloquent deconstructionism on everything that stands still -- newspapers, magazines, billboards, movies, op-eds, and grant proposals? I would much rather mention a bit about dictatorial hippies such as Martin than waste my precious time chastising squalid geeks. I kid you not. No one can claim to know the specific source of his sophistries, but his stories about despotism are particularly ridden with errors and distortions, even leaving aside the concept's initial implausibility.<br /><br />Martin plans to promote promiscuity and obscene language. The result will be an amalgam of deranged Comstockism and unambitious favoritism, if such a monster can be imagined. He has never gotten ahead because of his hard work or innovative ideas. Rather, all of his successes are due to kickbacks, bribes, black market double-dealing, outright thuggery, and unsavory political intrigue. It may seem obvious, but the law is not just a moral stance. It is the consensus of society on our minimum standards of behavior. Your guess is as good as mine as to why Martin wants to influence the attitudes of dominant culture towards any environment or activity that is predominantly headlong. Maybe it's because he plans to further political and social goals wholly or in part through activities that involve force or violence and a violation of criminal law.<br /><br />Martin practically breaks his arm patting himself on the back when he says, \\"It takes courage to go down into the muddy trenches and bring ugliness and nastiness into our lives.\\" As if that were something to be proud of. His sycophants are too lazy to ensure that the values for which we have labored and for which many of us have fought and sacrificed will continue in ascendancy. They just want to sit back, fasten their mouths on the public teats, and casually forget that the acid test for Martin's \\"kinder, gentler\\" new intimations should be, \\"Do they still encourage every sort of indiscipline and degeneracy in the name of freedom?\\" If the answer is yes, then we can conclude that this is a lesson for those with eyes to see. It is a lesson not so much about Martin's self-satisfied behavior, but about the way that Martin insists that clever one-liners are a valid substitute for actual thinking. In the long run, however, he's only fooling himself. Martin would be better off if he just admitted to himself that his ultimata are statism redux. No joke. I have one final message for you before ending this letter: I indubitably gainsay Martin Scorsese's notion that he is a bearer and agent of the Creator's purpose.actual thinking.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Will Ferrell fans now have a very good reason to stand up and cheer. Myself not being much of a Ferrell champion (although I modestly enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS), I came into STRANGER THAN FICTION wondering if he might try some over-the-top antics or just give another mediocre performance. Amazingly, Ferrell gives a thoughtful and insightful portrayal of a conflicted man who believes he's being followed by a narrating woman's voice.<br /><br />What gives Stranger Than Fiction its emotional heft, too, is its clever script and fine performances by Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal (SHERRYBABY), Dustin Hoffman, and even Queen Latifah.<br /><br />Falling partially into the fantasy category (but only slightly so), the story is of Harold Crick, an IRS agent who one day begins hearing a woman's voice narrating the more mundane portions of his life (\\"Harold brushed his teeth 32 strokes up and down and 72 side to side\\"). Initially Harold fears he may be having some sort of mental break. He goes to see a shrink who eventually (and reluctantly) refers him to Professor Jules Hilbert (Hoffman). Some of the most entertaining dialogue is heard here as Hilbert and Crick try to decide whether the voice is narrating his life as a comedy or a tragedy (or maybe some other genre). When Hilbert asks Crick what he does for a living and if there's anyone that might want to hurt him, Crick replies, \\"I'm an IRS agent, everyone hates me.\\" To which Professor Hilbert responds, \\"Well that certainly sounds like a comedy to me.\\"<br /><br />Eventually, Harold discovers who's voice is in his head. It's a novelist named Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), and it appears that Harold is simply a fictional creation of her's that has somehow come to life. Harold races to find Ms. Eiffel before she finishes her novel, strictly because he knows that he plans to kill her (she narrates to him this simple fact, much to Harold's dismay). Once they meet, Ms. Eiffel is somewhat freaked out by the prospect that one of her creations has come to life, and Harold is even more freaked to learn that she's finished the novel (the ending isn't typed yet, but is handwritten and awaiting the plunk! plunk! of the typewriter keys).<br /><br />The ending is bittersweet for both Harold and Emma. Can she change her masterpiece of fiction? Can she not kill Harold and still retain the essence of her work (she's killed off her main protagonist in all her other novels)?<br /><br />Ferrell's soft-spoken tax-man performance was something of a marvel. His witty line deliveries and his tender relationship with Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) goes way beyond anything we've seen from him before. Again, much of this can be attributed to the brilliant script by Zach Helm. But Will Ferrell's performance cannot be denied. He's in almost every shot, proving that he can be a great leading man if given the right set of circumstances. Now let's just hope that he continues on this upward swing.her creations has come to life, and Harold is even more freaked to learn that she's finished the novel (the ending isn't typed yet, but is handwritten and awaiting the plunk! plunk! of the typewriter keys).  <br /> <br />The ending is bittersweet for both Harold and Emma.

B00005JPFQ|5.0|Ghost Rider has one very profound line: \\"Look into my eyes and FEEL the pain you have caused others!\\" It was cathartic to see violent criminals being forced to feel the pain others experienced because of their brutal and selfish actions! Something I personally believe we will all face in the afterlife when we experience our own life review! But I digress...<br /><br />This film did not take its self too seriously, nor was the violence gruesome, or excessive. It clearly shows the  power of good versus evil in a new and refreshing way.  But is still edgy enough so not to be boring.<br /><br />It had plenty of occult symbolism,  even touching on Faust! In other words it had something for everyone - older children, teens and adults! If you like a movie where you can turn off the critical thinking part of your brain - than this refreshingly entertaining fantasy film is for you!
B000M5AJQS|1.0|This movie??? Well there is no other way to say it other than it sucks, and that is with a capital S. Everyone is making a big deal about beacuse Scorsese has his name pinned to it. (BIG DEAL). Leonard DiCaprio could not play a good bad guy if his life depended on it, Stick to sinking ships Leo. Do not waste an evening of your life watching this garbage, But hey this is just one mans opion LOL.
B000LC55F2|3.0|This movie has a lot going for it, strong performers, strong performances, and a solid premise.  Some of the twists and turns are a little easy to see through, but the film does build emotionally and I do think most people will be intrigued to see how it turns out.  For my money though, I don't think it was the film's close release to \\"The Illusionst\\" that diminished its box office appeal, I think it was a miscalculated ending.  I'm not going to give anything away, but I think the filmmakers took a calculated risk (and made a mistake) in choosing the last man standing.  I think it would have been more emotionally satisfying the other way around, and a bigger crowd pleaser.  Another reviewer here felt differently, however, and you may, too.
0072373350|5.0|Dr. Anderson's book is an excellent tool if you'd like to teach yourself aerodynamics and have the background in math to handle it (multivariable and vector calculus...get \\"Div, Grad, Curl, and All That\\" if you need a refresher).  His derivations are very clear and his chapter maps provide a nice road guide to give you an idea of where you're going.  This book is also very good at maintaining rigor in describing the limitations of the derivations, a necessary quality since a lot of us tend to forget that the results we see are only valid in certain circumstances (incompressible flow, irrotational flow, inviscid flow, etc.).   <br /> <br />Very few downsides: a few typos and no answers to end-of-the-chapter problems. <br />

B000M06K5C|5.0|A very strong record from a great band. Each track is filled with emotion and despair, but also hope and life. Some might say better than Silent Alarm, but that is like comparing apples to oranges. This album has a different vibe and character all its own. Try, you'll love every juicy bite!
B000H305U0|5.0|Let me start by first saying that I only bought this CD because I needed another purchase to qualify for Amazon's free shipping.  I wasn't a huge fan of the whole boy band era (my sister had all the CD's and they were OK, nothing exciting to me).  I am more into rock music, so I even surprised myself buying this album.  I received this CD on a Saturday and the following Thursday, I purchased tickets last minute to Justin's concert that night.  This album has me hooked.  I have listened to it more than the other two albums I bought at the same time (Gnarls Barkley and Wolfmother).  The concert was awesome, if he comes to your area it is a must see.  He has surpassed the NSync pop stuff and created a new sound that I haven't heard in a long time.  My only regret is that I didn't buy this CD when it came out.
B000EULJLU|3.0|heres the deal... <br /> <br />After lateralus came out, tool had a stellar 4 cd collection. opiate, undertow, aenima and lateralus were all classic albums and if the band broke up right then, they would have been legendary, no questions asked.  <br /> <br />But... <br /> <br />10000 days is the album where they settled for \\"good enough\\". Maynard went to work with APC and used up a lot of valuable creativity, they all did their individual side projects, their passion for tool dwindled, and 5 years later, decided to go through the motions one more time... <br /> <br />The riffs are old, \\"the pot\\" is cheesy as hell, \\"jambi\\" picks up at the end but is incredibly monotonous until that point, theres about 2 real songs on the album and most of it is random guitar riffs overlayed on random drum beats and labeled \\"artistic\\". Then the rest is pointless filler. \\"Vicarious\\" was obviously the only coherent, well written song so they rushed it up to the front of the album and made it the first single.  <br /> <br />there are definately highlights in the album that give me goosebumps and remind me of how impressive tool can be, but they come in 30 second spurts throughout the album and you have to chug along through 6- 14 minutes of song to get to them... <br /> <br />in conclusion...tool can do better...thank you <br /> <br /> <br />PS. dont insult me by saying there's some important hidden secret in the the 3d packaging thats magically going to have the album make sense.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941)<br /><br />Gather together one hundred professional film critics. You can mix and match them in any way you like, from any country in the world and from any period of time after World War II. Ask them what the best movie ever made is. While there are very few things about which film critics agree, this is one of them: the choice by the overwhelming majority of your mix-and-match set of film critics will be Citizen Kane. (The website They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? actually does this, except with, as I write this, 1,365 critics. I don't need to tell you what the outcome is, do I?) That said, faced with actually seeing a film so widely regarded as the best ever made, the average Goat is going to have one of two reactions: either \\"hey, wow, they're right!\\" or \\"what's all the hype about?\\"<br /><br />Well, I'm your average Goat. And I have to say, I can see what all the hype is about, as long as I turn my head and squint just right. I like Pauline Kael's quote about it: \\"it's the most fun you'll ever have watching a great movie.\\" Now there's a sentiment I can get behind.<br /><br />Welles' masterpiece is great not just because of the movie itself-- which Welles wrote, produced, and directed at the tender age of twenty-six (by contrast, Muranu was thirty-four when he directed Nosferatu, Romero twenty-nine at the time of Night of the Living Dead, Riefenstahl thirty-three at the time of Triumph des Willens)-- but because of the politics surrounding it. I won't even begin to attempt to get into that here; the American Experience documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane (thoughtfully included with the 2005 Warner two-disc set) is longer than the film itself. See The Battle Over Citizen Kane soon after seeing the movie itself to get some perspective.<br /><br />Note: here be spoilers. I assume the majority of those reading this, even those who haven't seen the film, already know the whole \\"Rosebud\\" shtick, but I'll warn you about spoilers anyway.<br /><br />The plot: a media tycoon, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), dies of old age. His last word: \\"Rosebud.\\" A newsreel crew working on a ten-minute film of his life wants to find out what he meant, and the rest of the film is members of the crew talking to Kane's friends and intimates, trying to track down the meaning of that word. They never do. Through the omniscience of the camera, we find out that \\"Rosebud\\" was the name of the sled Kane had as a child growing up poor in Wyoming, and that no one else will ever know this; the sled itself is burned by junk dealers as the closing credits roll.<br /><br />Now, here's the thing. The legions of folks who say \\"it's just a sled!\\" missed the entire point, and that's how Welles sets the whole thing up. Everything from the early scene of Welles in Wyoming (in which, of course, Rosebud plays a minor role) to the final moment of the film is a red herring. Which leads you to one of two conclusions: either the mystery is secondary to Kane's life in Welles' vision, or Welles would go to any length to pull a fast one. (I lean towards the second hypothesis.) It's a fun red herring, to be sure; after the screening of the newsreel itself, which takes up the first ten minutes of Citizen Kane (and they are the slowest in the movie), it rollocks and bounces along making just as much fun of itself as it does of the larger-than-life Charles Foster Kane. And it does make fun of Kane; why else would they portray a media tycoon longing, on his deathbed, for his penniless existence in the middle of nowhere? But the claws are always at least covered in velvet; it's an affectionate sort of savagery, if such a thing is possible. No one the film crew talks to is overly fond of Kane, and some outright hate him; all, however, are forced to admit to at least grudging respect for the man. Now, think about that for a moment (and think about the fact that Welles himself is playing the object of all this scorn); there's a whole lot of emotionallayering going on here. Solid stuff for a twenty-six-year-old kid.<br /><br />Welles had a grand vision for this movie, and, given complete freedom by the studio, he realized it. He did, in fact, make a great movie. Even with all the perspective, all the historical facts, all the mulling it over for weeks and realizing the depth of the script coupled with the incredible acting talent, pitch-perfect production, etc., though, I'm not even sure it's my favorite Welles movie. (I have a soft spot for The Stranger, the Welles that never pops up on anyone's thousand-best list, much less hundred-best.) Yes, it's a fantastic piece of work, an absolute must-see, a thoroughly enjoyable ride through the mind of one of the finest directors to ever work inside (or outside) the Hollywood machine. And it's possible that no movie ever made could live up to the hype to which this one has been subjected. It's genius, yes. But the best movie ever made? See it, and decide for yourself. **** ½f emotional layering going on here.

B000LC3ID8|2.0|Saw III (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2006)<br /><br />Well, the good news is that James Wan returned to do some of the script work for Saw III. The bad news is that James Wan only returned to do some of the script work for Saw III. Wan, who also directed the first film, created one of the enduring horror movies of the decade so far; Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the second film in the franchise, turned in what was, at best, just another cheesy survival thriller that lacked any echo of the characterization, complexity, and finesse that made the first one so good. Guess who directs Saw III?<br /><br />I'm sure you've seen at least one sitcom episode where there's a loose frame story that exists for the sole purpose of replaying amusing scenes from earlier in the season. That's, in part, the direction Saw III takes-- there's a lot of flashback footage in this movie. Which is really kind of depressing, because Wan came up with a real barnburner of a story idea here-- Jigsaw (Tobin Bell, reprising his role) and his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith, reprising hers) are the focus here. They've kidnapped Lynn (Crash's Bahar Soomekh), a doctor with marital problems, to keep Jigsaw alive during his final game, one in which Jeff (Titus' Angus McFadyen) must forgive the driver who killed his son in a hit-and-run accident, as well as a number of others who, directly or indirectly, contributed to his son's death. Jeff's game, however, is almost a background here, as the focus remains on Lynn, Amanda, and Jigsaw. And, of course, there's an awesome twist ending (with the most blatant \\"if you're not paying attention, you'll miss it\\" clue since Profondo Rosso) that leads us straight into Saw IV. And had Wan's idea been perfectly translated, I have no doubt this would have been an excellent movie, easily the equal of the first one.<br /><br />\\"Perfectly translated,\\" however, it is not. It has once again gone through the blender that is Leigh Whannell, but again without Wan's butt in the director's chair mitigating Whannell's inability to characterize. We see an even worse flaw of Whannell's in the opening scenes of Saw III: Dina Meyer, Costas Mandylor, and Donnie Wahlberg's characters, all of whom survived Saw II, appear in the movie's opening scenes and are eliminated for no reason. (Well, there's a reason, but it's a desperately flimsy one that's obviously the thinnest of layers over \\"hey, we have cool devices and nowhere else in the movie to use them.\\") While the movie's better than its predecessor, \\"better\\" is something of a relative term. It's certainly not the equal of the first film, but it doesn't quite have the \\"let's trample all over the legacy of the first film\\" feel to it that the second one does. Watchable, at least. **the director's chair mitigating Whannell's inability to characterize.

B000HK6AJS|4.0|Angela Carter, The Bloody Chamber and Other Adult Tales (Harper, 1979)<br /><br />Angela Carter tells stories. Fairy tales, to be precise, at least in this volume. They're the fairy tales you know well, that you grew up with. Carter just wants you to know that they've grown up with you. The Bloody Chamber and Other Adult Tales visits old standards and, well, not \\"makes them new again,\\" exactly, but takes a slightly different approach in the telling, making them earthier, exploring explicitly subtexts only hinted at in the tales we know (even if we grew up on the unexpurgated editions). In some ways, Angela Carter's minor masterpiece stands in direct opposition to Wendy Walker's retellings of fairytales, as Walker does the same thing, but by twisting the tales into even more labyrinthine iterations; Carter just wants to hack all the floweriness away and get to the bloody, decaying meat of the matter. Both writers are doing something wonderful. If you've never had the pleasure, pick up The Bloody Chamber and Other Adult Tales and get a glimpse of what Grimm was too scared to spell out. ****
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Persona (Ingmar Bergman, 1966)<br /><br />It's been a while since I've added a movie to my all-time 100-best list after only one viewing. I've been doing a good deal of shifting stuff around recently, but always with movies I've seen ten, fifteen, twenty times that have held up well over decades. Tonight, however, I saw Ingmar Bergman's Persona for the first time, and I really found myself with no choice. I've seen a few Bergman movies over the years, and I've always found them thought-provoking and enjoyable; this is the first one, however, that's grabbed me by the throat and not let go until the final frame.<br /><br />Bergman's eerie meditation on identity begins with Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann), a famous actress, in the hospital after what we assume is some sort of mental breakdown. A young nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), is assigned to care for her, and as part of Elisabeth's recuperation, the two spend the summer in a remote cottage on the shore. Elisabeth is mute, but Alma does enough talking for both of them. The isolation and Elisabeth's continuing silence, however, begin to play tricks on Alma's mind-- or is her reality changing?<br /><br />The movie hinges on Andersson's performance, which is as shocking today as it must have been in 1966-- her dialogue ranges from the mundane to the explicit, and she delivers it all with the same bubbliness (at least, in the early stages of the movie). Her character never slips, and she plays it to the hilt. Absolutely riveting. Even more impressive, however, is Ullmann, the silent spectre who often seems as if she's floating through the background of the movie; she doesn't have the benefit of dialogue here, so the power of her role comes solely from her body-- her facial expressions, the way she moves, her posture. And despite the greatness of Andersson's performance, Ullmann steals the show here. That's impressive.<br /><br />A powerhouse of a film. One of the best ever made. *****
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Lord of War (Andrew Niccol, 2005)<br /><br />This one flew under the radar, or at least as under the radar as a much-hyped major Hollywood production can. Upon reflection, that's not terribly surprising, given how strong a film it is; good things, it often seems, never flourish in the sandy, sandy soil of Hollywood. And Niccol (Gattaca) has created a good thing here.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) are arms dealers operating in the grey areas of the law. Or they are until Vitaly develops a rather nasty drug habit and goes into rehab, leaving Yuri to fly solo-- just as the Berlin Wall comes down and the arms market takes off. Yuri is being dogged by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an FBI agent who's sure he's breaking the law.<br /><br />As an action movie, it's kind of fun, interesting, a bit slow at times but watchable all the same. As a chronicle of the slow descent into corruption of a guy who's just trying to make his way in the world, it's incisive, well-done, witty, charming. However, the movie really shines as a survey of the political and economic structure of the world in the nineties. Yuri Orlov is the perfect character to allow Niccol to ruminate on the general anarchic wackiness of a lot of different hot spots at the time. Yuri traipses through the former Soviet Union and Africa, and Niccol follows with his camera, casting light on some very nasty characters who are thinly-veiled (at best) analogues of real dictators. It's good stuff; you probably didn't see it in the theater (very few did), but you can catch what you missed then on DVD now. ****
B00005JM0B|1.0|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Jonathan Mostow, 2003)<br /><br />Okay, raise your hands: how many people didn't see this movie crashing and burning when a director other than James Cameron-- despite his dismal track record since 1996-- was attached to it? (And let's face it, Terminator 2 wasn't exactly gangbusters, either.) Still, the fact that twelve years elapsed between the second and third movies lent a minor air of credibility to it. Incorrectly, of course, but there you go.<br /><br />As the title tells you, this is the story of how the machines took over the world. In other words, the very title of the film is a spoiler, since the machines take over the world, yes, in the very last scene of the film (after Arnie once again does his level best to save the world). This is pre-apocalypse John Connor (Carnivale's Nick Stahl), who begins the film as a bum, more or less. We are almost immediately introduced to Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the woman who will, obviously, be his saving grace. This isn't a spoiler; the movie's about as hard to figure out as a four-piece jigsaw puzzle with three pieces already put into place. And, of course, there's Arnie, the good guy, and Kristanna Loken, the bad guy-- uh, girl. Gotta wonder how Arnie keeps getting crushed, melted, and elected Governor of California, but they can keep sending him back to mess with the Connor family, don't you?<br /><br />In any case, things blow up, people run from terminators, people get killed by terminators, you know the drill. But, unlike the brilliant first film, and even the mediocre second, T3 manages to studiously avoid anything approaching characterization. We are given no reason to care about these characters, no suspense to make us wonder whether they'll rise to the occasion, not even a decent script for the actors to work with. This was as paint-by-numbers as it gets. Save your money, even if you can watch it free. *
B0000542DH|4.0|Natural Born Killers (Oliver Stone, 1994)<br /><br />I never really expected all that much from Natural Born Killers. All the reviews I've read have spent thousands of words going on and on about what a scathing indictment of American media culture this movie is as if it's the only thing about the movie that matters. That'll teach me to listen to reviewers. What's great about Natural Born Killers is that, within the space of Stone's ham-handed assault on the media, there are two characters who have a real relationship. We see how that relationship unfolds, in all its ugly glory. And that's what will keep you riveted.<br /><br />This doesn't feel like an Oliver Stone movie, really. He deals with the basic nastiness of his premise in a dadaesque fashion more reminiscent of David Lynch or Peter Jackson than Oliver Stone; the uglier the scene he's depicting, the more over-the-top he gets. The cast is more than ready to ham it up with him. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis make perfect thrill-killers, but it's some of the minor characters who really shine here. Who knew Rodney Dangerfield could project such an air of depraved menace? Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore, whose characters could have easily been cardboard cutouts representing the corruption of the law enforcement, are three-dimensional (though Jones' character never misses a chance to play to stereotype). Everyone seems as if they're having a great time. Kind of odd given that mass murder is the subject of the movie, but there you go.<br /><br />Capping that is the direction, which is exceptional throughout. The film comes across as thoroughly frenetic, partially because Stone manhandled five hundred more cuts into this movie than there are in Dawn of the Dead (which held the previous record), and Natural Born Killers is almost half an hour shorter. The movie plays like an adrenaline rush-- which is, of course, exactly what Stone intended. It pounds away at the viewer, merciless and relentless; it may be the only film extant capable of leaving an audience physically exhausted after doing nothing more than sitting in a comfortable chair for two hours.<br /><br />Somehow, after all these words, I've only touched the tip of the iceberg about Natural Born Killers.

B00004VXF2|2.0|It amazes me that people who hate this album and people who love it have actually spent the time listening to it when, clearly, Mr. Reed's intention is not that it be placed on a turntable but rather that it be hung on a wall.  This is not music, it is art.  And, as is so often the case when entertainers switch formats, it is not very good art. <br /> <br />Maybe that's not totally fair.  Lou's foray into the world of art isn't as bad as Usher's foray into acting ('In The Mix') or Hasselhof's foray into music ('Night Rocker') but those guys sucked to begin with. As art imitating a rock album, MMM is mildly successful.  Think of it this way, you can own a piece of controversial pop-art by a famous dude for under 20 bucks... not bad huh?  The drawbacks to ownership are that it is controversial in a very limited circle of people you don't wanna associate with who exist outside the art world and the risk that someone might make the mistake of putting a needle to it.
B000A7Q2DM|3.0|Ok ok, I have read plenty of reviews so far on this album and many people seem to be enthralled with it and thats fine. I am not going to make another review to the effect of: \\"You will love each song more than the one before it!\\" because those types of remarks have no meaning to me as a HUGE music fan. Let me start off by saying that I am a musician and in several bands. I found out about 30 seconds to mars not long after their first cd came out. I didn't let the idea that Jared leto was a movie star influence my opinion about the album and a I gave it a chance and alas, it was awesome but this review isn't about that album its about A Beautiful Lie. I have to say right off the bad that this album is very disappointing. I say this because it lacks the complete creativity that the band had with their previous effort. The spacyness and mysteriousness is long gone and it is in with the generic and emo-style singing / rocking. Perfect example is songs such as \\"The Fantasty\\" with lame slow breakdowns that lead back into generic chorus' and lets not forget the \\"woah oh oh\\" part half way through the song. Can anybody say raggae rip off? I like reggae and fully appreciate when bands cross genres but come on! Again, I will say that all of the originality with the band has been sucked out and what is left is many songs featuring Jared Leto's \\"awesome\\" voice. Only problem is that his voice is only marginally good - and thats when he's giving it his all. Perhaps the fact that he was a mainstream actor before his new band sped up the process towards mainstreamization and boring hooks that would have otherwise taken an up and coming band 3 or more album releases. The drummer Shannon Leto (yes Jared's brother) is awesome and his integration of acoustic drums with synth sounds is amazing. A Beautiful Lie however, features nothing of the sort and instead Shannon's drumming is dumbed down with hardly any creative freedom that was evident on the first album. Anyways, in short this cdlacks everything I liked about the first one. Anyone who disagrees can go ahead and listen to \\"Echelon\\" from their self titled cd and compare it to this new garbage.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I'm glad to see that overall, this film got 5 stars seeing that I am a huge Hitchcock buff and have seen all but a handful of his movies. But reading some of the other comments, it just goes to show that all movies are rated to our own opinions.  My only disagreement(at least the one I care to share) is that this movie is not based on voyeurism in a good light necissarily, although I think we all have it in us to some extent.  Speaking of propaganda-I really don't think ALL OF THE SPY CAMERAS EVERYWHERE are because of this movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is based on the true story of Easy Company.<br /><br />Acting:  A<br /><br />Screenplay:  A<br /><br />DVD Transfer: A<br /><br />Sound: A<br /><br />Even the wonderful Metal Box gets an \\"A\\"<br /><br />I have been reading WWII Comics from I was a child, having grown a fascination for WWII. Today, I enjoy WWII Online Games like Call of Duty 2 (This has been the only game that has held my interest for Over 2 Years! and still going)<br /><br />I recommend this boxed set to anyone that has the faintest of interest in WWII.  Even if you don't, and you enjoy inspiring true stories, don't miss out on this one!<br /><br />Also, watch the interviews of the Real Men of Easy Company, one of the most memorable and touching lines was when the Real Major Winters said, when he was asked by his Grandson, \\".....Grandpa...were you a hero in the war?\\"  Grandpa replied, \\"......No.....no son....,but I was surrounded by a Company of Heroes.....\\"<br /><br />(Company of Heroes is also a WWII game, and was game of the year last year - I recently purchased it, see my review of that when I get it)<br /><br />This has been one of my best purchases from Amazon.com.
B000I0RR7Q|5.0|I personally haven't seen Casablanca in HD as of yet. However, I am in total agreement with the previous review.  If you simply are watching movies for HD rather than the storyline or simply do not care for black and white films, you are missing the picture.  This movie was released during the war and overwhelmingly accepted at a time when blockbuster movies were not at the top of the list for our nation.  It has been revered as the best movie of all time by many and ranked #2 on AFI's top 100. Simply reviewing this film strictly for the set or grainy picture is not sufficient and is pretty much the same as if someone 50 years from now were to make the same remarks about an epic film of our day.  In closing I would like to say that even though I don't agree with the 3 stars, at least you watched the movie before you knocked it. My advice, watch it once more and appreciate it.
B000059XUO|5.0|It is a tragedy that Brandon Lee died while making this film.  Had he lived, the Crow sequels would have been much better. <br /> <br />The Crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace.  It set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990's. <br /> <br />
B00008YZYM|4.0|This is a sweet movie that's as much fun to watch the tenth time as the first. Dennis Quiad and Natasha Richardson are great here and to this day Hallie/Annie is how I still think of Lindsay Lohan, who in her twin roles was cute and talented and radiant with that energy Noel Coward aptly dubbed \\"star quality.\\" If you've only seen the original Parent Trap, don't assume you've seen this one, too, because not only is the '90's version just different enough to have its own style, it's actually the better of the two. Also keep your eyes peeled for cameos from the '60's Parent Trap: not only among returning cast members, but locations, too. As I said in my title, this is an adorable movie!
B00005NG9Z|5.0|A good video collection with great sound and some home videos to boot. Nice package for the money, and a great way to remember one of the best bands ever to grace our ears.
B000J103YI|4.0|The brand-new film version of DREAMGIRLS features three additional songs, especially written for the film version, which blend in seamlessly with the songs from the original stage production (for more info about the Broadway stage production, check out my review of the [[ASIN:B000000OM9 Dreamgirls (1982 Original Broadway Cast)]]).<br /><br />The true star of this soundtrack is undoubtedly Jennifer Hudson, whose searing performance as Effie White has won her Golden Globe, SAG, and Academy Awards for 'Best Supporting Actress'.  Just listen to the amazing way she tackles Effie's agonizing anthem, \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\".<br /><br />Beyonce Knowles plays the role of Deena Jones, and comes off best with \\"Listen\\", one of the three new songs (and co-wrote by Knowles herself), an equally-stirring ballad sung at a point where Deena has come to an emotional crossroads.  Anika Noni Rose (a Broadway veteran from CAROLINE OR CHANGE) also scores heavily as Lorrell with \\"Patience\\".<br /><br />Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx also unveil their fine singing voices here.  The soundtrack to DREAMGIRLS is a fantastic souvenir from an unforgettable movie musical.<br /><br />[Sony 88967 04102 2]
B000AMPZF8|5.0|My discovery of Muse started with Black Holes.  I fell in love.  I've worked my way backwards, buying Absolution, and now Origin.  I loved those two, but I REALLY love Origin.  It's fun, it's interesting, it rocks.  I just got it today, and I already know that it will be getting a lot of playtime.  Song I like the most:  Plug In Baby, I love the guitar. <br />These guys really can do no wrong.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|If ever there was something to truly pay attention to, this would be something to do just that.  People on this planet need to open their eyes and hearts to what is happening to the only thing that connects us all.  This movie/documentary was absolutely wonderful and our government should really be paying attention to something other than their precious bank accounts.  Well done Mr. Gore!
1582701709|5.0|The heart of gnostic teachings (distilled ageless wisdom) is explored -- again. Although told time and time again (from Abraham to Atkinson), 'like attracts like' is still a startling revelation (hence, a 'secret'), at least to the unenlightened masses. Some other metaphysical books exploring the law of intention/attraction are: The Mind Magnet, The Celestine Prophecy, From Hunters To Healers, Quantum Healing.
B000002J1S|5.0|I am old enough to remember when this magnificent recording was first released. It was a cornerstone recording much in the vein of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" as far as it signified a change in direction and focus for Genesis although not nearly as drastic as the Pink Floyd recording. <br /> <br />The last album that Genesis recorded with Peter Gabriel and the visible turning point of Phil Collins as a musician, after this effort, Collins would chart a completely different course for Genesis, one that I am still convinced was not really for the better as Genesis went from being innovative ground breakers to darlings of the top forty. <br /> <br />Still fresh after over thirty years, it shames the vast majority of newer rock bands on the market these days. Daring and different even though it is not consistently strong, \\"The Lamb\\" is a fine example of how innovative rock musicians can be when they set their mind to the task. It contains some of the finest work ever recorded by Tony Banks, Michael Rutherford and Tony Hackett, who are likely some of the most underrated musicians that I can personally think of. This is a must have for any serious music collection. <br />
0812550757|5.0|The entire Ender series really is a masterpiece in writing.  Even those who are not sci-fi geeks can appreciate the gritty human emotions and tough challenges that Ender and cast face.   The setting may be the future, but the emotions, relationships, and other sociological issues are very 21st century.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|This movie is pretty good for a love story. i enjoyed it. it wasn't boring and it made you think a little. it also has a suprise ending, which  i didn't excpect. But all in all it was a good film. you should see it.
0441172717|5.0|Dune represents what Science Fiction is all about.  Herbert presents us with a universe of infinite possibilities within a wonderous universe.  His entire universe is exceedingly well thought out.  The way his characters interact with it show that he really wants them to be products of that universe, not ours.  Top notch writing all around.
B000LC3IDI|5.0|saw three is the glue to the other two because saw 3 brings em' all together. it's like a 6 hour movie cut into 3 Movies. saw three is more gruesome and distubing than the first two wich makes it alot more fun to watch. i haven't seen a horror movie trilogy more disturbing than saw. you gotta love em'. Because it has it's own original story to it. This movie is Freakin' sweet. You have to see it. Oh, this i one series you do not go out of sequence if you do you'll get very confused.
0553573403|5.0|The books are great.  Just read them.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie tells all the truth. i really shouldn't say more. just go out and rent the movie. who knows who is reading it. i don't trust the government. there is no such thing as freedom of speech, well there is but you get punished for it. all i can say is that michael moore took a gutsy move on telling this story. But it needed to be told.
0553579908|5.0|Its an excellent series.  Apparently everyone else agrees.  If fantasy, or even medieval history, interests you, just read the books.  You won't be disappointed.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|this story about global warming needed to be told. no matter who told it. people need to know what is happening to our world. hopefully people will do thier part and try to help our planet. do more recycling, throw your trash in the cans and not on the side of the road our in the lakes, rivers and oceans. i just hope people are moved by this story that Al gore took a long time to tell. i don't know about other people but i like my planet. you have to see this movie.
B000NA28IE|3.0|Eragon made an ok to mediocre genre film, made from a great book.  If you have read the book, then you will know that is one of the worst adaptations ever made.  I doubt the scriptwriter actual read the book, it's like the cliff notes for dummies abbreviated version of events.  The coming of age story is entirely left out in favor of sword and sorcery FX shots (done low budget).  Key elements that are foreshadowed in the first book for events in the second (and likely third) books are entirely forgotten and don't even get lip service in the dialog.   <br /> <br />I love John Malkovich but he had no place in this film.  His scenes were all shot on one set and look terribly like they were an afterthought and not part of the movie script.  However, despite the movies flaws, it remains at least watchable. <br /> <br />Jeremy Irons, could have played a role that is absolutely pivotal to character development of Eragon.  Yet his talent as an actor and his importance as a character are almost entirely wasted in this sad script.  One monkey with a 100 typewriters could have done a better adaptation. <br /> <br />If you want to see a passable genre film, this will pass your time.  If you want to read a spectacular coming of age fantasy novel, then read the book.  You will be amazed to realize it was written by a fifteen year old kid.  Christopher Paolini is a far superior writer compared to the piss poor adapter of this screenplay.   <br />
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Jigsaw, what a crazy man, so he has an illness, okay so now everybody has to pay, espically the people who don't value thier lives or thier famliy, how messed up is that. Well it is twisted. this movie has an original story to it. its not like those other serial killer films. This movie rocks. and to top it all of it has the best and most suprising ending to it unlike most horror films. this movie is awesome.
B0007PALZ2|2.0|I thought I was going to be watching a very special movie based on all of the hype and reviews. I wasn't looking for a Die Hard movie and had no real expectations beyond what I mentioned. I was really disappointed with how disjointed it was and to be quite honest, the lousy acting. The only real joy was Brad Pitt. I don't normally consider myself a Pitt fan, and, I didn't realize he was actually in it. He stands out in this move where I think Bruce essentially mailed it in.
0374105235|5.0|Perhaps it is the harsh reality of experiences I am lucky enough not to know. Maybe it is the cruelty that a thirteen-year-old boy can feel. Or, it could be the story of revenge and redemption. Whatever the quality of this book that makes it such a compelling read, it is impossible not to feel the conflict of Sierra Leone while reading Ishmael Beah's book, A Long Way Gone.    As a boy citizen, Beah knew that good behavior was a requirement of surviving in Sierra Leone. He notes that young people, especially, were required to respect everyone in their community, especially their elders. As a boy soldier, Beah knew that disrespect and murder was required to survive.    Beah left his village one morning with a group of friends only to hear, later that afternoon that he could never return home. Rebels had captured his village and the war had begun. His memoir takes us through the forests of Sierra Leone with him as he searches for food and shelter. He found enough to get by, though lack of signage and the death of so many make it impossible for him to know the names of the villages that provided him these necessities.    \\"When I was very little, my father used to say, `If you are alive, there is hope for a better day and something good to happen. If there is nothing good left in the destiny of a person, he or she will die.'\\"    Beah is full of good and never gave up hope for better days. Through hunger so painful that he \\"didn't have the appetite to eat or the strength to find food\\" and a haze of drug use to numb his pain, he leads the reader to believe that somewhere inside of him he always knew he would escape the war torn forests of his homeland.    He watches as friends die and he takes the reader through his continued hope that he will see his family again. That chance comes when he approaches a village where it is rumored his family now resides. He is filled with a forgotten energy as he sees this village from atop a hill, but his group restrains him by demandinga rest for food, drinks, and a moment off of their feet. This rest that he does not want to take means the difference between his living and dying, but also means never seeing his family again.    \\"With trembling hands I took the gun, saluted him, and ran to the back of the line, still holding the gun but afraid to look at it... it frightened me.\\"    Watching this boy become a soldier is harrowing and painful. When he first holds his gun, filled with fear, he thinks of his toy gun, made from bamboo, which he played with at the age of seven. It strikes the reader that seven years old was but a short time ago for this new member of the army.    Beah is haunted while awake by the traumatizing events he watches unfold. He learns to justify his squad's killings as he is taught that these people took his family and keep him from his hometown. He is further haunted in the brief moments he sleeps by dreams of his being shot, tortured, and surrounded by blood.    Again, Beah shows us he is still a regular boy under a soldier's mentality when he discusses his excitement in reaching a village where old friends are stationed. He wanted to see his old friend to hear war stories and to hear how many people his friend had killed, but he also wanted to find a lieutenant, who he knew read Shakespeare, to talk of Julius Caesar and continue to learn.    \\"The squad had been our family.\\"    Beah's freedom from a soldier's life comes when UNICEF staff arrives at a village where he is currently stationed. He watches as the UNICEF staff meet with the lieutenant. He is confused and feels abandoned when he is ordered to go with these strangers. He and the other young boys who are removed from service to the army guess that the lieutenant was paid for the boys' freedom.    The author then takes us on his journey through rehabilitation and worldwide experiences as he becomes a speaker about the evils children face throughout the world. In the end, Beah knows that he must leave Sierra Leone orrisk being killed. Worse, the risk existed that he would rejoin the army.    This book takes the reader on an unpleasant, but necessary, journey. As twelve-year-olds in America, we learn about war in history books. Beah teaches us more than those books ever could through his firsthand accounting of his experiences as a child soldier.    A special thank you to Starbucks for featuring this book!
0446310786|4.0|This is a great book about predudice, femanist(a little), and most importantly innocence! If you are reading this book you are proboly thinking, what the heck, where did the mockingbird part come from. Well here you go, I'll save you a couple of hours thinking about this book trying to read between the lines... To kill a mockingbird first appears when Atticus Finch{did you get the Finch part, as in the bird} tells the kids that they can kill as many blue jays as the want, but to remember that to kill a mockingbird is a sin. Scout asks Mrs.Maudie why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird and she said it is because they don't do anything but sing theire heart out for us! If you still don't completley understand, mockingbird means innocence. It also comes when a newspaper ad is put in the paper about killing crippled, and lastly when scout tells atticus that to try Boo Radley would be like shooting a mockingbird! That's what I got from reading between the lines, but it you got something different feel free to post your opinions!
1582701709|1.0|If I wish hard enough that \\"The Secret\\" would just go away, will it make it so?  If that's the case, count me in!  Ridiculous drivel, and potentially harmful for any poor sap who believes that wishing really hard will make thier lymphoma disappear.  One star is overdoing it.
B00000K29E|4.0|you know, this was actually pretty good.  i listened to it for the first time, and i was surprised at the folky sound of it.  i thought that it was gonna be a blues rock romp.  i see this as a preamble to CHEAP THRILLS.  janis gets her down, but she does not get off on this one like i thought she would.  i like the stuff she does not do lead on as well.  very interesting formats.
B0006213H6|3.0|Released in the US only in 2004, Von is really Sigur Ros's first album.  It sounds it.  Fascinated with what they could create musically, they were in development then, playing with sounds, with effects and with the interplay of the music and the created language of their later, much better and sometimes almost magical works.  Look at Von as training and keep for your personal music player cuts 5 (Myrkur), 7 (Hafssol) and 11 (Syndir Guos), but not much else.
B000EZ7ZXQ|4.0|I like this movie - I found it amusing and entertaining. It's a unique story. The story does depict real life and its meant for entertainment so its not necessarily focused on being realistic. I would watch this one again and don't have a problem paying regular price for it.
0440241413|4.0|Kinsella goes a good job in trapping the reader into her story of Becky Bloomwood and her financial mishaps.  Becky is lovable even though some of her choices made me want to hit her.  She is a fun British character who is a little self involved, a chronic lier, and lives in her own dreamworld where credit cards are magical and the money does not mean anything.  I enjoyed Confessions because we all know a Becky.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It kept my interest and was entertaining. The blu-ray version is crystal clear and detailed. One of Amazon's listings shows the wrong description and actors for the movie. I would very much recomend this movie.
1596680199|5.0|This book is a compilation of MANY techniques I'd learned here and there over the years for making polymer clay, especially faux materials (wood, stone, leather, bone) and mokume-gane, which is a layered, irridescent technique that mimics layers of metal cut and polished. (Hard to describe, think cutting layers into the damascene metal like a Samurai sword's visible layers of steel to make a moire-patterned surface.)<br /><br />Skinner blends, millefiori, mica, foil, inlay, stamping and surface impression are also covered. Nothing is handled in too much depth, but enough is given so that most of the techniques are accessible even to polymer clay beginners.<br /><br />The examples of bead jewelry will take your breath away. I just wish there were more of them, as the artistry was exceptionally good.<br /><br />If you want a one-stop shopping volume for making faux stone or materials, this book has a great sampling and very good tutorials. There were a number of techniques I hadn't seen before. In all, an exciting book for the polymer clay artist, and a great reference for faux materials, let alone the many shapes and styles of beads. A must-have for your beading library.
B000FJGWBC|4.0|I liked this movie. I am a Jessica Alba fan and mainly got it for that reason. The movie is kind of flaky in the sense that the storyline is not original nor is it necessarily a great story. It did have enough action and Jessica Alba to make it a good movie though. I would watch it again, though its not going to make my top 50 movies. Worth it for a bargain price.
0757302661|5.0|I took Hypnobirthing classes because my first two births were overdue, drug induced and painful experiences.  I had a beautiful experience birthing my third daughter (on the date I chose to birth her -- not overdue) and know my fourth child will be born peacefully too -- due to hypnobirthing.  I just want people to know that the classes are worth the money.  It is a shame that insurance does not cover teaching this \\"cost saving\\" technique (yet)!  If it is still too much money or not offered by anyone in your area yet -- the books and tapes WILL suffice. You just won't get the additional support you would get by taking a class.  All the basics are in the book and the relaxation scripts on the CD narrated by Marie Mongan are great.  You can get additional scripts, ideas and suggestions in the classes, but my favorite is the rainbow relaxation script that is in the book and on CD from the institute. I also purchased the \\"Comfort Zone\\" CD from the institute and played it throughout my birthing.  It was sooo soothing!  Please don't doubt the process and especially don't   doubt yourself and the incredible power your body has!  So, smile, relax and breathe your baby into this world!
B000FGGE7C|3.0|I liked but didn't love this movie. I thought it got kind of boring in areas and although I know its the style, the softness of the cinematography bothered me. I bought it because I like Milla Jovovich. As far as the movie itself goes, buy this one from the bargain aisle and not at full price.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|By now, you must know how amazing The Departed is and how many awards its piled up since it was release.  So I won't bore you with what you already know.  Rather, I'll tell you how disappointing the extra features were.  For example, the 9 deleted features run from seconds to a few minutes long and after viewing them, you'd wish you never saw them.  It's pretty clear why they were cut out, as the movie was already running quite long and these scenes proved unworthy of being included in the film.  The other features including the short documentary about the inspiration behind Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello were not very refreshing either.  My honest opinion is... save the extra 5 bucks and get the one disk version.
B00003CWRX|5.0|The machine in this case, is big tobacco.  It is a giant business that is maybe too much for one man to take on.  That is until a guy named Jeffrey Wigand did just that.  Russell Crowe has played a lot of main parts before and after this movie, but his portrayal of this man was great.  Crowe shows us a solemn, somber man who works for a large tobacco company as a scientist doing research.  He has a falling out you could say, and is soon watched, harassed and blackballed.  He decides to expose some major truths about what is really going on with the cigarettes and the research going into making them...well you know.  Al Pacino is also in this film and does a fine job as a 60 minutes producer who tries to bring Wigand's dilemma to the people so they can see for themselves.  A lot of Red tape and some big business aspects stand in the way though, and Wigand's life spirals into further decline.  This is a great film and the special features show interviews with the real Mr. Wigand.  I did not like Christopher Plummer portraying the part of legendary 60 minutes journalist Mike Wallace though.  The two look nothing alike, and Plummer is much larger in size than Wallace.  That is the only thing I found wrong with this film.  It is very moving and I recommend it.
B000002U9Y|3.0|One of their least Floydian works, the album still comes across as one of the better, semi-generic psychedelic works of that time. producing a few of their beloved early live staples. As interesting as a few of these elongated centerpiece jams were, it would pain any fan in comparison to how they became so much more on masterful concerts (portrayed with their double Ummagumma). Helping round out some of the extended lsd indulgences were a few more upbeat, in their own warped way, rockers, and more of Floyd's greatest, identity-less, hippiefests. Ultimately, the energy is merely hinted at here. Even at their compositional best, the group does not have the confidence, nor the studio proficiency to complement their hazy ambitions, and sadly the power of much impact to be found throughout the compelling half-step in a memorable career is fleeting.  The bittersweet ending of Syd Barrett's drug-infested musical heart that helped start an amazing thing thankfully would give way to a new era of focus.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|Maybe you'll find a gem every now and then that went straight from the cutting room floor to DVD, but this is not it.  This movie is the direct result of what happens when there is absolutely no production and no money put into a film.  While the scenery and landscapes may be fascinating, the acting and dialogue is horrible.  I'm sorry, I've read the poem and have seen these actors in other roles and this movie is a completely distorted view of what the poem really is and who the actors really are.  Save your money and your time and wait for Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf adaptation coming out later this year in a THEATER near you.

0345451325|4.0|Yeah... I was like you too. I picked this up with a few other books with very low expectations, but I was very surprised. This book is actually decent. Even without a Video Game to back it up it would still make a good read. I enjoyed learning more about the Master Chief (main character in that Halo Video Game) partly because he identity is always hidden and the Video Game does not go into detail about how the current situation came to be. <br /> <br />This Book is the Prequel to the first Halo Video game, I enjoyed it and my only suggestion or flaw i found was that the battle sequences could use more description.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|Disc one starts out with a lot of screaming. This is not unexpected on a Foo Fighters CD, but it was pretty grating on the title cut. I found myself forgetting about the song and thinking, \\"Man, doesn't his throat hurt?\\" I doubt that's what the band was shooting for. It isn't until \\"Best of You\\" that the band hits its groove. This is classic Foo Fighters-screaming with purpose. The CD at this point pulls into a consistent, but vaguely familiar mode, where each song has a driving rhythm, but is lyrically simplistic and the vocalization has a one note tendency. \\"Resolve\\" breaks out of this mode with a more thoughtful approach and by ratcheting down the energy level and letting the words work through; it becomes an effective change of pace. This continues with \\"The Deepest Blues are Black\\" another number that lets the vocals work with the music. <br />Disc two is a departure for the band. Acoustic guitar and hopeful vocals surrounded by a gentle rhythm section, the question is, \\"Does it work?\\" I wish I could say it did. I like when bands take chances and break away from the tried and true, but in this case disc two definitely does not play to the band's strengths. Most of the numbers are forgettable and the lyrics are not strong enough to support the setting. I do admire the effort, but not the results.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|I must agree, this one does have a more mature sound than her previous effort, 'Healing is Diffucult'. That is not to downplay the excellence of 'Healing..' though. This album is sensual. It creeps into your soul and doesn't leave until it reaches the end. 'Breathe Me' is so hauntingly beautiful. And 'The Church of What's Happening', with it's slightly gospel-like posturing, is both inspiring and beautiful. This woman is no stranger to excellence, it seems.
B000KJTCOG|4.0|Not to be confused with the single disc \\"Original 80s Remix Album\\" CD, this is a 3 disc set.<br /><br />Okay, let's break down this title. ORIGINAL-80s-REMIX.<br /><br />Original? Sometimes--a good number of these mixes are not the original remixes.<br /><br />80s? Well, for the most part, any of the mixes that are not the original remixes were done in the NINETIES. So WHY have them on an `original 80s remix' compilation???<br /><br />Remix? Mostly. However, there are also quite a few album versions and 7\\" versions on here, some of them mislabeled.<br /><br />These compilations seem to be getting more desperate to cash in on collectors' desires to have rare 80s 12\\" remixes on CD. But instead of taking the time to research what we're really looking for and hunting down the licensing, they keep rehashing mixes used numerous times, throwing in easier to acquire bad 90s remixes, and mixing in a couple of album versions. Having said that, there are, as usual, a couple of mixes here that are making their CD debut, making this one a necessity. The sound quality is excellent as well.  Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />CD1:<br /><br />1. reflex...duran duran (6:35) (the 12\\" version)<br /><br />2. penthouse & pavement (tommy D mix)...heaven 17 (1990s house mix)<br /><br />3. lifeline...spandau ballet (12\\" version)<br /><br />4. enola gay...OMD (4:08) (sash remix from the 1990s--and the vocals are resung)<br /><br />5. The Circus...Erasure (4:05) (this is the single remix from the Erasure ebx 2 boxed set)<br /><br />6. reap the wild wind...ultravox (4:45)  (the 12\\" version)<br /><br />7. situation...yaz (5:45) (this is the album version)<br /><br />8. it's a miracle/miss me blind...culture club (9:12) (the original 12\\" medley)<br /><br />9. blinded me with science...thomas dolby (5:10) (the original US long version)<br /><br />10. he ain't no competition...brother beyond (5:42) (the original 12\\")<br /><br />11. belouis some (3:35) (um...this would be the 7\\", NOT the 12\\". And how about the 12\\" version of \\"Some People\\" for a change???)<br /><br />12. We Close Our Eyes...Go West (6:45) (BRILLIANT! This alternate 12\\" version to the \\"total overhang mix\\" is finally available on CD with the orchestral opening intact!)<br /><br />13. love missile f-11 (westbam remix short version)...sigue sigue sputnik (long or short, this remix doesn't do the original song justice--it's more like a dub)<br /><br />14. Heart of Glass...Blondie (5:50) (the absolutely easy to find original disco mix. A waste of precious disc space better used for something rare)<br /><br />CD2:<br /><br />1. keep on movin(M Beat bonus mix)...soul II soul (4:24) (EEK! A horrible breakbeat dub mix)<br /><br />2.

The 1984 12\\" remix. Very rare and collectible.)<br /><br />12. let's stick together...bryan ferry (2:59) (Indeed it is not the original mix.

B00005JPFQ|3.0|When I was younger I read some comic books, but I was never a fan of GHOST RIDER.  Sure the guy looked cool, but it didn't make any sense to me that a person could sell their soul to save a person they loved and then receive demonic powers that they would use to thwart the demon who had given the powers to them.  The idea still doesn't make any sense to me, but after having seen GHOST RIDER I have a better understanding about the character and his motivations.<br /><br />In the mythos that the film sets up, every generation has a Ghost Rider, a person who is given incredibly powers from the devil (well, not really, he's not Satan but is instead Mephistopheles) to use to do his dirty work in exchange for some great gift.  The film begins with the voice of The Caretaker (Sam Elliot) telling a story about a Ghost Rider from long ago who when it came time to pay the devil out ran the demon and made it to safety.  This opening segment seems quaint, but it actually ties into the story later on.  The story then fast forwards several years where we meet a younger Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) and his father Barton (Brett Cullen).  The Blazes are motorcycle stuntmen who mainly perform at a stationary carnival.  They are a good team and Barton loves his son.  However, Barton is dying of cancer and hides this from Johnny.  Johnny discovers the secret and finds himself torn.  He knows how much his father is sacrificing for him.  That's when a mysterious man arrives and offers to heal Johnny's father, but the price is his soul.  Before Johnny even realizes what has happened his blood has signed the deed and he finds himself the servant of a demon, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda).  Needless to say, the event changes Johnny's life.  He leaves behind the girl he was going to marry, Roxanne (Raquel Alessi) and sets out to make a new life.  Years later Mephistopheles' own son threatens to overthrow the demon and take his place as second-in-command of Hell.  So, Mephistopheles summons Johnny (now played by Nicholas Cage) away from his reunion with Roxanne (now played by Eva Mendes), transforms him into the Ghost Rider, and commands him to send his errant son and his friends back to Hell.<br /><br />The special effects in GHOST RIDER are pretty amazing.  The director, Martin Steven Johnson, and other filmmakers did an excellent job of creating the character of Ghost Rider.  The burning skull on wheels that's the devil's bounty hunter appears realistic.  I enjoy watching Sam Elliot in films and having him portray The Caretaker was an excellent idea.  Eva Mendes doesn't get to do much on screen other than look pretty, but she is one of the most attractive women in Hollywood (she has real curves) and makes any film more bearable to watch.  As for Nicholas Cage, he's not as good as Johnny Depp (the man originally slated for the title role), but Cage is a good actor and a huge fan of the comic book.  Despite having a hair piece that took three hours a day to set in play, he does justice to the character.  The film also does a good job at introducing people to the character of the audience.<br /><br />However, great actors and amazing special effects are not enough to make a movie like GHOST RIDER good.  The most important thing in any movie is to have a good story.  The general plot of GHOST RIDER is not a very good story.  It has a good introduction and opening sequence, but quickly moves downhill from there.  For instance, it's never made clear exactly why the contract Mephistopheles wants is so important.  The contract is supposed to contain untold evil that will bring a new Hell to Earth, but it's never made clear why--even when the characters explain what is happening, it makes no sense.<br /><br />Part of that might be because the story doesn't do a very good job of sticking to the rules of the universe it sets up.  For instance, The Caretaker tells Johnny that he should stay with him because demons can't stand on holy ground.  A few scenes we find Blackheart (Mephistopheles' son) and his demon buddies in a church harassing and torturing a priest.  In comic books inconsistencies like this happen quite often because there are different writers with different agendas each creating the same character.  This has gotten better in recent years as the comic book industry has attempted to create a better consistency to attract new readers without offending older ones, but it still happens.  In the comic book industry, such a thing is acceptable, but when it happens in a movie it's an example of shoddy writing and filmmaking.  Films based off a comic book can't be exactly like the works they are based on because they are two completely different mediums.<br /><br />In addition to the lack of an exciting story and poor writing, the character development is pretty bad.  The best comic book movies, such as the SPIDER MAN films or BATMAN BEGINS or even the original SUPERMAN don't just rely upon a good story, fine actors, and special effects.  They also do a thorough job of developing the central characters.  GHOST RIDER doesn't do that.  We get to know Johnny Blaze fairly well and The Caretaker, but that's about all.  Take Roxanne for instance.  We have no idea why she loves Johnny are why over a decade after he left her behind she still cares for him.  Eva Mendes is not only a beautiful actress, but she's also talented, but she isn't allowed to display her talents in GHOST RIDER.  Instead she just gets to play a cardboard damsel in distress.<br /><br />Overall, GHOST RIDER is just an average movie.  It has a lot of special effects, some great actors, and a great central character, but in the end it doesn't even ride high enough to travel into the sunset.  Fans of the Ghost Rider comic book might enjoy the film.  I'd also recommend seeing it if you are a fan of Sam Elliot, Nicholas Cage, or Eva Mendes, as well as someone looking to consume a piece of mindless eye candy with some action.ind Blackheart (Mephistopheles' son) and his demon buddies in a church harassing and torturing a priest.

I think I had it one a large 33 1/3 album. i guess that kinda dates me, huh?
