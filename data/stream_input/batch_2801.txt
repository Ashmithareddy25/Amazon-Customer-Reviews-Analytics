B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's an amazing game and you and friends should play! This game has amazing.graphics. It's really a fun game. I know I enjoyed so hopefully you will!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love the different story lines, but Joss didn't have to kill Lady Heather (CSI).  This is much better than the current stuff on SyFy.
B00821OX98|5.0|Good acting, believable characters, gripping plot, good production values for a cable series.<br />Catching up over the summer to be up to date when Season 4 starts
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|If you've seen this movie I don't need to comment because you know how great it is.  If you haven't seen it, then please take the time and you won't regret it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|At first, I resisted watching Suits because I thought it was just another con man type show. When I finally gave in and watched it,  I was amazed at the quality of the writing, acting, and directing. The actors are nothing short of superb. The characters they play are three-dimensional, complex, and believably flawed. The story lines are adult and satisfyingly complex. What a treat! Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams play off each other so perfectly. Meghan Markle and Gina Torres demonstrate awesome acting chops. Sarah Rafferty and Rick Hoffman provide both comic relief and emotional depth. This show is a winner.
B002N1AF7C|5.0|To listen to Kraftwerk music one must have a taste for the minimal, albeit recursed almost endlessly into a rich sound texture one can spend hours digging through.<br /><br />Like many working with synthesizers in the dawn of the analog synth age, one will hear cries of \\"*I* could play that\\". Themes in a Kraftwerk piece tend to be simple, poppy affairs (coaxing a given sound out of a synth in which the digital tech was limited to any built in sequencers or arpeggiators was and is a more difficult business as I can attest from experience), but are usually only the starting point for what one is listening to.<br /><br />Autobahn is a collosal joke, a sonic pun also recursed. A musical work themed on the mind-numbing business of driving the autobahn (the music conjours doing so at night for me but that may just be my own take and not what the group intended) that actually recapitulates the feeling of doing so. The lyrics emphasize the point, being extremely simple statements of the minimalist nature of the autobahn (and what else is there to look at in the headlights as one drives the endless black ribbon?). \\"We're driving, driving, driving on the autobahn\\" they sing in a desultory manner before describing the road - black with a white line down the middle and green bands along each side. Heh heh.<br /><br />As the journey ends, about 20 minutes or so after it began, the singer turns on the radio only to to hear someone singing \\"We're driving, driving, driving on the autobahn\\". The message is clear - there is no escape from the dreadful monotonous job at hand.<br /><br />Somehow, this all happens in a soundscape that is anything but monotonous. Cars and trucks zoom by at times, horns sound as they doppler into the distance. The listener is for all intents and purposes sitting in the cab next to the man driving, driving, driving on the autobahn.<br /><br />You'll need a cross-the-room separation on your speakers to get the most from this album. Headphones will not do it justice.<br /><br />There are four shorter pieces that follow the side-long (remember when recordings had sides?) Autobahn. The first two are arrangements of a simple tune, one slow and ethereal, the other a rocker with the synths pumping out harmonic-rich sound. The other two are stand alone pieces.<br /><br />There are other instuments on this album, notably flutes, but they are supplementing the synthesizer parts which are front and center.<br /><br />This music is definitely not for everyone. Impatient listeners will wonder what the fuss was about. I love it.justice.<br /><br />There are four shorter pieces that follow the side-long (remember when recordings had sides?) Autobahn.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The product arrived quick, only 2 days after I ordered it. The mouse and its buttons have a good feel and the mouse is quite light if you're used to wireless mice, which I was using before, but the mouse comes with adjustable weights that you can use to your preference. The mouse is a little on the big size in my opinion, though this suits my hand just fine. The mouse program software is straightforward and easy to use given a few minutes poking around and experimenting. You do have to download it from the Anker website, though, but the mouse will work without it. Overall its a great mouse.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|McConaughey is excellent as always.  The Dialog is excellent and spirited.<br />It would be hard to find a person that would not like this movie.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I am so looking forward to the next episode.  I was completely sucked into this story.  I love the characters and the work the actors who play them are doing.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This fits just great! It's very durable . This saves your Kindle especially if it's been carried by a child!!!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|thank you very much, I had been stuck on getting this season of fringe and now i am glad I got it,
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I picked this up last week, and I'm really enjoying the replay factor of the game.  The game offers random achievements, which are a fun way to reward those that replay and build their skill.<br /><br />I play the Infinite mode where I restart my progress at level 1 after I run out of room and the game ends.  The Zen mode is just a continual running, but I don't find it challenging.  The Survival mode is tough because you get a limited time to move blocks before bombarded with a bunch of falling blocks.<br /><br />I find the game challenging as you have to manage the fallen blocks, the upcoming blocks, and decide when to take advantage of the special blocks (e.g., bombs, glowing blocks, etc.).  It's taken me several hours to develop strategies and make progress on the levels.
142311339X|5.0|as always very happy to have another r.riordan book for my collection especially one thats in such fabulous condition thanks
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I read other reviews and just wonder what movie these people are watching. Are they on DMT? This is a piece of art that comes along once in a Blue Moon. This will be in my collection the day it gets released. Best scary movie ever and that's a fact.GREAT JOB!!!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|great service, got it really soon, love One Republic, their music I think is different because they mix all this different sounds, instruments, together.... .and sounds great!!
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|Joe Satriani has put out some remarkable albums throughout his career but this is one of my favorites! Fresh and more &#34;open&#34; sounding, this album delivers and soars!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Slydris is very addictive and fun but a couple times I have experienced problems with it reloading a level. It will load but there will be no bricks. Sometimes the game does this several times in a row. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this production, can't believe that people lived like this.... it would be great to live this life style. T
B007IXWKUK|5.0|That is all I can say! Oh My God! What a book.... Read it! You will not regret it!  Read them all!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The kindle fire Is too big for this game... but that is my opinion. I love this game on my phone!!! But with my kindle... it is hard to run on to a different tract!! Otherwise... I Love This Game!!!
B005LJK3AC|2.0|I just didn't like it.  It was only funny a couple of times, the timing was off.  I made myself watch the whole thing, I really wanted to frisbee it out the window.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series.  Can't wait for the fourth season.  I watch this whole season in like two days!  Love it.
0316236535|5.0|I used to have this book and gave it to a friend - then bought it again for myself.  My grandchildren love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It beats temple run, and temple run 2. It relates to the two movies. Something that your kids can play!
B005NK69ZC|1.0|I am a fan of Ellen's show but I found this book a little boring and very sarcastic in humour
B006LSZECO|1.0|I very much disliked the characters and I hated the ending.  I wouldn't waste my time or money on another book by this author.
1609611543|5.0|I am learning a lot about what is good for my system and what is not.<br />I am still reading it.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|Besides the cute guys, Natalie Portman was amazing!  It was a heartbreaking story - it makes your chest hurt so beware!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Engrossing epic series.  If this were a book, I'd call it a real page-turner.  I'm on my second time through the entire series, and will probably watch it all again before watching Season 4.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ran across yet . It really keeps the mind thinking and when your stuck it gives you well needed hints . Try it and I swear you 'll love it as well
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|It is a fun interactive game to play, and at least it's a challenge. They could put more creates down for more weapons. But all, and all it's a fun game to play.
0670022411|5.0|Very good book! I loved the story! i can not wait for the next books to come out! This is a wonderful read!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Entertaining, thought-provoking, I really enjoyed the book. Very detailed, descriptive passages that bring the reader into the life of a anorexic.
030789701X|5.0|The book was exactly what I was looking for. It was in great condition when it came in the mail and my boyfriend loves it and uses it all the time. I'd say it was the perfect gift for him.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|So much fun and lots to do on this game it's one of my favorite. I love the wild west look and so much more.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Hooks your interest in the opening pages and never let's you go. It flows so well that I read it all in one sitting. Gripping, terrifying, and unforgettable.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I've found that the characters have become increasingly hard to sympathize with since the 1st season. The Crawfords just seem entitled (which they are) and the staff is kind of stagnating in the same drama. I'm hoping it gets back on track in season 4.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is currently my favorite comedy series on broadcast television. This series has great writing that seems to keep getting better with each season. Big Bang Theory also has a great ensemble cast. The writers manage to balance out the scripts so that the focus is pretty well balanced between the ensemble cast which is also somewhat unusual.<br />A few of the actors were a little stiff and hadn't manage to fully flesh out their characters in seasons 1 and 2. From season 3 forward everything has operated with all cylinders firing in perfect sync. I have seasons 3, 4 and 5 in my collection and I am looking forward to buying season 6 for my collection.<br />I think it's essential to just be able to laugh and enjoy a good comedy. Thanks to seasons 3 through 5 in my current collection, plus being able to catch the reruns airing at 7:30 and 11pm in my area, I am able to enjoy comic relief. I highly recommend Big Bang Theory for seasons 3 through 6. Enjoy!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app is painfully slow and does not save images to a logical location. Actually I'm assuming it is saving them somewhere but I honestly haven't been able to find a directory with output files! Picsart, Retouch and others work much better. This one is a clunker.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|During the summer dry season of TV shows, this is a welcome relief. And no commercials, what could be better.
0449011917|2.0|I enjoy the books from this series. Although this book is my least favorite of the lot, my bad rating was mostly do to the CDs skipping and in some areas unreadable. Very annoying and disappointing. It only added to the boredom. The only bright side was I'm glad I did not actually attempt to read this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After all the buzz about the third season coming on, I decided to give it a whirl from the beginning. What a great original series. I found myself caught up on all episodes in only a matter of a weeks time. No I find myself waiting for season 4 and I have started watching it again and again. My wife thinks I'm crazy, but I will soon get her to break down and give it a go.
159463176X|3.0|I have to agree with the other raters.. I so looked forward to this book after \\"1000 splendid suns\\". It certainly had a promising and intriguing start.<br />Unfortunately the plot unravelled after half way and was disjointed.<br />As much as I kept waiting for all the various stories to tie together, this was lacking in the rather sudden and unsatisfactory ending.
B00338QENI|5.0|During a trip on the Civil Rghts Movements in Alabama I learned about this book. It was great and such an eye opener. I also just read an article in my local paper on the family and they finally have been put on a committee with say about who will get Henrietta cells. Wow awesome book.
B000002GVZ|5.0|Having been approximately the same age, the music has been very appealing to my husband.  It is smooth and helps reminisce.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We're real 'Thronies' so having this available whenever we need a fix is wonderful! I'm collecting first, second AND third seasons.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The Grandson enjoyed this movie.  They have a 3d tv so this was great for them.  Not many movies in 3 d
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Megan lost her brother Matt and comes to live at his place for a fresh<br />start.  There she meets the Jordan clan - Lacey and her brothers Iian<br />and Todd.  Megan and Todd come to like each other, but danger soon<br />looms in the form of Derek, Megan's violent ex-husband and her own<br />fears of a man controlling her again.  Can Todd and Megan work it out?<br />Worth a read.<br /><br />Typos<br /><br />Page 50, Location 577-78 - it should read 'Megan, it's Lacey', not its<br /><br />Page 140, Location 1661-62 - it should be asked, taking (not a space in between)<br /><br />Page 168, Location 1984 - there should be a period after Jordan<br /><br />Page 187, Location 2201 - should read Todd's chest
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Our Grandson loves Annie. He watches it over and over.  It does not have the violence of the movies of today.
B00669MFA2|3.0|It seems that this movie could have been part of the last one and they stretched both out to make more money. It was still okay though.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this program and I am very thankful for the resource provided especially since it is free of charge, thank you Farlex.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Wow. If u want a hidden object fix, this is it. Depending on how high u go level-wise, it can be an awesome workout for your eyes! :) I do think the only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is mainly due to how addicting it is becoming...and yep, it is not the cheapest of games as u progress....but hey u get good at it and the game throws u a bone on deals for upping your cache. Love this game, guys. Been looking for something like this for a LONG TIME! Big smiles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game it is like doing things with a real horse and this game is for people that love horse's
B007T7MIR0|1.0|I have to purchase an upgraded version for it to work. Free does nothing. Just wasted space. Very, very annoying.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much, I've read it like fifty time. Definitely get!!!! You will totally love this book
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free is the perfect little app to let you unwind from the daily curves of life. It's fun, entertaining, and challenges your problem solving skills. Enjoy and embrace!
0007520506|5.0|If you liked the Alchemist you will surely not be disappointed by this book.  A keeper. A treasure for sure.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Title says it all. When I got the upgrade, I was immediately confused. That was months ago. I'm still confused, so I use it less. But love T.W.C.
0374214913|5.0|This is an engaging read from the very first pages.  Although I read word for word, I stayed up for three nights until 2am (or 3am on the third night) to find out what happens.  I highly recommend this novel!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is the best app for Spider Solitaire...Tried a couple of others (free) too clunky on the 7 inch screen.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|Classic movie, had to get it when the bluray price dropped.  Will enjoy it for a long time to come.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Not happy with display image & style. Lucked out with trying another. This has a strange set up & on a small screen not good.
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|Good stuff most of it. Wish more of it had the same sound as their &#34;I like the remix&#34; song, but oh well, overall good CD
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Unfortunately I have to agree with the other 1 star reviewers.  There is no way to save the photos, even after manually putting in the path in the custom settings.  Tried the 2 default settings to no avail.<br /><br />Such a shame that a problem first reported over a year ago still hasn't been fixed, especially given the larger audience from a FAOD giveaway launch.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|This is a great movie .  You can tell the backgrounds or props are fake compared to today's standards.  All in all it is very entertaining.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is one of the best series on tv can't wait for the next season to be on tv.  Very good story line.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is the best game ever!!The only downside is you have to pay for the full version but it's totally worth it!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much harder then the first one but so much more fun the people who made this were very creative and it offers a much more challenging playing field
B006LSZECO|2.0|Very clever story.....to many dysfunctional characters.  Not my energy .I question the mind that creates this well written piece of craziness
B0032UYFA6|5.0|It was a great season Could have watched the entire cd in 1 sitting.  Can't wait to watch the next one
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The previous three were great and my expectations were lower with different lead for the fourth, but I was wrong.  Interesting intertwining of the previous in the series, but at the same time its own story that carried itself well enough.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Watched it in once weekend, it was great, love the characters coming into themselves.  Luckily I have a few more seasons to go.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is so fun its like your sitting at a table with your friends planting,and i also love how in to the game everyone gets!
B00E8B1358|2.0|It is what it is, a bunch of action and explosions and a story that really makes no sense. Sit back don't think and you might enjoy it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best Android keyboard app there is.  It is very accurate. Actually learns your personal dictionary per se,  I really like it.
1608871827|2.0|Maybe I am really harsh, but I was really looking forward to flipping through this glossy presentation. I have been very impressed by the work of Weta digital and workshop for the quality of concept art books they produce. However given the scope of Guillermo Del Toro's work on Pacific Rim - not much was given in terms of concept design. I was expecting a showcase of creative processes from sketch to the final clay model to the digital render. Instead the book was filled with bio's on the characters and screen shots from the films set. I don't know I guess I had something else in mind.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The editing is great and very easy to figure out but if it doesn't save to the camera roll it's useless to me.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Does what I need it to do, and more! Easily able to add a little something extra to any photo.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Nice to see these old guys together, much younger them me, but I just couldn't get into the story. Never finished the viewing. Maybe it's age or the fact that I can't do what I did. Hated it your my lase of youth.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I had never heard of it before last week.  I was a very good movie.  Recommended for everyone who likes Tommy Lee Jones.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game that my daughter and I both love to play! Great time waster. Love that you can customize the game to your age, more games should do that!!!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|We've watched it multiple times and it's still entertaining.<br /><br />The delivery via streaming is good, though I wish they would support at least 5.1 surround.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have had this on my phone for some time, but just found it available for my Kindle. LOVE it on here!
B0033806MI|1.0|this is waste of money, just ''interviews'' with the characters...and some on the go little stories, nothing special, nothing to make a book of...
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|It was such a good movie! I dont know how anyone could not have absoulutely loved it! IT was so sweet!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|grreat study on how to think before you answer any question or comment on a situation<br /><br />superb production and acting. lovely period piece. hooked to it and cant wait to see season 4!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I think it's good because it is in interacting with people  face book or no facex book also I didn't give it five is because you pay tickets rare things to play
1416550550|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. Lost of twists and turns. hard to put down.
B00503BN1M|5.0|very good i loved it a lot natalie portman is my favorite actor and yet again another fantastic movie by her
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I love to play this game. I wish I wasn't so busy so I could play it. But sometimes it won't let me in. That's my only complaint. You should totally get this game.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The game is vey fun and the rating I woulg give it is  a 4 and that it needs to be where u can play with your family members without logging into facebook
1781162646|5.0|Purchased as a gift, but hopefully the giftee will lend to the giftor. Stephen King-in my humble opinion-has never written a bad book. You may not like SK's writing, but he sure can tell a good story, and Amazon has them all. This one is a mystery and harkens back to the mystery writers of the 40s and 50s. It's a comfortable size as well, unlike some of his giant-size books. They work well on Kindles. If you like those good old mysteries, give this one a try.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have an account on it and I just started playing! I competed and started to get uncle hectors foal. So far I have completed around six competitions. You can find friends send gifts and play with the communities horses. I found it extremely addictive.<br />  I just love this game
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|I cannot believe you claim no ads.  . .lie!!! I cannot imagine why I paid for this app that gives so little when I had TWC for no expense. I must be getting stupid!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Speechless. It is awesome app for photo editing and now I can make memes so that is cool and the thing about it is I got it free for the day and it usually cost $5.00 so now I am very happy about that. I highly recommend this app for everyone young or old u should get it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the banter between Harvey and Mike.  It shows the brotherhood between the two and how much they are alike.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Purists will not enjoy the upgraded special effects but not only were they acceptable but far better than the original (looks cheap/cheesy in comparison). There are moments where the resolution does drop to the original broadcast quality but it's not a major annoyance. It does make the all-to-familiar episodes worth watching again.
B00CATSONE|4.0|he was a genius. it is too bad that everyone took advantage of him and took credit for his inventions. It is definitely not what i learned in history class!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The writing continues to be excellent (esp. the Dowager's lines - we are literally falling over with laughter at her snide remarks), as are all the performances.  Despite the heavily &#34;down&#34; tone to this season, we are glued to every episode. The costumes are fantastic (I want Lady Mary's wardrobe! BTW this is buster300's wife writing the review!) The stories touch upon numerous aspects of this historical period (Irish situation, women's burgeoning rights, class issues, etc.) to give the show breadth and interest. The humanity of all the characters is readily felt, so they are never simply good or evil (altho O'Brien may be the exception to that). I can't wait for Season 4!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I like this album even with it's slower pace it offers a lot to people looking for some good songs to mellow out to. Not really a dance album. unless your not a fast dance fan.
B00B97SNJI|3.0|At least 2 great songs, but most is moving away from the Americana roots... at least it seems that way to me. . A bit disappointing given all the hype about them lately.
B000WOXQDM|5.0|I bought this album on a road trip with some friends on tape and when I saw it in this format i had to have it. Well worth any one's time, weather your a pop fan or just like a good beat, you'll love this album.
B00122KV5O|5.0|A. M. Is a major talent whose work deserves appreciation. Very profound lyrics and a powerful voice to deliver them.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|I had never looked into this band before but was happy to find that this album has some very catchy beat and cool songs that stick with you. Some are a little slow but worth your time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I already own a LG tv with youtube and apps built in that could do the airplay like streaming to my TV.  Problem was that I wanted something else to plug into my older TV without spending a bundle on GoogleTV, Roku, etc.<br /><br />So i picked this up, and it shipped amazingly fast from Amazon.  Took it out of the box, plugged it into my HDMI, plugged into power, followed the steps on my Nexus 7, and it was up and working in close to no-time!  It pulled all of the data it needed to connect to my home network from my tablet, and once it was setup, it was flawless!<br /><br />Pros: Simple to use, all apps included work seamlessly.<br /><br />Cons: Lack of variety from apps.  If netflix wasn't included in the bundle, I'm not so sure it would have been a big hit.<br /><br />tl;dr - Great, cheap HDMI stick that streams Google Music, Google Play, and Netflix.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|this game is awesome. I liked it so much I bought everything that went with. my new favorite. get it.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Now this is a movie. Pacific Rim, movie where the acting wasn't all that great was hyped up more than this masterpiece. Great movie. Definitely will buy the blue-ray.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I, like others can't get the picture to save. It's a shame because this is a really great photo editing app. It could be the best in the world and be pointless without the save working. Tried on a nexus 4. I really hope the dev gets the issue fixed soon, I would love to use this.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Was a great summer reading book thanking god that one of my high school teachers actually have a personality. LoL
006178480X|5.0|James Rollins is the quinessential thriller writer and I eagerly anticipate each and every book her writes.  This was no exception, and it definitely liveed up to the hype I personally give the new book each year.  I have high expectations for what I expect Rollins to provide me during my reading experience, and he never ceases to live up to or exceed what I expect from him.  This book has everything from an end of the world possibility to magnetic-type implants on fingertips.  The stakes seem much higher in this book and the intensity never ceases.  Gray and his crew have a small timeframe to complete the mission and the ending is flawlessly written.  Sigma gains a new member.  He is very likeable and fits right into the already established set of characters.  I cannot wait to see what Mr. Rollins has in store for an encore.  The thrills are plenty here and I cannot imagine any thrill-seeker will find this book less than enjoyable.  If you are familiar with Rollins, you will love this newest Sigma installment.  If you aren't familiar with him, then you need to jump on board the Sigma bandwagon.  You don't know what you are missing.
B003P2WO5E|1.0|This book was terrible from the very beginning.  The author tries too hard to make up interesting new ways to tell the same exhausted story, and fails miserably.  I would not recommend this pile of garbage to the man who murdered my father.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|watched it on my kindlefire....now....i have to wait to find the next seasons...<br />This is another history and human nature lesson....( it will improve your manners, as well)
B00BP29SAA|5.0|We get all the Panda games. Daughter loves them, except the Panda Garage, she thinks that one is ok but not as fun as this one!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|hOW WONDERFUL IF MORE PEOPLE COULD AFFORD TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.  wHY DO YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFO WHEN i HAVE TOLD YOU HOW I FEEL???
B00D8RYV52|4.0|We got most all of the Panda games but this one was not as fun as the others. Our daughter loves the other ones we have, but she loses intrest more on this one. Not as many thing to do and the driving part has minimal things to do. Overall ok.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|An absolute buy for all Zimmer fans, One of my favorites from him. Movie was awesome as well, fits it perfectly!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The season was full of ups and downs, twists and turns and full of excitement.  I can't wait for next season to start! This is one drama my wife and I just love.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Overall a good show. This season was solid, but the later seasons are getting a little old in style and lack reality of the legal world.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I do not write reviews often. Call it laziness. This is an instance when my normal tendency to sit back has been overcome by a the amazing quality of this show. It starts and ends with the writing. The plot is as intricate, creative and sophisticated as any I have seen. If you think you're going to be stuck on Gilligan's Island in the 21st Century, think again. The characters are numerous and complex; point of view is dynamic; the setting is elastic, changeable and always fresh. Throw in excellent acting and crisp cinematography, and you have a minor masterpiece. This one is not to be missed!
B00CATSONE|4.0|A very good book. Learned a lot of facts. I had no idea to his struggles. A truly great man.
B003UESJJC|5.0|I'm a bit surprised with how well the transfer to Blu Ray worked out, considering how the negatives were probably treated over the years.  I just watched the original version (NOT redux) last night and it looked great.  I could almost smell the napalm...
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Fantastic show - love the interaction between Mike and Harvey.  Great set of characters and actors.  Can't wait til season 3 is available on Prime.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I see a LOT of recent reviews complaining that due to this being the UK version, it doesn't work on Playstation 3s.  I had no problems with mine.  Admittedly, I feel like the visual quality isn't quite as crisp as Planet Earth was.  I'm not sure why- it just feels like a slight downgrade in the HD.  Not a big deal however it still looks fantastic.<br /><br />So, long story short, not ALL of the David Attenborough versions don't support the PS3.  Mine works, even though some others don't.  May have something to do with the seller, not sure.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Well, i really like the song, is \\"innovator\\" in my opinion, Gaga i really good making music, is a good back to her, u dont wanna stop to listen! Its really god!
B001CDLATE|5.0|I first say this film over ten years ago in high school.  My match teacher showed it to us because a friend had made the film, and he found it to be powerful enough to share despite it not being related to math in any obvious way.  It's filled with breathtaking vistas, shots of ancient cultures and rituals (Whirling Dervishes, anyone?), and intimate looks at some of our modern marvels' darker sides (that chicken factory scene is still disturbing to this day).<br /><br />When I saw it had been remastered for Blu Ray I had to have it.  Five stars.
B005LAIGTG|5.0|Great acting, good story line, and very interesting. Plus Channing Tatum is the lead character- how could you go wrong?! Love it!
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Excellent live recordings of Soundgarden and Audioslave's frontman: Chris Cornell.  I just discovered something the other day as well: if you have Amazon Prime there is an AutoRip version in the Amazon Cloud Player.  On that version, there is an EXTRA TRACK that's not on the CD.  I Downloaded it and dropped it into iTunes so it's part of the entire album now in my collection.  I didn't realize that Amazon ever did this, releasing a special \\"Amazon Prime Limited Edition\\" or something like that (I don't remember exactly how it was labelled when I first imported it into iTunes but it had extra language appended to the album title).  Now I have to go through the Amazon Cloud Player and see if there are any more gems I missed.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Oldie, but so.good.  What a great artist - love the lyrics and so enjoy her composition. What an original artist.
B00007E8V4|5.0|One of my favorite System of a Down albums.  Not sure why I didn't buy it years ago!  I was going through my collection and realized that I somehow only had a couple tracks from this album and not the whole thing, so I bought my own copy.  I don't regret it!
B009NQZVKG|3.0|This is my first James Rollins novel and I found it somewhat disappointing. The premise is historically interesting - unfortunately much of the written detail is not.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love this game only thing is you need to have interbnet to play still a great game keep it up I still need more diamond's
0756655307|5.0|My husband is a superhero super fan. Some when I saw the updated and expanded edition I knew he had to have it.
B000002GYW|5.0|I've recently &#34;recycled&#34; this into my listening rotation and realized how awesome the music on this CD is! The songs on Desperado collectively are perhaps just as good now, perhaps even better,than when the album orginally came out (at the time expectations were different), the sound is tremendous!
B004G6TD66|5.0|Classic ELP - some of their best work in my humble opinion.<br />Found reasonable priced and shipped free on Amazon.<br />Great sound quality.<br />Great band and performers.<br />Imagination, humor and talent all magically entwine with 3 talented individuals.<br />Miss them.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|tTo save image somewhere you can find it: After you hit the save icon (the anachronistic floppy disk on the right side), you are presented with a list of resolutions you can choose from. The last option is &quot;custom&quot; - select that, and the bottom option is &quot;Location:&quot;. Select that and choose &quot;camera roll&quot; (or whatever you want). Then pictures will be saved.<br /><br />That being said, this is an ok program. The editing works, a bit fussy for my taste, but you can do all the basic editing you would need. I was only really impressed with the sharpen function which works better than with many basic phone photo apps.<br /><br />With the wide availability of apps that will both take a picture and let you edit AND  share them, this app feels dated. Personally, I paid for Vignette, an app that will take, edit and share. In my opinion, Vignette has produced the best results from my phone's camera.
B000002LSV|4.0|Assortment of music on CD was OK.  Sound quality was sorely lacking.<br />Nice to find while browsing traveling CD's on Amazon...yep, I'm still doing the CD thing...<br />Anyway enjoy the tunes and sing really loudly to cover for the sound quality - no one will care...it's like Cheap Sun Glasses, we all love 'em...
B007FO5PYK|5.0|A great movie for the man or woman who has ever been in military or in now....I served and saw many memories of my life in the army...Thanks
B000002GLV|5.0|Early, earthy John Mayall purchased through Amazon.<br />I purchased the CD to replace my sadly worn out LP purchased in the early 70's.<br />Great blues by one of the masters.<br />Enjoy!!
1575666286|5.0|I loved this book, as well as the documentaries online.  Healthy living is the way to go.  I recommend this book.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This is a wonderful musical directed by Tim Burton, with J. Depp in the leading role.  That should tell you a lot in itself.<br />Helena Bonham Carter does an excellent job carrying a leading and difficult role.<br />Great morbidly humorous story line,  excellent casting.  I have actually purchased the soundtrack also.  Both via Amazon.<br />My grand daughter and I sang with it just about the 9 hour trip back from vacation.<br />Great entertainment!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|After all the hype, I decided to read Gone Girl... It took me months of short reading sessions that didn't quite pull me in, but i didn't want to give up on the book, and then BAM,  it all started coming together and I couldn't put it down.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Something has to give, make Candy Crush available for the Kindle already!!!! And why put a Candy Crush help guide, when it's not even available. Have some common sense!!!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Remotely accessing and controlling couldn't have been made easier. Adding the &#34;everywhere addon&#34; just made it far more accessible to others needing help without having to be tethered to home network. Simple setup, settings and controls.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good Show To Watch As A Family. Great Imagination Put Into It. Makes You Wonder About Our Government And Life In General.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  The story was very original and well written.  The fact that the dog was telling the story from his point of view was very brilliant and entertaining.  It had funny moments and sad moments but ended with a happy note.  Hard to put the book down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's like subway surfers and temple run two but way better is anybody like those two games that I mentioned you will love this game
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Well, no more hating on McConaughey. He has become a really good actor. &#34;Mud&#34; and &#34;Killer Joe&#34;, show the actor has some real talent. I am a believer.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This is a fabulous work in which Paul McCartney collaborates with some of the greatest musicians and feels our nostalgia.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I held out on getting a PS3 as I HATE the tiny little Sony controller. I got rid of my Xbox and got my PS3 as I hated Xbox live even more ;\<br /><br />ordered this on a whim and SOOO glad I did. the controller is SO much more comfortable than the Sony's and even better than the Xbox's as the rubber textured grips are comfortable and let air flow so I don't get the sweaty palms I used to from the flat smooth plastic.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Updated review from \\"Broken + Free = Trash!\\":<br /><br />As of today (8/17/13), version 2.91.1 of esDot Development Studio's PicShop is now available for download at the Amazon AppStore.<br /><br />In my previous review, I expressed surprise that PicShop was being offered as the free app of the day, yet again. I also pointed out the numerous times customers have \\"reached out\\" for help, assistance, and/or any type of definitive follow up from either the developer or Amazon [having done so personally (contacted both)], but unfortunately with no response from the developer, and no resolution from Amazon.<br /><br />The app itself had once been a fine photo editing solution when Gingerbread was the current Android OS. However, as the top rated displayed review by Kiffany Bethel describes quite well, it didn't save your progress or images any longer.<br /><br />My observation suggested that the app needed to be updated (recoded) to properly recognize the OS file paths that are available. Even if you manually typed in correctly the file path you wished to save your image(s) to, the app did not save, nor execute the action. This had been a long standing issue, and based on other user reviews, in my opinion, should not be continued to be offered until given proper attention. I also stated that I believe an apology was in order.<br /><br />Although the app itself has been updated, and seemingly works properly as it once did long ago (based on my limited revisit of the app, currently), much more is yet to be done on the part of the developer.<br /><br />Aside from any pending bugs or enhancements waiting to be discovered, the main focus for the developer should probably be to update the screenshots of the app from version 1.0 to the current, but also the product description itself. Is $4.99 half of its usual price, etc.?<br /><br />It would seem that despite all, esDot Development Studio's next achievement would be to concentrate it's efforts in the public relations arena togain back the confidence and/or trust that it once had with it's customer base that has suffered for so long without even a hint of interest in who made them what they are. A simple message asking for the customers' patience while the developer was experiencing whatever scenario that prevented today's update from being any sooner, would have surely been accepted by most. After all, the app's Support section states: \\"Tell us what you don't like, and we'll fix it. Simple as that!\\".
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Great Program, But Pics Won't Save. Fun To Play With, But If You Can't Save The Edits, Then What's The Point?
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'm new to Audible and haven't been very enthusiastic.  This book is wonderful--- happy, sad, funny--it's great, but the narration is absolutely fantastic.  It makes the story come alive in every way.  I didn't realize how important a narrator was.  No wonder I wasn't enthusiastic.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is amazing. If you are considering getting this book because you watched the show on HBO, stop considering and get it. It's like rewatching the show with deleted footage, more detail, and better character development. If you haven't yet seen the show on HBO, and you love fantasy and great story telling, get this book now and you can consider watching the show later.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing. Its reminds me of playing Subway Surfers mixed in with Temple Run 2 but with the awesome despicable me 2 movie theme. I play this game all the time and my brother and I love to try and beat each other's high score.  It's incredibly addicting and hard to put down. TOTALLY LOVE THIS GAME.  AND YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GET IT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Cannot believe I didn't discover this show sooner.  Love it and thoroughly enjoyed binge watching both seasons!  Highly recommend it.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|So far enjoying this game. It has a variety to choose from and easy to understand how to play it. Better than paper books.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Have downloaded for use on a Samsung Galaxy Tab. Poor performance and fails to upgrade.<br />iOS version is fine on my iPad.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|I didn't like this game.  It seemed not very exciting. Could be just me ...I like games and puzzles...just didn't like this one.
1451626096|5.0|If you are a fan of Philippa Gregory or similar writers, you would not be disappointed in any of her work.  This meets all expectations.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|FUN GAME. SOME ARE EASY AND OTHERS ARE HARDER. YOU CAN'T PASS IF YOU GET STUCK.  THIS IS AN ADDICTING GAME FOR SURE.
B005HIEFC4|5.0|This is a great item that we enjoy all the time, thanks for the great deal. i would definitely buy from again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a huge fan of the walking dead! My husband and I couldnt wait till the release of DVD that we preordered the 3rd season! Love love love! !
B005OOL1IC|5.0|This is a great item that we enjoy all the time, thanks for the great deal. i would definitely buy from again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another typical tour-deforce in character development and suspense by Mr. King. Sorry to see it end (which is saying something when a book has this many pages...:) )
B00AQTY3XA|3.0|All my family enjoyed the film, picture image perfect BUT i could not get into the extras on three different machines. May be it is because live in the UK. Movie good disc a bit of a let down.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Won't save to s3 gallery so what is the point of this application??! Very disappointing to download, edit a pic for absolutely nothing.
B00C2IJJLO|4.0|As i have been an admirer when released in the cinema i had to upgrade from tape/ laser/ dvd. More fool me BUT i am more then happy with blu ray but please do not bring it out again in any other format!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I am really impressed with this app. There are a lot of apps that will do these sorts of photo edits, but none that are any easier to use. The image quality was excellent and the speed (even on my first gen Galaxy Tab 10.1) was blazing.<br />I can't speak to the file not saving as I've only just begun to use it and it worked well.
1609611543|5.0|I purchased three. I read one and underlined it and then a friend saw it and wanted one.  So I gave him my copy.  Soon, I purchased a second and repeated the process.  Three times!  Currently I do not have one.  But it is easy to read.  Full of simple research, even the food is good.  I absolutely love the cake and the creative cauliflower/rice recipe.  So, I bought the cookbook.  Excellent, too.  Great for lo=carbing, too.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game, but since your asking the game could use more then three levels. But fun all around. Would suggest for those bored days.
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|If you like classic Suede, there's no reason not to check this out.  It's all there.  Granted, the first half is better than the first but check it out.  If you are uninitiated, start with the self-titled record or Dog Man star...maybe even Coming Up.  but avoid Head Music and A New Morning because thy just lack the energy and songwriting of their earlier records.  This gets it back though, and it largely nails it.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I read like crazy... i read everything.... Every once in a while I like to read the junk food as I call it. Something simple and girly and easy. It's just easy fun reading. So yeah good book.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Produced pop music with a dark edge and a unique voice, there really isn't much to add.  Off to the Races and Video Games are stand out tracks.
B000001E3V|5.0|Folks, I'm going to say something about Eric Clapton.  He did not play his best when he was the Leader.  Eric Clapton played his best stuff in Cream, Blind Faith, and Derek and the Dominos.  In those groups he was the guitar player.  A great guitar player, but a guitar player.  He was part of a band.  As a result I had avoided Raibow Bridge because I thought that without Duane Allman it could not be good.  But folks, I was wrong.  This double cd is the same concert as Rainbow Bridge, but with more songs from the Clapton/Domino songbook.  AND, its GREAT.  Eric Clapton IS great, but for some reason he only really proved it as the guitar player of a band.  This album, Derek and the Dominos &#34;Live at the Fillmore&#34;  rocks,  cooks,  and the musicianship is tight.  Jim Gordon was a great drummer.  Bobby Whitlocks vocals and keyboards rise to Clapton.  Yea, Duane would have been perfect, but as this album stands, it is a truly complimentry addition to the lone Domino cd, Layla.  Thanks.  Johnny P
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is a game that will have you thinking out of the box. Great graphics and challenging puzzles. I look forward to solving the next release.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a fantastic game.  Fun to play and  after 4 months of playing, this is still my favorite game.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|DON'T GET APP!!. The game froze my phone and would shut it off several times a day.  Purchased add ons while playing, game kept stalling and re-directing me. Had customer service contact me 48 hrs after I contacted them twice trying to get my purchase.  It's been OVER A WEEK & 8 EMAILS BACK AND FORTH WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE: NEVER GOT MY MONEY I PAID FOR ON HERE!!!!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love this version of Emma.  Great acting, beautiful movie.  Item came sooner than expected which was great.  I definitely recommend this movie.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|If you liked \\"something Borrowed\\" you will love this!! I laughed, I cried, I had a hard time putting it down.  I have read it twice now!
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Oblivion turned out to be a pretty good movie, a lot better than some of the critics gave it credit for.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I'm not crazy about the verses, but i do go insane for the bridge and chorus!!! I live for the Applause, Applause, Applause! I live for the Applause, plause, Live for the Applause plause, Live for the!
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Great acting. No melodramatic characters.  Interesting story.  I finished watching Fringe and Lost.  I needed a new fix.  This and<br />Sherlock are doing  well for now.  Nothing will ever be as good as Fringe,
1419705644|5.0|I got this as a gift for my sister and she loves it. It has almost everyone in Ooo in it.
1847879071|5.0|SPSS using normal jargon...and not lacking humor. Wonderful.  Best textbook I bought all year.  Used for Intro to Quantitative as well as advanced.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addictive and fun. I just can't get enough of this game. More fun than Subway Surfers and I love Subway Surfers.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It made me laugh and cry. This is a wonderful and quirky little movie that every mom both current and soon to be will love and appreciate.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Awesome app I love it so much it is so awesomely awesomeness and the great app is awesome happened to play app
B004DLPXAO|1.0|BEWARE...was a great app until they updated.  It crashes every time and it is junk now.  Also, they want you to log into the amazon app store.  If I wanted to log in, I wouldn't be using the andriod app.  That's what the internet if for.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Finding Pride was a good and easy read.  Waiting to read the next book in this series by Jill Sanders.
B00BHSEKAK|4.0|MATERIAL IS OF GOOD QUALITY.  IT FITS MY CAMERA PERFECTLY AND ALLOWS ME TO TAKE IT ON ALL MY TRAVELS WITH THE MINIMUM OF EFFORT.
B005WBBYXO|4.0|The first book did not end as well as the movie.  But then again.  When does a movie follow a book anyway? It was a good omnibus anyway.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Intuitive app.  Let's you try tons of options to personalize your pics.  Borders, tone sharpening, image overlays.<br />The big flaw is that you can't do anything with them.  Want to save the end result to your phone?  Good luck with that.  Want to upload your pick to Facebook?  No, that's not going to happen either.<br />Sounds like this is a problem common to the majority of users, but the developers aren't fixing it so why give them $?
B000HKYOK0|4.0|I was a very early Trekkie, like when the series just started.  Makes it fun to watch the plots, 40 years (?) later with lots of other polished Trekkie in between times.  Just plain fun.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|RE: DVD + Digital Copy + UltravViolet version<br />  Worst plot, dialog, and acting I've ever witnessed from each \\"superstar\\" in this flick, with the possible exception of J-CVD. He actually made me completely forget all his previous \\"muscles from brussels\\" good-guy roles by playing the uber-villain in this one so convincingly. And that surprised me, having read about how thin and out-of-shape Sly found him prior to filming. He *was* much thinner, but then that happens to even the best of bodies as they age. Or they turn to flubber. Except, of course, for Mr. Stallone. But J-C still \\"has it\\". Just not as big.<br /><br />  As for the rest? Arnold, Jet, Liam, Dolph, Randy, and Bruce were as dead as could be imagined. As if they'd all just been handed their scripts, then played their parts with prompter boards, and each was filmed in their first and only take, in a single afternoon. The \\"subtle\\" nods toward each \\"hero's\\" prior work came across as completely un-natural. It took away from rather than added to the atmosphere.<br /><br />  Terry tried his usual low-brow humor with its usual un-funniness. Jason was ok, but his action scenes were too over-the-top to be considered remotely possible. Chuck should have stayed home. Maybe he did, and they merely green-screened his parts into the film. Maybe I've been watching too much \\"Walker: Texas Ranger\\"... high hopes.<br /><br />  The only fairly decent acting, not surprising considering it was his project, was from Sly. And I have no idea how he gets his body into shape like that. If only his face had withstood the test of time.<br /><br />  I'm just mad I paid a ten-spot at Target for it, thinking this had to be great. Those who like films with thousands of trained assassins shooting a barrage of bullets at Stallone and his ten closest friends, who, armed only with six-shooters are able to not only dodge all those bullets, but to shoot every one of the bad guys while they're at it, should like this one. The rest should look for something better.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I just loved it! Every bit as page-turning and surrealistic, as I'd grown to expect from Murakami. If you've like Murakami before, you'll definitely like this one.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|As others have mentioned, you can edit images like no other app.  BUT,  it's of no use if your changes can't be saved!  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because of the potential once this most basic function of saving is fixed.  Also, please allow the user to choose the save location or at least allow one to change the default save location.  Once fixed, this app will deserve 4-5 stars.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like it Its a pretty cool game but hard I wish it was easier to use but its fun
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Tender and funny... made me laugh and cry!!!  Awesome!!!  This is a great movie for kids and adults!!!  Great voice over actors.
0785162348|5.0|To see more pictures from the book, please visit my blog via my Amazon profile link.<br /><br />The book is packed full of great concept art, covering everything from the primary characters, set, mecha and weapon designs, posters, marketing materials and more; content wise its pretty comprehensive.<br /><br />Those who enjoyed the film and want to delve deeper into the art and making of the movie will find a lot to like. Highly recommended.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I literally binge-read this book. Paolini weaves a rich tapestry of images, and blazing action. This book is hardly finished and I'm diving into the final chronicle.
1781161097|5.0|To see more pictures from the book, please visit my blog via my Amazon profile link.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's much anticipated Prometheus may not have been the film that all Alien fans were hoping it'll be, but I don't think there is any argument about how visually stunning the movie is. This book goes behind the scenes and explores the art and making of the film, from concept art to set, costume, creature and mecha design; the works.<br /><br />Fans and artists alike should pick this one up for the wealth of materials it offers on the art and making of the film.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|If you liked the West Wing you'll love this.  Kevin Spacey is so charming and dispicable at the same time and Robin Wright is terrific.  There's intrigue and drama and sadly it's all very believeable.
1401227821|5.0|To see more pictures from the book, please visit my blog via my Amazon profile link.<br /><br />I've had my eyes on this book for quite some time now and finally bit the bullet and ordered it recently. Worth every penny, I should say.<br /><br />I've been wondering what is the special ingredient in Adam Hughes art work that make it stand out when viewed across an entire shelf of comic covers. Perhaps there isn't any single defining quality but I've always found the eye contact of his subjects particularly engaging and really captures my attention.<br /><br />I also like the way he uses bold outlines for the characters, an influence from the legendary Art Nouveau artist Alphonse Mucha.
0061992860|5.0|Very small book, great to put in a bag and is filled with lots of instructions and tips on survival.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Funny for adults and children! The little yellow guys are cute and funny.<br />Not much more to say. :)<br />Great!
1401224792|5.0|While I'm not super sure when this story takes place within the series. I do know that this is a really good read for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the comic
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Best show out there! The blu-ray combo is perfect! :)  The show is amazing and addicting.  First season is awesome!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Best Sci-Fi I've seen in years, maybe ever!  This one is original, not just a copy of someone else's premise.  Avatar was of this sort. I'm a fan of Sci-Fi, have been since I was a little boy, but I'm not impressed with only special effects, though this movie has plenty of stunning S.E., the story is so compelling that I had to watch it twice to pick it all up... and I plan on watching it again.  this is a good one.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|this game is fun for my grandaughter and myself to play.  Have spent many hours together enjoying this game.She loves it.  She is 7 and much better at this game than I am!
0316044695|5.0|This will be a short review.I believe Marcus Luttrell  has to the best of his knowledge and memory  told the true story of Operation Red Wing and Seal Team 10.The book is a very inspirational account of the Navy Seal culture and courage and sacrifice made under the worst  conditions imaginable.I believe many of Luttrell's detractors panned this book because they do not share his political slant.I can't wait to see the soon to be released movie.
0307341550|1.0|Listened to this as an audiobook. It was slow. Too repetitive in developing the characters, especially the main character. Okay we get it she cuts herself. But why do you need to tell us that over and over and over again? Just not enough plot to carry the characters and pacing. Her editor must have told her the book had to be n number of words, so she started with a plot and events then just filled in repetitive character details to make the number. The shocking twist at the end was not very believable. And I'm not a puritan, but it was just too gratuitous with graphic and repugnant details, with no point except shock value. Don't waste your time or money reading this one. Her book Gone Girl was much better.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|The application has great effects, but will not save any projects. Has all this useless Facebook integration, how about you let me SAVE my photo to the device and THEN I will share it to Facebook if I so please. It's absolutely ridiculous that a photo editing app will not successfully save a project. Fix and rating would be much better.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Always a must watch for me and the family. A great movie for almost all ages. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The kids like the pirate mystery:)
B00CATSONE|5.0|Truly enjoyed reading this book as it speaks loudly and is motivating in a sense of human individual development. I am inspired to share its passages!
0007466706|5.0|This is the second book in The Selection series, and it's so amazing!  I adored the tension between Aspen, America, and Maxon.  I had a hard time choosing which male I wanted her to end up with, and I think that's amazing for a novel!<br /><br />It will keep you up all night reading!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Really nothing more to say than that this is by far the best show I've ever watched. It has everything and is unpredictable. Love it!
B00CATSONE|4.0|What an inspiring book, well written and completly not what I was expecting, more a motivational book with a self help angle with Tesla as a good example.  Tesla made some amazing achievements and brought the world into the 20th century.  My only dislike was the hard sell at the end of the book for the actual self help book.  But hay if thats your thing go for it, you will not be dissapointed.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|This is a very cool book. I recommend to any mythology fan. I hope to read the rest of the series soon.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|Thank you!  I'm still a cd fan.  Play it in my car all the time. :)  It's great.  I love how you have to keep writin though for this to take reviews.  geeeezz...  socialism, creeping in.
B009ZM76J2|4.0|This was a very interesting movie. Quality was very good and no problems in play back. Learn something new about Australia
B000003CMC|5.0|This was my partner's favorite album that he only had as a cassette.  He really wanted a CD (we're tech resistant), so this was a terrific birthday present.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a really great and fun game and I love it so much because I have always wanted to ha e a horse and now I know how it feels to really have one
1451695187|2.0|My wife got this and she didn't read much as she got bored in the first few pages. She's not an avid book reader mind you so take it for what you will. She is more into magazines with short articles that are informative information type of things.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|Been a Noctua advocate for about 5 years now.  Wont use anything else if I depend on it.  I switch out all of my case fans with these cool blasting beauties, as well as, using their CPU fans/ heatsinks.  I consistently get as good or better cooling as my buddies using middle of the road liquid cooling systems (of similar price point), but they are ohhhh soooo reliable.  Can't say the same for my friends liquid pumps and fans :)  Overclocking or not - these are my go to fans!  3 of these are now keeping my Haswell system in the low 50's under heavy load inside a Corsair Vengeance Series C70 case.
B0035TMUTM|5.0|Love to put this on a loop during the day or when reading. Best Enigma collection out there!  Word word word word.... These rules are stupid
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Every other game will at least renew your token the following day or with in an hour. I played 11p.m Sunday night  and ran out  of tokens. The following day at 2 p.m Monday  I still had no tokens.I ONLY got tokens from the scratch off. I'll play this game every blue moon I'm not wasting any money on tokens
B007ZXK08C|5.0|My sister recommended this as a great read.  She wasn't exaggerating.  This book is a winner.  The writing is flawless.  It's a slightly slow starter, but once you get going, this is a page turner.  It's been hailed by mid to high-brow readers and the only thing I cannot understand, is the low-star rating given by some of the reviewers.  This author is going to soar.  Excellent!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters are complex, the plots are interdependent and the history adds tremendous richness.  We need to have more programs/series like this that are on a more intelligent and stimulating level.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i think this is the best game you gan get for android devices even though theres not redstone.<br />also im on kindle fire and i know how you get 0.7.0<br />you have to download the google play store then you buy it from there(its easy to get but its hard to find on the internet.)
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|It's so nice to see a movie that is about people caring about each other rather than cheating, shooting and having sex.
B007SGM084|5.0|More then I bargained for. Wiil open your eyes to another world quick. I would read it again at some point.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is really fun, I love it. But it has a tendency to freeze in the middle of a game
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great game to play. Lots of fun but it sucks waiting for more tokens....especially if you don't want to pay money. Great game overall.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|We have no children at home, but my husband and I really loved the movie.  It has some interesting messages and was very well done with good character development for a cartoon.  I highly recommend it.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|So I started reading the first book and actually lost interest because it was so boring.  The 2nd book was better but there are so many chapters where people are just sitting there talking to each other and I get that plotlines have to be advanced but it just seems that most of these books are people sitting around talking about what they're going to be doing and it's also hard to follow who is who.  I read every day on my lunch break at work and I like fantasy as well as sci-fi, some of my favorite authors are Terry Brooks, Kevin J. Anderson, and I do like The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher too.<br /><br />The thing about the books by the above authors is they have dialogue without it being boring and the action sequences in their books always keep me on the edge of my seat.  I bought the 4 book series of Game of Thrones after I looked at a few reviews and as I started reading the first book, I got bored and actually abandoned it and had to come back and force myself to finish it.  I do like the twists and turns that the plot has with people dying unexpectedly and my favorite characters are probably the Starks.  With that being said though, if you like more action and less dialogue go for something else, you can read 5 chapters in these books without someone swinging a sword.  Not a lot of magic use either which is something I always like to see.<br /><br />I actually wrote a book myself and posted it on Amazon earlier this year.  It has not gotten any reviews yet so please download it and rate it!  It's a short book, only 165 pages so it won't take up too much of your time.  Please see the link below to get to it.  It's called \\"A New Beginning (Journey Among the Stars) by Adam Frandsen.  Please share your feedback and help me get to 5 stars!!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BVOLC7Y A New Beginning (Journey Among the Stars)]]
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's so refreshing to read a SF book that has a concept that is not a rehash of a familiar one I've already read.  This one is a great read that has me excited about the next book before I am even halfway through the first one.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book and I found it even better and fun to read. It has it's twists and turns that make it such a great book to read. Ciao!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case works exactly as described.  It fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly and allows me to watch videos at multiple angles.  I BOUGHT one for my wife too!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|like this game. the puzzles are not super easy or hard. makes it enjoyable and fun to play. want to see a lot more floors.
B0090SI582|3.0|We like Wolverine. Apparently we really like him; \\"The Wolverine\\" is the sixth movie in which Hugh Jackman's played the character, which was created in 1974 by Len Wein and John Romita, Sr. (He was originally an enemy of the Hulk.) To understand why we like him so much, I think it's helpful to think back to 1974. America had just lost the war in Vietnam, thanks to the politicians despite winning all the battles (whether or not this is factually true, it was the general zeitgeist of the time.) We'd just found out our President was a crook, and forced him to resign. A lot of Americans had a lot of rage, a problem with authority, a hard time trusting anybody, but also a deep thirst for justice and revenge. We'd stopped believing the system was ever going to deliver it for us, and were ready to get it any way possible. We felt powerful, cheated, and pissed, and somebody needed to pay.<br /><br />As Wolverine's popularity skyrocketed in the comic books, Clint Eastwood became one of the most popular stars in Hollywood playing a brooding cop with a big gun who always got the bad guy but had a hard time playing by the rules. There's a lot of Dirty Harry in Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, and I'm still waiting for the movie that introduces Eastwood as Logan's long lost father.<br /><br />\\"The Wolverine\\" picks up where \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" left off, which is a bit of a stumble, because that movie was made 7 years ago and there have been two X-Men films since then. It took me a while to recapture the storyline: Logan killed Jean Grey, the woman he loved, because her alternate personality the Phoenix, was taking over and destroying everyone and everything around her.<br /><br />Wolverine has fled to somewhere very wooded and become Grizzly Adams. He is haunted by dreams of Jean Grey, and promises never to hurt anyone again ever, a promise he keeps for about five minutes, until someone hurts one of his ursine friends. While he is beating up rednecks, a pink-haired Japaneseninja girl (Rila Fukushima) finds him and begs him to come to Tokyo, where a man he once saved is dying, and wants to say goodbye.<br /><br />Logan agrees, and somehow never suspects that the man he is going to see-- billionaire tech giant Yashida, played by Haruhiko Yamanouchi -- might have an ulterior motive for bringing him across the ocean. Logan gets embroiled in a complicated, nearly incoherent family controversy, wherein the Yakuza are trying to assassinate the old man's granddaughter, except maybe they're hired by the pretty girl's father, who's mad that he's not mentioned in the old man's will, except maybe not, because there's also a playboy fianc&eacute;e with political ambitions and a jilted boyfriend with lots of ninja friends, and maybe the old man's not quite as dead as he appears.<br />I don't know if it all makes sense. I don't feel like wasting the brainpower it would take to untangle it all and see if it makes sense. What it all boils down to is that Logan is going to protect the pretty granddaughter (Tao Okamota) because she's pretty and vulnerable and likes to kiss him. And a lot of people want to kill her, some with guns and some with swords and some with poison-tipped arrows, and it's not all that important who sent them, or why.<br /><br />\\"The Wolverine's\\" convoluted plot, as well as an airless, joyless third act where everything is explained but nothing makes sense, are the film's weaknesses. But it has plenty of strengths. The film is strong on atmosphere and aesthetics, and director James Mangold knows how to make the most of his Japanese settings. It's packed to the brim with exciting action sequences, including one aboard a bullet train sequence bears more than a passing resemblance to the space suit action sequence in \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness.\\" I don't say that to disrespect it; these two are probably the best two action sequences in movies this summer.<br /><br />This is as much a samurai film as a superhero film, and that's pretty cool. Svetlana Khodchenkova has a lot of fun playing sexy villainess Viper, who likes to wear green, scaly tight-fitting things and kills people by kissing them with her acidic, forked tongue. She's not really given enough to do and her death is anticlimactic, but the Russian actress makes the most of what the script and the screen time give her.<br /><br />Also, she has the unexplained ability to take away Wolverine's healing factor, rendering him killable. The script makes the most of this, and Jackman's meets them halfway; the result is a protagonist who isn't invulnerable (like Superman and Thor,) but seems genuinely surprised by how much being hurt, well, hurts. Logan briefly contemplates letting himself be killed, so that he can join Jean Grey (and the countless other people he's watched die over his 200-year lifespan) in the afterlife. But there's the ing&eacute;nue to save from the bad guys. Sigh... seems like there's always an ing&eacute;nue to save from the bad guys. Superheroes never get a chance to spend quality time with their loved ones, dead or alive. It's a tough life.<br /><br />I wonder if, as an audience, we'll ever grow tired of Wolverine. 1974 was a long time ago, and it's been a while since we nearly impeached a president or lost a war. I suppose there's always plenty to be angry about, but successful, entertaining and even humorous movies featuring more brightly colored, optimistic superheroes - guys like Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - make me think the age of the dark, angsty protagonist may finally be coming to an end. There's another X-Men movie in the works (make sure to stick through the credits to see the teaser for \\"Days of Future Past\\") but maybe after that, Jackman can hang up the claws once and for all. I've enjoyed the Wolverine movies -- most of them -- but don't really feel like I need any more of them.
B00CLT31D6|3.0|I thought that by buying the latest version the information would be updated to at least 2010 values. The concepts are relevant but the stats are from 2 decades ago.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|We have seen the play recently, and when I saw this CD on Amazon, I decided to surprise her with it, and she plays it all the time, both at home and in her car. Best buy I have made  in a long time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I enjoy game time because of this game. It's a very fun game that we can't wait for the video release.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As the title hints, this is an incredibly good story! I learned so much about the era, the pilots (both American and German), the sentiment in Germany before and during the war. A very humanizing slice of history.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|I love this movie. It streams with no problems good sound and great picture. No buffering no lag. I would recommend.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|My only criticism is the jumping from one time period to another and the telling of the story from the grandmother to the granddaughter.  I don't know how the book could have been written any other way and as long as you pay attention to the dates at the beginning of each chapter it really does not matter.  I loved the suspense, the drama, and the history.  Fantastic book for everyone.
B003THHIEM|3.0|Fun little show with a likable cast and story lines that are entertaining. The type of program that lets you escape from the daily grind.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved the characters.  I think it would be a good read for young people to understand some of the things that happened in WWII.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|An intelligent police drama with excellent acting and and with a top notch cast. It will keep you involved from beginning to end.
B00ACP3OOM|3.0|You have to create a mp3 version of all your songs in itunes or the finis player wont work... so its not fully compatible as it says in the box...
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Initially looked like fun, but the download file and installation was either too big or otherwise would not operate on my Android tablet.
B00E9HML1Q|4.0|I obtained the statue versions of the extended DVD's for the Lord of the Rings trilogy when each of them came out and the statues are absolutely amazing.  Unfortunately there appears to be an issue with this release in that it appears that it is only part of a set offered by Amazon.com and not Amazon.UK, meaning that the region of the Blu-rays are only playable in North America.  Considering that the movie itself was made in New Zealand and Weta is also based in New Zealand, I think it very bad form that the same set is not available through Amazon UK so that others around the world can also obtain it, including those that live in the very country where the movie and statue was made.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I've played a number of these games and this is definitely one of the best. G5 games in general are great! Even tho' I'm presently just playing the free demo of this I thoroughly plan to purchase this game. This adventure is entertaining and imaginative. The mini games are great too.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|As much as I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, I am ambivalent on this<br />third outing. There were actually several story themes, but only one was carried through well.<br />Perhaps it would have been a good collection of short stories. There were some excellent<br />characterizations. Since it was a book club book, I finished it, but lost the thread sometimes.
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|It may be because I had mastitis as I read of the main character's mastitis, but I found this book compelling and well rounded.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it fun when u have over fifty in one app.I like when it challenges you to play. it also is cool when they reward you money when u come ever single day. you should get this game.,
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The characters are well developed.  I found the weakness in the mother deplorable insofar as she takes to her bed and takes responsibility for nothing.  She has choices in terms of sedating herself and dealing with reality.  Marshall has neither parent to halt his increasingly destructive behavior which ultimately result in his death.  The fact that these human beings were treated as property and sold at will is heart wrenching .
B005ES0YKO|5.0|Exactly what we were looking for. The wide sturdy base is a nice upgrade from the original crocs. They are great for every day use.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not surprising that the wife planned her disappearance.  The fact that she gets away with it makes the novel rather pointless since the diaries she supposedly wrote could have been tested to show that they were newly written.  Also her supposed rapist would have undergone an autopsy wherein the amount of barbiturates in his system would have aroused suspician.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for season 4. We were so happy to find season three on amazon instant streaming...and in HD! Awesome!
B00821OX98|5.0|Fun and entertaining.  Easy to get absorbe in the characters.  One of my favorite SciFi shows on TV right now.
0062238868|5.0|What a powerful story!  A very lethal SEAL sniper... but mainly just a guy doing his best to serve his Country and be a husband and Dad.  I read this about the same time I read Marcus Lutrells' book and they actually compliment each other as both men knew one another.<br /><br />The strong point of this book is the contributions by Mrs. Kyle; she writes patches here and there in the book giving her side of events and situations.  It really improves the story and makes it more interesting.<br /><br />Such an ironic fate for a great guy, very sad but tells us about our soldiers and the human spirit.  Good read!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Some of the puzzles are relatively easy, but some are challenging.  I like that there is a time limit on the puzzles.
0316044695|5.0|Wow an amazing story!  Really a good book, shows how tough our SEALS are!<br /><br />Starts out first half of the book with mainly the training and life before the famous incident.  Then the second half is the battle that many brave SEALs lost their lives, and the eventual rescue of Marcus Lutrell.<br /><br />The training of the SEAL is very interesting.  I have read Rogue Warrior and Chris Kyle's book this is definitely just as well written.<br /><br />The other SEALs in the book are so well written it makes it very heartbreaking to learn their fates.  One of the SEALs has a park dedicated to his memory where I live in Colorado.  I recommend this book highly and if you can't put it down and lose sleep like I did you also might want to read the books I mentioned above.
6304712936|5.0|This movie is great on many levels but my most favorite reason for loving it is because it is quite witty!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I found that though this piece had been well-written with no errors. It lacked creativity. The erotics were all the same things and most if it wasn't or didn't even sound realistic. It was as if it was all one scene repeated pages later. I just found by erotica standards it wasn't as interesting as many other erotica pieces. Maybe it was the authors first time at writing erotica and I, myself have never written erotica yet but i am a book critic and a reviewer and have read my fair share of erotica to say that this book didnt stand out to me between Fifty Shades Of Grey and Hunters blood series by Rue Volley or Sylvia Day's pieces it'd have to be Hunters blood series and sylvia days pieces. With that in mind it did have a plot and the characters built up and grew stronger. I'd advise the writer to read more erotica as to see how to change the repetitive sex scenes and maybe learn how erotica stands out might gain a few good tips to help.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but I thought that it got a little bit too deep into the medical aspect of his condition.  I would recommend this to people who are interested in near death experiences.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|I love this movie and was shocked that my boyfriend of 2 years had never seen it. So I fixed that! Great choice, now he can appreciate it too!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Good action but didn't follow the original movie plot. Duke died in the first few minutes, Destro was abandoned and Storm Shadow was resurrected.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Pretty good app for cell phones. Pretty easy to figure out how to use. Beginers should have no problems. Fun for all ages.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I'm not really a fan of games. I downloaded this one and couldn't be more perfect. Is great and addictive, you're always trying to do missions and ypu can be playing hours and hours. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Btw, sorry for my english.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|I loved everyone in this movie I hope they make another one, very action packed, would recommend to watch, for adults only.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|I should have seen this movie many years ago as I've heard about it all of my life (I&#34;m now 66).  I would recommend it to baby boomers and older.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|It was a great movie, every one should watch it, very action packed, would recommend if you like this sort of movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a fun game for kids and adults. I also like that there is more levels too. My nieces and nephews love this game.
B004G6009K|5.0|My Daughter is in love with Rapunzel. She would watch this every day if she were allowed. Great story, enjoyed by the whole family!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is an Amazing book for young women to read it helps  teach life long lessons to any one who is wise enough to listen I loved it
B002LK3DUQ|4.0|I liked the movie but my daughter wasn't a real fan of it. Maybe when she gets a little bigger she will appreciate it.
020530902X|4.0|I'm a nerd, so I enjoy style guides. Knowing that one of my friends sent this to me. It is a traditional approach, but you also get a little humor and flair. Especially in the section of easily confused words and phrases.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|After riding on Dumbo at Disney my kids had to watch the movie. My daughter loved it! A little sad as I remembered but still classic.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but the camera movement was hard to follow. Also a lot of times it was too dark to see what was happening.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophia Kinsella always writes books that a fun, easy and quick read. This book is no exception.  You aren't going to stimulate your brain but it is enjoyable.
B000T433CO|5.0|I've watched this movie so many times that I had to own a copy.  Oh no, it's not just for Christmas - it's whenever I want to thoroughly indulge in the beauty of the locations, the gorgeous and talented stars, and oh yes, I love the story through and through.  A highlight for me is the part Eli Wallach plays and the sweet, sweet ways in which the younger characters honor and respect his seniority.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I am a scifi buff, so I tend to enjoy this genre. Great plot, writing, acting, visuals. What more can u ask for? No it's not Transformers or Armageddon type action, but for me I liked it so much I watched it 2x to catch some of the things I missed first time.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Of course we ladies have fallen in love with the story and watch it over and over again.  One day it occured to me that so much of the enjoyment is built around the songs, so I had to have the CD.  Do yourself a favor - love this along with the movie.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Allows you to access your email account just like you would on your phone or other devices.  It works well.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|McConaughey excels along with the other cast members in this story of a man on the lam for killing his lover's abusive ex.  Needing help to get a boat out of a tree and equip it with a motor and food, he enlists the aid of two 14-year-old boys who come from screwy families and want an older man to look up to.  The boys have some growing up to do and so does Mud, or so he calls himself.  Thoughtful movie for thoughtful viewers.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|It's Twitter.  It loads the recent Tweets but if you go for a few hours or a day without checking it you miss all of those Tweets.  It will only upload the recent ones that were posted.
B008IZYWXU|3.0|In my eyes (and ears) Freddie can do no wrong.  I bought this to add to my vast collection of his work.  It brought tears to my eyes to see his final performance with HIS idol, which is a reason I bought it.  I had not heard Monserrat perform and know Freddie thought of her as I think of him.  The video is brief, about 4-5 songs, then it repeats itself as to take up space where some other desired footage (of Freddie) could have been placed.  It's expensive for a five song video but I'm glad I have it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is Facebook.  You can use it to message friends or check recent news feed, or stalk random peeps.  Your choice.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Fast service, just as promised product, exciting series. One to keep you glued to t.v. & the  plot. Very happy with product
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app works very well, pretty much on par with the myriad of photo editor apps. I just wanted to note that amazon already had this as the free app of the day awhile ago.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|I love this show, love dexter, hate to see the show end.  I understand why it is but still wish it could go on forever.  I hope the ending is not a disappointment.  I have bought all of the episodes, love it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I loved it, because it followed the book closer than any movie can. I didn't mind that is was about 5 hours long.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love this book, the movie and all of the collectibles that are available for this wonderful story. Amazon keep it up
B004TBWFAO|5.0|worth the effort to read this classic! The annotations were very helpful. Take the Coursera course &#34;The Fiction of Relationship&#34; you won't regret it. This was part of the reading list. I got so much more out of it this time around.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love reading and this one is a good one.  I saw the movie but some how the book is always better
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For a free app, this calculator does more than the basics that many reviewers have complained about. If you swipe the memory buttons to the side, you will reveal buttons for pi, x squared, square root, and inverse.<br />Also, if you tap the menu tab at the bottom of your screen a &quot;tape&quot; of your previous actions is revealed that you can scroll through like a tape on a conventional adding machine. If you tap on any of these previous results, it is returned to the calculator window for further use.<br />I am using this app on a Kindle Fire HD and have not had any trouble with the app. It works fine without Wi-Fi, with Wi-Fi there are ads at the top of the screen, but they do not interfere with the operation or display.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is awesome I am on level two in the city I love how you go down the water slide it is just asesome and I love it.
0679411585|5.0|I had seen the Mel Gibson movie before I read the book. I have read a lot of books on historic battles but this one was up close and personal especially when you can run your fingers over the names who gave all in what was truly a life and death struggle. I rank this right up there with Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan!
B005COO1X6|5.0|For the length if the book it was iconic. Loved it very much. Can't wait for anything new from kings collection.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I did not see this at the movies. I wish I did it was surprisingly good. I enjoyed it. It was confusing at the beginning but It all made sense toward the end. Excellent mind bender.
0062238868|5.0|I am so thankful that Chris Kyle produced this candid account of his experience as a navy seal and sniper. It provided a glimpse into the psychic makeup of a modern day warrior. He was able to bring to life experiences that most of us will never experience and in a way that showed his compassion for others and his country. I read this book to help me understand the man in my life that was also a seal who did four tours of active duty in Viet Nam.  Chris' words helped me understand the raw courage required to do the job they did for their country and the impact combat has on all soldiers. Chris demonstrated in his words and in his life that all soldiers who face combat are wounded (in one way or another). I hope that others will read and appreciate the sacrifices many have made for our freedom.<br />Karen Wills Fox<br />USAF Nurse Corps
1932735410|1.0|I am trying to take the test in September, so I don't have time to replace.  But when you buy something you should get the complete set - Rita PMP provides a comprehensive CD which has the full book and testing modules.<br /><br />Book is good - but the fowl play with the book is a bit disturbing.<br /><br />Would recommend not purchasing from this source on Amazon as well.  Tried contacting them, and have not provided a response.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is amazing! I love all the characters and the detailed course. The only problem is the ads. I used to not have any ads, but just because I wouldn't rate their game or buy temple run brave. So I am a little ticked off because of this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The advertisements are not bad and the game is free :)<br />I have been enjoying this app so far! Great game
B007JZGIMS|1.0|Edit<br /><br />Ok having the same problems as others after a day so Changed from 5 stars to 1.<br /><br />Songs will suddenly stop playing and won't restart.<br /><br />Sometimes a reboot will help, Sometimes not..<br /><br />Stick with free version!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Somewhat different from the animated version, darker, deeper, I liked it a lot.  I would definitely consider other books by D.W.Jones.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Its really fun i enjoyed it but iys cheap the graffics could be better buttts how they want it so
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Cheesy movie.. but good chance to see all of our favorite action heroes.  Wait to buy it once the &#34;new&#34; sticker price has dropped.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I rarely review books but I only logged in to Amazon to give this book 5 stars because I enjoyed it so much. The last book series that I enjoyed this much was \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Farseer Trilogy\\" to mention a few but Brandon Sanderson got his own style.<br /><br />This book is perfect when you want a fun book, with a different setting that is easy to read. It is the first of three books but it got a proper ending, something that I appreciate very much. Highly recommended.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|Other than sharing what you like, I see NO way to flip what I like into my own magazine as on my phone, disappointed.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|Update: 12/20/2013 - After months of use, I am removing a star for uncomfortably. I thought these would adjust more to my head but I find myself only wearing them for an hour before it hurts my head/ears.  Even while I have them on, I am slightly distracted from the music because of the pressure on my head.  I kind of wish I could sell these at this point.  The sound is incredible and I'm convinced nothing can beat it at this price, but they are just not comfortable. = (<br /><br />Bought this after extensive research.  But I will be honest, my brother has had this pair for a year.  I wanted to avoid getting the same pair just to try something different but after a lot of research and trying my brothers pair, I decided to pull the trigger.<br /><br />I use these headphones with an Aune T1 Tube deal that the guys off Hi Fi forums recommended.  I have tested the different between the headphones plugged into my Iphone 5, Computer, and this receiver deal (Aune T1) and it's pretty amazing.<br /><br />I have a difficult time with comfort. I can't seem to find any that are comfortable enough for a 3-4 hour session. But out of all headphones I've tried, these are the best.<br /><br />As far as the bass, I have no idea what people are talking about.  These have plenty bass and if you add more, you just ruin the way music is supposed to be listened to.  I think people have become accustomed to bad quality stereos because a lot of cheap stuff out there is all about the bass. Give them a go and turn it up =)
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I like it because it is full of intrigue & life lessons.  You have the feeling of being a companion to Lin.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Non stop action and very well made picture. Caracters are well played and it develops in Brazil. Won't regret having it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|WiFi sniffers cost hundreds of dollars and for free you get this Swiss-army knife for you'd WiFi configuration. Great work guys, now please write one for Windows 8 mobile, please!
B00957T6X6|5.0|The best epic fantasy literature that I've read recently.  The Robert Jordon's Wheel of Time is its close runner up, though.
B000FCK65W|5.0|It brought me to tears going through the teenage life of Francie Nolan. She made me want to never give up and to look at my life a whole new way, a better way.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Biggest issue I had was that thru out he insisted that Rome named the entire region Palestine before the destruction of the Temple c. 70 CE.  It was officially renamed Palestine in whole by Hadrian in the next century when the Jews were permanently disinherited of Judea.  Henceforth, all the other Semitic tribes in the region were called Palestinians, even to this day.  And Jews still say &#34;may his bone rot&#34; when Hadrian's name is mentioned.  This important because it proves historically that the current day Palestinians are the same non-Jewish Semitic people to have lived there since we have reliable records along side those of Jewish ethnicity.  Hadrian didn't move people in, he moved the Jews out..
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love it!!! It has great ideas for all occasions. Quick, simple, and delicious meals n drinks for all ages!!!!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Remarkable to hear the progression of the voice. Many stand out tracks. Love hearing the &#34;patter&#34; in the studio. She still has it!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|A social Uno game! Really neat for people who like card games. You can also invite friends from Facebook. Have fun with this cool game
B009R9WB5C|5.0|I was excited to purchase this cd, but felt let down when I heard it. The only songs I enjoyed were the one's from the radio. So when I listen to the cd I typically skip over the one's I don't care for and that was many. If I had been able to hear the cd in full before buying it I wouldn't have gotten it and just downloaded the one's I did like from ITunes. The cd played well and arrived on time so that is the only reason why I am saying I love it.
B001POXA02|5.0|Brought this watch for my husbands birthday in March.  Could tell that my son loved it as well.  So we decided to get the same watch for my son's birthday this month.  the look in his eyes when he unwrapped and saw a seiko box, and then saw the same watch as his dad.  PRICELELSS.  Thank you Amazon for getting it to us in time.  We received it the day before his birthday and at the same price as my husbands.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This is a great game until you update, sooner or later 1 of these updates will crash the game so it no longer loads. If a later update restores the game you have to use all your acorns to get back into the game where you left off. Then it'll work, at least it will until the next update. It's a scam to extort money by making you buy acorns if you want to play the game again. Oh, and the faulty updates will crash your ipad as well. Parents, don't ket your kids start playing it or there will be tears....
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I rated this game 2 stars because you only let people get free tokens every 40 minutes or so. You also have us pay for free tokens . You should have an in game bonus were you can earn them. Thank you for your time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game....makes you want to keep playing to collect more bananas and get a higher score. Fun for all ages, some levels do get tricky.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A wonderful overview on the life and works of one of the most brilliant minds in human history, underpinned with a thoughtful exploration of what we call \\"genius\\".<br /><br />A fun, quick read, perfect for a slow day in the office.
0345472322|5.0|I am very happy with the everything about this transaction...thank you very much...I would recommend to anyone this type of buying.
B005OK721G|4.0|This is a mixture of action thriller and revenge flick, hardly an original combination, but well-done, nevertheless.  The action scenes were well-executed.  The writing was better than average.  Zoe Saldana was very engaging.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I am very happy with the everything about this transaction...thank you very much...I would recommend to anyone this type of buying.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|As good as the original Terminator was (and it's excellent), this sequel is even better.  I've seen it several times and still haven't tired of it.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Well worth $1.99. Makes you think hard. Only downfall is that I wish it was longer. Love how after a bit of not making progress they give you clues!!!!
B003Y5H54W|4.0|An interesting interpretation of the myth of Little Red Riding Hood.  Amanda Seyfried is great, as always.  The supporting cast was also more than competent.  It's a fun movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|really challenging and fun. enjoyed it. definitely an app worth getting. I got hooked pretty quick. try it out. great game.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is one of the best action film of the eighties.  Even today, it holds up well.  One of Arnold's best films.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I absolutely love this show. The characters are outstanding, and the story lines are not the same tired courtroom dramas.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|An off-beat little film.  One might be tempted to write it off as a chick flick, but it was as funny in places as it was romantic, so I'll give it a thumb's-up.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|There's a very good reason why this book is so well loved a classic. Follett is at the top of his class, and not just for Pillars of The Earth. If you love the latter, try this one too. It's the perfect beach book, flight read, or rainy day amusement. I read it in less than a day.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the series, hoping it never ends. This is the reason I don't do reviews, you ask for too much.<br />Just leave it at stars, and I will go on doing them.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|an average tale about a boy who is just a bit too awesome at everything. i didnt really like it.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|Not appropriate to watch. Guess I am naive but this should be rated 'R' for graphic scenes and language. Can't believe parents would say these kinds of things to their children. I do not recommend this to anyone.
B00CP4RZIO|1.0|Why does Mark Hunter even try? At least wrap this garbage up under a different name and give Chimaira a chance of being remembered for the music they USED to make. This is one of the most generic, uninspired and cheesy albums I have heard in quite some time. If this is \\"good metal\\" to you, then you really need to expand your musical horizons. I'm very glad that I didn't waste a penny on this album; I recommend you do the same.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Saw this at Zoombezi &#34;Dive-in Theater&#34;... And wanted to see it in HD, a great movie.  I will see it again, and again.
B003405MF6|5.0|So, who said rock artists can't be serious musicians. This is a great departure for Beck's guitar artistry into the realm of sturm und drang...even an operatic track. Expand your horizons as Jeff Beck did. There's a whole lot of good stuff waiting to be discovered. Dig it!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really, really cool, very well written and acted series...  I look forward to watching every episode... I loved this thing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I travel out of the US quite a bit so I frequently miss weekly series. Netflix doesn't carry The Good Wife and I wasn't willing to buy several seasons. I am so pleased Amazon Prime now has the series.  It is a great show on so many levels. I have almost finished Season 1.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|I watched this after watching all of the Shrek movies, and here is my take on it: It is a fun and entertaining movie, with a pleasant mix of action, funniness and little bit of betrayal. (No gruesome parts) All and all, I think it is a great family movie, and I am not above watching it again. Review by Zoe, age 10
B000RZIGVS|3.0|I purchased it new and the 3 sections were separately wrapped inside the sealed package.  Yet several of the DVDs were scratched, some severely and I had difficultly playing 2 of the DVDs. As I said, I love the series and hope to eventually buy it on bluray to replace this set. (When I noted the scratches, I took special care removing them and still found more with scratches, so I knew it was not I that caused the scratches)
B002CGSYNU|4.0|I am using it to mount the &#34;Olympus LC-40.5 Front Lens Cap for Olympus 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens&#34; lens cap for the camera, as I do not wish to keep the lens open and exposed. I still wonder why Olympus didn't include a lens cap with the camera.<br /><br />I am using the 40.5mm &#34;Rainbowimaging 40.5mm Conversion Lens Adapter for OLYMPUS TG-1&#34; adapter that fits on the Olympus Tough TG-1 camera after you remove the ring from around the lens on the camera. It is made of plastic but the build seems decent to me. I was able to mount it the adapter and then the lens cap on the camera properly without modding it in any way.
1451695195|4.0|This very personal account of an unexpected traumatic experience and its aftermath is well written and credible.  It stays in ones thoughts ong after being read.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS FOR REAL!!!  'EDWARD' REALLY HAD A CRAPPY LIFE AND THEN MET THIS GIRL AND GOT OFF DRUGS (the bad ones at least) AND WROTE SOME DOWN SONGS AND SOME LOVE SONGS (REAL LOVE SONGS) AND THEN MADE IT!!!  DON'T YOU LOVE THAT?!
B000GRTREC|5.0|Bob Dylan is my favorite musician ever. I recently started buying up his old vinyl and buying the newer ones on Amazon. Love the album but hate that its a regular length album split over 4 short sides.
0887307280|2.0|The book was ok, but it didn't look like the one in the picture, so I am not even sure if it is the right version.  Not happy about that.
B008M9PHWM|5.0|Bob Dylan is my favorite musician ever. I recently started buying up his old vinyl and buying the newer ones on Amazon. Love the album but hate that its a regular length album split over 4 short sides.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. Not a bad choice for horse lovers. The downside is that it uses a lot of battery power
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|How could it be any less then 5 stars for Indiana Jones. The movies look great on bluray. I havent dove into the special features too much yet though
B006FE83UE|5.0|This is my all time favorite. Don't every watched a colorized version, if there is on. Black and white makes the movie.
B000002KHY|5.0|As they say in Southern California, Van Nuys, Van Nuys.  Sweet Baby James did himself up proud.  A couple of things I don't care for so much, but all in all, a winner.
B001LM1456|4.0|Always a good classic.  Would watch again.. Good Movie for all.  Great special effects and entertaining. word word words word.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|No action-adventure movie should held to the standard of a \\"Citizen Kane.\\"  The genre is akin to a roller coaster ride: it provides entertaining thrills. There are of course minimum requirements for performances, dialogue, plot, and special effects. Oblivion achieve all in a workmanlike manner.  It may not be the finest of its type and it's not 100% original, but it's entertaining and far from the worst.  The CGI's are stunning, and the action proceeds logically.<br /><br />Rottentomatoes gave it a 54% positive rating, marginally failing to achieve their \\"fresh\\" rating.  Perversely, Ridley Scott's muddled and illogical creature-feature, \\"Prometheus\\" was rated a 74% positive.  That should arguably call into question the reviewers' credibility.
160774273X|5.0|The technique and using the dutch oven along with the recipes has resulted in awesome bread.  And since we live in a rural town with no bakery to speak of, this fills a void very well.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The inimitable Maggie Smith aside, the servants' acting is far the stronger. Upstairs, again Dame Maggie exempted, virtually everyone simpers constantly. This is not new but begins to wear.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|I love it! I'm all for an up beat song to get me going or lift my mood, and who can resist the Despicable family! This song is definitely a top rater for me
0345529057|5.0|You've seen the shows and they are great.  Now, read the books.  Seriously, if you loved the show the books are way better.  More detail, more history on why things happen, more character development.  The show cuts out major plot points, rearranges the scenes, and basically butchers the full story.  You owe it to yourself to read the books.<br /><br />The set itself is nice, good quality paperbacks.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Definitely worth a rental, but glad I didn't take the family to see it in the theater.  Morgan freedman only has a small role
B004UQ03P2|5.0|The &#34;iVisor&#34; serves the purpose it is designed for, perfectly!<br />It's been just an hour since I put this on, and I was so impressed that I was compelled to give a 5 star and write this up.<br />I agree with others about the screen dimming down; I don't mind for that as long as I don't have to keep<br />trying to get my face off of my laptop!<br /><br />I hope it stays and does not peel off like it happened to a couple of reviewers.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I can't tell you how good the entire movie was since i fell asleep early in the movie the two times that I tried to watch it.  I admitted had a tough time telling apart all of the dwarfs.  as an FYI - i loved the book when i was a kid.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great Movie! It has very good story and characters!!! My son loves it and we all too in our house!
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|more fun that I thought it was going to be - while actually ringing true in the moments when it is supposed to connect with the audiance
B0028MBKVG|5.0|// sweet read- bummed I waited this long to enjoy it. Will definitely tell other runners to check it out
B00CDT41RY|2.0|After all the media buildup and a high recommendation from a family member - I was disappointed with the language and situation that allowed for the unlikely escape of key figures at opportune times.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|I expected very little of this movie and watched cause I am a fan of the big guy, but I was pleasantly surprised by a good cast, fun script and kick-ass action.  Great flick.  King Conan!  Bring it on!
B001EBIRZE|5.0|Great movie for kids, my 5 year old daughter enjoyed watching it, and she thought it was funny and she liked it alot
B005HEPIDS|5.0|As with most series, they start out a little rough and the characters develop with time.  Same here.  I like how Mulgrew &#34;matured&#34; the Janeway character.  You could tell she was more comfortable in the role, more relaxed.  The plots got a bit silly sometimes, however nothing like DS9.  I think Voyager reminded me more of the original series than any of the other Star Treks.  Couple that with Jeri Ryan in a body suit, what more could one ask for?
B008JFUREC|4.0|For those of you that enjoyed this movie for what it is, congratulations!, you've grown up. As for you haters, this is a kids movie, intended for kids. It should not be filled with over-complicated plots, innuendos, or gratuitous violence to appease adult intellect or lack thereof. This movie did exactly what it was intended to do. It made my thirteen year old daughter happy and that alone is enough for me. As an adult, if you go into it light hearted, not looking for 'The Terminator' or 'Gone with the Wind', you may actually enjoy bonding with your kids. It's the 'Smurfs' people. Little blue folk that live in mushrooms and spend their existence running from a wizard and his cat. Lighten up & have fun!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of the very very few movies that I thought was much better than the book! Very entertaining.
B000069KE0|5.0|Classic album!  I got this for Christmas in 1971.  I had the original cd as well on two discs.  The re-mastered cd on one disc is easier to manage.  I wanted the cd because there are several &#34;suites&#34; on this album, and digital copies pause between the tracks.  Great listening and the auto-rip feature allows instant listening from the time of purchase.  The cd was received quickly with Prime shipping.  A bargain at twice the price!
B005DJREJS|5.0|I love amazon prime. Starting my membership after my 30 day free trial. Only 75 dollars a year and free 2 day shipping on certain items. You won't find anything better.
B000069KGM|5.0|Classic album!  I got the original vinyl album as a follow-up to Chicago II.  I had the original cd as well on two discs.  The re-mastered cd on one disc is easier to manage.  I wanted the cd because there are several &#34;suites&#34; on this album, and digital copies pause between the tracks.  Great listening and the auto-rip feature allows instant listening from the time of purchase.  The cd was received quickly with Prime shipping.  A bargain at twice the price!
B008VBYN80|5.0|My son loves it! He is able to play and help his friends out. They enjoy giving each other ideas.
0688011500|5.0|I have read all of Ken Follet's books to date and have loved them with one or two exceptions.  This was one that I loved.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My son loves movie and I'm glad I got this on his kindle its very convenient no scratched dvd hassle perfect for my little guy!!!
B00A11AN6O|4.0|Easy to work and get around in app. I really enjoy my kindle version . I would recommend to ever one who has a kindle.
B00371XIJE|5.0|Very well done. Wonderful entertainment for the whole family. The acting was fabulous. A heart warming story. I highly recommend it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Lyrically, it is like the \\"Born This Way\\" era. Musically, it is a nice return to \\"The Fame\\" era =] I love it
B00AFEY354|5.0|I teach middle school and learned some great lessons from this movie.  It is a must see.  My only suggestion<br />is that you see it with someone.  You will want to talk about the movie when you are done watching it.
B000W93CHC|4.0|I am enjoying the story line.  It does seem to follow the same formula Pillars of the Earth.  Follett is an excellent writer and he does well with historical fiction.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Even if you haven't seen the musical, you love love this CD.  It will get you to<br />go to the production.  :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard yet not too easy--just right. Some repetition but probably tough to be completely original. Definitely worth it--fun!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  I read it from cover to cover but it did take me awhile..abit hard to understand but I will read it again.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|I loved this book though there was a few posts were I just got bored. I would reverend this book to someone that likes th little house on the prairie books. (It could go the other way around)
B0081X8AE6|5.0|R&B, jazz, lounge, chill...whatever your music type....Home Again will make you happy. Michael Kiwanuka is an amazing artist. Buy today.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enjoyed it a lot...getting the other books in the series.  Definitely would recommend it to sci-fi lovers.  Can't wait for the movie.
0374275637|5.0|The book is good - I havent had time to read ir to be honest - but I will get around to it eventually
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Really can't say much about this application. If you want weather and news at your fingertips, this is what you want. It's that simple. It does flash ads but 90% of &quot;free&quot; apps do that, so surprise there.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I had a water cooler from another company that wasn't delivering the kind of cooling satisfaction that I was looking for. So I had myself a look around and found the Cooler Master on this website and bought it. I didn't use the thermal goo that came with it, I bought some different stuff that's supposed to be better.<br /><br />It cooled my processor lots better than the radiator I'd installed before, but I think I might have installed it wrong. I found that out when I pulled it off. Instead of taking this thing back I installed it anyway because I remember when my radiator hoses burst on my old Caddy being bad news.<br /><br />It has copper heat pipes that directly touch the metal cap on my Ivy Bridge, no extra metal to get in the way or anything, so that's not bad. It also has some plastic bits to install another fan to get some really kickin' airflow, I used the radiator fan from my other thing, but any old 120mm fan will certainly do the trick.<br /><br />It's a bit tall, so you might need to break out a ruler or tape measure or something to make sure it fits in your computer box.<br /><br />I also want to compliment Cooler Master on their green conscious instructions. They seem to have brought back Cold War spy era micro-print for their instructions so they could save on paper and cut down less trees.<br /><br />All in all it's a good tower of aluminum and copper to cool your Ivy Bridge or Trinity or whatever you got powering your computer machine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great app.  it is super fun and totally free! Not hard enough to totally stump you,  but just challenging enough to keep you coming back!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Enjoyed this movie very much.  I just did not like the fact that it was so realistic regarding what takes place during those show.  You just should tell all of the secrets of girls night out.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I enjoy playing the game.I would come home from work and start playing the game and play for hours.if I could I would tell everyone to try and play the game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The themes and tones presented here are amazing. I am speechless. Sure, I love the action as much as the next person, but this book takes some time to stop and think. I love it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is great for when you get home from work, just had a stressful day, or just needing to relax. It's great for playing while taking a hot bath too! Definitely worth it, it also helps putting babies to sleep.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it is a awesome game you should download this game now!!  But.....  it wants you to install other games but you dont have to. it is awesome DOWNLOAD it TODAY&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|First season hooked the whole family.  We could not keep from watching, sometimes 3 episodes in one day. Now on season 3.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie, and Ben Affleck proved it by winning the Academy Award....I loved it a lot
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Classic and wonderful in so many ways.  The language is rich with atmosphere.  A study in courage and nobility of spirit.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is not your typical Stephen King novel. If you are looking for horror and supernatural, this is not it. The supernatural elements of this book are very peripheral. However, as always, King is a master at creating characters and a story that they are swept up into, that you can't help but care about them. Also, as is his habit, King built a world that in every way would pass muster for anyone who happened to live through the late 1950's and early 1960's. His attention to the details never fails. King has a rare talent for delivering the right ending even if it is one that is more emotionally difficult to accept.
B000BB14YY|5.0|So sorry for the extremely delayed response.<br />I keep forgetting that amazon has this section to fill out.<br />all the best!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book. Admittedly, it came to my attention because of the movie, and the movie was good, but the book was amazing.<br /><br />The characters were wonderfully rendered. They were so much like real people with their ugly traits and beautiful traits. And like real life, not every screwed up dysfunctional relationship was brought to a healthy tearfully wonderful resolution by the end of the book. And yet, it was a good ending. One where you could say, as messy as life is, I can see their silver lining. I also really enjoyed the perspective of the book being set completely inside the main character's mind. You get a constant stream of consciousness with his internal reactions and rationalizations of his actions in response to the things that the people around him say and do.<br /><br />One of the few books where I was constantly being surprised by how much I was really enjoying it while I read it.
B00CKZX0AA|1.0|In order to appropriately sum up this score I would need a GIF of Steve Carell's character from Anchorman screaming \\"Loud Noises!\\"<br /><br />Ol' Hans does accomplish one thing, however.  He matches the endless cacophany of the film with an equally cacophonic score.  There is no melody. There are no character themes.  There's simply no imagination or desire to enhance the film through the score.  Not that the film, horrible as it was, could have been helped by a good score.  The one, sad, lonely piano theme is so overused in the film that by the end that I was incredibly frustrated by whatever jackass of an editor got cut-and-paste-happy with whatever editing suite they used and just thought \\"there should be some emotion here, let's just use that piano bit again.\\"  That's not Zimmer's fault, but it is his fault for failing to come up with anything worthwhile here.  The score's only redeeming quality is the \\"What Are You Going To Do...\\" that everyone heard in the trailers for the film.  And THAT track doesn't even do much until the end.<br /><br />I'm not a Hans Zimmer hater.  I genuinely enjoy some of his scores.  But this was just so phoned in, so typical Hans, that it doesn't deserve the love it's received.  He had such a nice opportunity to create a great superhero theme; something beyond a few emotional notes on a piano.  Very very disappointing effort.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|App has great options,  but it wont save any of the pics that i edited. The layout is nice and it appears simple,  if only it worked.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Like every Marvel movie there is a lot of action and it is entertaining. I was happy with the story line and I thought it had its funny moments as well. I thought they brought all the characters together pretty well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You can not go wrong having the Bible on your kindle.  Very handy reference, and valuable as you sift through the challenges of life.  Always a good idea to consult the word of God when faced with decisions.
B003HKN52A|5.0|This is an AWESOME dvd of Elvis touring, and how he has set the stage for artists that came along after! Love it! He's my IDOL, and I'm a huge FAN! If you are it's a must collector to own! :-)
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|The water friendly toys are great.  Also somewhat hard to find so I may just be excited that I could find them at all.<br /><br />The clear plastic hatch is prone to come off but that is expected.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's pretty awesome. It might be cool that if at a certain level you could go inside of the trains.<br /><br />It's awesome I like it.
B003XC5OHG|3.0|Johnny Depp is always great, story was good, but wished the would have made it without the singing!  Still enjoyed it though!
0812550706|5.0|I've just re-read Enders Game in preparation for the movie and while I like it just as much as I did the first time I got more out of it this time. Card's writing is easy to fall into and all the bits about video games and laser tag flow so well that when the thematic changes come along it's easy to miss them. I especially like Card's point reinforced subtly throughout the book that the important things are what aren't talked about. I found that especially relevant to religion which is apparently a taboo in the world that Ender lives in and yet hints of it are found in almost every character. It's also seen in family relationships which are not talked about but are definitely at the heart of the book. I look forward to seeing what the movie does with Card's work.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Addictive as always.  The characters, script and acting is riveting.  The last show of the season let us know that the gig is almost up and the Dexter-era is drawing to a close.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|...DO NOT miss this film!  especially if you are a fan of REAL science fiction  =)<br />or realistic cinematography...  shots of the habitat were more reminiscent of \\"2001\\" than anything in memory...<br />Great story, great direction, great writing, great design, great acting...  a real rarity IMHO  =)
B007MD2RHC|5.0|I'm always looking for moving music to have on in the background and Illusions has become one of my favorites.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Wonderful! Love the wit! Plus, you can't beat all the flashbacks to Roseanne! I love it! I love Leonard he's my favorite!
B00ATX7FLA|4.0|I've got a number of the mini ships in a display and this one fits perfectly. Build time was about 10 minutes.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Wonderful! Love the wit! Plus, you can't beat all the flashbacks to Roseanne! I love it! I love Leonard he's my favorite!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a really good and fun game. Great graphics. Challenging and not just hidden objects. More games should be like this, although I think $5 is a bit much for a once playable game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book so much!!!!!i could not stop readig and i think every one hast to read this book
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think this is a great game!  Its fun and simple, yet just complicated enough to makd it addicting. The only negative thing i have to say about it is that i wish everything didnt have to cost over five diamonds to use. I dont mind buying diamonds once in awhile, but i dont want to have to make a purchase every few minutes!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is one I still under utilise. I use it to keep from forgetting those helpful pieces of info or ideas through the day. the ability to save articles and organise everything for quick access is just what I need.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Love this sci-fi movie, it was all I hoped it would be and more and I've watched it more than once - I recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi as I do...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Got involved and wish there was more! A rare find as I searched through the TV shows I had not seen before.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this movie - the best of actors played their rolls as if they were living the experience - it made me feel good and I have watched it several times when I want that 'feel-good' feeling again...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game isAddicting!! A must play game. Fun, relaxing, and a sure fire stresscreliever. Plus the minions faces are adorable.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Anytime I get into a show, I have to go back and start from the beginning. And you will find no dissappointments here. Includeds hours of extras!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|This game is fun and enough of a challenge to keep me wanting to move on to the next level.
B004YRSBTW|4.0|The movie has a noble plot. A man with no short term memory tries to make sense of the world and revenge the murder of his wife. Others try to manipulate him along the way. As someone with not so great memory I can relate the issue and it was interesting it to imagine what would it look like if you had to cope with a serious case. It's a thriller, you can't expect a lot of correspondence to a real case but I enjoyed watching it. Wait...what was I watching?
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Mr. Eastwood has done it again. A fantastic story about Love and persistence. Great Acting and a Great Story. A Must see....
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|After having read every book in the Wheel of time, I was primed for the final chapter, so to speak.  Things started out well, but the last battle was way too long.  I would have liked to know if Elayne's babies came out all right, so to speak.
B00DURILJ2|2.0|I had high hopes, but Mud was pretty bad.  Story line was weak, ZERO in character development...and nothing really ever 'happened'.  There were so many underlying stories, that also went nowhere.  I ADORE M.M. and it pains me greatly to give this flick a big fat thumbs down.  Save your money, or watch The Paperboy....That was a great one.
1452126607|5.0|Now I can be grumpy for a whole year. I love that little face with the frown and the piercing scowl.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This is a delightful story! Characters who are not mainstream are treated with sympathy and gentle humour. It was easy to predict the ending, and lovely to go along with the ride to get there.
1452126577|5.0|As a primer for grumpiness, this book is a hands-down winner.  Now I know how to rain on someone's parade, as well as making all kinds of people cry.
B003IHWLL8|5.0|George Clooney at his best. I love this movie and his role in O' Brother Where Art Thou. He's hilarious and this whole movie has gold written all over it.
0451209338|5.0|I read a review of this book, The Kill Artist by Daniel Silva, and thought it sounded great. Well it was and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
1439190275|5.0|Excellent book, very informative. Easy to folloe, excellent recipes and it is very helpful for someone who is interested in losing weight
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a very fun game and it has lots of hilarious rag doll physics. It is a game for everyone
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This should be considered one of the best albums of all time. This is the best album of all the Linkin Park albums.  Minutes to Midnight has a variety of sounds, which is why I like it so much because I don't like albums that all the songs sound the exact same. All of the songs are very poetic.  My favorite song on the album is \\"THE LITTLE THINGS GIVE YOU AWAY\\", it's nice and slow mostly with powerful lyrics and then in the close to the end of a song there is a strong yet weeping guitar solo.  \\"BLEED IT OUT\\" is an excellent party song a mixture of Rock and Roll and Hip Hop. \\"GIVEN UP\\", \\"WHAT I'VE DONE\\", and \\"NO MORE SORROW\\" are very loud and powerful songs in your face in a way. \\"LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST\\", \\"SHADOW OF THE DAY\\", \\"VALENTINE'S DAY\\", and \\"IN PIECES\\" are quiet in a way soothing song but still powerful. \\"HAND HELD HIGH\\" and \\"IN BETWEEN\\" are genius from Mike.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a awesome awesome game I love it I would recommend it to anyone I keep playing lol u should get it
B000F1IQNM|5.0|this is a delightful movie and my grandchildren love to watch this, this is entertainment for the whole family thanks
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun! I just wish there were an easier way to get the other costumes besides having to spend your money to get Gru coins. Other then that very addicting.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Overall a good game.  The difficulty seems to vary quite a bit, but I like the challenge. I would recommend it.
B001EOOQEC|5.0|&#34;Heaven and Hell&#34; and &#34;The Mob Rules&#34; are good albums but &#34;Dehumanizer&#34; blows them both out of the water. Dehumanizer is by far the best Sabbath album with Dio. The riffs are rimenisent of early Sabbath kicked up a few notches and Tony Iommi kicks on some major lead solos. Highly recommend this album, especially to any Sabbath and/or Dio fan. You won't be dissappointed.
0439023521|5.0|I like the Hunger Games Series and read all three books. Good story about futuristic America. Now that movie one is out, awaiting next movie to see how it follows book two.
B008BO65S8|3.0|The kindle edition has some technical flaws and is hard to navigate.<br />As for the content, it's very useful from time to time, but sometimes the tone's too obnoxious and unobjective. The prices listed in the book never should be used even as a guidance.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Walk Off the Earth is amazing, so their album is, too. Listen to the samples to know for yourself.  I first found them on youtube and have been a fan for years. I'm excited that they're finally getting the acknowledgement they deserve!
B0017I1FO4|5.0|all of the songs on this cd are really good , i enjoyed it, i liked breaking inside as one of my favourite songs,
B00008J2PG|5.0|I read the book -  and after that just had to see the film.  It followed the book quite closely . . . for a film.  I found it amazing that a film made for TV had such major stars, namely Gregory Peck,and Christopher Plummer, and Sir John Gielgud.  I loved Gielgud's Pius  XII.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating for the book because, the book kept me entertained, wanting more and making it difficult to put the book down. I loved the storyline it was unique, made sense. I loved everything about  the book the two things I disliked about the book was that it could  have told how the other competitors die and I dislike one of the competitor I didn't want to die died. I'd recommend this book too whoever knows how to read
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Plain and simple; just a lot of fun for everyone; for all ages! Would recommend to everyone. Love it alot.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I was copying slides by projecting on the wall and taking pictures. Labor intensive after 150 slides.<br />This was a good purchase for coping the remaining 750 slides. What a great time/labor saver.<br />I highly recommend.
076421120X|4.0|Born of her own journaling experience, Darlene Zschech provides us with a year full of devotions that bring \\"light to your heart and mind.\\"<br /><br />I was expecting something that takes from the numerous songs of worship the author has produced over the years.  There are several songs utilized, but they are mostly hymns such as Great Is Thy Faithfulness, It Is Well With My Soul, and several other classic songs.  But truly, there are few of these-considering it's a year-long devotional-and feels much like looking into the author's Bible study journals and reading her personal thoughts.<br /><br />The daily devotions are set up in the traditional daily format with a Scripture, devotion, and thought or prayer.  It might take you five minutes to read through but as with most devotions you will get out what you put in.  This will make a great addition, or encouragement to start, your daily prayer time.  The devotions will lift you up and put you in positive mood, but most importantly, they will help you to focus on Jesus.  The cover and insides are beautiful helping to make this a nice devotion for giving.<br /><br />I received this book from Bethany House Publishers free of charge in exchange for an honest review.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The characters were great, the story was great. I loved the whole movie.  I saw Red 2 recently, and it was even better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Way better than temple run. Great for kids. Really fun and addicting. I love it.best game ever on the kindle.<br /> A lot like temple run.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I loved the music, but the story was very slow moving.  The story had a very good plot--aging opera diva is afraid to sing in public in her advanced years; friends convince her to give it a try.  However, for some reason the story seemed to plod along.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Well It's a little bit hard I had to use the computer at level 5 and still using it now<br />So you can tell it's hard but it is really fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is so much fun. I love serpent and can't wait to buy more games with my points. I hope you read this review and want to get this game.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It is awesome I love this app so much really good app it is really fun picking pics to use to change them to more cooler then that where.
B0064MGU98|4.0|You can almost feel she's truly going through it, the plot also just isn't about his infidelity and HIS issues but how she copes with it all.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Full of action and adventure but never to scary for our 5 & 6 year old girls-they watched it twice in 48 hours!
B009AJD5E0|5.0|This is first-rate sci-fi! It seems to me that there are only a couple of really well-produced science fiction movies made per annum. This was the best such movie that I have seen since Avatar. Both the special effects and the story line are most entertaining.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|I love the app but every time I want different type of wool it gives me white wool.please fix that but I love it keep up the good work!
B0019GO58C|1.0|The quality of the DVD was very poor .  It's impossible to hear the dialogue over the humming noise on the tape.  This was a beautiful story with my favorite actors ruined be the very poor quality of the DVD.
B008TRUDAS|1.0|This book would appeal to a high school aged girl, but not me.  I found it entirely unrealistic and unbelievable.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I LOVE this book ! originally I began reading the book because of the upcoming film, but now I'm onto the second book of the series and am fully invested in it! I truly hope the film does this opener justice!
B00271HAK8|4.0|A classic film, you gotta love it. Lots of great characters, the headmaster, the parking attendant, the depressed buddy, etc.
B0002KVULG|5.0|I was happy to get this film on cd. Has been one of my favorites and still enjoy watching today.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|What a delight!  Amazing cast.  Witty, sophisticated dialogue. Historically accurate.  Visually stunning.  Completely addictive.  Loved by adults & teenagers, alike.  Can't wait for season 4!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is really good.But there are pros and cons.Then again,What app doesn't?<br /><br />  PROS.  CONS<br />Great filters.  Doesn't show how to fix blemishe<br />  Doesn't have directions<br />Good frames<br />Mice styles<br />Better than the free version.<br /><br />Soooooo,u should buy this version!!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book!  I was not expecting to like it, but I was instantly engaged and could not put it down.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|I saw this recommended on Facebook and was in a hurry and thought I would read it on the plane.<br />Very disappointed. I wish I had taken time to research it first. The author is a body builder and a self appointed &#34;expert&#34; with no medical background.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think at first, but it captured and captivated me at the end of the first chapter!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Christopher Eccleston is the best doctor. Any fan girls out there who are disappointed in the choosing of the 12th doctor, this right here is the reality. Billie Piper is amazing too and the chemistry between her and Eccleston is unmatched.
B004UPANAI|4.0|If you like super hero movies this is the one watched it with my son and we were both very into it
B00E8B1358|2.0|Just didn't find the movie all that interesting. Fight scenes were okay but the in between areas were very lackluster.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Funny and entertaining for the family. Nice story and interesting animations. Well done movie with beautiful scenes and some action.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This was one of the most engaging, lovable book that I have read since the Rosie Project - a wonderful read.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Fab animations and action with funny bits. We loved ice age 1 and this one is a nice spin on it.
B000002GYN|4.0|Convened as refugees from Linda Ronstadt's backing band, the 1972 \\"Eagles\\" was a calling card of the easy going California rock scene. At this point, the Eagles were something of a democratic quartet, with the members each getting shots at lead vocals and writing credits. Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner all came from varying backgrounds and different bands, including Bob Seger (Frey), Flying Burrito Brothers (Leadon) and Poco (Meisner) in addition to Ronstadt, so the dominant musical theme was countrified mellow rock. Having Jackson Browne as a friend and co-writer kind of cemented that deal.<br /><br />\\"Eagles\\" reflects that combination of talents. The calling card first single, \\"Take It Easy,\\" was the perfect blend. Frey sings it as a breezy song about just relaxing into what comes your way while Leadon adds a banjo solo. \\"Witchy Woman\\" highlighted Henley's gruff singing style and was the first of many Eagles songs about wicked women. Then there was the ballad, \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling,\\" which again was a precursor to many of the Eagles' greater successes. The formula worked for the bulk of the album, with the true wonder of the band being their exquisite vocal harmonies.<br /><br />However much \\"Eagles\\" wanted to be a rock band album, though, the band just wasn't there yet. The most memorable non-single is \\"Train Leaves Here This Morning,\\" a country ballad sung by Leadon (and one of the few non-hits played on the 40th Anniversary tour). The one attempt at a bona-fide rocker is \\"Chug All Night,\\" which is generic bar-band stuff. Meisner's \\"Tryin'\\" fairs just a bit better. Tack on the dreadfully annoying bird whistle intro on \\"Earlybird,\\" and you hear a band still finding its footing. They'd make a major leap when releasing \\"Desperado\\" (which also began Henley's ascent into the groups main voice) the following year, but \\"Eagles\\" remains a decent album of it's time and an interesting introduction to a band that would ultimately evolve into one the biggest bands in history.he biggest bands in history.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game it's really fun even though I'm stuck right now.You get to work a case and your the detective
0316069884|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer is a very talented writer. He takes a very serious subject and adds some humor to it. All in all, I enjoyed reading it and found myself easily persuaded by the facts he presented to the reader about factory farmed animals. Although I can't say I'll become a vegetarian, or a vegan... I am certainly abstaining from factory farmed animal meats. Thankfully I live in a part of VT where I can get REAL farm raised meat whenever I want it. Sure, it's expensive, which had drastically cut back my meat consumption, but, I really learned a lot in this book and I wish I could share it with everyone, so they knew exactly what it is they are ingesting!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It is rare that a book could fill me with such emotion, especially towards the end. This was a great read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesomeness doesn't inscribe it.Cool no I can't find a word to to describe it that's how a some it is.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It's kind of sad to see the end of this series...Author Brandon Sanderson did an excellent job finishing it up after Jordan's death and this last book was a phenomenal end to the series.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|The best picture ever!!! What a classic Masterpiece. The best special effects, edits, picture, themes, and philosophical message!! Where are the Oscars??
B000091OB6|5.0|One of the best progressive metal album ever made, incredible musicianship, technically proficient. Great artwork, powerful stuff from start to finish..
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's super easy and well made . But I think it works so well that they should make one for kids like a parent to help with homework
B007D2XSW0|1.0|RIGHT WHEN UR DONE INSTALLING AND UR READY TO PLAY THE  game ur KINDLE  crashes took 2 days to fix WHEN I GOT BACK ON NOTHING WOULD LOAD I SAT THEIR FOR Aa GOOD 30 MINUTES DO NOT INSTALL MAY BE FREE BUT WILL MESS UP YOUR DEVICE NOW BECAUSE OF THAT APP MY KINDELS SLOW!!!!!!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|It wasn't what I expected, but I enjoyed the movie very much.  Have shared it with others and we have all liked it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The fun game the best game of all I like the game like the movie I fell like if I am seeing it aging
B006S01GH2|5.0|This is a very unusual movie, but it moves in a fast but entertaining pace. You don't actually realize it is in subtitles... it doesn't<br />matter, in fact it makes it all the better.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Amazing synths, beats, and melody. Lyrics are amazing and APPLAUSE worthy. Also pre-order ARTPOP on Amazon when available and on iTunes now!
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|Like Buble does for the music of Senatra, Caro does for a slice of time when the world was full of possibilities.  Riviera Life just takes me to sunny, tree-lined blvds, fresh with beautiful women of the 40's and 50's in sunglasses and pretty sun dresses.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I really love this album missed them in Sturgis due to some bad planning. Now I want to buy the new explicit album The Strange Case and cant find it in cd form, only mp3. At least I can't see where it's marked \\"Eplicit\\". Any ideas??
B000BU0C98|5.0|Straight in your face blues, John covers some Jimi Hendrix and Ray Charles just a great concert all around. You will not be disappointed.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is very entertaining when your trying to pass time. Be warned some pictures are very difficult to pass but all in all I love it!
B0056EB8QA|5.0|I love this album all the way through!! if you like anything from this band start with Land of rape and honey on!
B002AS466O|4.0|This is Willis in top form. In the mould of the hard boiled pulps of the 30's (including Hammett's, Continental Op) he plays a down and out private detective, a former secret service operative who saved a  President's life. He takes a bodyguard job passed on by his best friend, also a PI, who is sleeping with his wife. From then on it is murder, violence, blackmailing, civic corruption, and his 13 year old daughter who spouts profanity. More than most films,  the movie goes from one confrontation to another, from one act of violence to another, from one killing to another, all devised so as to show the cynicism and simmering violence in the Willis character. He is excellent, so is the supporting cast which, by reflection, enhances the Willis character. For anyone into the old-fashioned private eye style, this is likely to be gratifying.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|I'm so tired of dealing with this... Videos never play without a problem... Bandwidth is never sufficient... Prime does not work in this instance.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Gave me insight into the lives of Afghans.I enjoyed the before and after story line. It keeps you thinking about how great it is to live in the U.S.
B005X7HAAS|5.0|If you like those mafia type movies then this is perfect. Probably one of the best Yakuza movies this generation. The 2nd one is good as well but I don't know when it comes out in the US.
B005544V6A|5.0|It's a fast-paced TV series with mature themes.  There's romance, bantering, and 'chick-appealing' sensitivity.  The<br />characters are interesting, intelligent, and of all ages. Check out fashions on 'hot' men and women!<br /><br />It reminds me of a legal Star Trek.  Cases that demand 'outside the box' solutions are won by determined and extremely clever 'suits'.  We see enough of their personal lives<br />to keep everyone happy!  Great rock soundtrack and New<br />York aerial shots.
B005HEDIHG|4.0|OK- We all know and love Star Trek as we zip thru space light years at a time. This series is great fun. No analysis ~ just enjoy it!
B00003CXFV|5.0|Julia Roberts at her best.  She plays a character I don't even like, but she plays it well and it's an excellent movie. I suppose you can admire Erin, but not really like her.  She alienates everyone around her.  She complains of the men in her past, but she walks all over two good men ( her boss and her boyfriend ) in the present.  It would be interesting to see what the men in her past thought of her.  This is not to say the character is not interesting; she is.  But it's the one and only time I found Julia Roberts unappealing.  Which is probably just right for the movie.<br /><br />Albert Finney ( no surprise here ) is excellent.<br /><br />The movie is exciting with it's share of heartbreak and humor.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The novel was quite distracting with the development of too many characters all at the same time.  It just kept moving from one to another and how they all tied in together ultimately was disjointed. Perhaps this could have been turned into a number of short stories.
0553386697|4.0|Interesting and informative.  I recommend getting to know the brain behind the behavior and this makes a great handbook for that.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|its like bejeweled  there are multiple games to choose from so you don't get bored  i spend hours playing it
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This series is excellent and I'm so sorry there are only seven seasons. I have been taking my time with it because I want to savor it. Excellent storyline, excellent actors, excellent all around.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|my grandchildren are 5 &8  they love watching this movie  it is very entertaining  it has a lot of funny parts & some sad parts  has a great ending
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|This is an amazing book, it's a nice quick read but it's still is an awesome story I would highly recommend reading it
B00D2K40WY|5.0|my granddaughts love this game  they spend hours playing it  it is very easy to use  when you 1st get it withouy buying it you only get one girl to dress up but the 2.99 is worth getting all the girls & dresses
B0014VQGX4|4.0|My 2 year and half son really loves it except it is too much elaborate for children. I totally recommend it to those who looking for heavy loaders for their children.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An AWESOME book!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Amazing words make me feel like I'm really in the story!!!!!!!<br />Gory and bloody! With a good storyline!
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Really loved it. My only beef is that there weren't more tracks. The funniest lyrics for me from the album goes like this: &#34;What you doing in the club on a thursday. She say she only here for her girl birthday. She ordered champagne but still look thirsty. Rock forever 21 but just turned thirty&#34;. I laughed superhard upon hearing that. Many more clever lyrics in the album.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is my go to pass the time game! I love the challenges and all the different boards.  The graphics are fantastic.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I liked this movie. Though it was completely predictable, it was still a nice movie to enjoy at home. I wouldn't want to spend movie theater prices though.
0385349947|5.0|I was not interested in reading this book at first because of all the negative publicity but decided to read it after watching Sandberg's TED talk. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved this book! What a creative, engaging, and compassionate way to hear about an important issue affecting the way women work differently from men. I found Sandberg's book far from the militant feminism than I had expected and much more courageous. By opening her own choices up to international scrutiny, and speaking candidly (and compassionately) about the choices that women make that contribute to inequality I think Sandberg has positively impacted women everywhere. As a vocational psychologist, I recommend this book to every woman (men could benefit too!).
B0031Q0XCA|1.0|I was completely bored and had to turn it off even though I paid for it. I guess it might work for a Sunday afternoon nap.
0770437400|5.0|I really liked this book.  It was a Zombie book that wasn't really about zombies.  It was more of a sociological study of how different populations deal with things.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|huge fan of Gaga. She's back, better than ever. I will continue to support her and will probably buy this track 20 more times!
1475143389|5.0|I bought this book with some reservations because I have been victim to many of the workout myths out there for a while. The scientific approach to the subject of weight training and dieting was really refreshing. After reading the first chapter, I read the whole book in one sitting - an easy read for your not-so-typical bookworm. What I liked most about this book was that it lays down the fundamentals of training and dieting in a simple yet scientific manner all while making complicated topics and ideas easy to understand for anyone. I have been on Mike's program for about 3 months now and I've been able to cut fat weight while maintaining most of my muscle gains - a feat I have only been able to accomplish now with the help of this book. I strongly recommend this book to anyone serious about getting bigger leaner and stronger!
1475143389|5.0|Mike Matthews does an admirable job of cutting out the ridiculous hype and unfounded trends and claims while providing the reader with a great foundation of nutrition and workout programming.<br /><br />I've been lifting for over 6 years and it's nice to find a resource that collates much of the best research regarding what's most effective in one place. I also appreciate that he takes that time to give readers who might be new to the muscle game a pretty thorough dictionary of the terms that get used regarding nutrition, workouts and physiology.<br /><br />With that being said I still feel his nutritional advice, while still credible, inches a little toward the fat-phobic end of the spectrum with suggestions to keep saturated fat below 10% of calories for instance. It would also be nice to have some more attention paid to developing small difficult body parts like calves which aren't really addressed in the book.<br /><br />All in all though this is a very accessible, informative and just down to earth resource that can benefit the uninitiated or experienced alike.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I like it best when the story is told at the right speed; this movie revealed the story in a believable manner with just enough realism at times to avoid complete suspension of belief. My imagination was captured by the terrific cinematography and the concept of &#34;question everything&#34; is relevant here.<br /><br />Something about when you have that &#34;gut feeling&#34; must be connected to the universal equalizer...enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I might be late to the game as an avid viewer but that doesn't diminsh my love for the storylines, characters and general feel of the show.  Once I started watching I was hooked.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|App works great, would be even better if you could see how any views the items you are selling have. Love my Kindle and it's great to be able to use EBay  on it
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I found the book touching in many respects.  Good solid writing style, a great summer read.  I recommend it highly.
B00B9366VO|5.0|An amazing story that is masterfully put together. Entertaining throughout. A lot of rock & roll history summed up in this doc. A must see for any music fan.
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|I purchased this set for my daughter today. Like those previous, I quickly realized that Sofia and Amber's heads were a problem. I quickly called the manufacturer and was told that replacement dolls will be mailed to me. They have changed the neck design.
0307352145|3.0|As an introvert, myself, I thought I might learn something. I guess I did learn that there have been studies showing that western culture is geared towards the extrovert. In my opinion, the tone occasionally veered towards whining about how introverts get the short end of the stick. Other than that, I didn't find the book to have much to say beyond \\"people are complicated\\".
161655164X|5.0|If you just can't get enough from this awesome game, go for it, and for the artists, tons of inspiration.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|One of the better versions of sudoku that I've tried. Free. Nice design. Easy to play. Simple interface. Great way to kill time and exercise the mind.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I play this with my grandkids and I don.t know who enjoys it more! It just makes you laugh. There is no thinking required.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We love this movie! So many great lines that my husband and 4 kids quote constantly! We never get tired of this movie.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a light game to play that doesn't take alot of concentration. You can leave it and come back.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I could relate to much of what she had to say from personal experience - very similar insecurities and the insights she brings to ways to approach changing the conversation.  I appreciate that she's talking from experience - this isn't some academic touting theories that sound good in practice but which wouldn't work in the real world.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|My Son and I watched this movie and he didn't know it was a cartoon because the graphics were so good.  Great movie fun to watch.
B0037NVM2C|2.0|I understand this is the director's original concept and the edited version was in the theaters, I personally didn't care for the directors cut.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Great movie.. Great great great.. My 3 yr old loved this movie and we had to get a  costume just because of it.  We have watched it a dozen times =)
0316247545|5.0|This book was jam packed with information about My Little Ponies.  I enjoyed going through it and reading all the information about MLP.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.. very different than most movies.. quite a twist.. Sam Rockwell played a very good role...  I cant complain about this movie at all..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The CLUES are all there; just need to find all of them and figure out what goes where. Each level is a new challenge and requires the user to think - sometimes logically and other times creatively.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Loved the pleasant quiet alarm! It's nice to be able to dim the light on the clock and wake up peacefully!
B0085OEU1I|5.0|Funny, dark, great preformances by all the actors. All my favorites, I can sing along with it, I have watched it so often.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I am addicted to Jack Reacher books!! I picked one up when I needed a book to read and my husband had one on his Kindle. Now we have read almost all of the series and look forward to the new book coming out soon. Jack, what a smooth mover and so smart!! Lee Childs has a most amazing imagination and it's refreshing to see an author who can create a new scenerio with each book.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|Perhaps a little too cheesy.  Could use a tad more humor.  It does present a good platform to evolve from and that certainly happened.  Good for Captain America.
1250029465|5.0|The author and and his street cat Bob are a sweet and inspiring story. For animal lovers everywhere. Hope they have a terrific life together.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|So addictive! It is hard to put down once you start. Just wish there were more levels to build on.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|When we meet main character Victoria she seems self-destructive and anchor-less.  By the end, her life does not look so much like a statistic of the foster care system but like a real life, with troubles and joy, family and friends, work and leisure.  Unlike anything I've read recently.  Fitting for young adults as well as older adults like me.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|the chemistry took a while to develop between the two but they really are a good match. the story lines are also pretty good - not the traditional run of the mill kind of story line.  the side characters, like the plow truck driver, are also a good additions the the episodes.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|It is a great album.  I especially love make the stars dance.  Great song. It is worth the purchase. for
1936608898|5.0|My body is healing. Daily headaches are gone. Pain in my knees and hips...gone... what more can I say...Just do it. try it for a month...see if it makes a difference. What have you got to lose except illness, headaches, joint pain...etc..
B0026KX6TY|5.0|This was a great family movie.  Even our teenager liked it.  The boy who played Josh was great.  Would watch it again
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is a fun and addicting game!!! I play it all the time racing around anxious to try so nachos lair :)
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is lots of fun and challenging. I  play every day and can't stop trying to beat my best score.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the bomb. It is super fun as worth the download. It's definitely based on the movie. Something the YOU should download and enjoy
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome series! Thrilled I received it expediciously.  Can't wait for the next season to be released. A real treat for all.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this so much! 10x better than pinning on the computer which is so slow! The only problem is that I've come across a few questionable things on pinterest on this app and I haven't been able to report it!!
B005XN0SGU|4.0|Got this to read comic books on my kindle. love it!! one two three four five six seven eight nine
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a amazing you can mix trucks,cars, an  levels. I love it. When you try I already know that you will love it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The book is written very well, catching and exciting.<br />You live and learn with the main character. I love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game or app cuz it is fun for my brothers and sisters I don't know what I would do with out it
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a really fun game I have like 5games like this one's and they are all really fun games
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this app I don't have to check my email online I can just check the app I can use it any where
B009PK9SB8|5.0|it did what it was ment to, so nothing else to add.. great product, great brand, amazing characteristics. Buy it now
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman has a great writing style, delivering the scary side of fantasy with just the right light touch.  This book is just a perfect example.
B003AVMUU4|4.0|Wonderful toy.  Bought the original Brio train for my 32 year old son.  Still working beautifully, but we bought this for our 3 year old grandson.  Still great quality and worth hours of fun time for a little train lover (and the grown up ones too.).  However, some of the pieces on the actual train come off and can get lost.
B001L5YW9I|2.0|After spending time to watch this movie, I can tell you with confidence that the book is much more exciting.
B009K86D86|5.0|Everyone should be required to watch this. Think you understand how the food industry works? Are you sure? Care to bet?
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I use this quite a bit but I really don't like all the advertisements.  As is typical, it doesn't give the forecast for my exact position, but rather calculates it from a more common city.  In my case, that is nearly 20 miles away and at a lower altitude.  Also typical, the temps are usually incorrect by 5-8 degrees on the hot days, and maybe something less on the colder days.  It's still a handy tool and once you get comfortable with the differences it is easy enough to live with.
B002P79KAC|5.0|This ensemble is fantastic from Season 1 Episode 1.  But you'll fall in love with Penny.  This character endures soooo much that no ordinary real life woman ever would.  And that's why we love her.  Kelly Cuoco has struck the mother lode.
B000024KRO|5.0|These guys still ROCK!!  Some really great material on this recording!<br /><br />Steve Morse sounds like he's always been part of DP!!  Definitely worth the price!!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Very addictive game. Quick gameplay and graphics are awesome. I love that it is different from the pc version, because I already loved that one.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|Phil does it again! His vocals are always stellar...the heaviness of the music is awesome! I will buy any record with his name attached to it :)
B00DU73T08|4.0|I had not previously heard of this movie. It sounded interesting and did not disappoint. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys sci-fi. I was a little worried from the description that it would be a chick flick. Although there is a romance element to it, that is really secondary to the main theme of the movie.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Several disturbing inaccuracies. Disappointed in the &#34;confidence&#34;Aslan places in canonical sources, using them without question to make his points. Jesus may have been a zealot but Aslan has not demonstrated that conclusively.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Absolutely the best in HD!  Like watching it for the first time.  Classic stories that stand the test of time.
0312330537|3.0|The book was more used than I expected and it arrived later than the other book I ordered after Shantaram.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Ap is easy to use, provides great information and is overall a very useful tool. Want more words, how about Bite me.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I rated this 5 stars because I was riveted each episode and looked forward to the next one! I grew attached to the characters and enjoyed the story line.
B006PYHYXG|5.0|It's a monitor extension arm. It works fine and fits the monitor arm it was made for. Not sure what else there is to say.
030758836X|2.0|I gave this book 2 stars because it was a rollicking potboiler.  The kind of book you madly read, then throw away once finished, and immediately forget.  The characters were all seriously flawed.  As someone with psychological training, I was amazed and a bit concerned at how accurately the author was able to depict all the characteristics of borderline personality disorder in Amy.  I kept reading and kept hoping that something meaningful would come out of the book.  But nothing did.  And the ending was just such a big cop out that I was appalled this book got such high praise.  It is definitely not literature.  It is also not even well written.  But it must have been superbly marketed. A film of the book coming out in 2014 attests to that.  I must say that I read it out of curiosity.  So the marketing hype definitely worked.  That was all that did work though.  Don't waste your time or money on this one please.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love and am totally hooked on this series, so purchasing the DVD's was a must.  I must say I'm more of a fan of the first five seasons that the ones that have followed.  For too long,  ( seasons 6,7) Sam was a hero  smart ass and Dean was just angry and whiny. However, season eight seems to be trying to get the brothers back to their true selves.  Still not there yet.  I have high hopes for season 9.  They just need to ease up on the nerd factor, though. :-).
B008HK3XOU|3.0|It serves well as a protective cover but, the nonstop surface wore down in a couple of weeks. I will likely recover that surface myself with something else or place a silicon dot on the corners to provide a better grip.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is really good. The auto move feature sometimes moves the wrong thing or to the wrong place adding moves. Other than that it is everything expected.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Loved it!  One can't  imagine how wonderful life becomes by the addition of a pet.  Can't and don't ever want to live without a loving animal!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large size letters. Great to have@ my finger tips. Accurate and Easy to use. Easy to see. Two can see the numbers at the same time.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|entertaining and keeps your attention. Not a barn burning page turner but still a fast and attention maintaining read. Recommended.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|This game is well executed and fun to play. The music is my favorite part so far, but the challenge of seeing what will happen after a simple move is very satisfying.
B000XXLY8G|5.0|This is a very good product , i will recommend to all whoever is want to buy this item. Its really good one.
B00CW665VI|1.0|I just did not feel any connection to the characters.  I always continue with a series once I start it.  i do not care what happens to these characters.
B00BGPKCO2|5.0|Was the subject book for our book club at church for the month of July.  EVERYONE loved it.  Personally it gave me an insight to autism.  I never really understood much about it before.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This was a great game until August 12.  That was when an automatic &quot;:upgrade&quot; took away the smooth-running game I had played quite regularly with a monstronsity that jitters and pauses randomly. A once relaxing, fun game is now unlike staring into a strobe light that fires at a rapid but random pace.  Skill no longer matters since success is based on the luck of when the game decides to randomly pause and ignore user input for 1/10 of a second.<br /><br />The enough-running, interesting and relaxing Temple Run 2 is dead. An annoying mess has taken its place on the Kindle Fire.
B008Y768XO|5.0|This movie is a story based on true events which took place in Japan, I Believe!  Loyalty is the value taught here, How often in today's society is a mans word or promis worthless? When I sat man I mean all mankind, male or female, young or old Rich or poor,
B0094K1K42|3.0|I did manage to stay with this film to the end because I love Charlize Theron, but there were too many unbelievable moments and also too many cringe-worthy ones!!
B00AKKS278|4.0|Motivating and inspiring, to the point. A quick and easy read. I am on week 6 of rising at 5am or earlier, on my own accord. And loving it!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|There are a lot of people confused by the Cast resolution settings in Chrome vs the (nonexistent) HDMI resolution settings.  The HDMI output of the Chromecast device appears to be fixed at 1080P as soon as it hits the welcome screen.  The output is at a lower resolution as it boots, and is viewable for a moment on lower than 1080P resolution displays.<br /><br />If your display, or any devices between your display and Chromecast (receiver, etc.), do not support 1080P, then you will get no joy.  The Casting resolution issues are purely about the quality of the display that you get and not about a failure to display at all, so are less of an issue than HDMI resolution.<br /><br />Google needs to either fix this issue or be clear about the system requirements, as they are entirely focused on the requirement of the machine running Chrome at the moment, and not the Chromecast device or connected display.<br /><br />Google has also advertised devices as connectable which are not at this time. No iOS device support on release even though they clearly state that it's available.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Tricky but Fun game to pass the time! Every level that I pass I'm intrigued to find out what the have next!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Threat game to biuld and create your own world. good for all ages over  twelve.  Wish there was a was to get cash though
1416500294|5.0|This is a great book. Fairly short, but so classic and so entertaining. The characters are engaging and the book does not become too slow from what I remember. I would read it again.
B009NX409M|5.0|I loved this movie because both of the stars were very convincing in their roles and it was quite a simple story but it held my interest.
B008NW67E0|4.0|Bought it for my daughter for Christmas last year.  She was happy to receive it and enjoys listening to it.
B002413TY2|4.0|If you want basic Jason action this is a good flick. 9 more words required and 2 more now yes!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Comedy, action, romance, social commentary, blood, great actors and great performances.  If you haven't seen this you are in for a treat.
B00821OX98|4.0|I saw Noah Wyle interviewed and had to find this series on line... I always loved him in ER and have not been disapointed.  My teenage godsons have gotten into to it this vacation.  It is great to be able to turn them on to something new... Steven Speilberg as a producer also makes you want to continue to watch the series.
0937381888|5.0|Its called the Home Brew 'Bible' for a reason. This book covers everything from cleaning a bucket to the science of fermentation and details on uses for different hops, grains, etc. A must of you are into brewing your own.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A simple game that is fun to play.  The game looks great on my kindle HD.  Would be nice of you could play in landscape mode.
031606792X|4.0|My nieces kept bugging me to read this series.  I bought all of them on amazon and received them in excellent condition and quickly.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|On my tablet the app won't even open. On my galaxy s2 the app works OK. Ugh this app is frustrating.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of my favorite SciFi books ever.  The rest of the series is interesting but not half as entertaining as this book.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I love a story that moves me to tears. Cranford never fails to make me shed a tear of joy or feel nostalgic for another time and place. The story is fun, serious, complex, and simple. It proves that all things are possible in film.
0375826742|5.0|A great series for anyone into fantasy books. The books are geared towards the &#34;young adult&#34; audience of course so expect the story to be set up that way. Great characters, world, story, and ending.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Anyone who loves music as a listener, player, collector, historian or just a curious bystander will love this movie. It was great.
B0081336FO|5.0|Moffat delivers again in this retelling of Sherlock Holmes. A combination of classical Sherlock with new details added. Humor and cleverness abound and make this an interesting watch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pintrest is amazing there are things like cooking arts and crafts fashion and gardening ideas and tips it has changed my life
B00385TM3K|4.0|I am always surprised when I meet a Douglas fan who hasn't seen this.  One of his better films with lots of action. If you haven't seen this you are in for a treat.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|This soundtrack is awesome in the movie and this is why I purchased it to listen to. Anyone who enjoyed the movie should like the soundtrack as well. I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again either.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|This is the best installment of HP up to its point. Dumbledore's character does not fit the book's version in my opinion but overall, nicely done. Received it on the expected delivery date to boot.
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|I purchased this book to learn and understand how HTML5 works but in the end I learned a lot more. I have stronger understanding of the internet and new motivation to what I want to do in the end.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Finally, wizards has released an mtg app for android. MTG2k14 is wonderful, it will entertain you for hours, enen for the trial version. It does have a few problems that should get fixed, until then its a 4 star app.<br /><br />-There is no exit button to close the app.<br />-Sealed campaign is very short<br />-Audio is a bit buggy, sometimes it will continue to play the fire crackle sound effect when you press the.home button. Audio will sometimes cut out completely if the sound volume is modified from the kindle's settings.<br />-Buying the full version does NOT unlock any decks or cards for campaign. These must be unlocked via gameplay or bought seperately.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I thought the flow of the plot and the development of the characters was refreshing. I actually felt I was experience the unfolding of events as they happened to the character and was not able to necessarily figure out the full plot by the middle of the movie as most action movies these days. I would suggest a must watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the series,  can't wait for season 4! Amazon Prime had it for free,  playback was flawless and I love the closed caption and the xray options.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|An above average movie-based build app. The graphics look good and I like how it's not just a build based game and that you can actually build an army and fight through numerous battle missions. Another plus is that it's not money based, You can actually do a lot of stuff with just the resources you gain and not have to pay for jack, Unlike quite a few other free build apps I could mention. That's a huge plus.<br /><br />I wish you could actually control characters that you attack instead of just build the army, setting up the troops, and letting the AI duke it out to see who wins. It'd be nice to control characters because battle outcomes would be different, I'd immediately go after the strongest guy instead of fighting with the weaker ones because the strongest enemy could take a guy out in 1 hit while it takes 2-3 for the other guys.<br /><br />Overall, the Epic app is at the very least worth checking out, Especially if you like the film or simply enjoy build apps. That being said, It doesn't do much originality wise to separate itself from other apps like it and that's what stops it from being great.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|This movie was awesome and having the DVD so I can watch it anytime I like is great. DVD works great and was able to put the movie on my iPhone with no trouble.
B0051UH6YM|5.0|This book is a most entertaining read for a book on punctuation.  The way Truss portrays her lessons on punctuation with her humorous anecdotes makes it a most enjoyable way to learn proper punctuation.  I keep it with my other greats for writing, alongside Strunk and White's Elements of Style and King's On Writing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is really fun when you get good maps please put more vehicles in the game<br />I would love a bycicle in the game
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for #6!! Great book! Come on mr. Martin, write more for all the fans out here! Please. Great read!
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors that is still writing.  He is playful and haunting.  His thoughts will permeate your dreams at night and cloud your thoughts during the day.  Read everything he has written.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Great movie from Studio Ghibli. A bit gory, especially towards the beginning (guys heads and arms shot off with arrows) but the movie as a whole is pretty darn good.
B002NV9AH8|5.0|Tony Banks is a great writer and player he shows it here! Forever Morning, Somebody elses Dream, From The Undertow, The Lie and After the Lie are some of Tony's best work. Tony used Chester Thomson here and is positive proof that Genesis were stronger as solo acts.
B00BJS7104|5.0|While this movie is not for the soft viewer it carries a realistic story in history. Being able to capture a time , place and sad history of our country it allows us to try to imagine how things were. We have obviously have come a long way. But could be seen as an  over the top display of entertainment. It being a show of negative, hate , goodwill and drive of men black & white. It also shows an opposite practice of  black males abandoning their women and family. This movie illustrates different. A black man stopping at nothing to get his love back while dealing all kinds of obstacles. Good watching lots of adult situations and I do recommend. Try and watch it without closing your eyes or disputing it. Watch, think about it it, you too may see many interesting acts of human and inhumane behaviors that all men and women can appreciate that is captured in a movie.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|What more can I say.  There is something about this movie that I just enjoy.  No violence, no cursing, no slapstick non-funny so-called comedy by any Saturday Night Live characters;  just an enjoyable movie for the entire family to watch.  Watched it 5 times now and will probably watch it again some day.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is so much fun it take some time to get used to it but once you do it is fun fun fun and  I got a high score and one of my game a great pastime and the sound effects are very funny love this game very much it's great
0375823352|5.0|This is a great work of fiction that all people will enjoy.  The story has many twists and turns and every direction it takes you is enjoyable.  In many ways it is a children's story, but I really think the story just has children as the main characters.  (Kind of like Ender's Game.  The children are completing the action of the story, but there is more going on than that.)  Lyra acts as an adult that has to make decisions and stick to them.  The story show the importance of responsibility and the consequences of your actions.  If you are a fan of science fiction then you should read this book.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I thought this was the game as i did not pay attention to what it was.  I dont understand how you dont have the game, but have a cheats app.  disappointing.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|The Metal Gear Solid series has been my favorite franchise in the gaming industry. In the past I've had to trade in my previous Metal gear games to buy new games but with this collection, you'll be able to understand the Metal Gear saga perfectly.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book was OK but the mission was a very small part of the book. It makes sense, though, as how much can you write about 1 operation?
B0094BB4TW|3.0|They keep changing things on Facebook.  Too much information is available to too many people.  As much security as there is, people can still get into accounts.  When I first joined Facebook, it was simple and now it has become too much to handle.  I've started to pull back, and don't post as many pictures as I used to.  I'm going back to email for private matters.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Another hit! The story pulls you in and is filled with twists you don't see coming! Can't wait to read the next one!
B00847KFDS|5.0|If you were a CCR fan back in the day, this is an album you gotta hear. While never as good as the originals, this is a very interesting take on Fogerty's classic songs. I bought it & if you are a serious music collector or CCR fan, you should buy it too.<br />Also, Rolling Stone rated it 5 stars, and that almost never happens.<br />Good album!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game love to play it with my son and challenge  my wife can't wait to beat it and start a new one works great on my kindle.
0399162097|5.0|This book was hard for me to review because it was so different than anything I have ever read.  It is beautifully written and early on you get to know and understand most of the family dynamics.<br /><br />This is a brilliant idea for a novel.  It is... poignant, funny, interesting, tragic and heartbreaking.  You get to know Rosemary as a young child, an adolescent, college student and finally an adult.  The author takes you from hilarity to chaos every few pages.<br /><br />She is such an incredible story teller that you are almost tricked into thinking you are reading a memoir.<br /><br />This story isn't for everyone. As the owner of 4 rescue dogs, I had a hard time reading through some of the chapters dealing with unnecessary experiments because by this time you really see Fern as a sister and nothing else. If you can get by this, you will enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />This is by far one of the best books I have read this year. On the last page I actually cried.<br /><br />Thank you Karen Joy Fowler for such an incredible read.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Sivers presents a vision of entrepreneurialism unlike anything I've encountered before. His can-do, must-create, customer-love instead of consumer-manipulation philosophy is similar to Seth Godin's (I actually got turned on to this book by Seth's blog), so if you jive with that then this book is probably right up your alley. Unlike much of Godin's work, this book is a sort of venture autobiography, going over how CDBaby grew, what Siver's mindset was, why he made the decisions he did, and why he thinks entrepreneurial ventures (based off of his experience) are so invigorating and worthwhile. His philosophy and approach to business is not for everyone, and he makes that disclaimer early on, but regardless of whether you're 100% in the same boat (I'm not), there's a lot of wisdom to be found in this 1 hour read.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is all around great. Not a bad song on it. Is my go to album when nothing else will do.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I loved this app. It's super easy to use. If only they would change it so you can view the contents you have stored on the app from you amazon account. That would be extremely helpful. My kindle crashed and now I can't access the stuff I need to that is stored on that app. Bummer. But otherwise it was AWESOME! (:
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I was excited about reading this book after the great reviews its received. Blah. In no way lived up to the hype. I kept waiting for it to take off and it never did.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|ok i bought it thinking it would ok .. but boy was i wrong<br />its addictive as any game ive played yes its a little slow in the early stages<br />you have to get past the first few that are easy as you learn the game but then OMG wow<br />i was addicted LOL i played every chance i got and now Ive beaten them all on all levels and i am just waiting<br />for a new update for more virus types.<br /><br />Think of it like RisK LOL but your a virus :-)<br />its a great game at a great price and I LOVE that you dont have to spend any money to<br />but the other plague types you just have to spend some time to unlock them and yes I unlocked them all<br />by just playing the game

B00DF0POXA|4.0|This album is very dark compared to the last. Overall a good album with good flow ...but maybe some anger management therapy....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very challenging game. you really have to think outside of the box to make it thru some of the levels.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Don't kid yourself, there are 100 different devices that do what this does, but better. It's not revolutionary. It's not evolutionary. It's just a inexpensive toy from google.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong, it does make watching porn a heck of a lot easier.
0307474259|5.0|Since reading this book I have lost 30 pounds, and I'm still losing.  I bought the paper version so my wife could read it as well, as she was wondering why I was losing weight.  If you are thinking this is a typical diet book, you will be surprised by this one,  First of all, most of the book lays out the medical basis for the diet, complete with illustrations and references to studies.  Only in the last chapter or two are diet suggestions included.  Typical diet books explain the basis of the diet in the first chapter, and then spend the rest of the book on diet recommendations, recipes, and exercise routines.<br /><br />This format is much more effective for me.  Also, after reading this book, you will realize that most of the nutritional and diet advice you have heard about all your life is wrong.  It is a real paradigm shift if you are like me. But following the advice in the book has enabled me to lose after almost 50 years of trying to lose and keep off pounds. Way recommended!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Having read some other books about this topic, I was disappointed in this one.  I can't think of a good way to describe it but all I can do is give this one 2 stars just for effort.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the BEST BOND in years and believe me as a child of the 60s I have seen them all and multiple times.  I have every one and this movie is the one I can watch over and over.  Craig (and I am sorry Sean Connery) is now my favorite Bond.  This sealed the deal.  What I like about this movie is the abscence of campy lines - all the excess women - and yes the stupid gadgetry.  What I love about this movie is Craig raw and emotional.  This man rocks as Bond.  His essense is palpable.  I like the introduction of Ben Wishaw as Q - so geeky sexy - and of course MONEYPENNY!  This is a kick ass Bond and I cannot wait for the next.
0385737955|5.0|I read it for the first time a few years ago and decided to re-read it, as well as the rest of the series, and it was just as wonderful, if not better, than I remember. Even when I had other things to attend to, I couldn't bring myself to put it down; I think I finished it in about a day.<br /><br />I was constantly kept on edge by what was going to come next and I felt myself emotionally invested with the characters, Thomas especially, right from the start.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I thought this was a great book. I would recommend it to anyone.  If you like conspiracy theories you will especially like it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW. All actors play very well. it's both drama and comedy. I am addicted to it. Highly recommended.
B008XG1X18|4.0|huge waste of time...in a good way. I use it for my love of art, love of books, love of dancing, love of all things cute and awesome, etc.
B00CS65JS2|3.0|RAM does a great job of updating that soul/disco 70s thing, kind of the way Jamiroquai did in the late 90s.  And I think in five years, it will probably be as memorable as Jamiroquai.  Meaning, probably not very.  Still &#34;Get Lucky&#34; is a great groove, and the rest of the album does a good job of continuing with that same feel, even if the other tracks aren't as catchy.  Kind of makes me think of a disco concept album or something . . .
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|GREAT DVD...GREAT ROCK N ROLL....I bought this for my sister and I to watch because we have always been Huge Aerosmith Fans and we were not disappointed. We watched it twice!! Steven Tyler is amazing and Joe Perry is Smokin Hot Mmmmm!! We had a blast watching it! It is a Great Addition to my library. If you like Aerosmith you are missing out by not grabbing a copy of this for yourself. BUY IT.

B008O037RG|5.0|Proud to say I'm expanding my vinyl library! After I saw these guys live in Portlandia, I couldn't not buy their albums. The quality is much better than on the cd, and the songs are just fascinating.
0920236162|4.0|My 3 year old daughter loved this story.  I liked the fact that it was a change from your standard princess story.  I just wish Ronald, the prince in the book, wasn't such a bum.  My daughter did learn something from him though.  The learned what being rude was, but she couldn't understand why someone would be rude.<br /><br />Overall, I'd strongly recommend the book for a 2 1/2 year plus child.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A moving read, a charming story. You will feel wrung out and happy to have read it. I'm so pleased that I did.
B004XXIHS2|4.0|If you like suspense Levin is for you! This book wasn't terrifying so much as made me paranoid of my boyfriend of the time. HAHA! Anything by levin is a nice quick read with very interesting twists.

B003L16FAE|5.0|Before purchasing this movie, I did have reservations on how the transfer to Blu-ray was going to look.<br />I have this on dvd and the quality of the picture and sound is not great.<br />However, this movie looks fantastic on my LG 55inch TV. The picture quality has a more realistic image and look.<br />Im glad I bought this and 1st thing tomorrow im going to do is dump my old dvd copy.
0142501123|5.0|I love reading this book to my then 3 and now 4 year old daughter.  The rhyme of this book is great.  It is consistent within each section and some components keep coming back page after page.  Initially, I was confused by the reviews on Amazon that mentioned the french fries, but now I get it.  I love doing the voices for this book.  I'm happy that we've read it at least once a week since October of last year.  We gave it to my 5 year old niece, and she likes it too.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Always have love the Star Trek Series and this one is no exception. Now my grandson is hooked on it.

B0095P33IW|5.0|I love this movie.  Could watch it every month!  Good Action, Good Heroes  villans maybe a little over the top

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the grandeur, the clothes, the ambiance of the abbey, and the characters.  My husband and i are both hooked. Can't wait for season 4!
0062255657|5.0|How to describe this book?  Think back to your childhood.  Is there a memory, a little fuzzy around the edges, where you're not quite sure what happened?  Something just slightly unbelievable, that you dismiss for the more rational answer?  Well, maybe you had an encounter at the edge of faerie.<br />Gaiman has such a talent at capturing the magic, both light and dark, in the every day.  As I read this I can only think that this is how we were given the gift that is Neil Gaiman.  A young boy who encountered magic and spends his life trying to capture it, and give it to the rest of us.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was suggested at our Book Club as a book to read...that was a year ago.  One  of the women in our group said that she would not read a book where children were killed.  Based on her comment, we voted No to reading it.  It took me one year to decide to read the book and I am going to tell her at our next meeting how wrong she was about the book.  It's about government control over people.  I then read the next two books in the series.  It took me 2 weeks to read all 3 three books.
B005LAII12|5.0|One of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen.  Not for children.  I had watched it via Netflix, but needed to own that one.  Ted can come and live with me anytime.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|We waited a long time for this and BOC finally delivered. I was starting to think they were done. Tomorrow's Harvest is very dark and atmospheric. Great moods. I've listened to it about 10 times now and it keeps getting better. Definitely in my top 3 albums of 2013.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|First let me say good book a inventive new world for readers to experience. At first it developed slow but for the story itself time was necessary to develop the characters and the story. I fell in love with kalidon he brought me in to the story with his emotional struggles and I'm interested to see how the other story's meld together in future novels. Really looking forward to the next book
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|Great product, good quality. It is light due the material and easy to carry.<br />it works great and well built.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Highly educational background on a grass roots gang of sound engineers who demanded as much from their 70's state-of-the-art mix board as of the elite musical rock-n-roll talent.  At the edge of closing shop, a coincidental meeting provided the connection for Sound City to make payroll when a desperate pair of musicians found a home to record.  (Buckingham-Nix) It's a can't miss if you need to expand your rock history.
B00DHRLK84|1.0|If you enjoy zombie movies or read the book do not waste your time with this movie. There are no zombies in the movie, just a bunch of things that run 4 times faster than a humans, so I guess it's a superhero movie with brad pitt as the star.<br /><br />If you like zombies, read the book, its amazing. This film is an insult to it and writing in general. There were so many straight up stupid moments I almost left the movie. The whole reason zombie movies are scary is because there is this huge hoard of unfeeling creatures which will never stop coming after you, just like Jason or Freddy or plenty of others they don't need to hurry...because they always catch you. Unlike a human they never tire out, that's creepy. So why make them run at ludicrous speed?!<br /><br />Uber-stupid writing moments from the film:<br /><br />Example 1: You are a highly trained group of soldiers, a plane needs refueling, and there are creatures running around that are attracted to sound. Do you: Go out in the night when its raining and completely dark riding on bicycles or hmmm wait a few hours for some sunlight...<br /><br />Example 2: Singing on loudspeakers causes zombies to get smarter, adapt and climb a 100 ft wall....<br /><br />Example 3: We are safe on an airplane and after a very long flight the zombie (who normally runs at ludicrous speed) decided to come out of hiding as the plane makes its final descent! OMG ...(I'm picturing the zombie sitting on some luggage drinking a fruit juice as we waits for his perfect moment....)<br /><br />Dramatic moments don't have to be stupid and not follow any logic or rationale. The book is full of creepy moments and it all feels real. THE BOOK ALL FEELS REAL and that is truly scary to convince you of what the a world war against zombies would really look like. You arent questioning it, but just immersed which is quite an achievement, which this movie missed altogether.<br /><br />This movie is a brad pitt film. The book was not about a hero it was about surviving. Brad Pitt does his normal character and he is the hero, the story is just randomness to send him jetsetting across the world so he can save it. Oh brad...the world does not revolve around you buddy. He should not be producing. He had the perfect script and ignored every bit of it to create an insulting film made merely to take your money.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Works well for documents for the most part. Best office suite on android. However, PDF documents are terrible as it seems to loop pages a lot of the time.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|I remember seeing this in the late 80's. When I saw it available on Blu Ray I decided to pick it up. It looks great and still holds up today. The special features are great too. Definitely worth buying.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|THIS VERSION IS A NEWER AND BETTER IMPROVMENT OF THE ORIGINAL. THE GAME PLAY IS THE SAME BUT WITH MORE WAYS TO PLAY AND CONTENT THAT CAN BE BOUGHT.
B0027ZCQ4E|5.0|Maybe it's the best movie in the series, because it's also based on the best book of the series? (just my opinion though)

B00E88YNJY|5.0|Recently there has been a plethora of neo-folk bands and solo singers that have all started to sound the same. Throw in some hand clapping with a little banjo and a group of people shouting the chorus, and it's automatically \\"real\\" and serious music. It's only when comparing some of these bands and singers to the real deal when it becomes clear how average and dull they are. Valerie June is the real deal. She has this music deep in her Jackson, Tennessee born soul. It's not forced or contrived. It's not pop music trying to hide under a few strands of double bass. It's quite frankly some of the best modern fusion folk music to have come from this whole modern folk movement.<br /><br />Let's start with Valerie's voice. Astonishingly unique and instantly identifiable. Part Nina Simone, Billie Holiday and Dolly Parton yet all Valerie. On the more upbeat songs, it tends to go rather flatly stylized very reminiscent of early 1940s folk bands like the Carter Family or Hank Williams.  On the softer songs, her tone is simply flawless showing much more range and a real talent for finding the groove to a song. Genuine and heartfelt, it makes me feel like home.<br /><br />The music is really something special as well. It's not merely borrowing an occasional twang--it is unapologetic folk music. Albeit folk music that has been influenced by the delta blues, Southern spirituals and jazz. In Valerie's own words: \\"It's moonshine roots music.\\" Produced by Kevin Augunas (Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, ZZ Ward) and Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, this album has just enough modern sensibilities to make it much more accessible than old 1920s recordings of traditional Appalachian music. Still you can hear the spirits of Mississippi John Hurt, Doc Boggs, and Elizabeth Cotten  giving their approval and smiling down from above.<br /><br />\\"Workin' Woman Blues\\" sets the tone for the album with its spare guitar line and basic percussion interjected with a jazzy trumpet. Valerie doesn't dress up her brand of folk with trying to make it complicated and needlessly layered--it's the art of minimalism perfected. \\"Twined & Twisted\\" showcases Valerie's ability to both write and sing poignant tales of lost love. She's a troubadour, a wandering minstrel content to play at the campfire after a long day in the saddle. \\"You Can't Be Told\\" kicks things back up a notch with full on backing vocals on the chorus and a funk jazz guitar throwing down a wicked little groove that is sure to get you moving. My favorite though is the matter of fact and slightly morbid \\"One My Way\\" with its soft piano flourishes provided by none other than Booker T and a beautiful fiddle carrying the melody.<br /><br />All in all, really exciting music and a standout voice. Though this is her first full studio album, Valerie has been playing music professionally for about 10 years now,  and you can hear her utter confidence in her sound and where she wants to take you. If you are a fan of any of the singers listed above or into modern bands like the Carolina Chocolate Drops, Alabama Shakes or the Avett Brothers, I bet you'll find something to love here. Highly recommend.ress up her brand of folk with trying to make it complicated and needlessly layered--it's the art of minimalism perfected. \\"Twined & Twisted\\" showcases Valerie's ability to both write and sing poignant tales of lost love.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was just sorry when the book ended!  The author portrays a young girl and then young woman who does everything in her power to protect herself from being loved, something she does not feel she deserves.  Yet, this is done with such compassion, despite brutally &#34;bad&#34; behavior, the reader only wants Victoria to succeed.  The language of the book is as warm as the language of the flowers themselves.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Another winner for the Brits, who know how to weave a story with that special British humor. Wonderful cast and plot. We oldies crave movies like this. Very enjoyable.
B007IV1E2W|5.0|Continues on the story of the Doctor and companions Amy and Rory.  Lots of great stories and engaging characters, especially explaining alot of River Song's backstory and all those &#34;spoilers&#34; a true fan would want to know about.
B000PHX4VA|4.0|I held off buying this set for years because of the ridiculous price (at most places, around $20), but I finally took the plunge today and I suppose I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The good: Excellent sound quality, the best remastering yet and most importantly to me, the glitched intro of 'Don't Stand So Close To Me' has finally been corrected! This buzz & click problem originated with [[ASIN:B000002G23 Message in a Box]] and continued to show up everywhere, even the 2003 Bob Ludwig \\"remaster\\" of [[ASIN:B0006VXMDU Every Breath You Take: The Classics]](shame on you, Bob!)<br /><br />My disappointment is mostly with the running time of the discs.. disc one is under 51 minutes. Nearly 30 more minutes of music could have fit on here, and at this price, it should have.<br /><br />The digipack packaging is nice... anyone who's acquired a Polygram 'Deluxe Edition' will be familiar with the plastic slipcase digipack design. In this case however, we are given a thin paper fold-out booklet which I suppose was necessary for it to unfold to a poster, but I'm the type of guy who wants a sturdy booklet to consult, not a flimsy folded poster I'll never hang & ruin the value of my overpriced Police CD set.<br /><br />So, if you're into sound quality, love The Police and have possibly been bugged by glitches on previous compilations, this is a nice set to have if you can afford it.<br /><br />EDIT: I just found out you can get the U.K. version with 2 bonus tracks from Amazon.co.uk for about $12 U.S., roughly $16 delivered. If only I'd done my research.........

B00COQKE2M|5.0|I really was not looking forward to this CD after hearing Alone, but then when they released the single Fashionably Late I thought I'd give it a chance afterall.  To my surprise it is a really fun CD to listen too (except for a few lackluster songs towards the end).  After some listens through the entire CD I even started liking Alone.  Now some time after it's release I still keep going back to this CD in my car.  I think I like it so much because it's such a mish-mash of genres that you get a little bit of everything in one serving.  The songs contain a variety of Hardcore, Metal, Rock, Pop, Rap, Techno, and Dubstep.  I feel like they splice all of the genres in very nicely without it seeming to gimmicky.  If you're into Falling in Reverse or music that doesn't fit into one specific category I suggest picking it up.  It's not going to be for everybody, but if you give it a shot you just might end up consistently getting some Falling in Reverse cravings.  Cravings similar to that of wanting milk with your chocolate chip cookies.  Only this milk is chocolate, which you find to be a little too chocolately considering the cookies have chocolate chips in them.  But, you enjoy it none the less.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a great way to challenge your mind. It makes you pay attention to everything in the rooms.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|i'm down to the last three boxes and just cant get it,so i quit the game and added it to my collection of unfinished games.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|As soon as you begin the opening page of this novel it grips you and hangs on tightly until the very last page.<br />I don't usually read detective novels involving serial killers but this book has seriously made me reconsider my reading material.<br />The evil mind of the killer Mike/Tom is realistic and filled with malevolent thoughts which draw the reader into his creepy world.<br />The detectives investigating the murders are believable and engaging as we watch them piece the mystery together.<br />The pace of the novel matches the desperation of the police as they close in on their killer, trying to prevent him striking again.<br />The details of his crimes made me squirm but were totally necessary for the realism of this tale.<br />You seriously won't regret purchasing this book; a great find.
0062014536|5.0|Lauren Oliver's writing is beautiful and at times very poetic. I loved Delirium. I loved the romance. Pandemonium was just... ok. Requiem was probably just as good as Delirium, but as others have mentioned before, I also feel like there should at least be a fourth book. There's so many questioned that need to be answered about the ending.<br />*******  SPOILERS  *******  What happened to Tack? Did he stay with Raven the whole time only to allow himself to be killed as well? Julian became stronger than what Lena originally thought of him, but their relationship fizzled out rather quickly, which I was ok with since I originally liked Alex the best. I'm so glad that Alex came back, but why did it take two whole books for them to finally get back together? How come it seemed like Alex and Lena weren't as excited/happy to see each other at the end? And why did Alex let her go even when he said he wouldn't ever again? I like that they were all tearing down the wall and taking back their city and feel like that part got resolved, but still there's so many questions to be answered. I couldn't stop thinking about it all after I finished reading it. Overall, I enjoyed the whole series and would recommend it to others.
B004KPQK2S|3.0|Fun, entertaining story of the fastest horse that ever lived.  Some great action sequences of race horses running. Plot is a little too contrived and acting a little too Disney to appeal to audiences hoping for a more thoughtful drama.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game. very nice graphics. Easy to control.The chain production is the best idea for these kind of games. I recommend this game

B00ALGW286|4.0|This book gives the reader a privileged and interesting insight into Russian life for a young girl in the early 1990s.<br />As the reader follows Marina's story filled with her hopes and dreams of a promising future, we learn of the uncertainty of every day life for Russians in those days and inevitably make comparisons with our own lives.<br />The description of characters was realistic and believable and the portrait of family life and friendships endearing.<br />There is a perfect blend of factual history along with the fictional lives of the characters.

B000O3R1C8|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase. In spite of its ahead, the text looks, feels, and smells nearly new. Pages are pristine and the book is a pleasure to read.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game is really fun once you get to play it but there are major flaws. It takes FOREVER to load you have to go through several loading screens. My granddaughter got extremely frustrated waiting and waiting. I had the game loaded on my kindle fire AND my I-Pod and the SAME problem existed on BOTH devices. I have since deleted the game from BOTH devices.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great show about a young college drop-out that lands a stellar job at a top NY law firm based on his knowledge of the law and photographic memory.  The show has drama, romance and a small bit of action.  FYI this may not be appropriate for younger viewers as sex and a few scenes with drug use on some episodes.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Johnny Depp is fantastic in The Tourist. The DVD is excellent and your service was prompt. Thank you.
B008P9M614|5.0|I bought this series because I'm just plain addicted to this show! It was a great price, arrived on time when they said it would, and is already one of my \\"can't live without\\" sets!! Very happy with this purchase and the fact I can watch my favorite show whenever I want!! Worth the money and so entertaining!!!! And no, I'm not lying!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is beautiful in a sad way. Everyone lives to die. I get that, but why... I don't want to spoil anything for people but you will ask why when you get further into the book... John Green is an amazing author and this book really did make me cry at the end. It made me think \\"I should start YOLO-ing everything because you never know. You never know what's coming tomorrow or in the next hour.\\" This was a very difficult book to finish (not for the vocabulary but for the fear of the main character's fate). This story was sad and beautiful. It is a great love story. Okay?
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really love escape games. This one is good for starters. It is not too easy or difficult. Would recommend.
B002MG2ATY|4.0|It goes to show that lies keep the American people from overhauling our systematic Goverment. What is past is prologue
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|This was a great movie. I watched it kind of late at night, and it moved sort of slowly, so it was a bit hard to stick with at times. It's the kind of movie you want to be invested in.<br /><br />Basically, the story is about two kids, Ellis and Neckbone, who stumble upon a drifter living in a boat that has inexplicably ended up in a tree in the middle of a small river island. The two are drawn to this mysterious man, especially Ellis, who is dealing with some family troubles at home.<br /><br />The story is fairly compelling, but it requires some patience. Aside from one sequence, it never gets particularly action packed, and so the payoff is really an emotional one, but it's a powerful emotional punch. From his parents, to Matthew McConaughey's drifter, to his friend's uncle, Ellis pays close attention to the examples of romantic love he sees around him. At it's heart, this story is all about Ellis' coming-of-age, especially in terms of how he views women, and how he views love. It's a very powerful story, and I remember waking up the next day, and thinking a lot throughout the day about Ellis' transformation, and thinking a lot about love.<br /><br />It sounds sort of cliche the way I write it, and maybe it won't hit you the same way it hit me, but the movie didn't feel cliche. I found it very powerful, and I would highly recommend this movie.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Your service was great but I could not recommend this one. It's too gruesome.
031236198X|5.0|Kotter brings the power of the fable to any organization in Our Iceberg is Melting. Applicable to any organization or situation, Iceberg will help anyone understand how they help or how they hinder change efforts. We all know people that will challenge the change all the way through and even after it has successfully completed.<br />Great for any age range or reading levels. The book can be read in a couple of days at a casual pace and the story keeps you turning the pages. I recommend it for corporations, non-profits, and even for students. Students will be able to learn about how they fit into the ever-changing world we live in.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I loved the pulse especially for the sleep function on it. That differentiated it for me from an app like Runkeeper on the iPhone. Unfortunately I lost it after 4 days. I had it attached to my jeans and probably it came of while unbuckeling my seatbelt. So that is actually the one thing I am disappointed about.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I really enjoy gangster movies. While this is no &#34;Untouchables&#34;, this was a fun movie, even though it was somewhat predictable at times. I think that Sean Penn played Cohen a bit over the top and Robert Patrick's character was completely underused, but fun.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Editing is great, but worthless to do because you cannot save the image. The app acts as though it is saving but goes to back to editing mode.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this after reading several other good reviews here on Amazon about it and I'm really glad I did. It was so cheap but it's good quality and fits on all our strollers. One of our strollers doesn't have any sort of parent caddy so I stopped using it until we got this. I need somewhere for my drink to go and other little odds and ends like keys and cell phone so they are handy. This works great!! It velcros on very securely. I highly recommend this, and you can't beat the price!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Great service with a 5 Star rating. The movie is one of Depps best.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I have been a devoted follower of the Good Wife from the beginning, but last year (2012) I was outvoted by my Walking Dead zombie family members so I had to catch most of seasons 3-4 through repeats.
B001O304TO|5.0|I both this CD back in '87 when I was in Okinawa, Japan because CD's really hadn't caught on in the U.S. yet. Well 25yrs later and 4 kids my original CD was caseless (the liner notes where in English and Japanesse) and scratched. So I opted for this because it came with a bonus disk 2 with remixes and MP3's uploaded to my &#34;cloud&#34;
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I think the cast of the first movie had better chemistry. While I think The Rock was a good addition, I did not like the character of Lady Jaye, Jinx or Flint as they were portrayed.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first movie and are expecting the same from this one, you will be disapointed.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was a little leary after being so in Love with Christian from Shades of Grey, but Miss Day out did herself and made me a believer wanting this odd couple to make it!
0385344228|3.0|When a child is accused of murder, the parents first reaction is that it can't be true.  In Defending Jacob, gradually there is an unalterable path pointing to his guilt.  In this book, even though the legalities may lead to innocence, Jacob's mother comes to her own judgement.  At the end of the book, you may ask yourself, was his mother right?
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|It worked fine the day I installed it and it played all my videos, but the next day every time I tried to play a video it stopped working, and even the kindle video player stopped working. I had to reset my kindle to factory settings twice to make it work fine.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Crashes, crashes, crashes that's all it does. I was so excited to find this game for my Android. However it sadly has let me down.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My husband started watching this because he was bored.  Now we're both hooked.  This show is not what I expected and so much better.  I definately recommend it.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I must say that I could not put this series down once I started reading them.  Fell in love with Gideon from the get go!  You will too!
B0071MDA2U|5.0|I have read lots of trilogies and Lauren Oliver is right...you just get tired of the story dragging on and on.  Not so with these books!  I love the characters. The story twists and turns in ways that are not predictable and I love that! I'm excited to get started on the third book!!  How will she end it? I hope not in a predictable ending!  Love her writing!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|But too contrived for my tastes. Too many instances of, for instance, jumping out of a multi-story building and there just happens to be (a truck, a dumpster, whatever) below to break your fall -- otherwise you'd be dead and splattered. Or, finding some obscure clue that just happens to tell you where in a large, foreign city the bad guys have gone. I've generally liked the Die Hard franchise but this one may leave you a little disappointed. But, if you like shoot-em-ups where the gun magazines (apparently) hold about a thousand rounds before needing to reload, and one guy can take out dozens of bad guys at a time, you'll like this one.
B001XUY818|5.0|Exciting telling of a true story -- how deadbeat grew to become one of the largest drug dealers in U.S.  I personally believe it's one of Depp's finer roles.
1594744475|5.0|This book has some really fun ideas for children's lunches.  I wish it had more &#34;healthful&#34; recipes as most of the items it uses are processed lunch meats, white rice, and cheese slices but can probably improvise for some of those.  Great ideas nonetheless.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A wonderful adventure, it was hard to turn away. Definitely recommend for those who love puzzles and mysteries, I look forward to more like it
B000HZCZZ6|4.0|This was an awesome movie. We watched it with the kids and they loved it, too. Great characters and story-line, made me wish I lived on this planet!

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Mr. Aslan has clearly done an enormous amount of research and I simply could not put this book down. The parts I liked most were the history of Peter verses Paul in terms of doctrine and even more so the information regarding James towards the very end of the book.  James is the MAN apparently.<br /><br />Overall I feel like I got to benefit from Aslan's years and years of research distilled into one easy to read and understand work of art.<br /><br />Thank you Reza Aslan -- I very much enjoyed this book.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I have a iMac computer.  Use it a lot.  So, the batteries in the wireless mouse wear out fast.  Replacing 2 of AA batteries frequently can become expensive.  This charger seemed like the ideal answer to that problem.  Searched all over Amazon for this item to find it at the lowest price.  The ratings for the seller were around 98% positive, so I felt \\"safe\\" to buy the item.  Well, it took a rather long time to arrive (about two weeks).  But, what really got me was that the seller is in Illinois, but the item was sent from Nomorerack in Los Angeles, which is just 65 miles from where I live.  So, why did it take so long to arrive to me?  I already knew that Nomorerack has a very bad reputation (they often send out broken items, inferior replacements of poor quality, and even wrong items).  They even intentionally send out wrong items in cheap flimsy packaging, thus saving them money, with the hope that you'll just keep the wrong item rather than go through the trouble of trying to return it for the correct item, which actually costs you more in time and money.  Nomorerack is very hard to deal with.  They hardly ever answer their phone, and if they do, then they just put you on hold and eventually drop the call in order to frustrate you.  So, they never actually speak with you.  --  Well you guessed it.  The seller in Illinois outsourced this item to Nomorerack in Los Angeles.  And guess further . . . I was sent the wrong item; it was a used charger in an opened box which was for an Apple keyboard, not for the mouse.  I tried to contact the seller.  She did not respond to my e-mail.  After a few weeks had passed, I then used Infobel (which I had to pay) to get the seller's unlisted phone number.  When I called her, she was stunned that I was actually able to speak with her.  I told her that I was sent the wrong item, and that it didn't come from her but rather from Nomorerack in Los Angeles.  After several phone calls, much conversation, much agrivation, and much persuasion on my part, the seller finally agreed to refund me the payment for the item if I would send it to her at my expense.  I was finally refunded the cost of the wrong item several weeks later.  I'm guessing that she was just afraid that I would report her to Amazon if she didn't do the right thing.  --  Final word . . . If you're buying this item, just make sure that it's not being outsourced to another company (especially Nomorerack), even if you have to pay more.  Also, make sure that you're getting the right item.  When it comes to technology, you can easily be sent a wrong item.  Also, never buy from this seller; buy from another seller.  --  And yes, I just bought this same exact item from another seller at a little higher price.  Just waiting for it to arrive.  Will let you know how it works after I've tried using it for a while.asion on my part, the seller finally agreed to refund me the payment for the item if I would send it to her at my expense.

B007D2XSW0|3.0|Doing the 'custom' save trick mentioned here enabled me to find my pic after all. Yay! But only on Kindle Fire HD. On newer Android phone, saving pic option just sends hard work spinning off into the ether. Some of the crosshairs are very off for applying effects, will take a bit of trial and error to get it just right. Kind of fun overall once you get past the save glitch on the proper device!  Good luck!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This was a pretty good movie! It had several details that you just can't show on Broadway, that helped clarify and rectify some of the differences between the original book, and what's on Broadway. I love the story and the characters. The singing in this movie was great as well, but didn't have the depth that the musical actors/actresses did. Granted, they can sing better than anyone I know, so they are still amazingly talented. Will watch again and again in the future.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing characters brought to life by great actors - It is worth watching! I can not wait for season 4.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I'm an artist, so I like to try new software, especially when I can get it for free.  So, since this is the free app of the day, I decided to give it a whirl.  I used it to modify a couple images, one of my cat that I took with my tablet's camera and a 3D CGI render that I did last year on my computer and have on the table to use as a background image.  I found the program to be just OK and at times annoying and it has a fatal flaw.<br /><br />First of all, I found the selection of filters to be decent, though limited in function.  It has the usual suspects: red eye removal, B&W, color enhancement, sepia tone, and many more.  Many of the filters have no options, you simply apply them and they do their thing at predetermined levels.  For the ones that do have user set levels, those levels are set using a simple slider, there's no way to input numeric values, which means they're very imprecise.  That may be OK for novices and casual users, but it won't fly for people who are serious about photo editing. So, the filters are decent, though not great.<br /><br />On to the annoying side of things.  This program has virtually no options.  One of the more annoying things it does is it has \\"tips\\" that pop up frequently.  On my second run through, it was showing me the same tips it showed me the first time.  Both times, I had to get rid of them to continue working.  And, since the program has no options, save for changing the color of the interface, I couldn't find a way to disable those.  They are very annoying and they get in the way.  Then, when I was (supposedly) saving my second image, a pop up thing came up asking me if I wanted to give them a five star rating.  Firstly, NO.  Secondly, popping up and begging for a five star rating is one thing that irritates me to no end.  So, this app definitely has some annoying tendencies.<br /><br />Now for the fatal flaw.  Many people already know what it is.  It won't save images locally.  I hit \\"save\\" on both of the images I edited and neither is saved to my tablet anywhere.  I went through every folder, even the hidden ones, and I can't find them.  It doesn't let you choose where to save and it won't tell you where it supposedly saves it.  That makes this app completely useless for me.  I have no idea if the \\"post to Facebook\\" button works because I don't have or want a Facebook account. That may work, but it can't be the only way to save the images.<br /><br />So, this app is a big fail for me and I already deleted it from my tablet.  If you're a serious image editor and/or you like saving your work on your device, I'd suggest passing on this one and using Photoshop Touch.  It costs more, but you get what you pay for.  It's not perfect, but it suffers from none of those problems and it has more filters.  Also, it can edit images in layers and it has better control.ed and neither is saved to my tablet anywhere.

This movie was recommended by a lady friend, and I must say it was somewhat of a &#34;chick flick.&#34;  The plot and ending were obvious after the first few minutes, but it was a good cast and well produced.  Great for the romantics out there...

1451624468|5.0|The \\"Universe from Nothing\\" my Lawrence M. Krauss is a laborious explanation of \\"Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing\\" (subtitle). Dr. Krauss goes to great lengths to offer a scientific explanation of why even an absolute void is unstable and that through quantum particle activity, even absolute voids are alive with ghostly intervention. All matter and energy can be explained as the ultimate result of quantum activity organized into subatomic strings or branes composed of strings. Thirteen to fourteen billion years ago the strings or branes combined or collided in such a way as to create quantum gravity and then Newtonian gravity. All of this speculation is the implication of theoretical mathematics on steroids. For example, we cannot know by empirical verification of other universes beyond our own. Eventually, the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) could possibly give us some indication of the existence of extra dimensions beyond the four dimensions we experience on earth (L, W, H, & T). But the mathematical theories imply not just one or two additional abstract dimensions but six or seven additional abstract dimensions. Dr. Krauss's explanation of why there is something rather than nothing is lacking in empirical support.<br /><br />I do not suggest that a numinous God is the answer. I am too much of a skeptic to believe in any God as defined by any religious order on earth. Objectively, no epistemological basis supports the existence of a creator God and no epistemological basis supports the denial of a creator God. That is, we cannot know and will not ever know if a creator God exists or does not exist.<br /><br />Even Dr. Stephen Hawkings in his book \\"The Grand Design\\" essentially proposed that (paraphrasing) \\"a creator God is not necessary to explain the existence of our (anthropic) universe\\". In parsing his words, he is careful not to take a creator God off the table. He does not emphatically state that a creator God does not exist. Rather, he states that a creator God is not necessary. However, that means by implication that an incomprehensible creator God is a possible alternative to a randomly created universe and life on earth.<br /><br />The astrophysicist's explanations are based on applying extremely remote statistical probabilities to extremely large populations. Dr. Krauss implies that in a multi-universe of billions upon billions of universes, the extremely remote probabilities of physical properties and physical equations that support the anthropic existence we experience in our universe would likely occur in a few universes like ours. This kind of extreme statistical hypothesis requires a leap of faith as great as the assumption that a creator God could be responsible.<br /><br />The statistical improbabilities are further complicated by the prevalence of a propensity for extreme disorder in a thermodynamic universe. In a universe where entropy drives order into disorder, why would a highly ordered anthropic existence occur in our speck of a corner of the universe? Surely, the other universes in the greater immensity of multi-universes must also be subject to entropy. I do not discount the possibility that another highly ordered planet in our galaxy could harbor anthropic life. But again, those other Earth-like existences would then also have to somehow emerge in defiance of statistical improbabilities and entropy. The real question is \\"what is God's purpose in breathing fire into the determinate equations that support anthropic life on Earth despite the disorganizing effects of entropy\\"?<br /><br />Random chance offers no purpose and entropy only offers purposeful disorganization. Anthropic life through random chance in quantum particles appears by logical deduction to be statistically and thermodynamically unsupportable. The something that comes from nothing would more likely be randomly scattered particles or atoms but then how could life come from the nothing that started as an absolute void?<br /><br />In offering a creator God is a possible alternative to random chance creation, I would not suggest that any creator God is related to the God of Genesis or to the God of the gospels to any other man-made God. When the Big Bang theory was announced by astrophysicists, the theological community was quick to make the case that scientists had verified the existence of the God of the monotheistic religions. The opening lines of Genesis appeared to theologians like a Big Bang event. But these two or three opening lines of Genesis are the only coincidental similarities to the Big Bang. The following lines of Genesis proceed to explain how God created all living things at his will in total defiance of the scientifically verifiable theory of evolution. Theologians are losing God to science and are desperate to find any scientific support for their mythologies. Consequently, the failure of the hypothesis that random chance could explain the creation of the anthropic universe does not thereby support theological explanations for the existence of the biblical God. The biblical God is a mythology and not a viable explanation for anything.<br /><br />In summary, neither quantum fluctuations nor extreme statistical inferences can explain why there is something rather than nothing. Entropy defies the kind of precise order that is needed for our existence. Can one discount the possibility that an intervening cosmological God could force order in a universe that overwhelmingly defies order at the cosmic scale as well as at the subatomic scale? With all due respect, Dr. Krauss has failed in his vainglorious attempt to explain our existence without crediting a creator God. Again, we cannot know whether a cosmological creator God exists or does not exist and mankind is unlikely to ever know. Perhaps God is the ultimate statistician and physicist who happens to enjoy live drama.<br /><br />Arthur F. Garcia, Jr., author of \\"A Skeptic's God: The Irrelevance of Religion in a Modern World\\"
0785153942|4.0|The artwork is beautiful.  The story adds depth to the movie.  It was just too short, wishing for more. Oh and another thing, nevermind.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|It's suspenseful, heartfelt and all around a wonderful drama. I found myself on the constantly thinking and I can't wait to see what happens next.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I bought this book because a family member has celiac disease.  The book gives a comprehensive review of wheat-based hazards for those who have gluten sensitivity.  The author (apparently a practicing M.D.) makes the case for known celiac sensitivities being the tip of an iceberg where various food sensitivities might be at the root of a wider variety of food-induced maladies than is generally recognized.  I am not qualified to judge whether his claims are balanced or out of proportion to reality, but to a non-expert in the field they sound plausible.  Anyone who suspects they might be afflicted by some food sensitivity will find much here to contemplate.
B00CRMX53S|4.0|reminds me of a really funky Devo. I don't like much Techno/Electronica but I do like Daft Punk's style. It gets me to moving.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This is a 5 star movie.  Plus its over 2 hours so you really get your moneys worth.  I'll be watching this again sometime this year.  5 stars!!!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down I kept reading with the hopes that the less fortunate would win. A great read.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|You have to keep going back to the same scenes, but it's good at telling you where to go next.
B005U9REU0|5.0|The grandkids loved it and so did I. I Love mystical type movies like this and the rental price was good.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|This game is too simple to keep an adult's interest for more than a few tries.  Its worth the price--&#34;free&#34; but a waste of time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just a bit too short. Otherwise quite an enjoyable game. It would benefit from extra levels. Let's hope they come soon
B00DM12ANO|5.0|Most previews disappoint but this one provided exactly what it promised. The visuals were stunning and well pur together. Definitely worth watching.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love to play all different Angry Birds.  Especially watching the pigs go bye-bye.  Lots of fun and good for brain useage.  Physics come into play on all different games.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|well I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was but there little things I would like different about the game and over all the best game
1476727910|4.0|This book is easy to read - I enjoy the short chapters because it makes it easy to pick up and put down when you only have a little time. Very amusing but also oddly insightful. Would be good for men, women, young, old.... all around a good read.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I enjoy this show.  The relationship between Harvey and Mike is very interesting; I love their banter back and forth.  The story lines are well done and the supporting characters are great.  I also really like the theme song!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Truly a disappointment: contrived and predictable.  At best, the anticlimactic closure offers very little except an ending to the reader's commitment to finish the narrative.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a super fun game my son just loves it and is one of his favorite movies of all time.
B00AX6KMGS|3.0|It was a little to far out for me. The bloody scene were very phony and there was no plot.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|The app is intitive and easy to use....but it doesn't save the edited image anywhere that I can find and it doesn't let me email either. Only thing I can do is post on facebook and sometimes I don't want that. Would give 5 stars if this problem was fixed.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Boy, this one really makes you think! It's amazing because each level gets trickier. Just when you think &#34;I got it!&#34; ... you don't. LOL
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is easy enough for them to be able to play & hard enough to keep me entertained too.
B00062PN6I|4.0|I use these to practice in a keyboard. Bought them for $10, and as far as I'm concerned, you can't beat these for that price. If they had cost more than $20, I'd be a little angry, but they do a fine job at this price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Gold-plated 3.5mm to 1/4\\" adapter included<br />Comfortable fit<br />Decent bass for classical purposes<br /><br />Cons:<br />A tiny bit of distortion (clipping) if key velocity exceeds about 100/128 at master volume half-way up.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|Distinct: QotSA always knows how to tweak their sound just enough to sound 'different' while keeping that 'acid rock' appeal.  The first time you hear their songs they sound 'original' and by the second they sound 'classic'.<br /><br />Depressing: With song titles like 'Fairweather friends' and 'I Appear Missing', lyrics like &#34;Does anyone ever get this right?  I feel no love&#34; and slow tempos tossed in from start to finish, clearly the most downer album in QotSA's collection.<br /><br />Dependable:  Never a bad track to be had from the mind of Josh Homme.<br /><br />Rock:  Josh Homme and his eclectic band of raconteurs know how to do it and keep the spirit of it better than anybody else.<br /><br />4 1/2 out of 5 stars
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I tried using another android application and it was so complicated and didn't work the way it was suppose to - when I saw the Kindle for Android application I immediately downloaded it and was able to use it immediately and it works as well as my Kindle Fire for reading books.  I love it!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A touching reconstruction of lives torn apart by greed but rebuilt by love.  There is a constant need to stretch your imagination as you read.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|LOVE this case.  LOVE the color and the durablilty.  Although i have dropped my phone a lot and have to get a replacement case-phone is like new still though and I believe it is because of this case
0425263924|5.0|I'm completely in love with these characters because they are so human to me. I loved the turn that this book took and was glad that it wasn't the final one. If I go into more detail, I'll write out the whole plot...so I'm going to stop here.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book was recommended to me. I read it on my Kindle Android App, and I could not put it down. It is a quick and impactful read. It will change your life if you apply the simple four agreements.  It is obvious that our lives have been tainted with gossip, rumors, anger, jealously, rage, etc., so if you want to lead a happier life get this book now!
B002GZQYMK|3.0|It's taken me a long time to think of how best to review this album.  Why?  Because Muse is an awesome band and this album was... disappointing.<br /><br />I could easily write thousands of words defending and praising Muse's discography from Showbiz to Black Holes and Revelations, for I am an avid fan (with simple music tastes, but still).  So I will try and use far less to explain why I wasn't a huge fan of Muse's fifth album.<br /><br />Using Occam's Razor, the simplest way of saying why I didn't like this album is 'overly-high expectations'.  A less simple and self-blaming way of saying why this album was disappointing is to say that is sounds like Muse is 'trying too hard'... only that doesn't really cover EVERY aspect of why The Resistance doesn't work (or falls short of expectations).<br /><br />The best possible way to explain why it's easy to be critical of this album is such:<br /><br />It sounds like a band trying to sound like Muse impersonating other bands (Radiohead Depeche Mode, Queen, other 80's prog rock) that Muse has been accused of being 'facsimiles of'/inspired by.<br /><br />The result is an album that has never sounded more as such... and it sounds forced.  Like an attempt at homage or an odd form of self-deprecation.<br /><br />Perhaps a bad comparison, but it would be like David Lynch making a movie where he TRIED to make a 'Lynchian' movie (or Andy Kaufman doing an impression of Andy Kaufman's impression of Elvis).<br /><br />It just doesn't work.  It isn't 'bad', it just sounds redundant or regurgitated.<br /><br />3 1/2 words rounded down to 3 stars since the explanation of why this album is 'substandard' is too pedantic.
B00296A4F4|4.0|Had to go back and remind myself how it all started. And you get to see how great Finn really was, gonna be missed
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Five star because it made available music that is not readily available for purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone who has an appreciation of talent and mucis.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James' writing is fresh, insightful, and actionable. A brilliant writer with the wealth of experience to back it up, his book offers (I expect) something for everybody, and a lot for me. His core values helped tie together a lot of loose observations floating around my brain and gave me some general guidelines on how to be at my best as often as possible, and to make me and my best even better. It's a quick read... buy it.
193700788X|4.0|No spoilers - I have read every Sookie book at least 3 times (addicted - I know). I'm glad the series wrapped up this way and was happy but kinda predicted the ending based on the track record. If you like the series, the books are a million times better.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Well. J K Rowling wrote a legendary fantasy which beguiled the world. Not me, I never got further than the first Harry Potter, but I had nothing against it, it was just not my kind of magic, I prefer Zelazny for that genre.<br /><br />Then she wrote a horror story. Good thing we were warned it was an adult novel, I wouldn't really like to see this one in the hands of any impressionable kid. For the many reasons expressed by other negative reviews. Fortunately for me I read The Cuckoo's Calling first, which I enjoyed a lot, otherwise I would not have bought it.<br /><br />For sure, the writing is excellent, as one would expect, and the depiction of the many characters good (if overdone) which is actually the problem. It's not often one finds so many uglies in one wrapper.<br /><br />Amazon does not need this review, by today's check #3808, but I wanted to register my vote for the averages. 1 star for the writing and the other because I did not actually hate it - just did not like it at all.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|really fun to play it keeps me from constant board em and it gets really adicting at times hope you like it.
0062059963|4.0|What I Liked: 1) I am Team Maxon. All the way. I think he's sweet, and funny, and a little bit nerdy. Very endearing. The innocence that he had when we first met him in The Selection has gradually faded as he's come to know some of the girls participating in The Selection, and I think his character growth has been wonderful. Yes, okay, he gets a little...egotistical, especially towards the end. But I'm not holding it against him. 2) The Six. It was a lot of fun getting to know not only America, but the other girls who have made it this far in the Selection. They really help us get to know Maxon better, because he acts differently towards each of them. Not different in a personality complex kind of way, we just get to see the different sides of him. It was a great device to introduce us to the many faces of Prince Maxon, especially since we get so little of the Selection process from his side. 3) The King and Queen. I was not expecting their reactions to America at all. It's nice when an author has the ability to surprise me. I actually would have liked a little more face time with them, as it seemed like a lot of what we got was through he said, she said from Maxon. But it was definitely a new angle to throw in and I liked it a lot. 4) There was a lot more action in this one. If you'll remember from the first, in addition to the main plot line (The Selection), there is some civil unrest going on within Illea. We get much more information regarding this plot line, and I finally was starting to piece a few things together. While we are still focused on the \\"Bachelor-esque\\" part of the story, it was nice to be bringing in some more about life in Illea. You begin to realize that while the choice may appear to be Maxon's alone, it really isn't. 5) The ending. It's about time we get some time outside the castle. That's all I'm going to say.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: Just two tiny little things. First off, Aspen. Maybe this is because I'm all Team Maxon and everything, but he just seems to always show up at the most inopportune times. Ugh! Secondly, I like America, and she seemed to be a strong character in The Selection. But she's become a little wishy-washy in this book. Every few pages she changes her mind, Maxon or Aspen. This started to get on my nerves a little. Maybe I'm just ready for her to make up her mind!<br /><br />Overall Thoughts: I mostly love this series. I'm a little frustrated with America right now, but I still love the idea, and the plot keeps me very well engaged. If you haven't taken the time to start this series yet, now would be a great time. It's got some great romance elements, personable characters and a plotline that gives you someone to root for. I was pleased to see that this book did not fall into that old, second-book trap that I despise so much and it's left me very anxious for the next and final book in the series, The One (which won't be out until next May. *sigh*), but he just seems to always show up at the most inopportune times.

B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This game is extremely fun and sometimes challenging.I highly recommend this game to people who love funny and challenging games.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Alot of top actors but the movie was slow and boring. What happened to all the elite moves that made first movie. Also a lot was cut out, making hop from one scene to another. Just because you have a lot of 'A' listed actors in a movie if you don't know how to direct them the movie is still a flop.
0061726834|5.0|Loved this book and couldn't put it down to go to bed. Make sure you have time to read this.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The author kept the book moving and was a good and fairly quick read. The pace of the book made for an enjoyable read.
0525478817|5.0|I really enjoyed the book even though I had to stop more than once to wipe away my tears. A highly recommended book!
1250012570|5.0|What I Liked: 1) I loved the all of the emotions that swirled around this book, and the emotions that it stirred in me as I was reading. We see a lot of \\"insta-love\\" in YA fiction, or even the, not quite insta-love, but where the characters will suddenly realize they love each other after spending a week arguing about something. The most poignant thing about Eleanor and Park is their slow, sweet slide into love. It's not something either of them are looking for, in fact they silently fight it for a while. And their love story develops without many words being exchanged at all. It's a different kind of romance, very moving and sweet. 2) Nothing about this book is simple. Eleanor is living in a harsh world where she has no privacy, and even less stability from adult figures in her life. Her psyche is damaged but still she manages to find beauty in certain things in life, and is truly inspiring in both her ability to find strength in unlikely places and her devotion to her siblings. Park's life, while it's been much easier than Eleanor's, isn't a bed of roses either. Yet even though neither of them know or understand deep and true love, they manage to find it within each other. 3) Bright spots of humor. I was chuckling aloud at some parts of this book. They fit so perfectly with the tone of the book, not out of place jokes just brought in to punch up dialogue. 4) This book was beautiful. There was beauty in the devastating and simple act of two misfits falling in love, and believing it can last when everything they know seems to be against them. Even now, days after having read it, their story is still on my mind and in my heart. It triggered nostalgia deep in me that made me think of the first time I fell in love, that sweet, woozy feeling, pounding heart, fireworks, and sweaty palms. 5) The ending. It was bittersweet, but also perfect in the way they made sacrifices for each other. Again, I'm struck by how beautiful I thought it was.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: I liked everything!<br /><br />Overall Thoughts: I loved Eleanor and Park. It was a beautiful story than will touch anyone with a soul! ;-) Rich characters will tug at your heartstrings both with their back stories, and their love stories. But most of all, their tumble into an undiscovered land of love for both of them is stirring and emotional, and very raw. Readers of all ages can fall head over heels for these two, and will leave you remembering the passion and nerves of your first love.<br /><br />My Rating: 5 shotsliked everything!<br /><br />Overall Thoughts: I loved Eleanor and Park.

B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Game has lots of visual appeal, but Grandsons 9 and 11 didn't stay with it for long.  Perhaps they were a little young or just not wanting to work at achieving the goals and required focus to be successful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is exciting and funny at the same time with the bombs and rockets ,slides and minion links awesome game.
0307887448|5.0|What I Liked: 1) The narrator. I can't even imagine anyone better to narrate this particular story than Wil Wheaton. He does a great job expressing the different emotions Wade is running through as he plays Halliady's game, and he also modulates his voice expertly for different characters (although it's Wade most of the time). Wil Wheaton was a great choice. 2) The pop culture references. I loved all of the pop culture references, and actually knew a lot of them. As a child of the 80s (well, sort of), how could I not? And I appreciated how cleverly Mr. Cline worked the references into the story. They had meanings and reasons for being there, instead of just random filler or comic relief. This is enough alone to persuade me to read the book. 3) The chase. A majority of the book is dedicated to the contest that began when James Halliday died. And though it's been years since the contest began, because no one has made any progress everything is still up for grabs. Wade spends almost all of his free time working on this intricate puzzle. Wade is chasing the answers to these riddles and pop culture quizzes throughout the whole story and with each new discovery comes a new spark of excitement. 4) The pacing. Major props for the pacing on this story. It's never slow. From the first page the story (at least with the audiobook, which technically doesn't have pages) everything moved quickly and smoothly, high energy blazing a path for me as a reader to sail right along side with Wade. 5) The Oasis. I thought the Oasis sounded cool. I don't know much about virtual reality and how any of that works or might work in the future, but the idea is intriguing. I think that I'd go to the beach, especially if it was a cold winter day. Though for me, really good books are almost like virtual reality - if I can imagine it, and get into the story so much that I feel like I'm there, then it really it like VR.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: I loved this story!<br /><br />Overall Thoughts: Ready Player One was something new to me, and a bit outside the norm of what I usually read. But it was funny, smart, and so energetic that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. The pop culture references were all so familiar and the puzzles were clever and just challenging enough to keep you guessing, but you could find the trail to figure out the answer. And with Wil Wheaton narrating, the story came to life as he read it. There is something for everyone in Ready Player One and I would recommend everyone check it out. If you're a fan of audiobooks then try this one as an AB, because the narrator makes a huge difference!<br /><br />My Rating: 5 shotseady Player One was something new to me, and a bit outside the norm of what I usually read.

B004CEUEWE|2.0|The rave reviews of how good this was.  As if.... a bank manager would fall in love with a bank robber.  As if.... a bank robber who uses army grade guns is a nice guy.  i thought this would be action movie about bank robberies but ended more like a love movie
0345529057|5.0|It is great story of power & greed vs noble souls with a healthy bit of revenge. It shocks with the characters that die and the horrors that others commit.  The characters intrigue so that the magic is a part of that reality.  it's a different world but reminds one of Medevial times with the manners and dress.

B0073COMUW|2.0|It's a very blue light, almost like a camplight.  Not very bright.  It's a very cold light and not acceptable to my wife.  I'll try it out longer, but it is clearly not an equivalent replacement for a 60-watt bulb.  Believe me, I want to like this LED bulb, but this just tells me that LED bulbs are still not ready for prime time, unfortunately.

B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Fun movie with the sexiest wickedest witch I have ever seen. Sometimes I felt the acting was a bit to rote, but it is the spectacle more than the substance for this film. Little touches of pre-Wizard of Oz characters sprinkled throughout will keep you watching.

B005D4YHCU|2.0|There's little I like about this product. The laces are sufficiently long that they need to be tucked in over the instep or they jangle around annoyingly. Overall, the construction materials feel stiff and unyielding. Most annoying is the fact that my 5th toes poke out between the straps, resulting in a most uncomfortable situation. I have worn Teva products forever, & currently own 5 pairs for various applications--from the first wearing, they have always fit & functioned wonderfully. Sorry I decided to try this Keen product. Am giving them away.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have become a Jack Reacher fan of late, but not this one.  Really disappointed with a very predictable ending. While you are lured in by suggestions of CIA and state department intrigue, this is a non-starter. The short story at the end is better than the Novel.
B000002O1Q|5.0|My husband loved the movie, and he appreciates the sound track--even though he claims the songs are &#34;out of order&#34; from where they were placed in the movie--that is okay, though--the music is very good.  My husband says that in all truth one of the songs says, &#34;Tonight is what it means to be young--GOD speed us away!&#34;  Joyce P
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so much fun. I love having to figure out all of these different levels. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves to solve puzzles.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app it works nice I got this for the free app of the day and it works nice I love this app I can mess with my brother with app AWESOME APP LOVE IT
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I have a 14 month old daughter and I definitely keep an eye on her at all times after watching this movie...  this movie made me not trust my daughter!  Scary!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very detailed in the effects of wheat on your health, changed my mindset about whole wheat. Can use a few more details on good recipes and alternatives.
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Little Ritchie crossed over lines that were &#34;not acceptable&#34; at that time.  He was a pioneer, and we love it!  Joyce P
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I wish more musicians experimented with string instruments and electronic music. D&B touch is always appreciated. Keep it coming girl!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is so much fun. It makes you feel like  a American settler. And it is also free. This is one of the best free games ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005HEK3JW|5.0|This series is by far the best incarnation in the Star Trek TV franchise. Love the original Star Trek movies, and I used to enjoy the series as a kid, but it's pretty hard to watch the old TV shows now with the technology of today!
B009FZFONO|5.0|instant download worked great. I probably will download the entire season soon. Works on my laptop or on the TV using my xbox.
B004N6369Y|4.0|I liked this book.I have been a fan of Danielle Steel's since college. This novel kept my attention--hated to put it down at times, but things must be done around the house. I would highly recommend this book--especially if you're a DS fan of her writing! Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this product is awesome any one who plays likes it!!! and will enjoy it and share to every single one of their friends!!!!!
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I downloaded this app and all I had to do was sign into my Facebook account and it pops up your page(s) you created, I've had this app for months and it still works great! It shows the new comers names that like your page, and it also is just like a facebook but for a page, but you receive messages and notifications. I'm on it with my Kindle fire HD, so you can't text people first. And if somebody writes some harassment or any comment you don't like you can ban that user, but it works perfectly, and has NEVER froze up on me. And it's a FREE app that works very great for me. :)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was the best book to start off a beautifully written series of love, war, and dragons. Can't wait to read the next book.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this game I won tournament mode and unlocked atom gold. I know how to easily win you just keep doing uppercut
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I really liked the film as it didn't fall victim to the modern sci-fi movie tropes, and was more story-driven then most sci-fi films these days, which seem to rely too heavily on special effects to drive their plots forward. Coupled with a great soundtrack by electronic duo M83, this made for an enjoyable movie that dares to be different.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I loved watching the episodes of Glee!! There were no commercials and I had no problems with having to wait for the videos to load. Very convenient, very user friendly!!
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|Good seller, nice product. The clock was what I was waiting, and more. I think that it was a big opportunity.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I could not put it down  The book and the entire series in fact, was addictive.  I highly recommend it.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|Glad it was the free app of the day. Play about 5 minutes before deleting. If you didn't get it as FAOTD, don't waste your money.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|It is the improved CD version of the classic LP that I owned in college + a couple of great live tracks.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Well it is really good but the ads will pop up and you will be doing something and you will accidentally tap on them. I hate that.  It is something they need to fix.  This game is so fun though!! I play it all day everyday. (Not really) I totally recommend it!!
B008MM9630|4.0|I enjoyed the game. easy to use fun. good for kids first farm. only problem is not so easy to select items from store.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The Book Thief was required summer reading for my sophomore son.  I wanted to read it also, so that we could discuss the book.  The book causes the reader to feel so many emotions.  The place and the time were some of the worst in this world's history.  But written from such an astounding viewpoint -- I was forced to not only feel, but maybe slightly understand.
B004AQR29C|3.0|If you like the old school action flicks, you will enjoy this movie. Not the greatest storyline, but a lot of action. Big booms, big guns, high body count, it's the 80's all over.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|I really liked this movie.  It was much better than I expected it would be.  I would recommend this movie to any Halo fan.
B0059M7YF8|5.0|My favorite of all of Jean Michel Jarre's efforts. Complex, melodic, hypnotic. Play it while watching a winamp visualization that reacts to the music.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I have watched all the Star Trek series.  My two favorites are The original and Enterprise.  Enterprise uses some of the best visuals and the stories that continue from episode to episode are really great.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book is surely the most thought provoking book I have read of late.  I decided to read it so that I could discuss the book with my son, as he was required to read it this summer.  I am so glad I did.  It gives us new depth for conversing.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I like that it has a lot of action.i love watching super heroes and my kids are just crazy about them they wanted to watch it again.
B00AKKS278|5.0|This book is written with intelect and courage. Intelect because the ideas are presented in a coherent way that touches our soul with rational arguments about life purpose and self fulfilment. Courage because the author exposes himself and his own self development - not in a narcisistic way but to convey genuine learning lessons - so that we as readers can better relate with the principles tought.
0375869026|5.0|I always read my children's required books to discuss with them.  This one was not a chore and wonderful except that I was crying at the end on the airplane.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|saw the movie and decided to check out the books...love em so far! Already on book three and just got started!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was not advised to purchase any additional items when I bought the Kindle. When I started having problems I contacted tech support at Kindle and they advised what I needed to resolve the problem.  Worked perfectly.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|I loved both seasons of 'Dollhouse' and highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys action-packed, &#34;kickass&#34; girl-with-a-gun movies & shows. LOL
B000QK7YQ2|4.0|On Any Sunday still holds true after coming out over forty years ago. This is the only documentary that covers all forms of off-road motorcycle riding in one film.  The bikes are classic, the riders are the best the sport had to offer in the early seventies, including one famous guy named Steve McQueen.  As a modern day motocross rider, I am a bit envious that i wasn't around during that time period in Southern California.  With virtually no regulations and tens of thousands of acres of available open space, this was truly the prime time to be a motocross or off road rider.  On Any Sunday does an excellent job highlighting the racers and the skill required in each unique event.  The stars of the movie are Mert Lawill, Malcolm Smith, and Steve McQueen.  Malcolm Smith was the top rider in a variety of different riding disciplines and the movie makes you jealous of his amazing skill.  Steve McQueen was one of the best amateur racers of his time when he wasn't starring in his own movies.  You could be lining up to your local race in San Diego on a Sunday in 1970 and Steve McQueen could be the guy right next to you in the gate.  Mert Lawill owned the dirt track championships of the late 60's and into the 70's.<br /><br />If your a fan of off road motorcycles this is a must see movie.<br /><br />The only downside is that the streaming quality is far from the HD we are all use to, but its hardly distracting once you get into the film.
0307120007|2.0|i have a good cat friend kittenshy who i buy books for. she \\"read\\" pat the bunny. she likes it, i am a bit concered about it. here's why: 1 the pages are flimsy, shes a cat, a cat with CLAWS. 2 the pages are scratchy, they could scratch her. :( meowch. 3 the smell the flowers page is perfume, bad for kitties.  4 the \\"feel daddy's face\\" sandpaper is scratchy that could hurt her soft paw-pads. and 5 the peek a boo page is very flimsy and could rip off. but she likes it and i am glad. i will look for the other pat the rabbit books for her.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Really like being able to sort my mail in different ways such as sender!!<br />lay out is pretty decent<br />Lends itself well to mobile use<br />If there is an issue, its is that it is sometimes a little slow and the spam filter could be better
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It is confusing at first if you dont know what all the things do but after a while you will get used to it and be doing it really fast if its a small edit
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I am having a lot of fun with this game I keep coming back for more. Do yourself a favor and give this one a try.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Great continuation of the psy changeling series.  Lots of loose ends wrapped up. The best thing about this series is the very well done over arching story lines. You can tell it's all been planned out.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is a great way to break up activities and pass the time. Easy to enjoy even in busy surroundings.
B005HEDIHG|4.0|What's not to like? The old series with new special effects and the same over acting that IS the show.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a REALLY great game. So addictive, too. I've gotten so many others playing it ALL the time. Lots of choices of places to go. I'd like to know about you other games, if I could get away from this one long enough! LOL.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Nothing more to say Oscar winner, well made and acted. Directing and script were perfect could watch a hundred times and transfer was flawless......
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app seems to work well in it's many options for altering a photo......except the most important! In its current form it is not saving the altered pic. I tried a number of times to save and then view the altered  picture but to no avail. You guys need to fix this or your product is of no value.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Nice interface, but completely useless. Does not save images for me either (see the many other reviews saying so). Using Verizon Samsung Note 2. I am going to unload it, and maybe someday this will be fixed and then the app can be used.<br /><br />So, take the app and then you can try again when they update it.
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|Bodies: Staged Fright is a fast-paced read that propels the reader in many directions, often at the same time. We are sent deep inside the C.D.C., the Department of Homeland Security, and (maybe most dangerous of all), the halls of a prestigious High School. Filled with danger, mystery, terror threats, and a healthy dose of sexual tension, Bodies: Staged Fright sends the reader on a dangerous and entertaining trip they won't soon forget, whetting your appetite for Book 2.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A must see for sure.  Intelligent, witty, and funny with a little bit of cockiness!  I would definitely suggest this series.
B005LAII3U|3.0|Lots of action but was not as good as I hoped, it was worth the watch but however afterwards I wished I had just rented.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in years. I rank it right up there with The Matrix & The Book of Eli. I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice in my 48 hour viewing period and will have to buy this movie on DVD as soon as the price drops a bit. This is a Sci-Fi for the thinking person and has more than a few extraordinary surprises built into it. For some it may start a little slow (no big booms or starship battles) but stick with it, it's a hell of a great story. I cannot help but wonder about the fate of Vicka 52?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game, actually a good deal of thought and into the design &amp; layout, graphics are very good. Performance on a Galaxy S4 is great.
078322947X|5.0|I loaned my previous copy out and never got it back. Too bad the production hasn't been fixed (see others' reviews), but I love the movie.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you like watching A Game of Thrones on HBO you will love these books.  The books go into just a bit more detail than the show on television does obviously.  A great read I can't put it down.
B009MO5G90|5.0|Big fan of the franchise and Milla always look forward to another resident evil, the transfer quality is superb and the 3D on this is very good, it should be since it was shot this way. ........
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It's okay because every time I try to watch a video this app keeps loading then it plays for a while then loads again this is not a everything thing but it is annoying cuz I want to watch a video without it keep loading and it loads sometimes for a pretty long time I give this 3 stars please make this better!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Kept my interest and was a great story.  Was also a page turner.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B001GSV3EC|4.0|Beck's certainly not for everyone...my wife asks &#34;what's that noise?&#34; whenever one of the cuts comes up on my iPod. But, I like the atmosphere and the originality (although he does some really old stuff that was better the first time).
0785132619|4.0|I had heard about this story, mostly after the movie came out with such hype from the other fanboys, and figured it must be an okay read to garner all the attention and the movie credits.  But still I didn't get it.  So when I saw previews for the move's sequel, I picked up the original Kick-Ass collection from my local store.  And loved it.  What I thought it was, it was...a story about a pathetic teenage angst-ridden outcast who gets the idea to put on a suit and do some good.  He gets his a$$ kicked (multiple times) and only when he actually wins a fight does he become this phenomenon.  Which leads down some dirty, violent roads once two of the \\"imitators\\" turn out to be the real deal in Hit-Girl and her father.<br /><br />I think Millar handles the melodrama of Kick-Ass pretty well...the fact that imitators do creep out of the corners of the city is something I didn't expect to happen in a comic book, but it certainly would in real life.  That Kick-Ass never truly takes himself too seriously--especially when people start beating him up--is refreshing.  Dave knows he's just a kid in a costume, and although his heart won't let him ignore trouble, he knows he's just as likely as the victim to get pummeled.  Romita's art isn't truly distinctive, which actually helps the story along.  His renderings of characters is spot-on, I think, and doesn't get in the way of the story.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Kick-Ass because he's just a guy in a suit, reminiscent of a Batman without the murderous motivation or the gadgets or the money or the car or the ninja moves.  Or the butler.  He's just a kid who wants to help out when he sees something going wrong...like the rest of us.  Most of the time.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I really enjoy the main characters Dorcas and Laura. They are kind-hearted, intelligent, and very enjoyable. I look forward to seeing their adventures into following seasons.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|WHEN I BOUGHT THIS DVD BACK IN THE DAY, IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES, FEEL GOOD!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love the graphics . Good for kids of all ages. Worth taking the time making your own reef. Just wish I could afford pearls.
0142407542|5.0|My kids first saw this as a movie on tv so  we had to get the book and we were not disappointed. We have now bought quite a few of Julia Donaldsons books and my 3 year old twins love the stories and they recite the rhymes in the book.<br />Very good.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Just downloaded sadly no pictures will load even took a picture still no luck.  I'm not a software engineer if the program won't work out of the box I don't need it.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|Loved this CD it was just what I wanted. I haven't heard it in a while , since high school.
B0053B347M|2.0|I bought this to use on the back of a 24&#34; iMac. It keeps falling unless I use tape to stick it. Also it's not really bright enough to make a big difference for this particular usage.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|My main problem with this is on my 7&#34; screen I sometimes have trouble because the tiles are small and my eyes get tired.  But I do enjoy it very much while playing.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|The watch is good and would've given it four stars except that the band was a little dirty when I got it. Looked like it was a return item.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this the best app ever it is so editing. this souled be a roller app all I can say is that this app is awesome
B00EH49DXA|5.0|This song is so powerful!! Katy does it again with ROAR. If you've ever been knocked down and pulled yourself out of it this is an amazing anthem song for that!! LOVE!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Starts really easy - but watch out.  I don't get on-line to play whichis good - I would play all-night if I had unlimited access to lives!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Pretty good book! I haven't seen the movie, but am disappointed by all the changes I've read happened from book to movie. It was a quick read, very enjoyable.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I thought Oblivion was a good movie.  It's the best movie I've seen from Tom Cruise in awhile.  The story line is excellent and I loved the special effects.  Really good!
B004I744AS|4.0|It even has a daily page for providing new words as well as providing games.  If works in defining as well as having thesaurus words.  I HAVE not had chance to explore foreign language capabilities.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and addictive game. At times it gets stuck and it is hard to pick to things on the screen.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Very well written book about a young boy growing up in poverty in Ireland. I'm amazed anyone made it out alive. I'd definitely recommend it. I'm sure there's more to be said about it, but definitely a good read.
B001UI1M26|4.0|This was a good story line.  Nicole Kidman is a prissy rich lady from the USA.  Her husband is in Australia running a cattle ranch.  She goes down to check on him and finds life in Austalia a little stronger than she expected.  She also meets and builds a friendship with Hugh Jackman, who is a rough and tough cowboy type Australian.  An additional part of the plot is a young mixed Aborigine boy and some of his relatives.  Of course, there are some thieves and swindlers amidst the good guys, and the government's plot to take the Aborigine out of the children. (Why can't we let children alone? They did this to the Indians, too.) Meanwhile, let's not forget WWII, going on in the backdrop.<br /><br />Good show!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book showed the exact feelings and thoughts any thoughtful cancer patient would or could possibly have, it shows exactly how she or he feels.not only is thus book highly detailed with an open mind to all thoughts, it is also highly packed with feeling and really makes you feel connected with the characters.. like your closer to them then your own family, I highly encourage you to read this AMAZING book, thank you
B005HSG3TC|2.0|This product is ok. It does not stand up very well. The cover is flimsy and doesn't support the weight of the tablet very well.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Sooooooooooo slow, almost gave up, the last quarter of the book really picked up. Looking forward to Book 5, and I've heard that suffering through Book 4 is made up for by Book 5, so looking forward to reading that. Just be prepared for boredom and frustration, especially coming off Book 3.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I had no idea what to expect with this book, but picked it up based on a book club recommendation. I was most pleasantly surprised.  This book tells the tale of a young boy who meets an odd girl and her family down the lane. They go on an adventure, and the adventure leads to a series of events which occur in his home life thereafter.  I loved the Hempstock ladies.  They sounded like lovely women that a child would easily flock to for comfort and solace.  This is a short book, and easy to read in a single sitting, but that doesn't make it any less powerful.
0312330537|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece.  The story itself is riveting, and the story of how this book was written, is also amazing.<br />Its be a long long time since a book has taken me the way this book has.<br />I can't recommend this book enough!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|My expectations were somewhere in the middle but I really enjoyed this movie.  I would rate it 4 1/2 stars if that were an option.  The movie was fast moving, interesting and keeps you guessing a little bit while not being overly complicated.  And the effects and creative use of technology reminded me of Minority Report.  Definitely worth seeing!

B00DU16OJM|5.0|This record really captures an old man at the end of his life. He's tired, his voice is shot, his life partner gone... But he's at the top of his songwriting game. Thank god for songwriters like Guy Clark.
B008035H16|2.0|It is an interesting thought to deliver happiness but the format structure and content doesn't do justice to the idea. I will read the detailed book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My husband sent me an article on how listening to pink noise while you sleep improves how well you sleep [...]<br /><br />Since then I started searching out apps that play pink noise.  This is the coolest one I've found.  This app allows you to create combinations of sounds too.  You can set a volume level for each sound and then save your creation under Favorites.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Great film. Cannot wait 'til the new one. Easy rental. Better than redbox or video store. I will stream again.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Liked the scientist seeing Heaven and explaining how he concluded that this was a real experience for him.  I recommend to anyone interested in the Hereafter.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Not a fan of playing with others.  So I think it was so-so, prefer the originals. Maybe I might try it again later.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It can open system files.It also allows to do copy, cut and paste files and folders. It can open zip files too
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|The only issue I have with this show is the main theme. I understand the desire to reach a new generation of Trekkies but all &#34;Trek&#34; shows have have a wonderful opening theme. This &#34;folk rock&#34; theme song betrays the entire genre.<br /><br />Of course, the intimacy between T'Pol and Tripp is weak and sometimes overplayed.
B000BVD460|5.0|this cd is a great choice for anyone who loves great rapping. eminem raps about his life growing up and what he has seen and been through. with dr. dre as his producer you know this album has great beats and hooks

B00124DUA0|5.0|The 70s was a great era for John Williams. Jaws, Star Wars and Close Encounters were fantastic scores. But his score for Superman completely defined the film. This soundtrack  includes previously unreleased cues, and it's a great addition to my collection.
0399213015|5.0|Loved and wanted this book for the collection for our grandchild. I loved it as a kid<br />even myself, what kid doesn't??
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|not a bad movie but kind of corny and not that origional.  Not scarey, very predictable but a lot of bangs and booms.  the kids loved it.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I love this movie and it is great. im glad I bought it! too bad I didn't buy the dvd!
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|Why why why? I tried playing, but I had to be on the internet and signed into my amazon account to play. No thanks! Not worth my time!

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Good way to spend an evening and you don't have to wait to see an<br />episode each week. Enjoy the show.
B00459GJUM|5.0|I wish SG-1 fans had shut their mouths complaining about this show.  By far the best of the Stargates.  Definitely a darker, more engaging plot.
B00459EZLW|2.0|It sucks when a show is cancelled and there is no true ending...Plus every episode was depressing, there was no hope and really no likable characters. They tried to do something similar to Battlestar Galactica and it failed.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|It doesn't allow you to save the picture after you do an excellent job editing. This was a problem with the original photo app so I deleted it.

1439153663|5.0|New York Times bestselling author Kathleen Grissom was the keynote speaker at the Navigating Your Writing Life conference in Charlottesville, VA. She told the fascinating story behind the story of her novel, The Kitchen House. While restoring a plantation tavern in southern Virginia with her husband, (and researching its past) she found a map with the notation \\"Negro Hill.\\" Intrigued by the mystery behind its name, she contacted historians but wasn't able to find any information. One morning after talking a walk, Grissom recalls a scene playing through her mind like a movie- a little white girl chasing after her mother and ultimately discovering a black woman hung from an oak tree. She quickly jotted down the scene (which ended up as the prologue to The Kitchen House ) and slipped the papers into a drawer. Sometime later, her father told her a story about a white Irish girl who came to the US by ship with her parents and brothers. Her parents died during the journey, the boys survived, but no one knows what happened to the little girl.<br /><br />These two events led Grissom to write her novel through the point of view of two girls, circa 1791. Seven-year-old Lavinia McCarten is a white girl whose parents die on a ship from Ireland. Lavinia and her older brother are sold to separate plantation owners to work as indentured servants. Eighteen-year-old Belle Pyke is the illegitimate black daughter of Captain James, a Virginia plantation owner. Belle takes Lavinia under her wing, and teaches her how to clean, cook, and serve Captain Pyke and his family. Lavinia and the black kitchen help form such strong bonds that Lavinia starts to refer to them as her family. One of my favorite passages of the book is on page 26, when Lavinia (or as the kitchen help call her \\"Abinia\\") asks Papa George if she can be his girl even though she's white. His response is priceless: \\"Abinia,\\" he said, pointing toward the chickens, \\"you look at those birds. Some of them be brown, some of thembe white and black. Do you think when they little chicks, those mamas and papas care about that?\\"  However, when Lavinia and members of the Pyke family grow close, she finds out how hard it is to toe the line between her black and white family. Both Belle and Lavinia endure emotional and physical abuse, lose their mothers and fathers as well as a plethora of friends to death, are heartbroken by the men they love...  I think The Boston Globe sums it up best as: \\"A touching tale of oppressed women, black and white... about love, survival,  friendship, and loss in the antebellum South should not be missed.\\"<br /><br />From the first page of the prologue, I was hooked on The Kitchen House and I believe it is  destined to become a classic which is \\"a book that never finished saying what it has to say.\\"  (Journalist Italo Calvino's descriptionof a classic). It's a hauntingly beautiful must read!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW! have not watched this season yet but I have speant countless hours trying to get the original full 2 hr first episode so I am hoping it is in this!
B00821OX98|5.0|The show has a nice mix serious and hopeful moments....Though I do wish writers would quit portraying most women as the soft hearted &#34;do-gooder&#34;...This is war and everyone should think that way.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am still learning about my new Kindle, so when I found out that I could use &#34;GOOGLE&#34; to search with I was thrilled. I have used &#34;GOOGLE&#34; for years and I am happy that I don't have to switch to use my Kindle!

B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I was hoping for more....I don't think James Franco was the right choice, which is a shame because he is a good actor.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|It's a book for teens, so it was an easy read. Good super hero story.  I found the characters very like able.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Would have given this a 5 but it was a little slow in some parts.  I enjoyed the movie and it showed a perspective of Lincoln that was very interesting.  Daniel Day-Lewis portrayal was outstanding.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked this book.  It had a lot more action than the first one and it is very well written.  I could almost imagine myself in that arena the way Suzanne describes it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed the first and second book, the first more.  Katness was  such a strong character in the beginning. To see  her mental breakdown and selfishness was horrible. I skipped so pages just to be  to the end...I am so glad it I  over.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game . It kept me intrigued  for hours. Ended too soon . Can not wait for more
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was a good one. We are getting used to high tech movies with stunning graphics. What sets this movie apart is that it actually had a plot, something that seems unique lately! I have enjoyed Tom Cruise's movies and feel that the critics tend to be really harsh in their reviews of his work. I liked his Mission Impossible movies, so I decided to watch Oblivion. Without spoiling it for other viewers, I'll just say this is a movie worth watching. It has unexpected twists in the plot that may surprise you. Make some popcorn, sit down and prepare to be entertained.
