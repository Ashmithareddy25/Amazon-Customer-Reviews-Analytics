Then I realized \\"cooking\\" as more as metaphor for \\"Meta-Learning\\", which I purchased the book for.<br /><br />It is amazing the amount of knowledge provided in this book, which can be easily utilized.<br /><br />I originally was not interested in the cooking aspect, however  Tim's deconstruction has made me interested in cooking again.<br /><br />I myself have been frustrated with traditional cook books multiple recipes, highly specialized and expensive equipment which one may use once or twice per year.<br /><br />This book is currently black listed by Barnes and Nobles, however it may be black listed by culinary equipment company vendors (Cutco, Williams Sonoma, etc)and McCormick spices. Due to Tim's chapter on the minimal pantry & equipment list (one of my favorites).<br /><br />I will use this guide as a:<br />1. See one.<br />2. Do one.<br />3.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Brilliant articulation and insight into societal awareness, a compelling page-turner played out masterfully through compelling characters - easy to recommend
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This is a great book for everyone. It uses several positive thnking tools as a means of focusing on personal problems.
B00005N6KG|4.0|The headphones are light and they do the job. My first pair did not function properly and I had notified them. They sent me a near pair with no cost and I appreciated it very much. The second pair works fine but I have to be delicate with them.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The crossfire series has been great. Read bared to you, and was totally addicted.<br />Reflected in you did not disappoint. Gideon and Eva's story gets more interesting with more of their back ground coming through . I hope the you give this book a chance. Great series is all I can say. I can not wait until May for the last book.!!!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|A decent read. I wouldn't say it's my favourite Mitch Albom, but it's worth the time (pun intended).  I found myself \\"observing\\" the story rather than living within it, but I still enjoyed it.
0525423656|3.0|I personally loved the idea of this dystopian world, and this series is definitely in my top 20, if not 10 or 5 favorite books of all time. But truth be told, this book, was very...very slow, and predictable. The writing technique, was pretty good 4/5 i would say, not her best work... But then again I think it went against matched alot. And as well as we be truthful **SPOILER HERE!** , the long adventure to find Ky, was quite interesting.......meh...kind of. But no real..how to say...exciting plot happened, other then Cassia's continuous journey. I was starting to want to close the book at this point, but i had the fuel of the love for the book.. and (LETS JUST SAY: Team Caxander... :3 Sorry, ...don't like teams? ...well meh. my opinion i guess xD) But, the ending made my heart break,especially since i read it the hour it came out. I finished it, but if you didn't have some sort of strong ship in the book, or loved the idea of such  controlling goverment as I did, I doubt you would finish this book. AND...lets just say, whatever You or I say about this book, I still want to see the adventure roll on. *Squeak* ....Yes . MY LIBRARY BOOK (REACHED) HAS FRIGGIN' ARRIVED! :D....Okay...gotta go read it now. But like I said. the writing ...plot could be better, but it definitely, was still a very great book, but not nearly as good, and really...truthfully a let down to the first one. ~Tris Everdeen
B00A77II0U|5.0|Loved this game with its unique story line.  The mini games are fun and the graphics are excellent.  I know you will enjoy this interesting game.
0761158464|5.0|This came in the perfect condition and its a great book!! I would recommend it to any Star Wars fan!!!
B009AP4MGE|5.0|Glee sometimes moves sideways but Dueling Duets episode was just great.  It must have been alot of fun for the actors to do!
0446691437|5.0|I don't often read stories multiple times, but I have read this book 4 times now and I love it more each time I read it.  This book is must for artists of any kind (writers, painters, actors, etc.)  It helps you to understand what your resistance is and what is holding you back from using your talents.  I highly recommend this.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This book definitely helped me flesh out why I like certain things and what I need to pursue in order to use my strengths.  It also was helpful in seeing how my strengths can become weaknesses if I'm not careful.  We used this book at work to see each other's strengths and play off of that.  Such an awesome idea for teamwork!
6305263248|5.0|This is what a movie should be - little to no BS and one hell of a ride. It's written by David Mamet (he used an alias in the credits) and as such it has a spoken sound that's succinct and to the point. Cliches and hackneyed quips aren't to be found. The ensemble cast is one of the best international assemblies I've seen.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Do you remember why Clark Griswold needed his bonus check so bad??? To put in a swimming pool! [...]  Cousin Eddie: \\"I can't swim Clark!\\" Clark: \\"I know that Eddie.\\" LOL
1400049628|4.0|kids like it, Not my choice, so what do you expect? I did not get it for me. go go
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of each book and could not wait to start the next book once one was completed. I had to buy my own book as my daughters would not let me read their copies.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked it. Very interesting and kept my attention. I usually enjoy Grisham's books so I would reccomend this to anyone who likes a surprise ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This novel was fantastic in that it was able to hold my attention for the majority of the story. This book had a great story with moving characters and an engaging plot.
0547884591|5.0|I'm 10% of the way in, but already have a fun success story. This book is about more than just cooking, it's about how to learn. One of the examples is a short section on basketball. I've recently taken up basketball again after twenty years of not playing. My shot was never good, even though I've practiced for hundreds of hours. I always knew that I probably had poor shooting habits, but I've never known what to focus on. But somehow, this short section from 4-Hour Chef completely changed my shot. Everything that I've wanted to happen just clicked and I know with every shot what are the three things I'm focused on repeating.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|I listen to this cd often and my 2 year old daughter loves it too. Imelda has such a smooth voice and style. Total girl crush!
B002A9VJ40|5.0|Absolutely classic. Been seeing this ever since I was a kid. my top 20 favorite movie for sure. Will never get over it<br />Acting is great<br />Soundtrack is perfect<br />Stunts and special effects still hold up very well especially with no CGI whats so ever :)
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I hope this gets made into a movie because I just adored the story. Can't wait for his next one!
B008D1LVRY|5.0|At first I was skeptical about getting a &#34;3rd&#34; release, but don't feel like you need to buy this just because it's a collection completer! This album has all of the first release's energy, and a little bit of each members' other bands tweeking into it.<br />if I didn't know better, I would say they should have made this album first!<br />Love this band!!!!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Catfish should be required viewing for all teens so there is an awareness that what you see or hear isn't always truth.  There is a difference between perception and reality.  Some people like to say perception is reality....Catfish proves otherwise.
B002ONV5E6|4.0|Fun movie, fights are cool and it's interesting that no one ever gets a cut, black eye or fat lip. =)
0307593525|5.0|I bought this set as a gift for my sister in law. They're in excellent new condition, a beautiful set, and hopefully exactly what she's looking for.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Very nice to be able to save your files online and access them from any device at any time. I am using it more and more all the time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|this is a must read! this should be on the required reading list for high school students. i think each year they could gain something new from this book with each read.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|I love the aesthetic and the game is super addictive, really happy to have picked this up as app of the day.
B005FISBTO|3.0|All disc seem to be fine , however.. the DVD cases were not the original and looks extremely tacky and cheep.<br />Person slipped the original Dexter covers into a cheep cases and it was crooked, not easy to fix.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. The writer kept the reader wondering throughout the entire book. The ending was unexpected at least by this reader.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|We love to play this game.  Although I play games to relax, this one has me on the edge of my seat as my daughter and I compete to see who gets the higher score.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I was amazed the first time I saw it on opening day, have watched it dozens of times since. Glad that I have a digital copy to watch on my iPad.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I can not even begin to explain how much I absolutely adored this book. Read it in one day and turned around and read it two more times within the next week I just couldn't get the darn book out of my head! The kicker is I just happened to come across it randomly and thought I would give it a try after reading some of the reviews and I am definitely glad that I did. I guess in a sense it takes me back to a similar love story of my own, maybe thats why I enjoy it so much. The book was amazing though, very well written and yes it was a rollercoaster...but no relationship is perfect so one shouldnt expect it to be. I thought it was a great read and I'm glad I found it...I am on edge waiting for Walking Disaster to come out from Travis's POV. SO excited :) Definitely give this book a try...you won't be disappointed! :)
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Best movie I've seen in several years. Excellent family feature. Our teenage boys really enjoyed the series of books and the movie brings the story to life.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I don't really understand how this book got so many good ratings...I mean I get that everyone has their own opinion...but the first book I read in one sitting...loved it! I even recommended it to a few friends and loved the first so much I immediately bought the second...which is still hanging out on my kindle at about 21% read. Needless to say, I'm not waiting on the edge of my seat for the third. I hate to be negative but sorry, it was a huge disappointment for me compared to the first.
B00004W221|5.0|Great football movie about hard work and perseverance no matter how tall you are, good family movie, got as a gift, highly recommend.
0307951529|5.0|A practical guide to start your own business. If you are searching for a book to give give you a step by step solution and ideas, this is the one. I recommend it a lot!
0545128285|5.0|This is a great add-on book for any avid Harry Potter reader. It includes several wizard fairy tales including Babbity Rabbity & her Cackling Stump, The Wizard & the Hopping Pot, and the famously famous Tale of the Three Brothers.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This was such a sweet and funny movie. It was pretty consistent with the style of Wes Anderson's other films, and was definitely just as enjoyable.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Came in excellent timing and was in great shape! It was a gift for my Mom. Great album! My Mom loved it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The graphics are very clear.  I enjoy the game very much.  It provides hours of entertainment, thinking and frustration to kill boredom.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|great TV series. Hard to stop watching as it is totally addictive. Learn so much and enjoy a good cast.
B008PZZYB2|5.0|Great movie.  Must see if you like goofy, silly movies.<br /><br />Great performances from everyone and a classic in my book.  I can watch this movie anytime.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is a great story.  The characters are developed well, the plot will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the development of the lives of the main characters are incredible.  You know the ins and outs of their personalities - until you realize, you don't!  Great book.
B004R92PYE|5.0|I actually bought this whole album more than a year ago. You see, I wanted to leave this review because more than a year later and I still listen to this album. I am the type of person that will choose 1 or 2 songs from an album and listen to just those songs over and over. After some time I get sick of those songs and move on to something else. This was definately not the case with this album. I fell in love with the entire album... More than a year later and I still can't stop listening to Vices & Virtues.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love games like this.  So keep up the good work on getting games like this one.  Cause it keeps me going every day. Just the way I like it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I liked the book. It was my least favorite of all of Mitch Alboms books. Tuesday's with Morrow will always be my favorite.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved the book. Saw the movie, now I can see it over again, and again. The sound is great love it
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I would recomend to all my friends. I could not put it down. It was a good story but sad
0345803507|5.0|Book #3 did not disappoint....... Again, there was sex, drama, passion, tension, even tenderness. This was a great book to finish off the series.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />It was great to for Christian to finally grasp what Elena did to him, even though in a way it did save him for a time. Christian is still overprotective but a lot more loving & understanding. And still sexy as ever. Book #3 I think was more Christian becoming aware of all his fears & putting together more peices of his past. Finally linking them together & understanding that he is loved & deserves love.<br /><br />Awesome. I will read this series many times
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Enjoyed the background to and development of a very close relationship that was different from anything I had read before
0345803485|5.0|All I can aay is WOW...... I did not understand the hype but now I do.<br /><br />I am not sure if you can seperate a novel from erotica & romance. I know it can be romance without the erotica. This is erotica that is for sure.<br /><br />The relationship between Ana & Christian is so awesome. I mean you understand that they both are so attracted to each other that they are willing to just dive in & throw the rules out the window. Ana is amazing in willingness & strength of her inner sex goddess. Ana wants compromise & Christian basically just wants Ana even if he has to compromise. I think these 2 people really need each other. Ana needs Christian to free her sexually & Christian needs Ana to show him he can love and is worthy of love. But can Christian love & can Ana deal with this kinky life style if she can have Christian she must try right.<br /><br />WOW -- I am very glad that I can dive right into Shades Darker & not wait. I can not wait to see what happens next with these two
1595141715|3.0|I did not find this book to be nearly as dazzling as everyone else seems to think. It wasn't a bad book but I think it's highly overrated. I gave it three stars because, being a victim of school bullying myself, I could totally believe all the little nasty things the kids at Hannah's school did. That part of the book was very real to me. But I had two major problems with the novel.<br /><br />Number One: Of course I felt sympathy for Hannah; she had a lot of problems, most of which were not her fault. But she was also a petty, whiny, vindictive witch. Her thirteen tapes are, as a friend of mine put it, the ultimate \\"you'll be sorry when I'm dead.\\" Very childish.<br /><br />Number Two: I know from experience that when a person is so depressed that they're at the point of ending their life, they usually just don't have the energy to do something as elaborate as Hannah's scheme with the tapes. Some of Hannah's other actions (or more like inactions) preceding her suicide make a lot of sense -- like, simply sitting there and allowing a boy she loathes to sexually assault her, that's exactly what an extremely depressed person might do, because they become extremely inert and apathetic. That doesn't really mesh with the kind of energy and careful planning it would have taken to execute the tape scheme. I simply could not buy the literary device of the tapes, without which the whole story collapses.<br /><br />In spite of its flaws, the story was compulsively readable and may teach the reader a lesson about how their actions affect other people. I believe this author has promise and I will probably read his next book. I think he simply bit off more than he could chew with this one, though.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I have been playing this game for a long time. I have built up my town with a lot of stuff. I go to play it today (11/25) and everything is gone. It has wiped everything away. I had over 10k in coins,  cash and 50 energy not to mention all my houses,  barns, storage buildings,  hospitals,  tent hospitals,  work shacks,  etc. I AM PISSED OFF and I will not start over.
B005HSL626|4.0|its good but after a while it kinds gets boring boy if you are. reading this to see if you should get it then you should because it is a awesome and easy game to play!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|During the first listen to this cd, I was immediately reminded of everything I loved about The Nightfly and Steely Dan's Two Against Nature. You can definately hear the influence of those two albums. A beautiful, relaxing, smooth jazz vibe runs through the whole set. With enough funk to keep your foot tapping. This has quickly become one of my favorite albums now.<br /><br />If you have any love of later Steely Dan or solo Fagen work, this album will feel like an old friend.
B0053O89XI|5.0|This show has continued to provide hours of laughter for our family.  I think we all have people in our lives, which remind us of these characters.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love playing this game.  My husband and I take turns which makes it even more fun.  When I miss by one, it make me angry myself sometimes though.
1400069289|4.0|Originally reviewed for 12booksgroup.com<br /><br />This was a great read, particularly because of the examples used to describe how habits work. Duhigg sharply expanded on his examples, deliberately using popular/familiar events to make the book a compelling read. The illustrations used to describe Duhigg's model were a welcome addition toward consistently highlighting the model's utility in various situations.<br /><br />I had some difficulty following the argument that habits  fundamentally controlled organizations and social movements, though. The details and circumstances of the real-life examples used seemed forcibly packaged into a type of habit or simply mentioned to be later disregarded.<br /><br />The Power of Habit was a great read for unlocking the way to combat bad personal habits, but the arguments for the role that habits play in much broader venues were a little too much for this reader to accept.
B002CO1Y2A|5.0|This album is my favorite Van Halen recording with Sammy Haggar. Awesome vocals and just kicking jams. Great music from the eighties.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Excellent read.  Is an interesting story line with a great twist at the end.  Keeps you glued to the book!
B009CG2YDE|1.0|this game douse not respond to my tillting on the kindlefire. I can not move and thisgame is not good at all. Do not waistyour.Mont on this game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's always there, when I pull down the menu slide on my Kindle Fire HD's home page, whenever I want a weather update or forecast. How convenient!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is a nail biter! If you're looking for a series to watch, this one is a good one!
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Great time waster. I love this game. I play it all the time. I'm constantly trying to beat my last score.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Of course I would give this product a 5/5 because its LED ZEPPELIN!! Their an amazing band and have loved their music ever since I was a little kid.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|\\"Live in London\\" is my favorite DVD and I have several of Il Divo. It is the next thing to being at a live concert.<br />I did go to an Il Divo concert in August, thanks to my son and daughter.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its easy to get lost in the game. great for when you're bored. only downside is that some are really tricky and to get hints( after 3) you have to pay. if you skip them its cool though. great game if you have time to waste.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|this game puts a new and exciting twist on an old classic that we all know and love. gotta love it.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Love tony bennett and love the cd and all the music on the cd.  the artists were great and would wonderful
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It had been quite a long while I had not watched a movie inside a cinema. The last one should be Avatar, simply because of the fad more than anything else. This one was different. I simply couldnt wait till its release in Blu-ray which I normally do no matter how great the reviews are. I remember that I had run to and fro the toilet in order to not miss much, and time really flied in that nearly three hours of engaging, imposing, exciting, heroic, frequently heavy but definitely not action packed experience, consummated with Zimmer's superb muscial score. The acting of Michael Caine is marvellous and it's the first time that the grandfather and son relationship between Bruce and Alfred had been so manifest. Actually my praise to this movie is beyond words. I bought the Blu-ray two days ago and I had already watched over ten times the part from which the \\"Bat\\" carried the bomb away over the bridge to the rolling of the credit (the whole of the music \\"Rise\\" on the OST) and for sure I will keep on enjoying that. In short, a must watch!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Action scene are perfect<br />Excelent cast<br />i watched this movie a lot of time and finally will be in my collection
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app ever it really wants to help guide you in the right direction. Now I know there's no excuse for not reading the Bible.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|After seeing the first 2 of the Atlas Shrugged movies, I wanted to see this, I loved it. It is B&W, quality production.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I saw \\"Avatar\\" in the theater when it first came out.  The 3D was especially well done.  It enhances the enjoyment of the fantastic world James Cameron created.  The movie is truly a visual delight.  The transfer to 3D Blu-Ray is superb.  Watching the movie at home is just as good as watching it in the theater.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was definitely interesting, but there were parts of t that were just too convoluted to make any sense out of.
B009MB682W|5.0|Just loved the original theme music.  The second CD of other music from the films is a nice addition.  Hurray for 50 years.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Kiddos and I enjoyed this movie. Had some scary parts for my six year old but we all liked it. Even my 16 yr old watched with us.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I found this book just amazing, very poignant and such food for thought  One of the best books I have read
B009JZSC9S|5.0|We were disappointed to have missed this episode and were thrilled to find we could do instant video. This was our first experience and it was so worth it. Great show!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought the hunger games was extremely well written.  All three books captivated me and I couldn't put them down.  My teenage daughter kept trying to get me to read them and I put her off for months.  Wow.  I should have listened much sooner.
B004J09ONG|5.0|I balled my eyes out so be prepared. This was an extremely touching story! I was amazing the entire time. You have to watch it!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Thought the movie was a little slow at first but when all is said and done and you realize what the deal is (i wont spoil the ending) this movie was just a classic Denzel movie.
B003K16PAU|4.0|Orwell does a fantastic  job describing the life of a pauper, first in Paris then in London. Orwell sheds light on the struggles being a low-lifer and dispels common misconceptions. His concise, simple approach to writing makes this book easy to digest. Highly recommended.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Cannot rate 3D effect as my Sony 3D quit after 18 months - the movie is great and exactly what I anticipated.
B009K0P10K|5.0|It's been a while since a television show has been so intense in all the right ways. This show keeps you on the edge of your seat. no reason to not like it. The actor's chemistry with one another shines through.
0316228532|5.0|When JK Rowling was on Charlie Rose, she said that the central theme of this novel was about who is worth saving, and what price the saving is worth. That is important to keep in mind as you are introduced to so many unlikable, and yet entirely realistic characters. Each of them needs to be saved from something, and each of them believes salvation lies down a different path. Discovering what lies at the end of each path is the joy and the heartbreak of this complex, emotional novel.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So addictive but I totally love it!!!!  Even with the ads, Angry Birds rocks.  You have to try this game.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think that since the app is free that there shouldn't be a cost for hints. But other than that, this app makes you want to figure out each and every puzzle.
0887307280|5.0|I ordered this book for my son.  He is enjoying reading and learning the pros and cons with opening your own business.
0440246016|4.0|I love the Reacher books.  Full of action and fleshed out areas, characters and plot.  I look forward to reading more and more Reacher books.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This movie is a feel good, nostalgic walk down memory lane, whenever your childhood, wherever summers were spent, this movie brings it all back. Great cast and setting, I will watch it again and again.
0515141429|5.0|I am definately a fan of Patterson and rarely critical of his writing.  I love his style of writing and find his books to be just fun reading.  I love the Reacher books probably because I envy Jack his ability to just wander around with nothing living his life.  Sounds like fun to me.
0525952926|5.0|I really like Ken Follett's writing.  This second book in the series picked up where the other left off, did a good job of reacquainting you with the events of the previous book, and carried the story forward.  I can't wait until book 3 is released.
B00ADII8YE|5.0|Who else out there is hoping for Andrea to die?? I can not stand her, love the show but please let her be the next to go.
0345803507|1.0|I have nothing to add that anyone else hasn't already said. It took me 5 months to hack through this thing.  I never give up on a book and I wasn't going to let this one break me.  There are a million GOOD books out there that most of us will never have the chance to read thanks to time wasted on trash like this.  I pity the tree that died for it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this story to anyone questioning the life after death theory.  This story fascinated me because it was written by a Dr. who previously had been of a scientific mind and after his experience was able to bring science and afterlife together and make them work!  Well written and very interesting.
1574214276|5.0|And I'm hooked. I reluctantly bought this book thinking there wasn't much I could learn about drawing. It turns out it is more than a drawing how-to. It is a book that leads you into a Zen-like drawing meditation with pen and paper. These aren't little doodles that take a few seconds to make. These are careful, yet playful, works of minature art that take your mind into a peaceful and meditative place. I confess that I love it. I used a blank Tarot deck and my trusty Uniball pen to make the drawings. Each one took at least 20 minutes, some taking much more -- and yet the time spent making them flew by as my right brain silenced the concerns and worries of my left brain. This is something you can do anywhere, anytime. Take your Zen with you by producing tangles wherever you happen to be at the moment. The tangles in the book are a good jump-start for the beginner as well as the stuck intermediate tangler.<br /><br />I've submitted photos of my beginner tangles above. In just a few weeks I've grown a great deal and I appreciate this wonderful meditation even more.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|This was a good movie, I love the polar bears.  They were cool with the armor and stuff, even read the book.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|This novel had a few good moments but not enough to keep me interested.  I finished the novel since I had invested a lot of reading time but I won't be reading the previous ones in the series.  The author had the good sense to kill Harry at the end and that is just as well.  Norway already has &#34;The Scream&#34; and there really is not much need for more anxiety and isolation.

0547884591|5.0|Tim surpasses my expectations with each book he releases.  HIs ability to DiSSS topics and provide the tools for the readers to accomplish these tasks, be it an awesome body, sex, running, work and now cooking.  The gem in this book is that he has not only been able to distill his knowledge of cooking to me, a skill that I need badly - however he has given his readers the step-by-step instructions on how he thinks to accomplish his tasks through DiSSS and CaFE.  This is what I've been waiting for.  Not, how to cook...but how he learns.  The META section of the book is well worth the price alone.

0547884591|5.0|In in the interest of full disclosure, I'm only halfway through this book.<br /><br />And yes, it is a book about cooking (and other things), but I think that taking it out of context is a mistake. Its not just a cooking book, its a book about cooking by Tim Ferriss. It's an approach to learning a subject in the most efficient way possible. Regardless of why you read his books (I love all of them and I'm not exactly working a 4-hour work week and most definitely eat more than beans and meats for every meal), if you like his books for what's at the core of them-- intrepid adventurer learns how to do something better than other people; lives to tell the tale; teaches you how to do it too-- then you'll like this one.
B0081HLMD8|4.0|This Norwegian import was quite the pleasant surprise.  Combining the disturbing wit of the Coen Brothers, the mystery of Hitchcock and the in-your-face visceral gore of Sam Raimi, Morten Tyldum's film has enough twists and turns for any fan of the genre.<br /><br />Roger Brown (excellent Aksel Hennie) narrates his own story.  Although he is a successful corporate recruiter (headhunter), he has trouble making ends meet.  He's living over his head always trying to make an impression on his statuesque trophy-wife Diane (beautiful Synnove Macody Lund).  He lets the audience know that he's only 5' 6\\" more than once.  He supports Diana's art gallery opening and is constantly paranoid about his wife's commitment.  To us it appears her only concern is that Roger refuses to discuss the idea of having children.<br /><br />Needing more income, Roger has a sideline.  He steals rare art (Diana unwittingly gives him information), replacing it with near perfect reproductions.  It turns out that one of Roger's potential clients, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is known to have a valuable Renoir.  As Roger lifts the painting, he discovers his wife's phone in Clas's apartment.  Hmm.  This set up leads to a strong middle section of the film where Clas is hunting down Roger in an effort to kill him.<br /><br />This frankly doesn't make much sense, but it's a lot of fun to try to figure out why.  At the same time we see poor Roger go through a series of identity changes and escape mechanisms including one you won't forget any time soon.  This is a skillfully made, tension filled drama with just enough wickedness to make it a cut above.<br /><br />The Blu ray version of this film looks excellent.  Although I suspect it was shot on film, the 1080p transfer looks very digital-like.  That is, there is little if any grain.  As it takes place in cold Norway, the whites are bright and the sky is blue, very blue.  Excellent blacks as well.  You have 2 audio options, both DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  I only watched the Norwegian version with English subtitles.  The other option is a dubbed English language version.  The audio is very active with the soundtrack very noticable throughout the film.5.1.  I only watched the Norwegian version with English subtitles.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I rarely give 5 star ratings unless it's a classic album, just personally amazing to me, or if it's so brutal it would be a crime not to rate it highly. Dark Roots of Earth is an album that suprised me in a BIG way. In fact, its in their top four best albums. Chuck's vocals are amazing. The solos are pretty nice and the drumming as always is great. If I'm not mistaken I believe this album uses blast beats as well which I find as a nice addition to the personality of this album. The title track is heavy and one of Chuck's best vocal showings on the whole album. Cold Embrace is one of their best ballads they have ever done, if not the best. The intro to the song is like a cross between the intros to  \\"Return to Apocalyptic City.\\" from The Legacy and the intro to \\"Hypnosis\\" from the New Order. The whole album is a modern day classic. The only weak part to me is Man Kills Mankind. While the concept is great, the chorus sorta wears me down, other than that, this is a great metal album from one of the masters. I'm about to get The Formation of Damnation soon and see why everyone hates it. But I believe this album can only be topped by The Legacy and possibly The New Order. Overall, this is a must have album it belongs with their best and the production is great.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Supposedly un-filmable, this fantastical tale of a teenager from India surviving at sea for weeks, alone but for a Bengal tiger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking.  The movie begins with an adult Piscine (Pi) Patel (Irfan Khan) relating a potential story for a book to be written by a friend of a friend (Rafe Spall).<br /><br />He tells of him and his family leaving India and their zoo for Canada to start over.  They have crated up numerous animals for the long voyage on a Japanese cargo ship.  During a violent storm the ship sinks, but through some fortune, Pi (Suraj Sharma) has managed to land on a life boat along with an injured zebra, a disoriented Orangutan and an ornery Hyena.  Oh, and the tiger.<br /><br />Now before you think this is one of those can't-we-all-just-get-along Disney movies - after all it is rated PG - forget about it.  One of the points driven home in the film is that these are animals and in fact, they do what animals do.  You get the picture.  Pi, realizing he isn't dealing with dogs and cats, uses the human brain and creates a makeshift raft which is tethered to the boat.  At certain times he is able to return to the boat for supplies and to check on the surviving tiger.<br /><br />Their confrontations are certainly the meat of the film, but that really isn't enough.  I saw this in 3-D and it is certainly the best use of the technology since \\"Avatar.\\"  Directed by Ang Lee, the use is never in-your-face trickery, but is created on film as a new, dare I say art form?  While this film may not be life changing, it is beautifully made, creative and wondrous.  There are enough questions to keep the mind busy for days to come.  Lee and screenwriter David Magee masterfully adapt Yann Martel's novel.  And just when you are trying to soak it all it, an alternate version of the story gets the mind reeling.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (5-2-13):<br /><br />This Oscar winner, including director Ang Lee, begged to be seen again.  It ranked as my 10th favorite film from last year and would likely move up if I would have a do over.  This time I saw it in 2-D and it holds up nearly as well as it did on the big screen in 3-D.  While there is no understating the technical achievement of the film, it is also filled with wonderful emotional moments and big chunks of humor.<br /><br />For example, early in the story Pi relates how he became so interested in various religions.  He was a practicing Hindu as well as Christian and Muslim as a young teen.  Surprisingly this didn't seem to bother his parents.  In one exchange at the dinner table his father, Santosh (Adil Hussain), comments, \\"3 more religions and you'll spend your whole life on holiday.\\" He then adds, \\"Think rationally.\\"  The relationship Pi had with his father, including the respect for wild animals, is an important point in the story.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer has an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, with a couple exceptions, and has a 1080p resolution.  As you might expect there are virtually no blips in the carryover that I could see.  This is a colorful movie and all the hues and shadings come across perfectly.  The film was digitally shot and is crystal clear.  Chapped lips and sunburned tiger nose are easily seen.  There is a couple format changes to note.  In one scene with the flying fish, the aspect ratio changes to a wider 2.35:1.  In another, a shot from overhead as a whale glides by the boat is shown in windowbox (1.33:1?).  These are brief scenes and while noticeable, they are not distracting.<br /><br />The audio is demo quality with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track on full display.  There are scenes of quiet beauty (great musical score) and others of thunderous activity from all speakers.  An example is the violent ship sinking scene.  For some great sound effects, check out the tiger claws as he makes his way around and later into the boat.  This is a magnificent film paired with a superb transfer.  There are 3 documentaries involving the movie production as well as a photo gallery and some storyboards included in the extras.n as well as a photo gallery and some storyboards included in the extras.

0547884591|5.0|I spent the weekend after Thanksgiving really studying this book and although I haven't read it cover to cover - I love it so far!  I have already followed two of the recipes and they turned out great and were very easy to follow.  This is one of the best things about the \\"cooking\\" portion of this book - the recipes are structured in a very user friendly way.<br /><br />I am also very excited about some of the more adventurous topics that appear later on in the book (I skimmed ahead.)<br /><br />The book is very visually appealing and that coupled with Ferriss' writing style makes it very hard to put it down.<br /><br />I would highly recommend getting the 4 Hour Body as a companion to the 4 Hour Chef (4HC) if you don't already have it as the 4HC really builds on some of the core principals in that book.  I have found the 4HC to be a great extension and motivator for achieving the diet/health goals I set for myself after reading the 4 Hour Body.<br /><br />I have already bought this book as a gift for several friends/family members and plan to get more as well.

B009MF56GC|4.0|The Good: An amazing opening action sequence instantly ropes you into the movie.  Jean-Claude Van Damme is the best thing about this movie, he's funny and makes an excellent villain (because he also comes across as menacing).  This movie is funnier than the first one, the chemistry has built up more between Stallone and Statham.  Their bickering will have you laughing.  The dialogue is also an improvement from the first one, granted, it's not going to win for best screenplay, but it helps move things along.  Chris Hemsworth provides the best acting in the movie (like Mickey Rourke in the first one).  He almost seems out of place in this movie because his acting is too good.  Seeing all the biggest action stars of the 80's blow apart an airport together (with civilians still in the line of fire) is an action fan's dream.  oh, and Chuck Norris of course.<br />The Bad:  This movie isn't as well-paced as the first one.  There is a gap where the movie sort of stagnates and attempts to develop its characters with mediocre dialogue.  There are some chuckles during this time, but you'd rather just see stuff blow up and everyone yelling like maniacs.  This movie puts its best foot forward with that opening action sequence, the rest of the movie never matches up to those first 10-15 minutes.  I felt they should have given Van-Damme a bit more in the last fight scene with Sly.  The spin kick ruled, but he should have bounced Sly's head off a wall a couple of times to make the fight more even. Arnold Schwarzenegger, I love Arnold, but he sucked in this movie.  'I'm back' 'He'll be back' 'Everyone is back' enough.  Usually, his awful jokes are funny, but here, their just regular awful.<br />The Deal: This movie is exactly what you think it is and Sly knows it.  It's very tongue-in-cheek where these guys can poke fun at themselves.  If you are an action fan you will catch some of the inside stuff going on here (Knock,Knock written on the tank in the beginning, a reference to oneof Arnold's lines from Predator).  This movie delivers from an action standpoint, which is the only standpoint it has to deliver.  This is a slightly better movie than the first one in part because there is some semblance of a plot (Van Damme stealing plutonium to sell to a buyer).  Good enough for me. Let's blow s**t up!!!

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Saw this movie in theaters and liked it quite a bit. I'm still unsure if this was supposed to be officially in the Alien movie line or if the references were just &#34;easter eggs.&#34; I also think there were some ties to Stargate SG-1, besides just the title.<br /><br />The environments were great and definitely worth seeing in HD. The plot was good, with a nice departure from every single Alien movie plot. Instead of aliens spreading like zombies to kill everyone, they were already there and it goes a lot deeper into the story and less on just survival.<br /><br />A huge plus, the girl is cuter than Ripley from the Alien series. ;)
B002AKPECW|5.0|The concepts are grand - for example, how do you have any kind of culture across star systems if the reality is that the speed of light is the limit? No, grander than that, even.

0316069434|4.0|If The Drop is Connelly's version of \\"taking a breath\\" after Nine Dragons, it appears the author is now oxygenated. Fully.<br /><br />The Black Box is Connelly building momentum from the jump, twisting it up right, then changing gears to a whole other level of \\"oh crap, really?\\", to a finish as gripping and cinematic as any Bosch adventure to date.<br /><br />After an opening flashback of his current cold case, we pick up Our Guy in the opening phases of his new look into things as a member of the Open/Unsolved team. Using newer technologies on the murder weapon and such. Fighting the disadvantage of chasing down twenty-year-old clues with a scintilla of new information. Faded memories make it harder. And that stuff is all minus intention.  Which Connelly adds with glee.<br /><br />The other primary element of The Black Box, is the evolving dynamic between Harry and his 16-year-old daughter Maddie. Being a fly-on-the-wall to this relationship has become the emotional core of the series, especially the way Connelly shows how it affects all aspects of Bosch's life.<br /><br />But wait, there's more. Bosch's beloved aversion to authority has created more than his share of boss issues, and the current punching bag is punching back, pushing an internal beef about a side-visit Bosch makes during his investigation, involving the son of his current flame, Hannah Stone, first intro'd in The Drop. Connelly's integration of her into BoschLand seems a bit tentative, tying in with Harry's similar attitude towards her, Plenty of walls there. This thread also introduces a new character, Detective Mendenhall, a tightly-wound by-the-book gal providing all kinds of conflict for Harry, and maybe a little spark!<br /><br />Connelly takes a peek into military life during Desert Storm, as things move forward, building great back story and locking in Bosch's dedication to the victim, a European female photojournalist. Connelly uses this character to send a nice valentine to the amazing real-life reporters that jump into harm's way in a perilous search for truth and, sometimes, justice.<br /><br />It's these basic elements that Connelly winds up, then as the gears of the cold case start to mesh, Bosch hits the road, and before long we're in a Joe Carnahan movie.....intense action, high stakes, and a hero pushed to his limits both physical and spiritual.<br /><br />The Black Box is yet another rocket-ride from one of the acknowledged masters, and one of the year's best books.al-life reporters that jump into harm's way in a perilous search for truth and, sometimes, justice.<br /><br />It's these basic elements that Connelly winds up, then as the gears of the cold case start to mesh, Bosch hits the road, and before long we're in a Joe Carnahan movie.....intense action, high stakes, and a hero pushed to his limits both physical and spiritual.<br /><br />The Black Box is yet another rocket-ride from one of the acknowledged masters, and one of the year's best books.

0547995660|3.0|Jonas, an eleven-almost-twelve-year-old boy lives in the Community with his father, mother, and younger sister Lily.  It is a planned utopian society governed by Sameness, with no war, fear, or pain, but also no choices.  The weather is perfectly controlled, no hills exist, no live animals are seen, and there is even no color or music.  At age twelve, all people are assigned their roles in the community.  The old, young children who do not thrive, and even those who rebel are \\"released.\\"  Jonas is singled out to receive special training from the Receiver, who alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life and now becomes \\"the Giver,\\" so that Jonas can be trained as the new Receiver.  Jonas's father is a nurturer and the family has been caring for a newborn named Gabriel who is not thriving, so the decision is eventually made that the infant will be released.  Now that he has received the truth, how will Jonas react when he learns what it really means to be released?  And what will he do?<br /><br />  The Giver is well-written and quite interesting to read.  However, to be truthful, I really did not care for it.  And I think that my reaction basically involves the issue of age-appropriateness.  The book is said to be written on an age nine to eleven reading level and is usually listed as being for age twelve and above, so it was apparently aimed at middle-grade students.  However, I noticed that the Random House edition which I read is found in their \\"Teens\\" section, and others have recommended it basically for upper grades.  There may be some value in the book for high school students to consider the consequences of a controlled society where people give up freedom for safety.  However, there are certain aspects of the story--the infanticide, the euthanasia, and some rather oblique sexual references--which I think are just too heavy and thus are not appropriate for younger readers.<br /><br />Also, the ending is rather odd.  Whether it is happy or not I guess all depends on the eye of the beholder.  Is The Giver a horrific book?  Not necessarily, although it has some things horrible to contemplate in it.  Is it a useful book?  Perhaps, under certain circumstances.  Is it a good book?  Each person will have to make up his or her own mind on that question.  I do agree with the assessment that it is \\"For mature audiences, as there is an episode of euthanasia.  The story questions values we take for granted.  Caution, and probably pre-reading recommended.\\"  There are three \\"companion\\" novels--Gathering Blue, Messenger, and now Son.t I guess all depends on the eye of the beholder.  Is The Giver a horrific book?  Not necessarily, although it has some things horrible to contemplate in it.  Is it a useful book?  Perhaps, under certain circumstances.  Is it a good book?  Each person will have to make up his or her own mind on that question.  I do agree with the assessment that it is \\"For mature audiences, as there is an episode of euthanasia.  The story questions values we take for granted.  Caution, and probably pre-reading recommended.\\"  There are three \\"companion\\" novels--Gathering Blue, Messenger, and now Son.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Another item my fiance began reading, she read the first one in ONE day! She was absolutely addicted and had to read ALL three books!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|This video is elusive, having seen it on its premiere and several rentals-it is noteworthy imvho for its replayability and the difficulty in finding the dvd at a reasonable price.Take a peek at the other 2 parts of the trilogy for real sticker shock, lol.  Christian Bale adds his dark terminator style and spiritual noteworthiness.The symbolic good vs evil emulation, kung fu on a mountaintop, fantastic toys and the 1% vigilante justice lifestyle. Truly, how can you go wrong? Fear the Bat!
B009K0P10K|5.0|My fiance watches it, she can't get enough of it! We both like suspence, thriller type of movies with good plots. Well done!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|It didn't get much love from my girlfriend or I. I would pass find and something more interesting. Not very good CG.
B00881PPTO|3.0|To speak to the permissions people are freaking out over:<br /><br />Read/write calendar: so it can add the itinerary you book to your calendar<br />Email: so you can send that itinerary to contact(s) of your choosing<br /><br />Think maybe that could be the point of using a travel app instead of the website? Logic people!
0307341550|5.0|This book was hands down one of the best books I've ever read.<br />I still think about it weeks after I have finished it. Visions of amma and adora haunt my thoughts. it is such an eerie tone which Gillian Flynn gives to this novel! I can't wait to read her other books.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My kid loves playing this.  Maybe too much because I can't ever play it.  The adds don't mess things up.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Love it! Saw them on late night tv and wanted to hear more. Brittney's voice and style remind me of Amy Winehouse only she rocks more.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Bought this for my lady and we both are enjoying Led Zeppelin, Celebration Day. It is a great addition to our music and music videos...
B002ELIXCA|5.0|Wanted to watch Dexter to see what all the talk was about, but I wanted to start from the beginning to get the full story. Love it! I'm not disappointed! Although, sometimes I have to FF through some scenes if they're too much for me.
0345803485|5.0|This book caught my attention as soon as I started reading it. I could not put the book down. I could not wait to read book 2. As soon as I read this one i ordered the 2nd.
B0027I93U6|5.0|After ordering Season 1 - I couldn't stop! Love it! Just had to order Season 2 and I'm certainly not disappointed!
0345803493|5.0|Amazing book!!! I can't wait to read book 3. I could not put the book down. Very well written book
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I had a lot of fun going thru this game.  The puzzles were challenging and the music provides a nice sense of atmosphere.  Simply controls/gameplay and great puzzles makes this an excellent game for your mobile.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Saw this on a 60 minutes show and bought the book.  Am REALLY enjoying it so far!  A nice dow to earth writing style.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Every year after Thanksgiving dinner we watch this as a family. We lost our dvd so I ordered the blue ray, it was good that we were also able to watch it instantly online because the package did not get delivered in time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game because there is such a variety and you can rack up points to get even more variety
B000P6PVLC|5.0|The story line of the young girl in Asia (I think it was Japan) was just so...well, lets just say I couldn't stop thinking about it for days after seeing the film.  Solid performances across the board and of course great story weaving by Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie was funny and tear-jerking all at once!  Watched it with my whole tribe aged newborn thru 19, seven kids...all of them loved it!  The 4 year old thought the bear was a little scary, but strangely enough, the 2year old didn't!  There are two scenes showing naked behinds, which I wasn't too thrilled about, but there is no bad language which was a refreshing change.  Overall, I would totally recommend this movie and I intend to buy it as soon as I can!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Great retro style game.. basically space invaders, but a fun little time waster.<br /><br />Only complaint for me is that it didnt flip, so stuck with a very narrow game.. But overall, liked it
B004J09ONG|5.0|I had watched this movie a lot when I first saw it. I fell in love with it. I thought Elsa was so cute! She is a very cute baby cub, at least when she was a cub.Let me tell you a little about it:<br /><br />  The cub was first found when George Adamson, which is Bill Travers, goes on a hunting trip. He finds three lion cubs and takes them home for his wife Joy Adamson, which is Virginia Mckenna. They name the cubs Big One, Lastica, and Elsa. They had to sell two cubs, and Elsa gets kept.<br /><br /> About two years later, Elsa shows an interest in going off on her own. The Adamsons train her how to hunt and get along with other lions. A year later, she has three cubs of her own, and she lives happily for ever.<br />  I loved lions ever since I watched this movie, and I hope you would enjoy this movie too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very helpful in letting me know how much time I have left on my battery. Loved the choice of colors to choose from. This app is very useful on my kindle. If you own a kindle I would recommend this.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Whenever we stream Amazon movies from our LG smart tv we have problems with the volume not being loud enough...we don't have this problem when we stream Amazon movies from a Roku onto other tv's. Not sure why this happens so we just hooked up Bose speakers and still enjoyed the movie. I'm sure someone out there knows the solution to this problem..? Quality of picture was good.
0547884591|5.0|I pre-ordered this book from Amazon and tore through it when i got it. I never expected a \\"cookbook\\" to be a page turner, but it was. In this book Tim Ferriss gives some great strategies and an overview of meta learning - a lot of it was things I've sort of done or thought to be the case, but it was refreshing to see it laid out so well. T<br /><br />The cooking techniques an recipes are also great. I've always wanted to cook, but similarly got overwhelmed. 30 minute meals used to tick me off because they were really 3 hour meals, and even then i needed someone to help me navigate through it. It was enough to make me want to quit. 4 hour chef brings a fresh approach, its written for someone who is new to cooking, but at the same time isn't an idiot (ie its written to address an intelligent audience who can learn on their own quickly with the right direction). This book gives the right direction.<br /><br />I make scrambled eggs for breakfast every morning, and i knew they were off, but i  never knew what was wrong. after this book, my eggs were transformed, so much so that my wife said they were good enough that not only would she actually eat them, but i could serve them to guests :)<br /><br />This book has given me the building blocks I needed to learn how to cook without having to immerse myself in a youtube bachelor's program watching hours upon hours of alton brown. it cuts to the essential techniques with quick wins.<br /><br />Best of all - the recipes are slow carb compliant, it's enabled me and my wife to not only start the slow carb diet [after starting/restarting/stopping paleo multiple times], but make it an adventure along the way.<br /><br />One quick update i will add is that i love kindle books, however after going through this, it is definitely the type of book you want on your shelf for easy reference, so i recommend the hardback.
0547884591|4.0|I have been discovering Timothy Ferris books quite recently. This one, I am still reading, seems to be the broader. Cooking is just the example to make you learn how to learn.<br />The first chapters are a bit strange sometimes as the examples stray far away from cooking (sports, dances, slow carb diet...). But keep in mind that those are mere examples. The real difficulty is in real life application to your field of choice.<br />Take the trip anyway, you won't be disappointed.
B00439KW2U|4.0|Good family safe film.  My grandson is 8 years old and this movie is his favorite todate. Love the streaming video, easy, and fast.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|This movie was very disappointing. I thought the acting was poor and the plot was not well developed. At times I had no idea what they were talking about.
B00470TOV0|3.0|My husband loved it. Fast moving.  Violence as expected but in all the necessary places.  Even has some historical references.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I haven't bought it yet but I have it on the D's its a great game you guys are ganna love this one
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever! The movie is not compared to the book, it will form part of my home library, the argument is excellent and the ending even better.
030759565X|5.0|The photos, the writing, the recipes - they are all so beautiful and down to earth. I have aquired more of my all time favorite recipes from Smitten Kitchen than anywhere else. Love this cookbook!
B0089BSM70|5.0|But then again, it came in time for Halloween.  I love H2 (1981) and this package delivers.  It has a gang of xtras and a filmed episode of Horror hound's hallowed grounds (Halloween 2) for those that reads horror hound mag which is awesome.  The tv cut is cool but its edited!  That's what I thought at first but then my friend said it wasn't edited just added footage and whatnot.  So i got my hopes up for the tv cut being extra sweet but it is wht it is, a tv cut.  Nevertheless, it still brings back memories of watching it on television.  A must own for horror hounds and Michael Myers enthusiasts!
B008OOYALE|3.0|The dragons are cute and its fun to have a different setting, but as other reviewers have commented, the amount of effort to grow food enough to feed your dragons gets old fairly quickly.  And, the main complaint I have with all of the Team Lava games that I have is the amount of pop-ups you have to click through each time you open the game - very annoying!!
B0092MKTL2|4.0|So, I'm torn.  Some of these songs are great and qualify easily for five stars in my book like Radioactive, Demons, and Bleeding Out.  Others like Tiptoes and On Top of the World are strangely addictive bouncy pop songs.  Others are almost forgettable.  Listening to the album is kinda like this: Wow I love this song, happy bouncy song, this one's OK, wow I love this song, repeat.  In the end it's overall a good time, so I'm looking forward to future albums.
0547884591|5.0|Tim's done another great job with this book. It's a must read if you're looking to start your own restaurant or if you're just looking to impress yourself with what you can do in a small kitchen. He's also peppered the book with a lot of non-food related info, which builds in well with his previous two books. If you're a Tim Ferriss fan, go for it! If you're completely new to the man, he's got something going and you might just want to give it a go. This book will completely remove any limiting beliefs you may have around a kitchen, and show you that anything you want for yourself is possible by using the right methods. A definite buy!
B005S9ELM6|5.0|I remember this time period well. I was in college with many Iranian friends. Everyday in the college campus' free speech area, there were tables manned by pro Ayatollah Khomeini and also pro Shah Reza Pahlavi groups.<br /><br />Interesting and tense times for these students here. For the U.S., there was a hostage crisis on hand.<br /><br />Such is the backdrop for this movie, Argo. I heard so much about it (all positive) the last couple of months that finally I just had to go and see it for myself.<br /><br />I came away very impressed with Ben Affleck's work, directing this movie and acting in it, both done brilliantly. Gone are the days when he was good materials for the tabloid fodder and nothing more. I've heard he directed a few other very good flicks, \\"Town\\" being one of them.<br /><br />Argo is a highly entertaining movie, suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />For me, easily the best movie of 2012.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|I am very fond of Wagner--I even went to Bayreuth for 2 weeks. If you are fond of Wagner you can't do better than seeing the Ring as produced by the Met.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|One season in the middle got a little slow... but they characters, story, and mythology were REALLY fun.<br /><br />I'd love to watch this a second time (I just don't have another year to invest... maybe when I retire).
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This movie was interesting, worth watching!  I found the story line to be full of things that make you really think.
144937980X|5.0|If you have a kid that's interested in programming (or if you just want the basics), you should get this book.<br /><br />I teach kids and adults about programming, so I have some background.<br /><br />This is by far the easiest way to learn the basics.
B008PWUYVA|4.0|Placing the Kindle Fire into the case is an effortless evolution.  The tactile feeling edge is comfortable and stable on different level surfaces.  It stands only on the horizontal position.<br /><br />The Velcro enslosure is both a positive and a negative.  Enclosure is solid and secure.  I have actually dropped the Kindle within the case, unintentionally, without I'll effects to the Kindle device or screen.  However, if you're reading at night, the Velcro is quite loud and can disturb bystanders.<br /><br />One flaw, which may be due to the evaluation item, was a small tear in the case on one corner.  I do not know if it is a quality control issue but it makes me suspect the long term performance/durability.<br /><br />Overall, I like this item.  It works as advertised.<br /><br />Two thumbs up.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I have read this book twice and find it fascinating.<br />If you like a good adventure book, this book is it.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|This series is one of the best shows I've ever watched.  Not many Americans are into PBS, but there are really some great shows.  All of the Masterpiece (Classic, Contemporary and Mystery) series are really, really good.  My tip is to turn on closed captioning, if you can, because the thick British accents can be difficult to understand.  These are all very well written and well acted.  And, educational.  I definitely recommend Downton Abbey to anyone who may be interested.  I was hooked after one episode.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Still lagging behind other platforms<br />No zen garden, no survival mode. Dissapointed that the android version was just abandoned.<br /><br />How hard could an update be?
B008N1V11U|2.0|the is ok but the graphics aren't a good as gangstar Rio or modern combat fallen nation and this game came out after them but if you like batman a lot buy it
030759565X|5.0|I started following the author's cooking blog a few years ago -- and I still swear by the recipes online. I've never made something that I didn't like from the site. I have just received this cookbook as a gift, and the two recipes that I have thus far made (the roasted eggplant with tahini yogurt sauce & pizza dough) are excellent. I am looking forward to working my way through this excellent cookbook.
B0092YRYBS|5.0|Two Door Cinema Club produced a great first album, and they don't disappoint with their second . Definitely a must have for indie/pop lovers!
0525952926|5.0|This series is stunning in it's historical detail and ability to still read as a story with characters you care about.
B0019TY084|1.0|It is a wrongful depiction of Turkey and Turkish people aimed at defamation. I would not recommend it. Do not waste your time watching misleading information.
1451695187|5.0|I was facinated to try to understand how a &#34;brain&#34; surgeon associated the organism (the brain) works, along with the souls (or spirits) of our bodies once death of the physical body has taken place. It is wonderful that science is finally connecting the two and can better treat the body & mind at the same tme. Not only was it an amazing experience for him to go through with the previous thought that when the brain dies there is nothing more to look foward to but now he leaves a legacy to all who read this book. We are all connected to God. What a wonderful way to think out the rest of our lives here on Earth.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|It educates and entertains at the same time. It is hard to find such movies with meaning and peaceful messages. Definitely a must see.
B008Y212PI|4.0|hours spent on this with my husband scowling at me.  lots of logic fun!  love these games.  im looking forwaed to more...
0307592731|1.0|I feel an obligation to rate this book to spare other potential readers the misery of reading it. I cannot believe that this book was published much less that it could become a best seller. It smells of fiction vs a memoir and poorly written fiction at that. At least James Frey's fictionalized memoir was entertaining. This book was mind numbing in its repetition and lack of substance.  As a lifelong traveler and fellow female hiker of many long distance treks, I kept hoping to find something that I could relate to in this book. Instead I put it down in disgust and disappointment. Throw this one in the campfire. Before you read it!!
1401322786|4.0|Mitch Albom tells beautiful stories. The Time Keeper is the third book I've read by him. Reading his works comes very easy. He writes with \\"undistracted excellence,\\" which means the reader is able to be carried away by the story without noticing the language. And when one does take time to notice the language their almost surprised by how simple it is.<br /><br />Time Keeper is a story about Father Time, how he ended up in that situation and ultimately how he escapes it. His journey intersects with two others: a young girl and an old man. The characters are basic archetypes, heart-broken girl and rich angry elder, but Mitch colors their stories so they don't feel cookie-cutter. Father Time's character actually remained the hardest for me to connect with.<br /><br />Albom is a very quotable writer. I found myself scribbling down catchy phrases that I wanted to remember every few pages, especially towards the end.<br /><br />The purpose of this book was to encourage us to enjoy our moments, and I certainly enjoyed every moment spent with this book.
6305428042|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my daughter and her kids so I haven't opened it but it came fast and looks in good shape.

B001I8A76A|5.0|I know Pink has been around for years, but i just discovered her music, and love it. This album is great, fun listening.
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|Movie was ok.  Didn't live up to the original though.  Guess I'm &#34;old school&#34;.  Watched it twice and wasn't thrilled either time.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|D.D. Warren sounds like a witch! I really like the Dodge character. He seems more the average person in that, he is dealing battles of right and wrong. Has many times done what he thought should be right and stands by his decision, even though, others question what doesn't make sense to them. Try wearing his shoes. I hope to see a line of books out with him as the main character.
B0086DBE62|5.0|This is a fantastic family movie. Would definately recommend to family and friends. The download to my Kindle was fast and error free.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! it is fun, enjoyable and you have to use your head. I don't see how anyone can hate it!<br />Super app I would definitely reccomend it.<br />hhhhhhhhhhhhhh......<br />I hate haters!
B00138H7YK|5.0|One of my favorite all time Queen albums. Got this digital download to replace broken CD. Play it all the time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Kids love it(4&6) and I love it. Entertaining for family<br />Spend lots of time using the game as well as all angry birds
0446547573|5.0|I've only read a few NICHOLAS SPARKS books, and each one was triggered by a movie. Not the typical way I pick out a book to read. The first was A WALK TO REMEMBER. Being one of my all time favorite movies, I just had to read the book to see how it was written. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Not that it wasn't written well, or a good story, just too different from then the movie.<br /><br />The next book by MR. SPARKS I read was, DEAR JOHN. I saw the movie trailer, and knew I had to see it. I made the mistake of rushing out to get the book to read beforehand, finishing it the day before I went to see the movie. Once again I was disappointed. They had changed something, in my eyes, something major. I couldn't get past that. The movie also lacked the emotion the book did (what a surprise). The book was amazing. The movie okay. Perhaps I saw the movie too close to having read the book.<br /><br />I have THE NOTEBOOK, but have yet to read it. Loved the movie. Have THE LAST SONG, have yet to read it. Loved the movie. I guess you might say I'm a little hesitant to read AND watch something by NICHOLAS SPARKS. If I don't read a book before watching a movie, the chances of me reading it afterwards is slim. Yet each time I see a great movie like one of MR. SPARKS, I yearn to read the book.<br /><br />As soon as I saw the trailer for SAFE HAVEN, I knew I'd have to see it. Once again I wrestled with the idea of reading the book first. The writer in me wants to read how a great movie is played out in words. So I did it. I purchased the book and read it. And loved it!<br /><br />Katie Feldman slips into a small town in North Carolina, hoping to move in unnoticed. All she wants is to live out the rest of her life in peace. Meeting a man is the last thing she has on her mind. She'd doing just fine on her own, and that's the way she prefers it.<br /><br />Alex Wheatley is kind hearted and genuine. He's also a widow and father of two young children. When Katie steps into his quaint family store, he's immediately intrigued. Not only is she beautiful, she seemed to have a secret. One she isn't about to let Alex in on.<br /><br />SAVE HAVEN is definitely going on my list of favorite books. MR. SPARKS is an amazing story teller. I realize number one bestselling authors can get away with just about anything, but as an aspiring fiction author; it kind of annoyed me that he didn't keep his point-of-views straight. One sentence was one character, and the next another. More than a handful of times I had to go back and reread it to figure out whose point-of-view it was. To the average reader this may not be an issue, but to a writer that has been taught to not head hop/switch POV without indicating doing so with a break, it's distracting. I have to wonder why such a brilliant storyteller would do so. I admit there are a few times in many story that it might be helpful, but on the whole, it's not good to do so.<br /><br />Other then the head hopping, SAFE HAVE is an amazing story. Not a lull in the book, though I could have done without the overly descriptive details at times. I loved both characters, Katie and Alex. I was both surprised and pleased when the story shifted to Katie's past. The characters were three-dimensional, coming to life off the pages. After seeing the movie trailer, I could only picture the cast from the movie, which wasn't a bad thing. They fit the profile perfectly ... minus their hair color. I really liked how the abusive relationship was played out. It painted a realistic picture of what too many women go through. I have to say, I did feel sorry for Katie's husband at one point, wondering what happened in his life that caused him to do what he did.<br /><br />SAVE HAVEN is a fast paced, entraining read that will tug at your heart, and cause your heart to race with a few twists and surprises.<br /><br />Next on my list from NICHOLAS SPARKS ... THE LUCKY ONE. Now on DVD, I'm still deciding whether to read the book before seeing the movie. I guess time will tell.he movie. I guess time will tell.
B007MDB548|5.0|My only complaint is that there aren't more tinker bell movies.  We have been watching these since they came out and we waited a long time for this one and it was well worth the wait.  Disney Movies aren't all good for kids but the tinker bell movies are perfect for younger aged kids.  Not too scary and just the right amount of excitement.  Highly recommend it!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This is so PER-DICT-TABLE.  You know she is going to win and go back to har family.  It's slow at times, but still a good one to see.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|i recently fell in love with Taylor. Before i didnt understand why people luv her so much and why so many people buy her cds. but after learning about her biography and her growing up story, i find it wordlessly inspiring. I think everyone should own cd of someone i think beyond beautiful on the inside and outside.  Even lots of other award winning country singers buy taylors cd. she writes, plays, sings, she is beautiful and she is truly nice to everyone. i think she is the only person like that existing. Compare to Taylor swift, adele is notthing !!!<br /><br />i've checked out talented artists, bands, groups in both the indies rock and no indies rock side over the past years, but this is the 1st time i come across talent like Taylor Swift.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|When I read any mystery or thriller I want to be riveted instantly. I wasn't. I could, and did, put this book down. I found it hard to pick up again but I finished it. It was a very slow start and even with the usual grisly scientific details and familiar characters it never quite captivated me. Even though this was not a favorite, I will continue to be a Patricia Cornwall fan.
B008OTTRXU|1.0|what kind of crap is this ?  i need to rinse my ear out , god !  she stained the music industry
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|great album form beginning to end, my favorites are Numb, Pour it up, Loveeee, I can go on forever, she did her thing !!!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was the first time I had downloaded a movie onto my kindle fire. It was such a good picture it was hard to believe it was playing on the screen. The movie was a good tale about how the choices we make can have great consequences. My daughter watched it twice during our 48 hour rental.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|The origional program works great. But it loads an update within a few hours that causes it to quit working on Android phones.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|I got this for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it! I thought it was plastic but it is a kind of plastic vinyl like.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Love the diction, the style of the prose in each story, the characters and the atmosphere. Looking back, the plots where simple, the arcs linear, and the characters pretty much sings one tune each. But combined together and you get many different flavors in short, easy to consume half stories. The connecting thread isn't an overarching plot but a theme of predacity: the predators and the preys. I wouldn't say it's better or worse than the movie. They're both really good if you approach it with the right frame of mind.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|F18 carrier landing is a great diversion and isn't so overly simple that anyone could land the plane. On approach I'd like to see an LSO giving advice as you get close.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|Bought this book when it was on sale. It's pretty trippy and definitely feels like the world is very strange and disturbing, like in a feverish dream. Like PKD's other books, the characters are but plot devices with one dimensional personalities. It's interesting and worth a look but I wouldn't buy it at full price. I generally prefer to be more emotionally involved with the books I read.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Recently went to see the musical and it was hard to catch all the words of the songs. Now I know them by heart.
0345529057|3.0|Having just finished the first season of Game of Thrones, I was excited to find out what else happens. Only to realize not much. Second book has some interesting plot points, third book meanders until the end with a sizeable payoff. Fourth book is dull and boring and filled with my least interested characters. Apparently the fifth book will feature Aria and the dwarf more prominently, but at this point I'm ok with waiting three years to find out what happens.<br /><br />The main selling point of this series, I have come to realize from talking with other people who found it entertaining, is the world building. There is a tremendous amount of world details, politics, locations, people (and people, and people; not characters, but people: their name, position, and some history). It's like reading a history book of a fictional world. I actually just wanted to know 1.) the plot and 2.) what happens to my favorite characters. But when the majority of the books are spent on the characters I couldn't care less about, it becomes pretty difficult to keep going.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|the music makes me smile -- everything is a bit over the top, but fun.  The CD is a keeper in my car.

I'm impressed though, the book really delivers.<br /><br />Tim's approach to learning and cooking is the ideal hackers guide. It makes me want to cook.

It's a scary amount of knowledge packed into one book. But it's thoughtfully put together. And that's what makes it life changing.
1451648537|5.0|This is the ultimate biography about a man who made ground-breaking achievements in both technology and arts.  With a vast number of carefully but impartially compiled stories and interviews drawn from a wide range of sources,  Issacson answered the lot of questions and mysteries surrounding Steve Jobs.  Behind the splendid facade of a visionary and prophet in the IT industry, Jobs constantly struggled with his perfectionism and the imperfection of the world, the dichotomy of objects, the dilemma of being abandoned and abandoning, relationship with friends and family, as well as the prolonged agony of illness.  The author endeavoured to balance the opinions and ideas from different sources, through which he dug deep into the Zen philosophy and ideas that shaped Steve Jobs as both a prominent leader in the IT industry, and as a person not without regrets.  The book also presents a panorama of the turbulent IT era from the 60s to the beginning of the 21st century and the personalities whose ideas we can still feel the impact today.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Horrific, but beautiful. A true love story that any person would love to have someday. Peeta is a true man.
B000TEMS3O|5.0|I am glad I finally found this album on Amazon, I have been looking for it for a while.  It was everything I thought it would be and more.  This is very different from the other 30STM albums and just as great.  The diversity and originality of this band is what sets them apart from the rest.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was a good read.  A bit slow at times but very insightful. Overall a definite recommend and very good book.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India Arie she is such an original beautiful music song after song leaves you breathless. A must have CD if you love beautiful music.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Seniors love Star Wars Angry Birds!  Great graphics, more creative traps.  I guess I'll be buying more levels once I get through these!  I know I won't get bored.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|great service and great book. i would def. rec. this book and service to others to use. very pleased with the service
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am such a huge fan of the Vampire Diaries to begin with, but I thought they did an incredible job this season of developing the characters. Yes, sometimes the plot got a little convoluted, but overall, this season is wonderful. Buy it!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I bought this movie and planned a movie night since the kids have never seen it. They enjoyed the movie and it was in new condition. rec'd VERY quickly. I would buy from this person again.
B003Z0BSU8|5.0|Brilliant performance! Have 1&2 with Krystian Zimerman. I like the strive for perfection.  In the 3rd he starts rather quickly but not hastily. Then deploys his full palet of sounds which is so much required with Rachmaninov, but he never overdoes it. The 4th I have it with Arthur Benedetti Michelangeli which was an icon for me. Leif's is certainly equally impressive!
B009MO5960|5.0|Never thought the movie franchise would go this far, it was pretty awesome... Went to go see it opening night, and had a blast! Resident Evil movies never disappoint me! Sure the movie has it's problems, but every movie does!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you like other films from this director, like Royal Tenenbaums or The Life Aquatic, you'll also love this film.  It takes the hyper stylized quality of Life Aquatic and ramps it up to another, stranger level.  It also reminds me of the style in I Heart Huckabees.  The characters are genuinely interesting and the story is surprising.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun game.  You definitely need to rely on the &quot;hint&quot; button but it does take you where need to go.
0393064476|5.0|A very engaging tale. The author provides many insights into the history of preserving the spoken word. A great read that once started was difficult to put down.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|This game is fun for a while but gets a bit repetitive after. playing a lot. The different achievement stars are Great as are the variety of creatures that you can ride but it would be great if there was a variety in gameplay integrated?<br /><br />Maybe HORSE style trick levels or mini games (think Mario Party) after reaching certain distances?
B009NQKPUW|5.0|loved it. fantastic, incredible...would recommend to anybody who love this genre of movies, I hope that you enjoy it. thank you..
B0098460O4|5.0|This album is everything that I I had hoped for. It is totally professional and classy. Everyone should buy it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved the more in depth telling of emerald city and the witches and what happened to the main characture's. A great read to children!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good, well paced erotic book, with flawed, sympathetic characters, and suspense, as well.  Can't wait for the last of the trilogy
B005H29GSI|5.0|My son loves this game. He can easily play for two hours in a row.  Every kid that comes to our house asked to their parents to buy one like &#34;Ariel&#34; (my son's name).<br />I also like to play this with him.
1451696191|5.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's a little dark, has humor, and creates a vivid image of what Charlie is going through.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really liked this book.  I loved learning about the meaning of flowers and thought it was a great story, too.  The characters and their feelings felt real to me.
B007MDB548|5.0|My 5 year old daughter enjoyed the movie.  She liked the 3D copy and I liked the digital copy for my phone and ipad.  The story line is good and as a Dad its watchable.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Contains unedited versions of some classics as well as well as music not widely heard. The selections on the second disk are works of pathos containing colors and shadings from ethnic and folk sources that influence the popular music.
B001FXCE46|5.0|I've loved all of Kings of Leon's albums.  I loved their garage rock band first album and I've loved seeing them evolve into the monster 'pop rock' makers they are today - I say that in love.  I equate the large sounds and swelling melodies to those of U2 or Radiohead - just in a different vein of rock.  This album has a bunch of great, catchy, big songs with thoughtful and sometimes raucous lyrics and I love it.
B00881PPTO|5.0|To the person who asked why would someone pay for this, the same reason people pay for most apps is because they hate ads &amp; want adfree version. To the person who said kayak only uses airlines they can make money on, They only earn $ on the referrals so why wouldn't they want as many airlines as they can get? Of course if it were up to them they'd have them all but some airlines don't want to participate for their own reasons. And to the people always whining about permissions then having the nerve to talk about Amazon not doing its job is ridiculous &amp; these reviews are always worse on the faotd, how many apps have you developed? Do you realize that most of these permissions are used for our convenience to make apps run better? Granted sometimes there are some apps that go overboard with permissions when they don't need them maybe be used to learn basic stuff but not to the extent that people act like! I wonder how much info you unknowing give away while browsing the internet on your home computers! How many people use Facebook &amp; play Facebook games? I'll bet you don't check the&quot;permissions&quot; on the Facebook games like you do with these faotd! I bet it's more info than what kayak is getting from you when you use this app!<br />It's a free AD free app that is lated out for browsing on yourphone or tablet. It's the same deals you can get from their website that many people use so they must not all be bad deals. As with any traveling deals website you have to shop around! This is just 1 more option.
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|Anyone who would be looking at this CD, would be doing so because of the names in the band. That is a good place to start, but there is a whole lot more going on here. What stands out for me is the songwriting. These guys have managed to put their status aside and craft some really great songs. I would have purchased this CD blindfolded.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|this game is a rip off all u do is pay money and watch a 30 second video and then it crashes and turns black and just goes back to home page. I try over and over again but nothing I wish I could fix it DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! I wish there was a 0 star choice!!!!!!!! arrggg :(
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Book four is well written. Its is working well as a building block for the next books. I very much enjoy Game of Thrones!
B000002GB9|5.0|I love it.  CD is in perfect condition, not even a cracked case.  Styx rocks, man! I love it.  CD is in perfect condition, not even a cracked case.  Styx rocks, man!
0061124958|5.0|Charlotte's Web is a timeless classic. We bought it for our oldest who is just really starting to bud as a reader, and he loves the story.
B0083GCK5G|5.0|So glad they got together and did it again!!!!!  Been a fan for many years! Love the Beach Boys and their songs!
0205313426|5.0|I bought this for my husband who likes to write and he loves having it around. Very pleased with this purchase.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is really great. It helps my family and of course me too. This is a book you can look at if you need any help. The only problem is it doesn't exactly give you the letters in the contents and you have to keep flipping pages but other wise this is really good and great and I appreciate it if you get it or at least keep it.  Thank you for your time.
1451627289|5.0|Not quite the Stephen King twist that I was expecting, but overall I really enjoyed reading this book. Gives you something to think about for sure. :)
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It was great as far as usability and features. I used it for a long time, but then finally deleted it because I use the screen widget a lot and TWC widget cut off and didn't display correctly.
B004T32SOK|5.0|I have Box on all of my mobile devices and like the ease of use. I also use other storage programs but Box compliments them well.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Not a good app. I tried this and it never fit right on the screen. The widget cut words off and didn't fit right.
B002P73UQW|5.0|The show gets funnier and funnier as I progress through the seasons! Was recommended to me by parents, and can't stop laughing!
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|For some reason it refuses to play most of my audio files. Even audio files that I made myself, so there isn't any kind of DRM protection on them.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have eBay on all of my mobile devices and it works just as good on my Kindle Fire as it does on my phone and other tablet.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love that the app keeps track of my checkbook even when I'm not using it.  I can even go back and review to find mistakes.
1881273156|4.0|This book is an easy read that not only helps one understand his/her loved one better, but also oneself.  Great information here for relating to others based on their personality.
B00849F82E|5.0|Hard to read, but that's Chesterton.  He's a little obscure.  But his thoughts on orthodoxy are fantastic.  If you're willing to muddle through it may take a couple of reads to really get what he's saying, but then again, anything of worth is worth working for.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|Love it, great addition to my library. Never heard of them until my friend suggested them to me, and I'm a fan now.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Just love this app. It allows me to keep in contact with friends for free and the notifications pop up on the bar.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Muy buena pel&iacute;cula, se las recomiendo, es un cl&aacute;sico, espero que pronto la saque en Blu Ray, no dejen de verla.
0425263916|5.0|Great book can't wait till the next one. Sylvia is one of my favorite authors and does a great job.
B000T433CO|4.0|Quirky and fun characters - interesting mix of actors.  Overall cute romantic/comedy story line and worth the watch if you enjoy these types of movies.  I liked it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Just like all od George R.R Martin's books, this one is spectacular. If you're going to read this book read the first one first or you will be hopelessly lost.
0425263916|5.0|could not but it down I read Bared to you and could not wait for Reflected in you!!! Read it in 2 days!!!! I don't know how i will make it until May for Entwined in you !!!!!!! ABSOLUTELY ADDICTING!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|What more do you want? I'm sure others have more detailed reviews, thus making mine unnecessary. Four more words required.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have it on all my devices and love being able to share files with others.  I haven't had any problems with this program on any device.
B005LAII0I|5.0|A classic to be enjoyed by generations to come, a great family film, Julia Roberts always at her best and upcoming young actress Lilly Collins a beautiful Snow White. The fairy tale is hilarious and refreshing love the movie, it has all the trimmings a wicked witch a handsome prince and updated dwarves : }
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app. Plenty of channels and even when local stations aren't available it gives a decent alternative from other cities or countries.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|My boys and I absolutely LOVE this movie.  So creative with the &#34;claymation&#34; (sp??) and the music (and lyrics) are to die for!  It's our &#34;go-to&#34; movie on my son's kindle.
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|The songs were fun, but the story line predictable. There was nothing about it that really stood out. Not quite enough stereotypes to be really fun y
B0052AC8C6|5.0|It's a fantastic movie - kids loved it!  Was the top film for my kids and know they will watch it again and again.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I first saw this movie on cable and loved it.  I ordered the DVD so my girlfriend could see it.  I think this a wonderful story, brilliantly told.  It does not follow the book, but does a much better job of telling the story in a coherent way.
B008XBASVY|5.0|I read it in a day and I honestly could not put it down. Chris Colfer has done it again!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is awesome because it wakes you up everyday when you set it so I would recommend this app for everyone who needs a free alarm clock.
0811877485|1.0|We have a lovely Eric Carle decorated Hungry Caterpillar bathroom for our daughter. To sort of top it all off we picked these decals to make it even cooler. The problem is the adhesive on the back of the decals is terrible so decals pop up, fall off, and make it less cooler. The decals themselves look great, just don't count on them sticking to anything short of using Crazy Glue.<br /><br />PROS: They are cute in the book.<br />CONS: The adhesive is terrible. Really really terrible.
B004I744AS|5.0|I found this to be a very helpful dictionary. I like it much better than the one that came preinstalled on my kindle.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed Moran's humerous take on what it takes to be a woman.  It was a light read that left me occassionally smirking.  Although I enjoyed it, I would most likely not recommend it to others.
B001TODO54|5.0|This is a teen-section book but as an adult I found it to be fantastic.<br />The story of a young girl being raised by her uncle, the King, because her parents are dead.  It is discovered at a young age that she is \\"graced\\", not with the ability to dance, to read minds, or to sing, her grace is killing.  The King finds much use for her, as she is a wonderful enforcer.<br />Tired of being his puppet she leaves the kingdom in search of the reason why an elderly man was kidnapped.  Along with Po, another graced teen, they begin an adventure across many lands, inhabited by evil kings with many graces that are not so nice.  Each teen's grace complements the other and helps to keep them alive during this edge-of-your-seat trek through ancient lands.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Rachel's story and would recommend it to everyone looking for a good read.  It got my attention from the beginning and kept it through to the end.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|How important is this book - its off the charts!  Everyone needs to read and read again, take notes and implement the attached program..This is not a book to motivate today, its a book to live by to bring you the future you are looking to create!  So well written and built chapter after chapter, one lesson building up to the next.<br /><br />Take notes and follow them and come back to the book in six months and you will find more insight than before. Mr. Hardy has had some great mentors but has amazing discipline in his writing and instruction.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Heather's review says it all... 'm not typically a fan of this kind of music but I love this album and would recommend it to virtually anyone - no matter what your taste....buy it, you'll like it. \\"<br />Heather     88 reviewers made a similar statement\\".  This expresses my feeling exactly.  I am not big on this genre, but this is an album that anyone will love once they start listening to it.  Its the Exile On Main Street or Sgt Pepper's of its genre.  Poreciln is simply gorgeous and otherworldly.  The whole album was truly unique when it came out.  Its owes little or nothing to any previous artist.  I love it!
B00064X3FE|5.0|Still great even after all these years.  Love the recording and very well done.  Really good sound quality.  If you are a fan of Elton John, buy it.
B009MF56GC|1.0|I liked the first one, so I bought this one.<br />Big mistake.<br />There wasn't any real plot to speak of, it felt really disjointed as they tried to work in ways to bring old action stars into the movie.<br /><br />A laughed a couple times, but the action was boring. There was zero reason to care about what happened.<br />Near the end of the movie, I was just hoping it would end.
B0000E64TR|5.0|I think this is the best Elton John album ever.  Almost every track on the album is a good one.  The sound quality in SACD is fantastic.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|...but i'm glad I did. This is a great read and a wonderful adventure. I didn't even mind that it's targeted toward younger readers, the story is just that good.
B008QDCZ3S|5.0|I think this is still one of the greatest jazz recording every made, even though it was done in the infancy of quality recording.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Best book he's ever written. Could NOT put it down! Read it in one sitting! I recommend this to anyone. It's very fast reading!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought the subject matter of the book would be too gruesome for me, which is why I waited so long to read it. However, the story hooks you right away. I couldn't put it down. I'm glad I gave the book a chance.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I read Death Comes to Pemberley after reading several positive reviews in newspapers. Now I'm left wondering what book they read, because the one I read was a giant disappointment. The way I see it, this book would interest two main groups of people: fans of Pride and Prejudice and fans of mystery stories. The book fails at both.<br /><br />Death Comes to Pemberley is essentially P.D. James' version of a sequal to Pride and Prejudice. She introduces us to all the familiar characters six years after Elizabeth and Darcy wed. Elizabeth is happily married (supposedly) and mother to two children. Georgiana still lives with her brother and sister-in-law, and the Wickhams, of course, are still banned from Pemberley. Elizabeth is busy planning an annual ball when her youngest sister Lydia comes careening up the front drive in a carriage, crying that Wickham is shot dead. Well, he's not, but it turns out his friend(and bit player from Pride and Prejudice) Mr. Denny is, with Wickham as the chief murder suspect. The story then follows the investigation into the murder, with both Darcy and Elizabeth confused as to what's going on.<br /><br />They aren't the only ones. During the hours immediately following the murder, James does make an attempt to set up several characters as possible suspects along with Wickham. But she then abandons these routes and fails to have intelligent characters ask intelligent questions, such as just what was the shot that spooked Lydia in the first place? Most of the investigation work is also done offscene by other characters, versus Elizabeth and Darcy. Realistic? Probably. Interesting? No. Instead of having clues doled out throughout the book, the entire middle section is basically Darcy and Elizabeth wondering what's going on, with nothing new being revealed. The characters constantly feel a sense of foreboding, but the reader is never really told why. For instance, Elizabeth almost immediately decides that someone maliciously carved her husband's initials into a tree, although there could be any reason for why that happened.<br /><br />When the mystery is finally untangled, it basically comes near the end of the book at the hand of a deux ex machina, followed by boring and redundant explanations by the main players in the crime.<br /><br />I could have put up with a boring mystery plot if the other focus of the book - acting as a sequel to Pride and Prejudice - had worked. This is actually why I read the book, as I'm not a big fan of mysteries but do consider P&P one of my favorite books. Sadly, this books reads nothing like the original. What made P&P fun was the subtle but scathing social commentary and, of course, the push and pull between Elizabeth and Darcy, two flawed people battling each other until they can overcome their own prejudices. Yet the two barely talk to each other throughout the whole book. Even when it's assumed they're in the same room with each other, James instead has them talk to other people instead of each other. We're told they worry about each other but never see it. When they finally have a substantial talk, it comes at the very end of the book and actually mostly rehashes issues addressed by Jane Austen in the original. Little, if any, new ground is really covered with any of the familiar characters. Perhaps the only one James did decide to add more depth to was Colonel Fitzwilliam, and his change is not for the better, I would argue, or really necessary. Gone is the witty writing. Instead, it's all depression and gloomy atmospheres.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This group of humans with flaws, put together with their small town politics is so very real in a way which is frightening at times.  The characters' stories click together piece by piece, building to a clear need for some serious soul searching or certain catastrophe.  You can't stop in the middle of the book!
B001U887ME|5.0|Slightly small for the size, but are warm and do the job nicely.  Bought these for slipping on quickly and keeping my feet dry in our rainy climate...work very well.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is a great, fun, epic adventure of a movie.  From the witty dialogue to the epic battle scene at the end, this movie was a blast.  Highly recommended!
B00866JL96|5.0|I haven't watched the entire movie yet but I still like it especially with Zac Efron he makes me feel that everything happens for a reason that sometimes you believe in the unexpected and that sometimes it comes to you that you least expected even in the darkest of shadows.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|mail in great timing,mailed in great packaging,played great with no problem. have wanted this movie for years when I show it when i was a kid.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|I love it because it is great music to listen to and I love dancing it with it to make up a lot of my moves
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Great movie! Great story! The cast is awesome I have always been such a big fan of Steve Carell! I could watch iPhone watch this m8vie over and over again!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very intense, fast moving, will keep you reading into the wee hours. Graphic descriptions are not for the weak stomached
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I have played many different games and like this the least. It would be nice to know how many matches are available. The tiles are not easy to tell if they are available. The seasons (tiles that have pictures and symbols) are difficult to tell which they are match a match to.
B007EE564U|5.0|A real entertaining novel. Read it in one session and I m a pretty busy guy. Get it, you weren't be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The low levels are pretty mindless, go for the bigger challenges and save some time. Nice to play while traveling as it is easy to play with bumps and grinds of the road.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Bought this game and my grandkids play it on MY kindle fire all the time!<br />I would give it a thumbs up!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lot of fun, but is frustrating as you go along trying to get through the levels! Some guidelines would be nice.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|I wouldn't both using Amazon's rental service unless you just watch movies by yourself on your computer.  We rented this using my iPad and tried to play it on our TV through an HDMI connection as we have done with Netflix and others.  Surprise!  it doesn't work.  Audio plays but no video.  No fixes apparently available.  We googled this problem and found others had experienced it as well but no one had a solution.<br /><br />Don't rent from Amazon if you want to play it on your larger screen for others in the room.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Wish I had read the reviews first, camera is on kindle already. It is easy to use. Have not tried it a lot just yet, Hope pictures are nice.
0547884591|5.0|I picked up a copy of \\"The 4-hour Body\\" upon returning home from the Peace Corps. As cultural readjustment goes--specifically returning to the \\"western diet\\" and the American pace of life--the book helped me identify some simple and healthy practices that eased my transition and resulted in my becoming more fit and healthy at age 36 than I have ever been. Needless to say, I was pretty excited to hear about \\"The 4-hour Chef.\\" While I'm only a couple chapters in, and I've been bouncing around a lot, I love the book. Both the design and content are spectacular. Tim has a way of drawing connecting lines between so many seemingly disparate things all of which serves to peak my curiosity and give me the nudge I need to try something new. I've had the book for four days and am already counting up the \\"small victories\\":  made some awesome coconut mashed cauliflower, watched \\"Pressure Cooker\\" and an ep of \\"Escape to River Cottage, and hit the grocery store for some new, staple pantry items. This winter in the midwest, I'm learning to cook!<br /><br />On Robb Wolf's podcast \\"The Paleo Solution,\\" Tim talks about a digital malaise--you can work all day on the computer but when it's said and done, you don't have anything physical to show for all your efforts. I've certainly felt that but not been able to articulate it. Cooking is satisfying and cooking with fresh, healthy ingredients is truly a best practice for life.<br /><br />Highly recommend \\"The 4-hour Chef\\" to people who enjoy learning in general--not just those interesting in cooking--though it's fair to say, this book has something for everyone.
B003DZX44I|5.0|The package came in perfect condition and quickly. The disc played nicely, and I am so glad to add this amazing movie to my disney collection for my friends and I to enjoy.
B007RTAR64|5.0|It has great detail.  My daughter was thrilled.  It arrived very quickly and the price was right.  We have no regrets.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Cant get past the opening video.  Keeps crashing on me.  Glad I didn't pay full price but my son will be disappointed - he was looking forward to playing spiderman.  Hope they fix it somehow.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|I bought this movie after not being able to see it in the theaters when it first came out.  I'm so glad I bought it!  The storyline keeps your attention and the animation looks great and not cheap.  It was a cute spin on the same kind of Christmas movies I always seem to see - Santa Claus & relatives and something terrible has happened that will ruin Christmas! It didn't feel cliche.  I don't have children but I love Children's movies and I think this one could keep everyone's attention.<br /><br />I got the copy with the Ultraviolet streaming.  This was my first experience with it. It and Sony Pictures do some sort of streaming - I found the whole process very confusing but I think I was just trying to skip a step without knowing I was... once you have the Ultraviolet streaming set up it's great!  The customer service was quick to respond too, even though I was complaining about it not working when in fact it was... Oops! :)  I think it's totally worth the extra dollars to get all the disc options and the Ultraviolet streaming.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|a truly wonderful animated movie . . . the animation was superb, the story was engaging and the message was universal for all. voices were also top shelf
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I find this game to be very addicting just like most games I seem to find! I always want to \\"swipe\\" more and more candy to get the maximum amount of points as possible! It's a fun game to play when I just have a few minutes of downtime and I for some reason just can't sit still like an adult should be able too. :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just read the omnibus version and I couldn't put it down it really was great science fiction. I thought the characters were well developed and the action and suspense kept me reading late into the night. Interesting concept, makes you think about how humans might really act under these circumstances and as the story develops its another reminder that your best thinking happens when you break with your paradigms.
B007STXHTM|3.0|ITS GREAT! I loved it on my cancun vaction. Used it during surfing and diving but after the first week it scratched@
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I've been a big fan of The Walking Dead ever since the first season aired on AMC in 2010, but I never got around to buying the DVD sets. I attended the 8 PM Thursday (aka Black Friday sale) sale at my local Walmart just so I could get season one and a few other DVDS at a cheap price. I had to wiggle my way around a mob of shoppers to grab the last DVD set, which I paid just under ten dollars for.<br /><br />It only took me two nights to go through the short season of six episodes. They were just as good as when I originally watched them. The show is one of the best written series on television and it keeps getting better with every episode.<br /><br />The episodes on the 2-disc set are:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />Episode 1: Days Gone Bye<br />Episode 2: Guts<br />Episode 3: Tell It to the Frogs<br />Episode 4: Vatos<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />Episode 5: Wildfire<br />Episode 6: TS-19<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />Making of The Walking Dead<br />Inside The Walking Dead: Episodes 1-6<br />A Sneak Peek with Robert Kirkman<br />Behind the Scenes Zombie Make-up Tips<br />Convention Panel with Producers<br />The Walking Dead Trailer<br /><br />Extra Footage:<br /><br />Zombie School<br />Bicycle Girl<br />On Set with Robert Kirkman<br />Hanging with Stephen Yeun<br />Inside Dale's RV<br />On Set With Andrew Lincoln
B009CG2YDE|5.0|retro atari space invader the best in the world And very good sound And grafic i recoment download for sure
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I think they are doing an excellent job of using all of the characters in the story line.  I like seeing them work as a team.
0545265355|5.0|I ordered this series as a birthday gift for my husband.  It arrived quickly and in great condition. He hasn't started to read it yet, but is looking forward to having some time to start once the holidays roll around.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Haven't played this game yet. I chose this to play but I haven't had timeto start on it yet.  Thanks
0307887448|5.0|I ordered this book as a birthday gift for my husband.  It arrived quickly and in great condition.  He hasn't started to read it yet, but is looking forward to having some time to start once the holidays roll around.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|I really love the darkness of this book.  And, Karen Marie Moning always keeps you guessing.  Most books I'm able to foresee the outcome or the twists and turns.  However, her books keep you on your toes.  Can't wait for the next novel with Dani.
0547884591|5.0|I am losing sleep over the book because I've stayed up several nights reading this. Freaking Awesome. Seriously, freaking awesome. Well done Mr. Ferriss, well done.
141694737X|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter for her stocking. I know she will love it! She is really into the lift-the-flap books
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I did know/ believe I was getting 3 short stories. Fine. What wasn't fine was that the 3rd story really didn't have an ending. It may be my fault- would have to see a paper version to know, probably, but after trying to re-read 2 more time. I'm sure the story was truncated. Too bad as it was the best of the three...I think.
0679809015|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter for her stocking. I know she will love it! She is really into the lift-the-flap books.
B004GYNPL2|3.0|Why is it that the Amazon version is two updates old? Won't load on my CM7 Atrix. Update it please!
0547884591|5.0|As usual for Tim Ferriss, this book is about more than it's about.  Meaning: 4-Hour Work Week was kind of about how to limit the amount of time you spend working, but it's really more about productivity, achievement, efficiency in life and work, and being your own boss.  This book is about food, to be sure, but it's more about learning quickly and effectively.  Highly recommend it to anyone with or without an interest in cooking, for that very reason: but it's also great to have a collection of go-to slow carb recipes as laid out in the book.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I highly recommend it.  And six teen more words that I am required to include in this otherwise brief review.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|I enjoyed this..a bit addictive, but was able to stop. Will definitely come back to play this, since I can play it for a short or longer time and feel like I am not \\"finished\\".
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so fun! Love the similarities to Mario, but with its own twist. Easy to control and fun!
0670022950|5.0|Pinker has made great efforts at researching the available historical data for how people and states have behaved as regards violence. He shows very convincingly that in almost every subset of violence, the frequency is decreasing, sometimes to the effect that they have almost disappeared. As this is contrary to what media are prone to suggest, it is a very reassuring book which I found most uplifting. Let mankind continue in its present path but beware of ruthless potentates acquiring too much power!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This movie is so much fun. It's what every English major who loves Jane Austin wishes he or she could do: Transform into the Victorian Age and live the part, even if it's only temporary.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got the game becase I thought it looked like a fun carnival game and it was! all you do is just throw coins down on this moving platform and presto your playing! recemend for children 10 and up
B00005V1WO|1.0|I should have known that if it was directed by Ken Russel it was going to be too strange for my tastes. He butchered the good name of Mary Shelley and the other characters.  I was sorely disappointed.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love Ken Follet's books. He captures me, and I feel like I am transported to that era in time.  I have read many books romance, espionage, fantasy, and crime stories, but his are different.  They don't fall into any of the typical catergories, and for myself, his books are simply captivating.  I am having a difficult time finding another writer that has the same talent for fictional, historical story writing as he.  I can not remember the title of the book, but it was set around the period of the black plague, and Kingbridge Priory was a part of it.  It was amazing
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Great reading as per the series. Good to get back to Danerys, etc. I'm just anxious for the series' COMPLETION!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The comparisons to ancient Rome become much clearer. I did not expect what happens at the end. The author really ties the books together well.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Go ahead take some time and just escape!  Not your typical vampire story, not your typical love story; this one will stick with you and you will want to watch it again and again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The story gets much more exciting in this book. Some very interesting characters are added in this part of the story.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Enjoyed the movie but I am glad I didn't pay full price to see it in a theater.  The best parts were revealed in the trailers, the characters were not well developed and there was no real climax.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So much better than the movie. The story is explained much better in the book. The characters are much more appealing.
0452295548|5.0|I saw Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor's TED Talk on YouTube (Google it now if you haven't seen it!) and it prompted me to buy this book. I don't remember being so excited by any other book. The author is a Harvard brain scientist, who—through her own stroke at age 37—discovered that living free from your ego is a do-able choice and that our brains are neurologically oriented to experience the world spiritually if we only step out of our own way.
B009K0P10K|5.0|love this show can't wait for the next episode to come out  always something new happening on this show awesome
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my aunt. I received the DVD set ahead of the scheduled date and my aunt enjoyed a marathon of The Walking Dead for her birthday.
B000002BE9|3.0|I had some credit and bought this used. 3 songs I really like and the rest I'd never heard of.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am totally hooked! I cannot wait for the next episode! I love the storyline, the characters! It keeps me on the edge of my seat!
B0099114WO|5.0|In the first 10 minute of the film, you have established character with your two major actors. This is what a movie is supposed to do. It was refreshing to witness actors, director, and screen writer all come together in a professional manner. The only reason I mention this is because too many films out there are having trouble with this. These guys made it look easy.<br /><br />Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) and Kay (Meryl Streep) have been married for 31 years. They are in a routine which most of us call &#34;a rut.&#34; Kay opts to save the marriage, one that Arnold is unaware is in trouble, by going to a marriage counselor played by an unfunny Steven Carrell. Arnold hates the idea, and reluctantly goes with.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the quaint Maine coastal town of Norwalk, Conn. It is a feel good movie that has its ups and downs. The comedy, plot, and drama are light in order to generate a feeling. The film was done extremely well, one that I would say was worthy of Oscar nomination, but not necessarily winning. I will also add, it really wasn't my cup of tea, but I can't fault the film. I had to keep reminding myself Tommy Lee Jones was not named &#34;Kay&#34; in this film as he was in three previous pictures (MIB Agent K).<br /><br />Mimi Rogers, who is mentioned in the credits, is on screen for about 10 seconds near the end.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No nudity or F-bombs. The language is somewhat PG. There are sex scenes, including oral where everyone is fully clothed. The sex talk uses PG type language i.e. &#34;oral sex&#34; as opposed to &#34;BJ.&#34;
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I got back into the Doctor by catching a bit on BBCA and then buying Season 6 on a whim with a gift card from my sister.  Then I had to buy Season 5 to understand Season 6.  The girl who waited and the Last Centurion, wow, and gorgeous River Song.  So of course I had to start at the (new) beginning.  And what do I get? Rose.  As I said, Who wouldn't love the Doctor.
B008PZ69RU|3.0|I imagine this is titled 360 because &#34;Ring&#34; and &#34;It's a Small World&#34; were already taken. 360 involves a number of disjointed stories that have a way of intersecting or not. There are many indie films out there that do this, some work better than others. The ones that work have quirky stories that hold our interest. This one does not. The stories consist of an escort, infidelity, a sex offender, a man looking for his missing daughter, and a Russian. There may be a few more.<br /><br />The Denver airport was filmed in Minnesota, apparently they figured no one travels enough to either place to notice. While the acting wasn't bad, the stories were presented in a mundane fashion. One of the problems with the film is that you know in advance the story will circle back so you spend your time concentrating on how it is going to do that rather than try to take in what is on the screen.<br /><br />If you like intersecting indie films, try Jason Freeland's &#34;Garden Party&#34; a modest production which I enjoyed more than this film.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, and nudity. It had some of each, but really didn't dwell on it.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|See the title.  I am so disappointed.  It was a purchase of used DVDs that were supposed to be in great shape.  Caveat Emptor!  I lost chunks out of the middle of several episodes and I don't know how one ended and another started.  That's why I am returning them.  Is that enough words in the review now?
B009MO5E10|2.0|Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an underachiever bike messenger in NYC. He has issues with his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) who in turn is being evicted by her roommate Nima(Jamie Chung) and she is being hit on by Wilee's work mate Manny (Wol&eacute; Parks).<br /><br />Wilee likes to ride and is reckless. Once we get some quick character introductions, Wilee has to pick up a message from Nima...a premium rush, and deliver it in China Town. There is a policeman (Michael Shannon) with a gambling debt that is attempting to intercept the message.<br /><br />The plot is straight forward with no twists. Most of the film is bike riding. The film starts out as a flashback and then gives us flashbacks within the flashback to explain plot points. I was rather bored with the whole film, but this might have a younger audience appeal.<br /><br />Parental guide: 1 F-bomb (why do they do that?), no sex or nudity.
0689815816|5.0|Book well made and fun to share with my grandson. My son loved this activity when he was small and we shared it with his son using the book and motions remembered.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a must see! The truth that is revealed in this DVD will make you think twice about what you put on your plate.<br />It will leave you speechless....
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is an awesome movie probably 1 of Robert Duvall's best, he's a character I love all his movies. Duvall ought ta go down as 1 of the best actors of all times. I have a lot of his movies and love them all. This movie will keep your attention all the way to the end. I've seen this before but will never get tired of watching it.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Not only is this a great movie, but I am a huge fan of Stephen King.  Also I received my order very quickly.  It amazes me how fast these sellers respond to an order.
B00802JMPO|5.0|Wife loved them and I benefited. Heard about these from her friend and wanted them. Glad I got them. We both loved the results.
1594744475|5.0|I love it and it performs much better than my expection.  We have recommended to friends and family members, it is a good unit and cheaper than local vendors.
0547884591|5.0|This is a book first on learning, second on cooking.<br />Tim brings golden examples of out of the box thinking, and his approach to learning is priceless
0385512104|5.0|This is one of the most creatively written books that I have read in a long time.  It is hard for me to imagine how the author did it.  I can only guess that his personal experiences helped him to be able to write from the main character's view point.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I never got to see the whole movie as it was defective. I returned it and the replacements were also defective. Finally I was told I could not receive another and was issued a refund. This is the 2nd time I have purchased a blu-ray that was defective and finally issued a refund because a good one could not be given to me. the other was Puss-N-Boots. I spent a lot of time waiting for replacements and sending them back and never got to see the movie.
B0000541B2|5.0|This was good for th.e price, with all these fakers out there, I wanted a good one. It does the job
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|I read some of the bad reviews, and I cannot understand how these people did not expect this from Mel Brooks!  All the bad reviews mention older films by Mel Brooks, so they know his humor.  Just look at Blazing Saddles or Robin Hood: Men in Tights.  You know what you are getting into when you turn on a Mel Brooks Movie.  You do not expect great movie making, just some silly stupid humor that gives you a smile.<br /><br />Spaceballs is one of those films that brings me back to my younger days.  It has some really funny moments (the two black storm troopers with the hair pick combing the desert).  When you watch this movie, you cannot take it seriously.  Just go back to when you were a kid and laughed at stupid jokes!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The visuals were great but the story line didn't hold up.  Just get some other science fiction motion picture instead.
B009H442DG|5.0|This CD is exactly what it's supposed to be.  Two old friends got together, using their star power and appeal, grabbed some friends, went into the studio made an album that made all smile, and each sale puts profits into the hands of people who are helping others.<br />This is a must have for any JT or ONJ fan, or any Christmas collection, really.<br />Give this CD this season, and help these artists, help others.
1427208980|5.0|Exciting read. Helped me some correct some issue's at work. Could not wait to hear next chapter and how many things this can be applied to.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Use logic to determine the color of each square. I play almost every day.  New puzzles are added frequently.  The only feature I would add would be thecability to view the completed image without a message displayed.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved it, maybe more than my 6 year old daughter did! Thought the story line was great and loved that she was such a strong female lead.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|First things first, every single one star review for this is people who are complaining that they were \\"duped\\" or \\"scammed\\" because they thought it was the Christopher Nolan movie The Dark Knight Rises. You weren't scammed or duped or bait and switched in any way because A: It's a different name B: had an entirely different cast C: Has a different plot. If you order something without reading the title or description then any mistakes are your own fault.<br /><br />As for an actual review I should preface it by saying The Dark Knight Rises is one of my favorite comics of all time. I was hesitant that it wouldn't be a faithful adaption but it really does do a tremendous job. It captures the tone and feel of the comics exactly. Just because it's animated doesn't mean its for kids. It's pretty bloody and there's lots of violent themes and imagery.  But yeah, I love this and can't wait for part 2 to be released.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|bought it for my<br />son and it loads the beginning but cuts out as the game is to begin. maybe it is great, once you can get it to play.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I had heard of Ed Sheeran and had heard snippets of &#34;The A Team&#34; on the radio, but it wasn't until I found it on a discount PLUS I got the $2 credits from Amazon Student that I figured I'd give it a shot, half expecting it to be a little overrated...except it EXCEEDED my expectations. Each song is a lot more memorable than I expected them to be (&#34;Wake Me Up&#34; is one of my favorites of the album, a love song that feels fresh and sincere), and Sheeran clearly has quite a range and a hell of a lot of talent. Definitely one of my best decisions.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|it's confusing to use. one time it's got a zoom,next time it doesn't. pic quality is just ok too. You getwhat yoj pay for....
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like playing this although the new update makes it harder to get prizes. It's free so go ahead and download it. Only downside is the coin regeneration time is longer than what I would like but you can win prizes or level up to make it faster.
1469984202|4.0|A great story, kept me up all night. No need to add details of the plot; a good one. Like a Heinlein story I read years ago, people on a long-flight manmade asteriod, living in the interior, after several generations forgot why they were there, where they were going and who they were --- sent to colonize a distant planet many light-years away. Wool works on the same pinciple. A tightly contained society turned inward and ignorant of their past.<br /><br />One might call this an 'awakening' plot, as in the moment when a young person first asks the great questions, who am I? Where am I going? Why am I here? Always rivetting.<br /><br />This story depends on people inside the silo being taught never to say certain words like 'out'', never to ask about the outside world, society divided into classes and kept there, and that doesn't quite work.<br /><br />It could only work with high saturation of propaganda, and there was no evidence of this. The world of the silo somewhat resembles the East Bloc countries under socialism --- never ask what is beyond the borders or try to get there, obey your masters, but in the East Bloc and the USSR  this was reinforced by threat of serious bodily harm and incessant propaganda, like 24/7 about the glorious worker's state and the villainous capitalists and even then it only lasted about 70 years. But apparently the world of the silos has been going on for several hundred years. Without media propaganda saturation it could not have gone on that long, not possible. Human curiosity and mischief and energy and and contrariness can't be suppressed forever and sometimes not even for very long.<br /><br />Somebody or some group would have figured out how to construct good hazmat suits, over that amount of time, and would have gone out to explore the old toxic world. Human nature. Wool doesn't depict any propaganda at all and only once a year or so is some dissident chucked out of the airlock, gag, stagger, done for.<br /><br />It worked in Heinlein's story because they were in outer space, not on a toxic earth.<br /><br />He tries to depict Lukas' internal resistance to the idea that the people in the silo had a past, to think of going out, that they are on a thing called Earth, but it's not convincing and Lukas is so weak and wimpish I found him very dismissable. He doesn't seem to be able to think of much of anything at all. No passion, no energy, pages of serious get-down dithering. Also the villains don't seem all that in control. Confusing.<br /><br />Other chracters are wonderful. Juliette, Walker, Holston, all extremely well-done. We like them and live through them. Juliette's descent underwater to repair pumps in a jerry-rigged diver's suit is splendid.<br /><br />But again; this government/society in the silo shows no sign of squelching what is called the intermediary organizations which normally pop up in societies, voluntarily associated groups like choirs and chess clubs, ladies who take food to the bereaved, exercise clubs, youth groups, book clubs and so on. Again, human nature. But in the silo they are not forbidden and yet they don't exist, either. Since this little world has no TV you'd think people would play cards, have dance groups or something. Nope. Outlawing all non-government citizen groups was one way the USSR etc. retained control of people but there is no sign of their being forbidden in Wool.<br /><br />However I understand this is fiction. It's good. It wants to be a philosophical novel in the worst way but does not hammer the reader with acres of gray Dostoyevskian print wherein chracters argue political philosophy. At the end one character says something on the order of 'What if we had a society where people were empowered instead of manipulated?' But there is not much sign of the manipulation, certainly not the incessant propaganda it would actually take to keep a population all in their proper classes and incurious about the outside. To do that takes a lot of agitprop firepower plus TV.<br /><br />And empowering people still means a top-dog upper class handing out a permission slip, which is not empowering in the least. It's like saying 'Let's give people souls'. Souls are not ours to give.<br /><br />But, that said and however. It's a good novel, great opening, and I look forward to a sequel where they all bravely put on good hazmat suits and explore our long-forgotten abused earth. Adventures await.
B007MG360G|4.0|I like all of the doodle games! This one is better for kids and easier than Doodle God and Doodle Devil. It is also less risqué than the other two. There are less combinations but that's what makes it easier I guess.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Well the movie itself was hilarious because of how bad the plot and graphics were. Even though it wasn't really supposed to be funny but it was still good for a laugh. I absolutely love the Amazon customer service though. The playback when I was watching it was really bad where I pretty much couldn't see some of what was going on when anything fast happened. I'm pretty layed back though and I only payed about $4 to rent it, so I didn't really even think about complaining. However I guess that someone at Amazon was monitoring how it was playing and the next day I received an email apologizing for the quality and saying that they were refunding my money.
B0085MNZ66|3.0|I didn't really like this game because it was like &#34;Flow&#34; with color combining but if just felt.... messy. It also got a bit complicated soon after the game began.
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer went back to the roots of his essence as a musician and came up with the best CSN (Crosby, Stills, & Nash) since.... well \\"CSN\\" in 1977... I can't write one of those mega long reviews.. so I'm gonna say this.. I borrowed this cd from our local library and listened to it 20 times in the past two weeks.... Now I must return the borrowed copy... and I 've already placed a new copy of \\"Born and Raised\\" in my cart from amazon tonight to buy on my next order.....If you like John Mayer and can imagine 'CSN&M' instead of 'CSN&Y'... then this one is for you...rich harmonies, gentle guitar work, harmonica layering, solid lyrics, and some short tight poignant ditties like \\"Love Is a Verb\\" (CSN> \\"Just a Song Before I Go\\") \\"If I Ever Get Around to Living\\" (CSN> \\"Fair Game\\")\\"Something Like Olivia\\" (hear that Jen?) , \\"Shadow Days\\" (CSN> Shadow Captain?\\")and \\"Born and Raised\\" (CSN> \\"See the Changes\\")<br /><br />Each track gets stronger and stronger as the cd plays on (repeat)....<br /><br />To John... see if ya can get Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (on harmonica NOT vocals!)to encore your next concert or cd release... A+ Excellent!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this story because the characters kept my interest.<br />Good read ! I liked how the secondary characters supported the main character.
B0049J3RBC|5.0|We had a great time watching this movie. We even made the dish. Delicious! the HD was clear and beautiful.
141982869X|5.0|My mom LOVED it.  They got it in a timely manner, great condition.  Can't begin to tell you how many times they've watched it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Watched it over and over again on my Amazon Video rental that I bought the DVD. How's that for Brave?!
B00493E1GI|3.0|I watched this movie and came away thinking &#34;I'm not sure I got the entire message&#34;.  It just seemed to run on.  I guess the underlying message was that we do our own self-exploration and find what makes us happy and gets us in touch with our spiritual side.  I like Julia Roberts, but this was not one of her better performances.  I must say that I have not read the book.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I have been a huge Batman fan since I was a kid. From the comics, to the movies, to the cartoons and the games, but I absolutely loved this series the most. This series really hit the darker side of Batman and gave it a little more of a realistic touch. Batman The Dark Knight Rises, in my opinion, made Bane one of the scariest, most intense villains in any super hero movie I've seen in 2012. I think this movie did a great job ending this specific series, and even still it left me wanting more, but I was very satisfied with the ending. It was intense, fun, and even amusing at times. All around I think its a great movie, a great series and for me it was a definite buy! Hope everyone else can enjoy this movie/series as much as I did.
B00881PPTO|1.0|The following is my opinion.  I believe they only search sites they make money from not really for the cheapest fares, at least that is what my search results lead me to believe.  No Southwest, or Allegiant Airlines search options.  I searched with this app for a flight I was considering taking &amp; had already searched for a deal.  The cheapest I found was Allegiant Air $113.60 roundtrip.  Kayak app showed cheapest at Delta Airlines $444.00 with same dates depart/arrive, but not times.  The Allegiant flights averaged around 4 hours flight time R/T as they were direct, while the Delta flights were approximately 9 hours which included substantial layovers in relation to actual flight time.  This could end up being one of the most expensive free apps of the day ever!  I can't believe they have the nerve to charge for it at all.  I would give it negative 5 stars if possible.  I am also appalled at their slogan, it seems a bad joke to me.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The beginning of a wonderful series. While this is my least favorite of the three books, it's a very good book, and I recommend it, highly.
8866130907|5.0|This one is perfect, small enough for carrying around but big enough to include all the details you would need.  I prefer the Hard Cover pocket to the small as I like to put other things in the sleeve.  The soft worked well for this but I just liked the hard cover better for getting to what I needed quickly.  I hope to use these for a long time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put these books down. I killed the whole series in under 2 days.<br />Better than Twilight and super epic. Adult or kid, you'll love these books.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|He loves it so much in fact that this is our second copy. He got his hands on the first one a few times and scratched it up to the point of skipping in our DVD player, so this is our sencond copy. The movie itself is great and the message it conveys is a great one. Of course what would we expect from a story written by Dr Seus?<br /><br />Shipping was fast, item was packaged appropriately, and the copy we recieved was in retail packaging.<br /><br />If you have children, yound and old alike, pick up this movie! It is appropriate for all ages and even I like to sit and watch it with my 2 y/o son.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great ending to a great trilogy. I didn't even want to read these books at first, but I got totally sucked in!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Can not wait for more albums. I want to see them in concert,They are great together and make music without the use of instruments.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put these books down. I killed the whole series in under 2 days.<br />Better than Twilight and super epic. Adult or kid, you'll love these books.
B005LAII8A|4.0|\\"Looper\\" is a sci-fi actioner about a young man who is a looper, or basically, a hit man of the future. He closes loops, or the lives of people sent to him to be killed by him. But the film takes a dramatic turn when he is called upon to close his own \\"loop.\\" The movie pays homage to great science fiction films that came before it, like \\"Blade Runner.\\" The acting is solid, and the cast assembled here is excellent. Rian Johnson, the writer/director, also made a great noir movie called \\"Brick,\\" which I also reviewed on Amazon. If you like action films, science-fiction films, or movies that will get you talking afterward and asking what the heck just happened, Looper is a movie you won't want to miss. It's worth the time invested. However, it's a struggle to truly understand and keep up with everything that is happening, which will no doubt turn some people off.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|This book is a classic. It's everything you want in a story, and more.<br />Great for kids or adults of any age.
B009ERK1T0|4.0|\\"Koi No Yokan\\" is another home run from the most underrated American rock band in the last 20 years. The Deftones continue to put out great music, year after year, record after record. This album is experimental in sound, mixing harder rock sounds with the dream pop melodies that Chino Moreno seems to love to embrace. If you're fan of the Deftones, you won't be disappointed with this album. There are songs that will remind you of earlier work on \\"Adrenaline,\\" \\"White Pony,\\" and \\"Diamond Eyes.\\" It's wonderful to see the Deftones moving ever-forward with each album they create. While I don't find the album as commercially accessible as \\"White Pony,\\" I believe this album will win over some new fans, satisfy old fans, and keep the Deftones in the public eye until their next record comes out. And if this is the last Deftones album, I'm happy to say my favorite band of all-time has gone out swinging.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|This book is a classic. It's everything you want in a story, and more.<br />Great for kids or adults of any age.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We have become totally addicted to this series and had to get caught up for this season. Downloading from Amazon was instant gratification!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put these books down. I killed the whole series in under 2 days.<br />Better than Twilight and super epic. Adult or kid, you'll love these books.
145210655X|5.0|Arrived quickly and is super cute! Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift from our 10 month old son.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I really enjoyed these books, even though I spent a lot of time not wanting to read them. This book, Book 2, is my favorite of the trilogy.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|She is a super star, her voice is angelic...I am enjoying the CD makes a great gift for Christmas, fabulous!
B0049VZ222|5.0|I had missed the entire first season of The Walking Dead, and couldn't find it anywhere.<br />I was super excited to catch up on everything. ^_^
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Age range: 6 and up :) plot line was a little complicated and violent for me 4 year old but of course they can't make all movies a like.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not even done with this book yet, and I can tell you that for any gamer, or 80s lover, this is worth the read.<br />The writing is dynamic and interesting and there's a twist at the end of every tunnel.<br />So love.
B009AZZEU2|3.0|Not a 5 star album, and light years away from a 1 star. If you gave this album a single star I encourage you to take your copy back and get one that has Non State Actor, By Crooked Steps, Blood on the Valley Floor, and Attrition.<br />I'll forgo the song by song analysis, but suffice to say the first 7 songs are right in their wheel house. I find Rowing to be eerily amazing, even though it is not a typical song from SG. The rest of the songs are less Soundgarden than they are a band that sounds like Soundgarden.<br />I wasn't sure what to expect and am a little let down that the album as a whole is not as dark and heavy as they made it out to be in interviews.<br />It is very nice to hear a group of professionals back at it. They remain leagues ahead of bands out today in terms of chemistry and talent.<br />Who would have thought Cornell's voice would hold up after all these years? Kim and Matt are in true form and it sounds like Ben has spent the last 16 years locked in his studio practicing for the reunion.
B001G8NW6Y|5.0|This book rules.  I love the author and the simple lessons its teaches.  I bought this book brand new for my collection, and everyone should have it!!!
B005IQZB14|2.0|The story dealt  way too much on her personal past problems  I would have liked more story on her surroundings as she traveled the PCT.  She had lots of guts but lacked greatly in practical research and planning.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Loved the book...grabs you from the start and brings you inside the mind and life of a Navy Seal.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a sense of bravery and adventure!
B005CWRB44|4.0|My only issue with this light is that if they'd threaded a few more mm of the assembly it would be easier to screw into a decidedly 'off' position without the risk of uncoupling the assembly. Other than that, this is a great little unit.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This movie has intense violence as well as tender romance and breathtaking scenery.  Great chemistry between Daniel Day-Lewis (Hawkeye) and Madeleine Stowe (Cora).  Great cast.  If you've never seen this 1992 film, you will find yourself caught up in this &#34;edge of your seat&#34; story and rooting for the heroes to survive another day.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm not sure if its the new characters and powers these birds have, but this is a very entertaining game.
0425263908|5.0|I enjoyed this story from the second I started reading it, I can't wait for the 2nd one to follow.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are really fun but they cost a lot of coins which I don't really like. other then that its really awesome
034580404X|5.0|this is one of the first books I had read in a few years. Once i started reading it I couldn't put it down. I read all three books in nine days. I got hooked.
0547884591|4.0|I've been searching wide for books on learning/meta learning for ages. So far I've found no real amazing ones.<br />I thought Wyatt Woodsmall's Future of Learning would be great but it spent more time complaining about the educational system than it did on how to actually learn<br /><br />This book, however, spends more time giving you actionable steps, specific things to take away and step by step instructions for many things.<br /><br />So far I'm learning Spanish faster than I thought I'd be - with Michel Thomas' method (recommended in the book).<br /><br />Because I'm a super nerd geek, I wanted to hear more about Selection, Compression and Encoding at a higher level - specifically because I want to apply it to learning higher level jazz, but from the information I have so far, it seems I'll be able to transfer a lot of it over to learning music, starting a business and some of the other things I really want to do.<br /><br />I think I wanted more detail on Meta-learning from this book - but I'm sure that'll come in his blog. I'm sure it's a uber huge topic and Ferriss can't possibly cater for every single scenario.<br /><br />Even though I wanted more, no other book I've seen offers anything as clear cut as this. The DiSSS CaFE method is a great framework to run anything through. The only challenge I'm having is learning how to contact high-level experts specifically for the Deconstruction and Selection steps.<br /><br />I am finding it challenging applying it to music however - as 99% of all music teachers and experts I find take the 'results by volume' approach, and it's been really hard tracking down people who break it down to smaller chunks - but I'm sure there are plenty.<br /><br />To be honest, I really don't think this book is about 'hacking' learning. Tim Ferriss was never about 'shortcutting' anything<br />This book is about 'stopping learning the wrong way'.<br />For example - if it's possible to learn something in 3 months but the 'average' is 3 years, it doesn't mean the person who learned in 3 months 'hacked' anything. It just means that the person who took 3 years decided to do everything the long way.<br /><br />For haters of the 80/20 analysis all I can say is this - the 20% that is 'important' now will be different to the 20% that is 'important' in 3 months time.  You don't 'skip' things with Tim Ferriss' method. You just bypass the stuff you don't need to know at the beginning, and then later down the track you pick it back up when it actually becomes important to your development.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a fun, cute movie that parents and children can enjoy.  I think my husband likes it more than my girls!  There isn't adult humor, or swearing.  Just plain good entertainment.
B0000046KM|5.0|Wonderful musical selections with a fabulous singer!  Best of all is 'Here's To Life' with it's great philosophical lyrics, but every piece on this CD is a winner!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Spirit Filled Life Bible in the regular hard-copy edition, but now I can take this same Bible in the digital version wherever I happen to be.  It includes so many resources and study aids that I can't list them all here.
1423140605|5.0|This book was amazing! I really enjoyed reading it, I whipped through it in less than four days. :) I loved the cliffhanger (literally) ending. ;) I can't wait for the next one! Keep it up Rick Riordan!
B009SQRC9E|5.0|It's cute, but not cute enough for me to want to watch every day. However my two children under 9 would love to watch it everyday all day now that it's Christmas time.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|This is one of the best animated movies out there. The only one I would consider better is &#34;How to train your Dragon&#34;
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is not exactly what I was looking for but I'm glad I took a chance and read it. It was very good.
B008KE3960|5.0|I was looking for a air attack game for my Kindle Fire and it does not seem like there are many good ones out there.  I like this one because of the different levels of plays.  It also has a lot of different equipment to choose from.  Does not require a lot of skill to get started.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this series! I enjoyed the books and I feel like the show was very well done.  I didn't feel like the changes that were made impacted the story too much and most of the characters fit with the images I conjoured up of the characters when I read the books.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Again, I love The Vampire Diaries!! I can't wait to finish this season, and hopefully will get one or more of the other seasons for Christmas! :)) Very Satisfied!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|For angry birds fans this is a must have.  It has great visuals, challenging levels, and very interesting birds.  It's not free, but well worth the money.
1476712042|5.0|I have yet to read this book, wanting to finish the 3rd Fifty Shades of Grey first..I've had other obligations, and I didn't want the Fifty Shades to end! But heard this was the book to read after finishing Fifty Shades! I can't wait!! :)<br /><br />Thanks!
B00448SE4S|5.0|This movie was highly underrated in the theaters and did not get the publicity I think it deserved.  At its core, it is a romantic love story.  At face value, it is a collision of pop culture, video games, film, comic books, anime, and action martial arts films.  Edgar Wright did a wonderful job, in my opinion, of capturing the comic book it is derived from, and his direction makes for a very fun action packed heartfelt film.  Highly recommend the BluRay version as some of the action sequences only look better in hi-def.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love The Vampire Diaries!!! I just purchased the second season, and will buy the other's from Amazon also!!! Exactly as I expected..Awesome! A great purchase, for a great price! Amazon never seizes to amaze me. If I can't find it anywhere else, Amazon always seems to have it! :)<br /><br />Thanks again!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book for a kid that needs a cheering up. This is one of my favorite books of diary of a wimpy kid
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is fun my kids really like playing it. Its neat to figure out different ways to get the candy in his mouth.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Can't stop listening. Great album! I love this girl. Looking forward to seeing her perform live again. It's been way too long.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a side of J.K. that was not seen in any of the Harry Potter books. If you are expecting wizards and trolls, or charms and curses, this is NOT the book for you. If you can manage to get past the first half (which starts off very slow), where the whole gang of characters and their relationships are introduced in minute detail, then you are in for a wild ride. Some of the darkest, cruelest, and most vulnerable sides of all people are put into full spotlight in this scandalous book. Page by page I found myself not only questioning the characters, but myself and my beliefs as well. What is done in the dark literally comes into the light throughout the story. And, if you give it even half the chance (and manage to cast anything to do with Harry Potter completeley out of your mind) then you will enjoy this as much as I did.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|I choose this album because I wanted some upbeat music to work by.  I feel Taylor Swift has a wonderful way of entertaining, without screaming her lyrics at you.  VERY ENJOYABLE! PAMELA
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it
B000002GI0|5.0|I am always amazed at John Hiatt's ability to surround himself with the best musicians who are totally appropriate for his projects.  Sonny Landreth plays the most appropriate backing, whether it is down-and-dirty slide on DRIVE SOUTH or the heavenly lilting of FEELS LIKE RAIN.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|interesting and entertaining<br />game for all ages. I am having fun playing it. you should try it. beware though it is addictive.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love love love this book and would def recommend it to everyone I know!! Thank you Suzanne Collins :) Well Done!!!
B0036OS3EW|3.0|I like the light weight boot. But the inside was not a cushy as crocs other shoes. I found the arch hard and knew I would not last long in them. They where not as easy to slip on or off with the scrunchy top. They are what was described i guess just not what I expected. I'll try something else. I do like crocs  as a rule for summer wear. Relaxed fit usually fits perfect.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love it ;-) No wonder the President loves it too!!! It reminds me of the show 24 which I loved also ;-)
B007HGPBRC|5.0|An excellent book about the feelings one has about dying young.<br />However, I gave it to a friend to read and she found it depressing,
B001CQONKY|5.0|My children and I like the methods used in sloving a crime. The actors are top notch and come across as actual law enforcement and not just actors playing a part. This goes for all of the CSI Las Vegas series,
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was told that even though it was a boring book  the ending was so fantastic and so unexpected that it was worth the read.<br />They lied. It  is a book that is badly written; the ending  is not exceptional and is not really surprising and certainly was not worth the cost of the Kindle edition.<br /><br />I would suggest you settle in with a copy of Ken Follett's  Fall of Giants.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|excellent novel and acting. Great movie from one of Ayn Rand&#34;s books. Atlas Shrugged 1 is another one of her novels brought to the screen
B008GXHOFW|1.0|after the intro it closes!! does not work!!! please make an update to fix this game. we like spiderman and would love to play this game!
1449410243|5.0|I'm a big fan of the oatmeal, I really enjoyed this book. The comics are hilarious beyond reason. It was a bit shorter than I had expected, but for less than 10 bucks you shouldn't be expecting war and peace.<br /><br />If you're unsure you would like this book check out his website (theoatmeal.com) and read a few comics. If you like the site, buy the book. While you'll find a fair amount of the material in this book online, there is a bunch of new/unreleased stuff in the book. Totally worth it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so happy to see this app available for Android and have not been disappointed!  When I don't have a wi-fi connection I can surf on my smartphone.  No problems on my Kindle Fire or Motorola Droid X.  Super fast and no problems uploading pins.
B004SDEP38|3.0|A very practical tool to keep and transfer documents other than your PC.  Pretty simple to use and easy to understand
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I LOVE this album. The best tracks are Just A Fool (Xtina & Blake's voices blend beautifully together), Sing for Me, Best of me, & Army of me. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes music that's fun, inspirational, and sexy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS SOO AWESOME!!!!! 0.5.0 is amazing and it runs very fast and smooth. Thanks Amazon for finally realizing that we NEED minecraft on here.  BUY IT NOW!!
0205313426|5.0|It's very handy tiny book for everybody who writes an academic paper, essay, thesis or graduation document. It also helps even if your goal is to learn how to write emails and business letters. Very useful book!
B008QE9XD2|2.0|Like a few others, I feel misled by the trailers -- I thought this was going to be a creepy but funny movie, maybe along the thread of Edward Scissorhands. I know nothing of the original TV series, so I have nothing to compare it to and really had no expectations other than that I wanted to enjoy the movie. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in some time -- we gave it over an hour and could not stand to watch any more of it. It's spooky, but too dull to make it thrilling, and the humor was nothing but a few poor attempts to get a chuckle from the audience. Depp is usually able to disappear into a role, but here I felt like he was just playing dress-up as a vampire. The Depp-Burton combo failed on this one.
B008EDGBW6|1.0|Oh, don't wake me up up up up up up, don't wake me up up up up up up. Don't wake my up up up up up up, don't wake me up up up up up up up up up up up up up up u pu pu pu pu pu pu u puuuuuuuuuuup. About as repetitive and auto-tuned as is gets. Can't stand it anymore.
1451648537|3.0|bought this for my husband and he said it was interesting, somehow I could never get in to it, you know?
0547884591|5.0|I haven't gotten through too much of it yet, but this book is simply breathtaking to flip through. The 600+ pages of full color are absolutely beautiful, and they are loaded with not just useful cooking tips, but with great content to help you learn anything. Another awesome book from Tim.
B0027BVMSY|4.0|Lots of action. All of the stuff us Bond fans have come to expect. I have watched it 3 times and its still engaging.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Wanted to add this to my collection of movies to be viewed often.  Do cavalry reenactments and liked the way this film was done.
031262820X|3.0|I hadn't read any Madeleine Wickham books until recently, when I read [[ASIN:B004GKMUU8 Cocktails For Three]] and really enjoyed it (more than the Sophie Kinsella books, the author's pen name, which I occasionally delve into for an escapist release.) I didn't enjoy The Wedding Girl quite as much, although it's very readable. I found the lead character Milly a bit annoying, and a lot of the plot relies on misunderstandings and missed timing that is a bit cheap and sitcommish. The general theme is secrets, and a secret Milly has that threatens her upcoming marriage. In the process of revealing this, we are introduced to several periphery characters that make the book feel a bit scattered. One in particular, an old friend struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality, adds depth to this book, but also feels short-shrifted - his story could easily have been the co-center of this novel, and was the only part of the book that felt interesting to me actually. Alas, he only gets a chapter or so to himself, and so his complexity is resolved rather quickly.<br /><br />So overall, very readable, I wasn't bored, but just a bit scattered in some ways and predictable in others.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Saw my sister playing this and got hooked, it's something to do, creative, fun and it passes the time!<br /><br />Q
B007JCP8FE|5.0|If you like Shinedown this is a must have.  If you have never listened to them, this is the album to get acquainted with.  My two favorites are &#34;Unity&#34; and &#34;Miracle&#34; but there are others that are very good.  The album exceeded my expectations.
B000V6I7WG|3.0|This is a fantastic movie, one of my favorites.  That being said, I hate this blu-ray.  Save your money.  Buy the Tartan DVD.  I've read that this was an intentionally bad transfer.  I hope so, otherwise this is inexcusable.  Grainy and flat, there is really no difference in picture quality from the DVD.  Not much of an audiophile, so I can't speak to the sound quality.  Again, I hear this was what the director wanted with this picture, but if I'd realized this ahead of time, I would have just bought the original DVD and not have wasted money on the blu-ray edition.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Movie came in clear, story was great - never had any download problems or viewing delays.  Love the whole series; ready to watch more movies through Amazon.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Terrific app, always works (on my Galaxy 3s and Kindle Fire); very accurate and relevant. Best little dictionary you could want.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Jeri level would not open followed instruction to uninstall then reinstall and that did not work. Went to repurchase and it says I already purchased.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is an excellent primer (or review) of the history of Lucretius, the classic Epicurean, and the impact of his writings on the development of our own western history and culture, when his famous manuscript was rediscovered during the early Renaissance. f If you love history and appreciate Latin and the Roman society, you will love this short, easily readable book, which is annotated and attributed in a rigorous, scholarly fashion.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I don't care what any critic says, this is a great album.  Very pretty & poppy.  There is not a track that I do not enjoy!  Highly recommend!
030758836X|5.0|Wait.  WHAT?! It's that good.  Buy this book immediately.  You will reccomend it I promise!  Keep an open mind...you never know!
B008J34466|5.0|I really like this album!  Glad I don't have kids because there are some explicit lyrics that could be troublesome for little ears.  Great message.  Very poppy!  Gets me hyped up for sure!  Highly recommend!
B001XCWPAM|5.0|great, love it, can't wait until i get the fourth installment the bourne legacy with jeremy renner, hope its just as great
B0002F6BRE|4.0|You've read the other reviews, summarizing the plotline, so here goes once more:  Buddy, an orphaned human baby raised by elves at the North Pole, grows into guileless, maniacally cheerful adulthood and jaunts off to New York City to find his birth father, who is decidedly \\"on the naughty list,\\" and needs someone like Buddy and a Christmas crisis to save his greed-smudged soul.  All right then.  Sounds silly, trite, implausible even for a Christmas tale, yes?  It is, and joyfully so.  Like flying reindeer, smirky references to poor-quality stop-action animation Christmas specials from the '60's and '70's, and seas of swirly-twirly gumdrops, it shouldn't work, but it does.<br /><br />  As someone who never thought I'd be in a position to write a kind word about vulgar Saturday Night Live alum Will Ferrell's body of work-- not my sort of humor--it's hard to make my fingers type these words, but the man is absolutely hilarious, an outsized sprite bounding around in his tunic and tights, earnest and callow and unabashedly affectionate toward all living things, even his unlovable father.  The movie, full of unapologetic \\"magical moments\\" as Buddy wins friends everywhere, creates a winter wonderland in a department store in honor of \\"Santa's\\" visit, coaxes a disgruntled-but-pretty sales clerk out of her shell and into his first-ever kiss, and makes warm, syrupy inroads into his father's cold heart, is sweet-spirited and genuinely funny...and innocent enough that you can let the kids watch it.  It might even awaken in its viewers an affinity for elf culture. Gather the family, cram as much candy into your mouths as you can, and enjoy.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie is great and wanted it ever since i got a blu ray player, the service was very fast.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|First of all this is a great series its jaw breaking scenes and is one of my favorite series i liked how the head is it was a little smaller than what i suspected but I'm still satisfied
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This movie was an interesting look in the minds of two children who have their own inner struggles they must overcome. It's cute.
0547884591|5.0|First off, this thing is huge. And colorful. And just an amazingly put together tome.<br /><br />I've had a chance to dig into the book some, and the intro discusses a couple techniques Tim uses to break things down and learn the most important aspects that can be picked up the easiest. This technique applies equally to languages and cooking. For example, if you only use 1,000 words on average throughout the day in casual conversation, wouldn't it be easier to learn those 1,000 words instead of trying to memorize every verb, noun, and adjective? How about which spices and ingredients are the most important to the majority of dishes?<br /><br />Tim builds a framework with which he suggests for everyone when learning a new skill or language, and he encourages people to be more critical and active in deciding, learning, and experimenting with what works and what doesn't (this is something he espoused in 4HB too).<br /><br />Ultimately, people are going to throw stones at Tim because they have some sort of beef with him, but honestly, this is easily one of the top 5 most beautiful books I or my wife own (and trust me... we love books and have a few too many of them) and I know that it will be the one I learn the most about learning and picking up skills.<br /><br />Oh, and the recipes? Tim does an excellent job with recipes woven into the entire book along with all the stories, lessons, and breakdowns of techniques and skills.<br /><br />Bravo, Tim, bravo. You really outdid yourself on this one. It won't take me long to devour the rest of this book along with all the delicious meals I'll be cracking out! My wife will probably be sending you a Thank You card in the next couple weeks or so.<br /><br />(Note: If you have any specific questions or comments regarding my review, please be civil, and I will be more than happy to answer any rational, well-thought-out questions. Thanks!)
B0098460O4|2.0|I was so excited about the new album but when I got it I was disappointed. Johnathan & Charlotte both have fantastic voices, but the quality of the transfer to the CD was very poor. I hope in the future, they get a chance to work with a real record company that will do them justice.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I could watch it 50 more times and it would not cease to be a great heartfelt story. Now i have it ready to go anywhere.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a family-friendly movie and a tradition of ours during the holidays.  The acting is classic (but clean) Will Ferrell and anyone who watched Rankin Bass productions as a kid will appreciate the throwback North Pole.
B0045XICB2|4.0|Good Quality picture and sound. This movie really helps you to catch up on what happened in previous Twilight movies and prepares you for the latest sequel.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This movie should be mandatory for school children to see. What a learning experience in how to eat right and take care of your health.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The actress who played the queen made this film well worth the the rental fee. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't as exciting as I had anticipated.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one my favorites, so I have nothing bad to say! Silly and fun like the other National Lampoons movies.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I love this series and enjoy having the series to view additional times. I have all the episodes. I really enjoy these actors.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really liked this book. It was definitely a book that needed to be written for everything to come together in the end, so it's not as exciting as the first and last, but it definitely has its own action. It also really helps define Peeta and Katniss' relationship, or at least for Katniss in my opinion.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I have only viewed some of the episodes from the Seventh Season. I love the actors and really enjoy the show. I enjoy being able to view these at any time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book after having seen the movie and it still kept me on my toes. I like the book because it goes into more detail about Katniss' personality and her relationships with the characters of the book.
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|I expected more from this movie. Robert Downey is an excellent actor. Howeve there was just something about this movie I didn't care for.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I felt so attached to the characters by the end of it that I felt heartbroken, but I believe that it ended perfectly. The ending is a little sad however and not the happily ever after that some people might have been hoping for. I also like that it answers enough of your questions, but still leaves you wondering.
B00881PPTO|5.0|it should say ad free that's the only difference between this app and the free vision. other than that I love this app it helps me a lot when I travel.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very challenging. A lot of fun. Actually can become quite addictive. Once you start playing with three suits it gets very hard and a mind exercise.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I ordered the mp3 album, but it downloaded only one song.  Not sure how to have this corrected. There doesn't seem to be anywhere to find someone to contact.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/27/2012:  I am happy to say that Amazon contacted me very quickly and I was able to resolve the issue.  Now onto my thoughts of the album....  I really liked it.  I like his sound a lot.  I think he has a little room for improvement, though.  His songs sounded a lot alike to me, but that doesn't deter me from  liking his music.  I suspect he will only get better; I think he has a lot of versatility to explore.  Overall, I feel good about my purchase.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Watched it for a class assignment. Great story with interesting twists and loved the plot.I would highly recommend others to view this movie.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|I have enjoyed all the books, (I haven't read book #5 yet), and I have watched about 5 of the shows so far.  It seems to me they leave quite a bit out, but that's going to be true, no matter what.  I appreciate the gritty feel of G.R.R. Martin's world as interpreted for the small screen, and love the music.  I also enjoy watching the actors in this - some who have been in the business for quite a while and some who are just starting out.  Overall, very good series.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|This series is an excellent zombie apocalypse story. Like most modern dramas on tv though it suffers from creating suspense at the expense if great storytelling, though not quite as much as most of what is on tv.<br /><br />The characters are unique and not all o them fit the stereotypes you normally find in these. This is a good but fr someone who has not already seen the series.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|'Downton Abbey' (2010-present) is the outstanding period drama and British-American production created by Julian Fellowes.<br /><br />Unlike AMC's 'Mad Men,' which also took America by storm a little at a time, and also largely by word of mouth, 'Downton Abbey,' which considers Edwardian England, the Great War, and its aftermath, was predominantly created by native British citizens, and carefully analyzes the period it covers without wholly trashing it, as 'Mad Men' subtly and unsubtly does 1960s America on an episode-by-episode basis.<br /><br />In an era of exploitive programs like 'American Horror Story,' which is as extreme as anything ever produced for television, and which regularly traffics in horrific amputations, sadomasochism, genetic deformity, and torture, it is wonderful to discover a series like 'Downton Abbey,' which proves, among other points, that adults everywhere are absolutely starved for intelligent, ethical, and mature dramatic fare, such as was regularly produced in decades past on both sides of the Atlantic, especially in film.<br /><br />Opening in 1912, 'Downton Abbey' is the story of the aristocratic and genuinely noble Crawley family, who live in contented luxury at Downton Abbey, their immense Yorkshire estate, and of the lives of their multitude of servants, who the Crawleys treat with humanity, decency, and respect.<br /><br />Their fairly idyllic lifestyle is rattled by the loss of the family heirs on the Titanic, and then the coming of the Great War, which turns Britain and its social traditions upside down in a thousand painful ways.<br /><br />What makes 'Downton Abbey' almost radical in this age is that it refuses to denigrate the Edwardian aristocracy it examines. While both Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Maggie Smith) and American-born Lady Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern) are initially shown to be somewhat priggish and short-sighted, one of the themes of the program is the dual nature of most men.<br /><br />Thus, homosexual footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) is, along with lady's maid Miss O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran), initially something of a villain, but as the series progresses, even sociopathic Thomas is shown to have, or to develop, a good side.<br /><br />Likewise, overlooked middle sister Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) foolishly betrays her elder sister, Mary (Michelle Dockery), but this action is shown to be a lapse, if still a serious one, in an otherwise good personal character.<br /><br />As a whole, 'Downton Abbey' believes in the predominantly ethical and decent nature of man. As such, it depicts both the aristocrat and the 'common' working man, such as Christ figure and valet John Bates (Brendon Coyle, whose performance dominates the first season), as capable of integrity, empathy, courage, nobility of purpose, and basic human goodness in all its forms.<br /><br />It is this vision of mankind that gives 'Downton Abbey' its power.<br /><br />Though the series has the occasional weak treatment of a plot thread--such as dignified butler Carson (Jim Carter) being revealed to have once been a vaudeville performer or the rather unconvincing return of an heir thought dead, 'Downton Abbey' usually steers clear, not of soap opera cliches unfortunately, but of the standard melodramatic treatment of them when they do appear.<br /><br />For 'Downton Abbey' to continue to thrive creatively, however, the writing has to remain focused primarily on the historical period, and continue to provide viewers with 'a window into the past' instead of becoming bogged down too heavily in the lives of the characters themselves. By Season Three, for example, the lame and long-suffering Bates has been put through so many sensational reversals of fortune that such events no longer seem very credible, and audience sympathy for the character wanes considerably.<br /><br />In Season One, the various characters appeared largely to represent objective principles as much as they were presented as three-dimensional human beings; in the opening episodes of Season Three, however, the same characters are instead depicted strictly in human terms, and the writing is far more self-conscious in every respect. Thankfully, by the fifth episode and following, the writing is the best it has been since the first season.<br /><br />'Downton Abbey,' in its worldwide success, should not be playing to its audience, but going its own way and forcing the viewer to make all the effort necessary to follow it.<br /><br />Still, 'Downton Abbey' remains outstanding on almost every level, from the writing, cinematography, set design, costuming, and score to the brilliant acting by Hugh Bonneville as the Crawley family patriarch, Dan Stevens as heir presumptive Matthew Crawley and Smith, McGovern, Dockery, Coyle, and well over a dozen others, 'Downton Abbey' sets a new standard for 21st century television, and, by extension, asks us to reconsider the lives we lead and the society we support today.<br /><br />All students of Edwardian England, of Rupert Brooke, Vita Sackville-West, Kenneth Grahame, J. M. Barrie, the Sitwells and others will admire and deeply appreciate this intelligent, thoughtful, and moving series.imensional human beings; in the opening episodes of Season Three, however, the same characters are instead depicted strictly in human terms, and the writing is far more self-conscious in every respect.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Three blu-rays for this price is an excellent deal. All three films in the series warrant multiple viewings. For comic book fans, batman fans, superhero fans and guys ages 15-55 these are a no-brainer. Women and those uninitiated to batman or superheroes can still get enjoyment from the drama and story of these films.<br /><br />This is 5 star series, even despite Christian Bale's bad voice acting. They feature intense action, drama and memorable characters, particularly the villains.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Another typical Fagan gem. He has a knack for writing good tunes with great instrumentation and vocals.  No disappointment here.
B005IZLPMY|1.0|In spite of the high quality of recent superhero films, this movie seems rushed. The visuals and effects are not up to modern standards. Chris Evans only has one memorable scene and it is his very last one in the movie. The editing is sloppy (see the hangar chase), which is totally unacceptable for something with this budget.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|I have never been a huge Bob Dylan fan, but I must confess I have never really followed his music much.  I recently had the opportunity to listen to &#34;Tempest&#34; on Spotify and I was immediately impressed.  Within a week I found it on sale on Amazon so I downloaded it to my collection.  It was only after I purchased the album that I even read any reviews of Dylan's most recent offering.  My favorite tracks are &#34;Duquesne Whistle&#34; with its bouncy toe-tapping Western swing goodness and the haunting tale of the sinking of the Titanic, &#34;Tempest&#34;,  for which the album is named.  It still amazes me that such a rough voice can be so soothing.  Mr. Zimmerman you have won me over!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game------I can't wait to be able to play it----so far I can't get it away from my kids and Grandkids!!!  LOL
B009TZ7WDK|4.0|I love these two.  My problem with this recording is that it was technically not done well.  One song is so soft you can barely hear it, and the next comes blaring out loud enough to shatter your ear drums.  I like my music to be consistant in volume, I don't like running in to turn it down or up with each song.<br /><br />I would love an album of just Jonathan next.  Charlottes voice is pretty, but unremarkable. Just my opinion!  My DREAM DUO would be Jonathan and Andrew De Leon!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite TV shows and I enjoyed being able to watch each episode on my own computer at my own time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Definitely a good read. Keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Referred to me by friends and I passed on the recommendation.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|This movie is okay, but has some unrealistic/improbable parts in the movie. Overall it is a good movie with some amazing dancing.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Not as good as secret child but still a good book ...it took me longer to read this one. Still good.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|We watched Brave with our 2 and 3 year old sons and they loved the movie. They were frightened at one point in the movie, but overall they enjoyed the movie.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was the final book of the three that I read and probably the slowest read of all. I still enjoyed it, just not as much as Secret Child.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Plays like other Virtual City games. Biggest drawback is the need for investment dollars. Fastest way to get some is to post activity to Facebook. However, my phone tells me it isn't Configured to post to Facebook, so I only get investment dollars when I level up. (slowly, because I can't complete some tasks without investment dollars!)
B001R6AW18|5.0|My son needed to watch and review a 1930's film.  This was so easy to do! Quality was not bad either
B001N26GFC|5.0|I have seen a good deal of Mike Leigh's films now, but I think &#34;Happy-go-Lucky&#34; is his best. It features an Oscar-worthy (and Golden Globe-winning) performance from Sally Hawkins, one of Britain's best and more underutilized actresses. It pins a smile on your face and keeps it there for two hours. Witty, partially-improvised dialog that is expertly delivered by the first rate cast, this is a movie everyone should see.
B007TK77QE|1.0|Over verbose and under-edited. Full of characters which were poorly explored and universally devoid of any empathetic character. However, a successful observational exercise of collective human failure.
B004EBT6HE|5.0|I listened to this book on CD several years ago.  I thought the plot was fascinating, and that the mechanics of causing an earthquake was genius (even though unlikely).  I thought the title was perfect.  I decided to look it up and see what others thought about it.  Wowsers!!!  More 1-star reviews than 5-star reviews.  How can this be?  I've seen some really poor reads get far better reviews.  Oh, well.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|this book was very well researched ,organized and presented. the subject was an amazing man and had a great story. He was explained to the reader in a way that not only made his character clear but admirable. You as a reader could understand his faults, and they were many,  and forgive them, they in many ways turned out to be his strong points.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Good book, similar to many others about long distance hiking.  It flowed well and was easy to read. Would recommend to others.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|A great starter album from Phillips. I did not watch American Idol so was surprised to learn he was the winner when I heard this refreshing mix of sounds that are sometimes familiar (DMB's raspy sound) and fresh.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I am so in love with in.its so fun.and when nh kids play I don't have to sit their and worry abort their being blood everywhere. or the game cussing.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this game was a great running game with good graphics and easy money making....I had a highscore of over 130000 and about 80some thousand coins... then one morning I wake up and turn my game on and everything was erased just in this one app... all that work for nothing and its not worth doing it again...
B0098VYCCE|3.0|the costumes were astounding but there were great holes in the story and Kristen Stewart is a bore of an actress. She seems to only be able to summon surprise and a grimace.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|some of his narrative is meant for the scientific community and is a bit difficult to follow.  I enjoyed the first 80 % and then he started to recommend meditation gurus and it kind of put me off
0811868419|4.0|Just discovering the art of paper cut and found this book. I am enjoying the story told of the artist's search for companionship and love through his work.
0553801473|5.0|Excellent and I am ready for the next book!!!!  Although there were many on your website that gave the book questionable remarks, I found the book most entertaining and very enjoyable.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|Love these special Christmas issues!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book it was so interesting!  I recommend this book th others because it was fun to read and make you want to read more.
B004AQR24W|5.0|This is the Manwich of action movies. If you we're looking for depth or even art you should have known better. Awesome movie. A pure and sustained rush.
6305428387|5.0|I remember seeing this during Olympics.  I enjoyed watching the acting of how they had idea to go to winter olympics.  Some of them are funny.  I lived in Jamicia for 8 months and I know their culture and it fits perfectly!  :-)  I also am so happy that it has closed caption.
1451695187|3.0|Instead of more details on his experience, he spends a lot of time and words discussing his family...ie what they are doing, where there have been, and he includes more than just close family.  He also spends a lot of words talking about non related people and in laws.  This is a big distraction from what I wanted to really read about.  There were much too many pages ignoring his experience and talking about friends and relatives.<br />Finally, his experiences were detailed and commanded my attention...I am glad I read it.<br /><br />Phoenix,Az.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Director Scott once again made a movie I was sorry to see end.  I wanted to follow Noomi on to the home planet of the contemptuous giants.  The special effects were first class, the story line simple but compelling.  This was an entertaining movie worth buying.<br /><br />As usual, I noticed illogical actions from the scientists that screamed of idiocy, but after the rocket roar from ships in the vacuum of deep space, you give up worrying and just go with the flow. Could the human race's DNA been tampered with by visitors in our past?  Why not?<br /><br />I hope Ridley Scott fashions another film gem soon, his talent demands free rein!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this! getting better at it all the time. It sure challenges you. I have not had the ad problem that people talk about....yet! Hope I don't! I use it on my  kindle fire...first generation (not hd)
B0038P59A0|4.0|If you're the type to nitpick the language, and little details, used in a film like this then this is not for you. This is the 19th century for the 21st century done right. The writing, acting, and special effects are wrapped up in a package that's beautiful to look at. If they were on a ship they would be swashbuckling pirates, as it is this is a grand who-dunnit adventure. Leave the history books at the door.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Easy to learn, yet difficult to master.<br />I really enjoyed deflecting asteroids to land on the pigs below.<br />The gravity wells and the resulting changes in bird trajectory add a bit of problem solving to the game.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show! It's always funny. I look forward to watching it every week. I recommend it to everyone I know.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. Hours of playing in between words with friends games. Keeps me happy until the dog needs to go out :)
0547884591|5.0|It seems like Tim publishes a book every time I need another kick in the A. I've been putting off learning more programming languages and Spanish to my own detriment over the last couple years. But now, after starting The 4 Hour Chef and jumping straight to Meta Learning, I'm finally so damn excited to tackle these next 2 huge milestones in my life. Perfect timing, I'm fired up for this.<br /><br />I really need to get the Hard Copy, but you see... I can't. Because I'm on a tropical island in South East Asia... for over a year now :) A proud product of 4HWW (and also 4HB I might add!) I'll check the bookstores in BKK & MNL next time I get a chance! Until then, I got my kindle version. If anyone's interested in sharing notes just add me! cheers
B0091REZMW|5.0|its a fun game to play I only play once a day for about 2 mine because I don't want to have to use my diamonds to get food to continue so I just wait until my energy is refilled
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What a great story line....and all the twists and turns.....I never saw them coming but was extremely impressed with this book.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was one of those books you cannot put down and we enjoyed every page; however, I felt dread that the author would find herself in a bad situation with her taking the adventure by herself.  Probably would have enjoyed it even more had she been with another person and I could have relaxed.
B0085A9J18|5.0|This is one of the best martial arts/action movies I have ever seen. Scratch that. The Raid is one of the best overall films I have ever seen period. Awesome. Awesome to the max.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can you say about this trilogy????? Started out being horrified by the content but the more we read we decided we would probably read the second one, and then the third.  In the end it did have some saving grace in that if you search enough and tried hard enough you could say it was just a dirty love story.
B000G6BM00|5.0|This is a great movie and a perfect example of high quality science fiction. James Cameron takes Ridley Scott's Alien and totally runs with it turning everything up to 11! Game over man!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Prabably the dirtiest book ever read and yet something compelled us to keep going with the hopes that it had some redeeming grace.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Just what you think it is...I watched this with no expectations except entertainment, just what I got no suprises just fun
B008MG1E4A|5.0|My husband and I were fascinated from the first page until the last page of this book.  We felt it was not only a first-hand account of what happened, but an accurate account of what happened.  We were especially interested inasmuch as we had read &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; and were equally fascinated.  The author of &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; had been a one-time tenant of a good friend of ours so we felt we had a personal interest in his account of the horrors that particular team had endured.  We have ordered &#34;American Sniper&#34; and hope it will live up to the quality of the first two books I have noted above.
B008DF04J6|5.0|Dimitri From Paris again delights us with an impressive session, impeccable mixes, incredible remixes , flawless and elegant work.<br /><br />From the selection of each track to the remixes that made ​​Dimitri From Paris are incredibly good, have that special touch of sophistication, elegance and majesty.<br /><br />Incredible talent to delight us, each song and each mix leads to a new and higher level, when you think the session came to its best with the next track is improved even more and more, impeccable mixing session, highly recommended, Dimitri once again shows his great talent.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have already commented  on the last two books.  When starting this one we thought it beyond a decent read, but somehow just kept going until we were rather caught up in what could possibly happen next to shock us but after reading all three books we did end up happy that some decency was achieved and we could say that it was just a very dirty love story.
1609611543|5.0|This book has changed my life. And I'm losing weight!  Im giving it to everyone for the holidays this year
B008AWBQGM|5.0|Read a few reviews on the new album, seems to me some people just over analyse things. Thing is, over the past decade the music scene has been shocking to say the least . Have been a fan of the Southern Rock music seen since the early seventys when i first heard the Outlaws, these boys can play. Then Skynyrd quickly followed into my life, alas many years have passed, and many members passed on,( we know the history), so when ordering the new Outlaws album it was suggested i might like the new Skynyrd album as well , bloody well right I do. This album has restored my faith in music, after all the years gone, the boys and Ladys, STILL HAVE IT,!!!! from start to finish LOVE IT LOVE IT. Living in Australia , doubt I will ever get a chance to see the band live, but keep on doin what your doin and i will keep buying your music, BLOODY FANTASTIC. COLIN ,Perth, Western Australia.
0525425764|5.0|A great read even for adults.  Recommended as light, summer beach type reading.  Young readers will get hooked on the Grisham stories
0547884591|4.0|I just like the guy. I guess I'm a fan. This surprises me, to tell you the truth, because I think I'm pretty far outside his target market. His books are supermanic ADHD odysseys of self-improvement and bravado, and I very much enjoy them from the comfort of my recliner. These are the ravings of a man who is about equal parts ambitious, absurd and insecure, and I appreciate the literary benefits of this personality trifecta. He does wackadoo things so I don't have to, and he's a totally compulsive superachiever because he's really just an LI townie with something to prove. This makes for a compelling individual and fun books.<br />I don't find everything in his books personally valuable. I certainly don't agree with everything he proposes. I think parts of 4-Hour Chef are a lava-hot mess, in fact. It's way too much data, weirdly organized, mediocrely written, unskillfully photographed with an inexcusable number of typos for professionally printed matter. But it's really funny and fun. He routinely references his robust sex life in a book dedicated to his parents. That's just the kind of guy he is, and this is just the kind of book that guy writes.<br />This book, and all his books, are thinly-veiled comic books, with Tim as the earnest hero, really trying to be great, and being a big nerd despite himself. He is always the subject of his books, and we are the experiment. This is fine with me, I like the character, he's a joyful read.<br />I did chiffonade some basil this weekend, and he gets all the credit.
0385535147|5.0|Utterly fantastic and a fast paced, interesting story with the usual Grisham twist.  It was hard to put down.  You wonder throughout the book what the main character is up to....right up to the final page.  Highly recommended reading.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|I expected more from this movie.  It was too short and it did not have a plot or a good ending.
B004CFAWK2|4.0|I watched the movie Fried Green Tomatoes about 400,000 as a kid and loved it.  The book can be appreciated on its own but you have to divorce your emotions from the movie.  I really enjoyed that the lesbian relationship between Idgie and Ruth is much more clear-cut in the book.  The softened it up in the movie so it was kind of up for interpretation.  The book makes it clear.
B009JEMF0Q|2.0|I love Ellie Goulding, but after a few songs, I noticed that EVERY song's chorus or hook was Ellie repeating the same phrase 3, 4, 5 times, multiple times in the song.  Sounded like a one trick pony. :(
0345803485|5.0|Fun escape :)  But if you're looking for literature, it's not for you.  I enjoyed it for what it was and probably what it's meant to be.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I love music and dancing and happy endings and this movie had it all.  I loved it.!!!  I highly reccomended
B004UID2LC|3.0|I'd much rather just go to youtube on the Internet, not that great. I gave it 3 stars because it is not all bad but I don't like it much
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I loved the movie.  Why? Because its a romantic story with a good ending.  Real life has its tragedy and sadness. Why should movies have sad endings?  Movies should make you happy and make you laugh and dream.  Movies should be about triumph and love and good endings.  A place to escape the reality of life.
B008458O3S|5.0|Fun and a good time killer. I really like it and I would recomend this to anyone. It gets a bit challenging as you go along but those are my favorite types of apps.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app runs smoothly and actually gives you a challenging game. I hats when the rounds are easy. of course there are a lot of ads..I mean come on...its a free app. no issues for me.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was disappointed in this final book.  Not in the ending but in the way it got there. to much crazy stuff.
B004HO6I2E|4.0|I personally thought this movie was funny and over the top comedy were you could tell they over exaggerated on some parts but I thought it was funny overall.  If your not into sick and evil humor and heavy dose of raunchy comedy then this movie is not for you.  The movie had it's good points with some nice themes to it.  It's a keeper for me.
1455828734|5.0|I must apologize in advance, because you're about to read mostly gushing and my experience reading this more than a summary of this story.<br /><br />I'm so thrilled I picked up The Fever series and I'm really sad that this is the last book for Jericho and Mac.  Well, at least for several years.  The story got better and more addictive with each book.  Shadowfever was COMPLETELY addicting.  This series was AMAZING and I now see why there are so many devoted fans.  I'm one of the obsessed now.  This review is for the unabridged audio version, which I highly recommend!<br /><br />I had been listening to Dreamfever (book 4) on the way to work and finished.  What an ending!  But it wasn't until I popped in the first CD of Shadowfever that I realized what had actually happened at the end of Dreamfever and I almost had a heart attack!  I had to go into work and as I was walking in, I purchased the Kindle version on my phone so I could sneak peeks during breaks, because I was so tortured!  When I got home I speed read/skimmed the rest of the book just to make sure everything was going to turn out okay.  Once I climbed off the ledge, I was able to relax and then listen to the rest without worries.<br /><br />Shadowfever is a LONG book.  Approximately 688 pages, but I loved each and every one of them.  I loved feisty and self-confident Mac, and with each book we make new discoveries about her identity and her powers.  We see her grow from Mac 1.0: innocent, sheltered, lover of all things pink and glittery, to Mac 2.0:  strong, powerful, and ready to take on any challenge.  Jericho Barrons was larger than life and everything you could want in an oh-so-delicious, dark hero.  Their relationship is, of course, my favorite part of this series, and it starts off on shaky ground when Shadowfever begins.  They repair, bit by bit, opening up, and pulling each other in closer and closer with every interaction.  They have off-the-charts chemistry:<br /><br />The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were trouble.\\"<br />\\"Ditto.\\"<br />\\"I wanted to drag you between the shelves, f-- k you senseless, and send you home.\\"<br />\\"If you'd done that, I never would have left.\\"<br />\\"You're still here anyway.\\"<br />\\"You don't have to sound so sour about it.\\"<br />\\"You're upsetting my entire existence.\\"<br />\\"Fine, I'll leave.\\"<br />\\"Try and I'll chain you up.\\"<br /><br />There were gripping plot twists that surprised, saddened, and enraged me. We finally find out who killed Alina, and it was a shocker.  We get answers about the book, who originally let it out, why Barrons wants it, what he is, and who the Unseelie King is.  I was happy with the way things ended and tied up, but apparently after three books revolving around Dani, we get more with Mac and Barrons.<br /><br />Like I said before, I listened to this on audio CDs while I commuted back and forth to work.  I had to try and restrict myself to just listening to it then, but when the holiday came, I could no longer resist and finished Shadowfever on my computer while following along on my Kindle.  I feel like the audio increased my pleasure immensely. The narrator switched mid series, and at first there was a woman doing all of the voices.  The last two books are narrated by a male and female and while it took me a bit to get used to the switch in Mac's voice, Jericho's voice was amazing, deep, sexy, and oh-so-perfect!<br /><br />See, I told you pretty much just gushing.  All I can say is, if you haven't read this series, go now!<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br /><br />\\"He pulls me around and kisses me.\\"You're Mac,\\" he says. \\"And I'm Jericho. And nothing else matters. Never will. You exist in a place that is beyond all rules for me. Do you understand that?\\"  I do.  Jericho Barrons just told me he loves me.\\"

0547995660|5.0|I've probably read this book tons of times since I was a child, but I couldn't recite it for you. Every time I read it, it's like I have never read it before. The Giver always feels new and fresh to me. I continue to read it with surprise and heartbreak; and even now I find myself tearing up or down right crying at different parts in the novel. Sometimes I feel that Lois Lowry wrote this masterpiece with me in mind, like it was written just for me.<br /><br />The novel is relatively short and simple to read, but is full of powerful themes and deep meaning. Lowry shows the power of our senses, the importance of memories (good and bad), and the significance of being different. The world in The Giver is supposedly a perfect society, but that doesn't make it a Utopia. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially young adults and older children. I believe this book shaped me in some way to be the woman I am today.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|This was an excellent movie - so why did I only give it four stars?  Well, as a critical move-watcher of films by Ridley Scott and others, I feel like there is a certain standard they need to live up to.  I simply needed more from this movie.<br /><br />It is not bad, really, in any way, but it has some small flaws in it that are hard for me to look past.  They might spoil the story for those that have not watched it, so I will not list them here, but they are significant enough to ding the movie one star in my mind.<br /><br />As far as the good stuff?  Wow - amazing effects, and some stellar acting by Michael Fassbender.  Really a great example of how detail oriented Ridley Scott is when designing a movie, which makes me feel a little more strongly about the flaws.<br /><br />In any case, if you are a sci-fi fan of hardcore science fiction, or a fan of the Alien / Aliens movies, this one is definitely worth the watch!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|to graphic and repeative could of eliminated some of sexual scenes and got more into his hidden past.  same ohj same
B0083SBJXS|5.0|There are many that would argue that point with me, but as an overall picture, this movie surpasses all of the existing superhero movies, including the incredible Christopher Nolan directed Batman trilogy.<br /><br />Joss Whedon did an amazing job of mixing the aspects of each of these characters, their flaws, their strengths, along with a memorable villain who was not easily dispatched, into something that could have easily flowed off the pages of a comic or graphic novel.<br /><br />I truly think that the next Avengers movie will have a lot to live up to - but the only way I want them to go is up!

0547884591|5.0|I really enjoyed Tim's first two books, and couldn't wait for the Four Hour Chef. I am 2/3 through the book so far, and would be finished already, if it wasn't such a huge brick of info. The Meta section blew my mind. This has been the most useful section for me thus far. The idea that you can fast forward your learning of any skill, and become world class quickly is revolutionary. Tim's style is very conversational, and this is an easy read. I plan to update this review after finishing the book.
B008EZVNO0|1.0|I have most of Van Morrison's albums, going back 25 years or more. I love the majority of his stuff, and I really looked forward to this album. But I'm very disappointed, sad to say. There's nothing really new here--Van whines about his life a lot, how people have done him wrong, how \\"the system\\" puts it to everybody, etc., ad nauseam--lots of trite phrasing. So many of his other songs have beautiful melodies or heartfelt lyrics--\\"Celtic New Year,\\" \\"Queen of the Slipstream,\\" for example. Or they're just plain fun or good to dance to--\\"Cleaning Windows,\\" \\"Jackie Wilson Said,\\" etc. None of that here, unfortunately. If you want something creative and fresh from somebody's who's also been around a while, buy Dylan's \\"Tempest.\\"

B0000636NQ|5.0|This version has 8 tracks instead of the five on the original and is the one you should get. (2006) version. As many others have stated the band really came alive on this one with their blend of hard rockin blues and even a whiff of jazz influence. THis still wasn't the great psych hard rock protometal band of just a year later but it was  excellent music. It was strange that this was their second release ,coming a year after their debut. Their studio second release would come later , to be followed by the explosive 'sssh'.  Still this is a fantastic live recording of true powerful musicians who were more than just straight rockers to be sure. In a earlier age these guys would have been a jazz combo. They can let loose a free form like that if they want. I have everything this band put out and many lee solo efforts and I can tell you that this is great and it reflects 1968 in a good way that still sounds interesting and jamming.

030746363X|2.0|After the 4HWW - I bought several copies and gave them to friends and family - I was really looking forward to this book, so much so that I ordered from the US as I couldn't wait for the book to be launched in the UK.<br />The slow carb diet is essentially Paleo, but I just don't get the lentils bit and in my experience don't aid weight loss.<br /><br />My real bug bear is the eulogies about swinging kettlebells. Swinging weights free form can be very dangerous as I found to my cost. 1 set of 15 swings caused a partial detachment of my supraspinatus muscle from which I still experience pain almost 2 years later.<br /><br />Rotator cuff injuries are common to kettlebell users, because many kettlebell moves involve lifting the arms over the shoulders. This over-head movement causes irritation to the muscles and tendons in the shoulder joint, or rotator cuff. Rotator cuff injuries may include tendinitis of the shoulder, bursitis and torn tendons. People over the age of 40 are more prone to rotator cuff injuries, because the collagen in tendons and muscles is not as robust as that in younger people. Exercise therapy, rest, ice and elevation are generally the first treatments, followed by steroid injections and surgery. To prevent rotator cuff injuries, use proper posture and form when lifting, and make sure you have balanced strength in and around the shoulder. Regular shoulder exercises -- as well as frequent breaks and rest -- help prevent shoulder joint injuries.<br /><br />That last bit from Livestrong
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've never been a gamer but mimecraft has got me hooked! Its my favorite game by far. I played on the xbox and fell in love. I was phyced when it came out on kindle. I just hope the next update has; water, lava, wolves, more monsters, more food, spawn seeds, and survival on creative. :) I would recommend it to everyone. I'm a girl and I play it, and love it.
0547884591|4.0|I was initially very sceptical about this book. I loved the 4HWW, but suffered a serious kettlebell injury following on from reading the 4HB and generally find the SCD pretty boring, but that might be down to my love of good red wine.<br />I'm also conscious of Tim's flair for self promotion (in itself nothing to sneer at), but I'm always reminded of a line from Monty Python's Life of Brian 'He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy'. I think some people actually want to be Tim Ferriss, rather than learning from him.<br />I'm a pretty good cook so I didn't expect to learn a lot from this book, but surprisingly I did learn some stuff, but more importantly it reignited my love of cooking. I especially liked the section 'The Professional' and was impressed with some of the techniques shown.<br />It does meander at times, but that doesn't bother me. In fact being incurably curious myself I kind of like the quirky style and I like Tim's writing style. I do agree with others, however, who say that the Kindle version can get a bit confusing when navigating through.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Before playing this app, go on youtube and watch the coin-dozer expert videos.  They won't help you win at the game, but they're quite funny.  This app gives you more coins than a real one would.  I just wish my Kindle Fire had a shake function.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very seldom do I write book reviews. This is only my second.  This book impressed me.  It was well written, the story was well thought out, the characters were engaging, and the author delivered an exceptionally great read.  I found it hard to put down. The author told a brilliant, if not terrifying story, one that could so easily come to pass. I, too, feel this book could become a classic.  I look forward to more books from this writer, and will be recommending this book to all of my friends as a 'must read'!

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Both of Sylvia Day's novels, Bared to You and Reflected in You, are far superior in writing style, story depth, and characterization than the 50 Shades of Grey series. Eva and Gideon are much more highly developed and believable characters. I like the fact that the author presents them as flawed human beings with lots of inner turmoil. A love story between two broken people is very evocative--a welcome change from romantic series where one or both of the protagonists is perfect.<br /><br />Having said that, however, I must admit that I'm troubled by the ending of Reflected in You. Without doing a \\"spoiler\\" here, I do want to say that the ending did leave me with grave reservations about Gideon Cross, and I couldn't help wondering what effect his most \\"extreme\\" action would eventually have upon Eva. How would anyone live with that knowledge between themselves? Perhaps the next Crossfire novel, Entwined in You, will deal with the fallout of the second book's ending, but as it stands now, although Reflected in You had a degree of emotional satisfaction regarding the ending, it also raises some disturbing issues about how far one person can, or should, go.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in a couple decades. 11/22/63 reminded me why I used to read King's books as soon as they were published ... and why I quit reading them. King is a good writer, has a great imagination, knows how to pen an engrossing story, but is exhaustingly verbose. I wanted to make a little circling motion with my finger to tell him to hurry up, but of course he wasn't in the room to see it.<br /><br />Fiction writers have the unique ability to bend time. We can do what we want because it's our world. We make it up. The premise of 11/22/63 is that our intrepid hero discovers a time portal that takes him back to 1958. After a quick touristic holiday, he decides to go back to 1958 and wait until November 22, 1963 in order to save John F. Kennedy. King proceeds to tell us everything that happens in the intervening five years. Why? It was King's decision to have the portal go to 1958. He could have chosen 1961 or 1962. I think he just loves to write.<br /><br />That aside, this is a well told story. I like time travel because they are basically fish-out-of-water tales. [[ASIN:1613823770 A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]] by Mark Twain is the apex of the genre. 11/22/63 may have been overly long (880 pages in paperback), but it was still a fun read with some creative twists on time travel. I didn't agree with his speculations about altered history, but they didn't interfere with the story. If you like to be immersed in Stephen King's world, you can have an extended stay with 11/22/63.

B0098VYCCE|3.0|This movie had amazing potential and I truly wanted to love it. The general problem was either they just didn't know which direction to go in or someone went a little too nutty with the editing.<br /><br />The Plot: Well, we know the basic idea of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, so no spoiler alert there. However elements were introduced in the story that seemed dropped in and never really explained or followed. For instance, Snow is led to safety by some (magical?) animals. A brief scene early in the movie of Snow White saving a bird MIGHT explain this, but you never really are sure.  SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: Also (and my entire family felt the same way)a troll is introduced in the middle of the movie, Snow White seems to tame it... but we're not sure why AND we never see this troll again. We loved the troll and thought he would come in later to help in the big final battle, but no. We definitely wanted more troll!  Later she gets a \\"blessing\\" from the king of the forest, but again we just don't understand why - Snow White just didn't seem that special.<br /><br />Cast:<br />Okay I loved the cast, with one notable exception: Kristen Stewart. What I've come to realize is that Ms. Stewart's role of Bella Swan (Twilight movies) is the extent of her acting ability. Perhaps an actress who could bring more vibrancy to the role would have sparked up the movie and even helped the audience be more amenable to believing that Snow White was more special than meets the eye.<br />Now, Charlize Theron almost made up for a weak Snow White, she was tremendous over the top the way an evil queen should be.<br />Chris Hemsworth was just right for the Huntsman (how can you go wrong with Thor in leathers and an axe :) and the \\"seven dwarfs\\" were all amazing actors.<br /><br />Is it a terrible movie? No, but it could have been a really enjoyable movie and that's what is most disappointing.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed this story, as I typically do grishams work. I loved the way he built suspense through the book and gives the reader enough clues and red herrings to make you think you know what will happen next, only to surprise you at the next turn. Grisham admits the book is poorly researched in his notes, so don't get distracted as I did, trying to figure out which prison the main character spent time in, and etc. Great page turner for a lazy snow day or a vacation.

B0097UO87U|5.0|Loved Jeff Lynne since the 70&#34;s and ELO as well as his solo stuff and work producing others - his distinctive sound comes through.  Interesting set of classics with his unique treatment, but just leaves you wanting more, which will likely be a long wait given the intervals between Armchair Theatre and Zoom.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|this movie seemed more like a disney movie than what i expect from a pixar movie. even by disney movie standards, it was poor. the story was very weak. I kept waiting for the movie to get to some sort of adventure or point and by then it was already over.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Reviewer's Note: Though I cannot promise I won't \\"slip up,\\" this will be a SPOILER-FREE review.<br /><br />Anyone who has watched this series - which I believe is basically... everyone, knows its sorrows, joys and triumphs. It's an award-winning ITV series penned by Julian Fellowes that has evolved a great deal in the last three years. Praised for its first season but earning lackluster reviews in its second (which I attribute to the time frame), the series returns for a stronger, but emotionally driven third season. One that wouldn't be the 'Downton Abbey' we know and love without some fun and soapy drama - and there's plenty of it!<br /><br />It has been many months since the house of Downton Abbey has seen such life and happiness as that of the impending wedding of Mary (Michelle Dockery) and Matthew (Dan Stevens). Butler and stickler of the rules, Carson (Jim Carter) couldn't be more proud if Mary were his own daughter - always his favorite, Carson would do anything to see to it that Mary and his employer Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonnville) receive only the best care and are never subject to scandal. Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) and the family couldn't be more delighted that Mary and Matthew are finally marrying after a tumultuous relationship and for once, Cora and her mother-in-law, Countess Grantham (Maggie Smith) agree on something. The big day isn't complete without the arrival of Cora's opinionated - and bossy -American mother (Shirley McClain)... and Cora's youngest daughter, Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay) who created waves of conflict in the family when she married the chauffer, Tom (Allen Leech). Accepting a tradesman for a son-in-law soon becomes second to the dreams of Edith (Laura Carmichael) becoming a journalist, the arrival of new downstairs staff, Thomas' shenanigans, scary possibilities for Mrs. Hughes (Phyillis Logan)... and financial woes for Downton Abbey.<br /><br />What makes this series such a success is its characters. It's been said time and again by reviewer after reviewer. And it's true; the foundation would simply crumble without them. It's the things that we laugh, cry and bite our nails over that makes Downton so distinctively what it is. Three years in, that is still the key to why this is so darn successful and I am pleased to say that even entering an age of renowned promiscuity - the \\"roaring 20's,\\" Fellowes still retains the charm and (mostly) wholesome ideal. Marvels galore - from new characters and old favorites... to inventive new costuming! -will delight devoted fans of this popular British-originated and now \\"imported\\" American series.<br /><br />Leaving off from the second season, certain character's fates were left in tatters and in jeopardy, and others lives were finally getting on the track of happily-ever-after after much angst. I'll confess to reading spoilers and gossiping about this in anticipation with a couple of friends so I wasn't unprepared for anything that was happening in the stately halls of my favorite British mansion. There is plenty of soapy drama mixing in with tears... and lest you despair, never fear, there are events that make us smile and our hearts inexplicably happy. Edith's happiness takes a turn, ripping a page straight from a Bronte novel. Thomas and O'Brien continue to scheme directing hate towards each other. Lest you think some fan favorites are absent, you'd be mistaken; Daisy, Anna and Bates are still a familiar presence, as is Isobel and even the re-appearance of the fallen maid, Ethel. New faces also become a fixture at Downton between a besotted new kitchen maid and a vain footman. That alone creates loads of tension.<br /><br />Some of the highlights consist of meeting Cora's mother (she and Violet are a riot together - like she and Isobel, they are constantly at odds) as well as the characters who have evolved into something more mature and if possible, more wonderful. Being something of a romantic, I wish Matthew and Mary had shared more intimate moments of flirting and stolen kisses but being the proper British couple they are, that is kept to a minimum but seriously, as my mother said, \\"even when they're fighting, they are cute!\\" She is so right! Their interaction is darling and all too rare. Everything from the motor cars to the scenery, the grandeur of a London club to the costuming is gorgeous and beautifully puts us in mind of this era. I love the production for that reason alone if nothing else though there are many other reasons. With rumors that some of the main cast (nooo! Please say it isn't so!) is leaving and no report that there will be a fourth series (yet!), I can accept this ending but am wishing that we will be granted another series beyond just the upcoming Christmas special. So many moments were precious (including the acceptance of Tom - loved Robert's shifting attitude) and memories were made that we will no doubt cherish all of which is carried by the phenomenal cast and the emotional, witty script. Perhaps it's not as \\"brilliant\\" as when it first debuted though far be it from me to judge, but Fellowes is on the right track and for me, Downton Abbey won my heart over anew.<br /><br />'Downton Abbey' premieres in the U.S. January 2013 on Masterpiece Theatre.<br /><br />© Copyright 2011-2013 Dreaming Under the Same Moon / Scribbles, Scripts and Suchts of flirting and stolen kisses but being the proper British couple they are, that is kept to a minimum but seriously, as my mother said, \\"even when they're fighting, they are cute!\\" She is so right!

B00973DDN2|3.0|Overall it is a pretty good album, but not quite as good as other Killers albums.  There are no great ballads that you just want to listen to over and over.
B00000612P|5.0|This album is perfect: strong and high-powerful voice, instrumental accompaniment both energetic and virtuosistic. A mix of rock and blues that sings the song of UK music of the early seventies.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|My little sister loved this book when I read it to her it make us laugh and giggle. Its a cool book
0545425115|2.0|I started the Hunger Games series because I heard that it was a phenomenon, and as I started to read it, I realized that the plot was magnificent, with the whole utopian society of Panem and the whole Hunger Games itself... the catch on why I rated this book 2 stars? The writing wasn't the best.<br />I mean, there couldve been more description and a \\"stopping point\\" between scenes. I realize, that if I tried, I could write this book a whole lot better than she can!<br />It's based off of \\"star-crossed lovers\\", not on the games itself. The girl on fire and the dumb boy with the bread are in love on a screen. I mean, come on! If I wanted a sappy book, I would've chosen Twilight!<br />So, all in all, a fan, but not exactly a fangirl over it. Great plot, just poor writing.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|Very fun book to read even though many parts are by now very dated. Feynman surely had genius in the field of physics but was also interested in so many other topics it's kind of amazing.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I have been a fan of Macklemore for a few years. Great to see him get the fame he deserves. Excellent performer with a meaningful message. Buy this CD.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I have eagerly devoured the first two seasons of Breaking Bad. Imagine my disappointment when I put the first disc of Season 3 in my Blu-Ray player only to get the message that the disc is not playable. Why? It was a PAL disc, incompatible with a Region 1 DVD player. Nothing on the packaging or the Amazon listing hinted that this was a PAL version. Thanks for nothing, WAREHOUSE DEALS, INC. Breaking Bad: A+; Warehouse Deals: D. This review, however, reflects my satisfaction with the 3rd season of the show, which did not disappoint as one of the best shows on TV ever continues.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Its a nice long cord. I love it. It fits great with my power charger adapter. It fits nicely its not loose.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|NO doubt this is a great watch...It keeps time accurate enough for a mechanical watch. gains like 5-7 sec per day probably... by no mean i have counted it but it is a guess.<br /><br />The dial is small and well suited for smaller wrists. Canvas belt is Okay.. not great but no complaints either.. Watch dial has matte finish and i love it ...<br /><br />The back is open so you have see its heart beating ....!<br /><br />I dont know about the water resistance but i don't swim with watch...<br /><br />I like this watch and I will recommend it to anyone with small-medium wrist.
B005PK553C|5.0|Not what I was expecting but very pleasantly suprised - my kind of creepy show - Jessica Lange makes it worth watching!
B0060D123K|1.0|I didn't like it, and neither did my 3 yr old grandson, it was just as gloomy as the original.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|i love this movie and would have bought it years ago if i knew how hard it would be to find later. Wanted the narated version and this is not it but this is still worth the money.
B00A12VW86|4.0|Green Day delivers on second album of trio. Billie Joe clearly has a lot on his mind. Good driving pop punk album with plenty of venom.
B00005UWMX|1.0|this dvd would not play on my nor anyone i knew dvd player. it would however play on the computer. It ssays on the screen that it is a regional era. Dont know what that means but feel a bit unsatisfied that i cant watch this movie with friends unless its on computer.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I like the book and found the subject of animals in captivity more interesting than I would have ever expected.  I had read &#34;Son of The Circus&#34; and found the comparison of India and Canada very similar in &#34;Life of Pi&#34;.
0307474712|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book because the movie looked so good but I was only able to make it through about 3 chapters before I couldn't force myself to keep going.  Perhaps it gets better but this may be one of the few movies that I watch with out reading the book first.  Hopefully the movie is better but if not, at least Jim Sturgess gives plenty of eye candy!
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|I have listened to this CD several times now and each time I like it more.  IT's doesn't sound as if the AI machine over produced it - it actually has a sound - his sound - that makes it great!  I am so happy for him!
1451696191|5.0|I got this book because I wanted to see the movie and needed a light read before setting out on my next novel.  This book while easy to read was really reflective and I can see why middle america keeps challenging this book on reading lists.<br /><br />It raised a lot of tough subjects particularly for someone so young.  The main character is only a freshman.  You can feel the angst of not understanding much of the world, and in particular, not understanding yourself.  now in my mid 20's, I can look back and still relate to a bunch of the feelings he felt, like the intense need to have friends and escape from the world and feel &#34;infinite&#34; as Charlie puts it a few times.  When I read that, I immediately went to the times when I could have described my own infinite experiences with friends.<br /><br />The book is also difficult to read because it deals with depression, abuse, sexual abuse from family members and close friends, homosexuality, and the sheer awkwardness that it seems almost everyone faces most severely when you are 14.  It was fun seeing charlie work through his freshman year through the outpouring of his thoughts to a stranger that all he wanted from was a listening ear.<br /><br />This would make a great book club read
B00881PPTO|4.0|So many trolls in the reviews. Just needed to say that.<br /><br />1) Yes, this app does require permission to run and modify things, as does nearly every other app out there. Calm down.<br /><br />2) Yes, kayak.com doesn't search some of the low cost or budget airlines. That is why it is *your* obligation to find the flight you want. Kayak is just a tool to help out. Oh, and more often than not, kayak does have the lowest prices.<br /><br />Good app, I personally like the price alerts, flight trackers, and airport information functions, can't really speak about the hotel finding, etc.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a good Mahjong Game for the Kindle Fire HD. It functions like you would expect it to function.
B008G59IKO|5.0|The 2nd of the albums is another great one. With the similar sound of Uno, but with a more indie rock/alt rock sound to it (Think Neon Trees or Fun.), and is pulled off perfectly.<br /><br />If you heard about the song \\"Nightlife\\" and the collaboration of Lady Cobra rapping, you might think it is a bit odd, but they somehow pull it off perfectly.<br /><br />Just as awesome as Uno and I have high hopes for Tre!
B00992CF6W|2.0|common put the updateds up already mojang we all need the nether portal and melons and zombie pigmen cause its way better that way.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Don't think Green Day's political sound was here to stay. This new album brings back the sound we got to know and love in the 90's. One of the best songs on the album is \\"Nuclear Family\\", which will really get you sucked in.<br /><br />Very impressive album for the GD collection
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I love this game!!! I dont know y people r giving it bad reviews. Its challenging, fun, and 100% addictive. I understand paying for extras is sucky but u can beat the game without having to purchase anything. I recommend this game to everyone! Its worth a buck!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really struggled with this book about half way through... Just know that it will all work out and that you are learning this information to finish tying the knot!!  Once you hit the half way mark you will not be able to put it down!!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Hilarious!  I'm a pretty crazy guy anyways, but my 2 year old grandson and I had a ball with it.  Great app for free for sure!  Nice job.
0486409511|5.0|I took a Calligraphy Class and the Instructor recommended this book, just for having a reference after class!!<br />Great book for learning and for reference!!
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I love Diana Krall and own everything she has ever recorded, so I bought this album, too.  Day one.  But, I don't like Ragtime.  To me, modern music started sometime in 1938 when the last bit of Ragtime was wrung out of Benny Goodman's music and it was finally over.  Well, except for Jimmy Dorsey, who continued that obnoxious staccato rhythm for a while.  At least he didn't use a tuba for bass.<br /><br />Anyway, I listened to this album a few times because it is, after all, the great Diana Krall, just to make sure that old-style piano was still there, then did some research and ordered 5 Anita O'Day albums.  I listen to them and feel much better.<br /><br />I'll still buy her next album the day it comes out.  Until then, I'll just hope the next one captures the magic of her version of \\"Cry Me A River\\", which ends with the greatest fade-out ever.
0064400557|5.0|One of my Favorite Books as a child, we recently acquired a spider that lives in our mailbox- it took me to another place and time!! I had to find and purchase this right way!!<br /><br />Any child with a great imagination will love this story!!
1451608659|5.0|This book was a quick read that really brought you behind closed doors of what this gymnast and possibly others have and will face when competing at the elite level of a sport. Also reveals a lot of family and personal struggles Dominique Moceanu went through.  If you have followed her since you were little like I have, or are just interested in an Olympic Athlete's story, then this book is a must-read!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins introduces you to the world of the Hunger Games- Putting it down will be the hardest part- It will leave you wondering what happens next. Take it with you and read it on your lunch break!! :) Excellent Series for the young and old!!
1442359315|2.0|The book didn't stay on any one thought for very long before going off on tangent after tangent. When he finally did spend some time on the subject of his NDE (Near Death Experience) the book was actually interesting. If this book was re-edited and put into some semblance of a logical order and the extraneous BS (brain storming) deleted, it would make an excellent short story. Do you know an insomnia victim? Give them this book.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this app that is probably Rovio ever made! but I haven't played mighty eagle yet. So you should really get it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My niece loves this game!  Anything having to do with Star Wars and Angry Birds is reason enough for her!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book. This book has great writing. I love how Sylvia Day made the relationship with Gideon & Eva.  Both of them have their own issues to deal with. There are signs of how they should not be together but they stay together not matter at what odds. In this book, Gideon deals with Eva's pass for her and he does everything to keep her at a distance. She starts to understand more about his past even though he will not say much about it. I can not wait to see how the next book comes out.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I used to love these games at the carnivals and festivals! I am sooooooo glad some body turned it into a game for the kindle!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|You want to read a book after reading Fifty Shades..... this book is the one. I love the writing in this book. In this story line not only is Gideon have issues but Eva does too. You find out why in this book. Gideon on the other hand, you find out little bit about Gideon's past. I love the push and pull in the relationship.<br /><br />Great book to read.
B000YHG72E|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies.  It's been added to the rotation with Christmas Vacation, A Christmas Story, Home Alone, Four Christmases, etc.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I loved seeing the series as part of the PBS Masterpiece series and it is fun to have the DVD set so I can watch whenever I desire to watch it.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've had these for over a year now and I don't even bother playing COD without them. Get some rechargable batteries and start shooting fools!
B008VBYN80|4.0|Awesome game where you get to be a lord in your own kingdom.<br />Medieval lover's will enjoy fighting in battles, collecting taxes, and best of all, kicking button and taking names!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Not much needs to be said. All of the hype and acclaim was justified. Great performances by all of the key players in each movie
B008MG1E4A|5.0|When reading this book I felt like i was every soldiers mom. My heart really cried for what they had to endure. I think that I am a much more informed person for reading this book.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|One of my top 5 Denzel performances. He commands every scene that he's in like only Denzel can. The last half our is simply epic
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|it had potential but the ending sucks, the acting by benecio del toro was some what comical for some reason dont know if that was intended, if it had a better storyline and a good ending, i would have gave it 5 stars, i love drug movies
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this Bible App on every Android device that I have - phone and tablet.  It's easy to use and I love the daily Bible reading plans that help stay on track with reading through the Bible in 1 year.
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|Wonderful movie to close the stargate sg1 saga.  A must see for your whole family.  Guaranteed wonder and amusement once again
B009GESJH2|1.0|I know Mr.Ritchie doesn't do the same music he did from a few years back and i get that part.But when the 1st 3 songs have steel guitar in them and sound pretty much the same i kind of know it's going to go south from there.If you want to do a country album then do it just let me know.I swear i heard the same drum parts on the next several songs as well just a different symbol action.I find to myself if i don't raise the volume on any song on a disc then i know I am bored by it and frankly every song on here is just that and again they sound a great deal alike.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I like the ease of reading this book. She takes u on this journey with her and does an excellent job. I could not imagine how difficult it was to write this book. Jay ce is one of the strongest people I know.
0896762173|5.0|If you are interested in costuming of years gone by this is an excellent reference book.  It is an easy read and well written.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|This is a great book for women who are interested in World War II history. To see the inside of Germany through the eyes of a young Jewish woman who is believed to be German I found intriguing. This book was a required read for my Modern European History course but I have re-read it for pleasure because I found it so interesting. I tell people it's &#34;Ann Frank for adults&#34;. I highly recommend this book.
1572814136|5.0|Since I saw this first Tarot, apaxonei me, and now for someone who always buy me encomnda one, is very attractive
1419705849|5.0|As with all of the other Wimpy Kid books this one was a hit with my middle school son. He love the Wimpy Kid series and this one was no exception!
0738711500|5.0|Since I saw this first Tarot, apaxonei me, and now for someone who always buy me encomnda one is just fantastic!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I look forward to watching this show weekly. Very exciting and love the characters too. Hope it continues for some time.
0913866156|5.0|Since I saw this first Tarot, apaxonei me, and now for someone who always buy me encomnda one is just fantastic!
B007YA5NRO|4.0|Fuji supplied handbook very difficult to apply to X10. This Guide explains the workings of the camera in a way whch users can follow and apply when starting out with this beautiful piece of kit.
B004NS710C|5.0|Someone posted that this is pure escapism. That is true, the public safety, FD, PD and helos are pretty stupid but it was fun to watch .
B0091REZMW|4.0|like it so far. will have to play a while longer to really. know how it is.  have a great day
B0030MKGKY|5.0|Am a combat vet.  One of the most poignant things is the main characters numbness to death.  He is ; like a lot of us, more comfortable in the field than back in the world
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|A lot of bang for the buck, great way to finish up Thanksgiving !!!!!!!!!!!! the action all comes at the end of movie.
B0081FO2Q4|4.0|Very solid album, excellent lyrics, great production. It's surprising considering the age of Sheeran. One of those albums that really get you to think.
B00000F214|5.0|As much as I enjoyed the original, the BluRay made it better. Would watch it again right now, and again later.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I got this for my little sisters to play since they love MLP... I decided to try it out last night after I got it to see if I thought the girls would like it. Now, I'm 20 years old and I'm obsessed. It can be repetitive but it's still very entertaining!
1452101248|5.0|This is a great book not just for vegetarians but also for meat lovers and all the dishes I have made are beautiful and so so tasty and go well with a protein or just on their own I am a huge fan!
0142000671|5.0|Everyone should be required to read this book!  The story line never goes out of style.  Glad we purchased our own copy.
0385535147|4.0|The book as all books by Grisham, and I have read almost all of them is well written and the story unfolds in such a way as to arouse the reader's curiosity.<br />This book is good but he has written more engaging stories, such as THE FIRM, PELICAN BRIEF and THE RUNAWAY JURY to mention just a few.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I just wish the Kindle Fire had a two way camera.  I don't see how I'll be taking anything other than 'selfies' with the camera, so I'm sure I won't be able to use all the features of this app!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The concert brings together the great performers of the key roles in different productions; having seen the original on Broadway the year it came on stage, seeing and hearing some ot the outstanding actors/singers of two eras is a touchin experience. Great performance for a Great Musical based on a Great book.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I don't often review books (or products), but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and felt it deserved some positive feedback.  I found some of the material covered fascinating, particularly the information from studies conducted with patients as well as how marketers use their knowledge of habits combined with data and analytics.  The discussion of keystone habits has me considering what key habits I can change to have a cascading impact on other habits.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|Very poor vidio quality!  HD??  More like an old vhs left in the sun..  Not the first vidio I have streamed from Amazon, but the worst quality.  Distroyed the movie as it was bearly watchable.  Sometimes could not tell who the actors were...  Bad, bad, bad...
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I am not a gamer. I do however enjoy playing Angry Birds with my granddaughter. What I did not enjoy about this version of Angry Birds was that we were able to complete all the available levels in less than one day and the only way to go further was to purchase more...go figure, not even one day's worth of playtime....
B009CPES4I|4.0|Very good movie but a little draggy at points. Good acting,<br />which you would expect considering the caliber of the cast.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|now I must get the other books in this series because the story is on going and keeps me interested
B006YXTRHY|3.0|It's hard to make a movie as good as the book, but this one was the worst one so far.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I can hardly ever get the correct temp or weather<br />never coordinates with other weather programs<br />Hardly worth keeping this program in use
B0049GYXDG|5.0|I bought this used and it was in perfect condition. I was woeried it wouldnt come with thw sleeve that all of the diamond editions come with. But it did and there wasnt even a nick. Awesome.
B000NY12CI|5.0|the author certainly had a difficult journey.  3rd world countries are so male-oriented & it's good to see one woman fight the system.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|thoroughly enjoyed the celtic woman: a new journey--live at slane castle.  oh, to be in the audience.  this is a delightful dvd that i will play often. especially when i need my spirits lifted.<br /><br />i especially enjoyed the bit of choreography blended with the vocals for both the stars of the show and the choir.  as i work my way through their catalogue with my voice teacher, i have the artist in my head singing along which helps tremendously.<br /><br />now if they would perform in either redding, california or ashland, oregon so it would be easy to go and enjoy their performance.<br /><br />sandra a hood, dunsmuir, california
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|I am a huge pac man fan and also love racing games.  So I was extremly excited about this game.<br />Although I like the game, it is very hard to control the racer.  So after some frustration and swearing I some what got the hang of it.  But over all I really like the game and the graphics.
B00913P6G0|3.0|Excellent job on this CD by Mr. Lamar. Dr. Dre has produced another genius/great. I look forwrad to future work from both of them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written. Interesting presentation. Dark subject though. A little scary when you realize how easy it is to be duped.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|This is one of the best series that has come out in the past couple of years. The story writing is excellent and as each ceaseon progresses u are never disappointed.
0812984412|3.0|Robert Frobisher, the young composer in one of the Cloud Atlas segments, describes his \\"sextet for overlapping soloists\\" as having a format just like Mitchell's book. He asks, \\"Revolutionary or gimmicky\\"? I think it's gimmicky to no purpose. Starting a book six times, meeting totally new characters, I might as well have been reading short stories. I think David Mitchell was trading on his reputation with this one.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Loved every moment of this film.  It's true scifi like we haven't seen in theaters for quite some time.  Great cinematography, intriguing characters, and story telling that dares to not spoon feed everything to the audience and dares to ask more questions than it answers.  Quite similar to another landmark science fiction thriller, Alien!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|delivery.  i got this movie for my son..  he sure likes it.  the price was the best i found anywhere.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Typical Romance novel with no real value; as you read you can almost fill in the rest of the book yourself.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|While this book wasn't as good as the first I still enjoyed it. There were a few &#34;rich girl problems&#34; I could have lived without, but overall it's a great love story with some steamy sex scenes.
B001TXQN44|5.0|I was surprised & happy to have found this album again. All their best songs are there. Songs I've spent summers listening to. The lyrics are amazing, part of the 60's & early 70's. rebellious years, part of a generation's opinions of the country, during a time of great change. Songs like, For What It's Worth, are hard to forget. We lived our lives with music surrounding our lives. Good to know I can share them again.
B00190OHD6|5.0|this is a great movie and so worth watching with your significant other!!!! Hillary is amazing! And the friendships between the 3 women characters are very seet and very real
030758836X|4.0|Loved it; great &#34;who-done-it writer&#34;.  Would have given it 5 stars but thought the ending was a bit flat.  Will now read her other books.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I got into the show late. My wife and I started watching season 2 and decided we liked it and wanted to watch the first season before starting on the second. We were immediately hooked. There is no other TV show like it. The perfect combination of creepy and scary. There were several episodes where my wife and I just looked at each other and just shook our heads at the twisted nature of the episode. And we loved it. Can't wait to watch season 2.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|the game is realy fun but hard but expensive  i pay 5 $ al redy and im only on level
B007MDB6L0|4.0|This is for my Grandauther and was shipped to her place so I haven't seen the movie, but was told by her mom it was good and shipping was very fast.
B000GWE44U|1.0|with about 45 minutes remaining, the video began to stop.  It never began again.  We had company over to watch the movie.  Not getting to see it was very frustrating.  I believe yall should issue a credit.<br />Chuck Garrett
B00448SE4S|4.0|I didn't know what to expect before seeing it.  I'm a fan of Graphic Novels but didn't read this one.  I enjoyed seeing the unique take on relationships.  I really enjoyed it and have recommended it to many people.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|AWAITED FOR THIS BOOK BECAUSE I WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE FIRST AND i HAVE TO SAY IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. DELIVERED WHEN PROMISED AND A GREAT READ !!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Great fun.  Not the best movie in the world but an enjoyable experience and a good time.  Sure there are flaws, sure there are good times.  Just enjoy the ride.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I COULD HARDLEY WAIT TO READ IT. WHICH MAKES THE FACT THAT IT WAS DELIVERED SO QUICKLY A DEFINITE PLUS !
B007MB5OCE|2.0|To be honest I could not agree with most reviewers.  I found the premise unbelievable and the plot long and drawn out.  It was not worth the time.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I purchased this book on my kindle and I could not put it down. I think it is wonderful that he shares his story with us. It feels like it is not only a memoir but a testament of his life and it is very inspiring whether you are a rock star or not.
B00006BTCA|5.0|People can say that this album is pretentious, they can say that it rips off Joy Division(it doesn't), whatever, the fact is this is a wonderful album the whole way through. It simply pulsates with energy. There weren't many albums in the 00s or even now that do that! It still sounds fresh with every listen.<br />I can't even imagine how many times I have listened to this CD over the past ten years.
B0051UH6YM|5.0|Oddly enough, this book was very humorous while still instructing the proper uses of common grammar. I would highly recommend this book and enjoyed it very much.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|loves it . it just keeps getting better and Jessical Lange can do no wrong! i highly recomend this to anyone who enjoyed the first season
0547884591|5.0|Devoured it, and all the delicious food it helped me make in a very quick, logical and low-mess way. Before this book, I really thought I knew how to cook- long hours in the kitchen were just part of it, right? Turns out I was doing everything the hard way. Thanks T for savong me hours every week from here on, not to mention I now understand flavours for the first time, and all the other bonuses in the book. Juat buy it.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This is a gift, Christmas for my Grandaughter. She wanted series 1 but I found this series for her. It was a little more money than series 1 but hey what are grandfathers for if not to spoil their Grandkids. I am sure that she will have some friends over for a marathon of Big Bang

B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie was exactly what I expected:  entertaining, fun and on the corny side.  It knew what kind of movie it was, and it didn't try to come off too seriously.  Great fun and worth checking out!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I am a Twilight fan so it was nice to go online and rent this moving from home with out any troubles.<br />The movie was wonderful.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Our favorite band nails it on this-their FINAL concert...is the editing the best ever?  Probably not...that being said, I also have the bootleg of whoever recorded the concert on what appears to be a cell phone, and, to be honest; and I've compared the two versions at length...the DVD version is in one word...OUTSTANDING.  Whatever you do, order the deluxe edition that shows the final rehearsal at Shepperton Studios...they are so tight, it is unbelievable.<br /><br />I read some of the reviews that are critical of the video editing; and I agree somewhat, but disagree to an extent.  Richard Caruthers, whom Jimmy has used in the past, did (in my opinion at least) an excellent job.  No matter what, this shows the band in 2007 form, and they rock the hell out of the O2 arena.  You can tell they went to the extremes to put together a concert that their fans will never forget, and I defintely will not forget this performance...I wish I could have been there...long live the greatest band of all time, LED ZEPPELIN.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|it was very entertaining<br />The sentences flowed and kept the voice bright and interesting. I didn't get bored at all.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I listened to this a lot on Pandora, but finally broke down and bought it.  Glad I did.  Very sultry.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Even though I've seen it many times now, I still love the way Renee Russo plays the sexy siren! He's good, too, but she's the bomb! The story is fun and doesn't slow down. The vignettes with the psychologist where she's the same woman in the previous Crown Affair. I like the music chosen for the various scenes. The entire scene when Crown meets Banning at the museum. Perfect.
0547884591|5.0|By far the best out of the three \\"4-Hour\\" books Tim has written. I'm a quarter of the way through and can't put it down. Tim has already trained me how to consistently memorize the order of 13 shuffled cards in under 2 minutes (working my way up to the full 52), build an awesome bonfire that my family enjoyed for Thanksgiving, and my wife and I are making Osso \\"Buko\\" this week for the first time.<br /><br />Excellent book for anyone who likes to learn, not just cook. I wish I had this book in college; he teaches you how to learn.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|This movie prepares the believer for things to come and how family and friends will react.  This will be a difficult movie for someone who is afraid
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This show is the funniest show on television. Hands down. The actors are the best cast they could have chosen for this show.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really have enjoyed this game. It starts off easy so you don't get immediately frustrated. But it gets increasingly challenging so you don't get bored.<br />However, it has not yet gotten too hard.<br />Good for all ages.

B008BYXQJY|5.0|I've always liked Maroon 5's variety of music. I have yet to be disappointed. None of the songs sound the same. And the tunes are catchy enough to sing along to.
B001LF347E|5.0|I bought Merlin last year. It's now my favorite TV show out there. The show is funny, yet also has a serious side to it. Each episode is interesting and leaves you wanting to watch more. If you have never seen Merlin before, I would highly recommend giving it a try. You won't be disappointed. I own all three seasons on DVD and I'm counting down the days until the fourth season is released!
0547884591|5.0|A great book, I love the principale of taking the most effective root towards a goal, which i believe is one of the key learning's from every 4H book.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this show, and I love the DVDs. It is a great family show to where I can watch with the family without being embarrassed. The DVD extras are quite fun too. This is one of the best shows in a LONG time, and it totally different than anything else on TV!
B000SE0OYA|5.0|Product arrived on time and was the correct product for the printer. The product works great, would purchase it again.
1609611543|5.0|I got this book because I had heard so much about it. I have Celiac disease so I do a lot of research and chatting with people involved in gluten free/wheat free diets. I found this very interesting and well researched. Made me think about a lot of things I hadn't thought of before. If I wasn't already on a gluten free diet this book would have made me try it!

0786962984|5.0|This game is not overly simple, but simple enough to pick up quickly, or overly complex so game play takes forever to learn. This strikes the right middle space for a game with enough variety and differences to make games different. Very enjoyable game.
B005KP7EK4|2.0|I consider flashbacks a device that is often used when a straight plot line isn't interesting enough.  Even with the frequent flashbacks this movie was very slow and boring.
0385536895|2.0|I am a long time Grisham fan, and I read this in 1-10 hour sitting, but to me this was his worst book.  The ending did not logically flow from the rest of the book.  Thought about going back to see how the ending flowed from the earlier plot-line, but decided not worth it.  A dissappointed GRISHAM fan.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I've imported this game and it works without any problem here in Europe. What is left to say about Persona? About one year ago i bought \\"Persona 3 Portable\\" for the PSP just because of pure curiosity... a mixture of RPG and \\"The Sims\\"? What?!?! But when i started playing it, it hit me like a thunder: this is such a great, deep and emotional game, it is hard to believe if you do not play it for yourself. I still can remember every NPC, i can remember things they said and things the have done. The characters in Persona may be heroes on the battleground, but during the rest of the day they are normal people with normal problems. This is so special about Persona: you really do CARE about the characters. After i finished P3P i knew that this was maybe one of the best games i ever played. Now back to Persona 4: It is like Persona 3 but with improved graphics, more features, a new story and new characters. Simply said: i love it like i loved P3P! I really can recommend this game to everyone out there, give it a try! It is worth your time and maybe one of the best games for the Vita.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed the read.  An insider look into the world where national power and individual soldiers overlaps certainly makes one appreciate our military persons.
B003719GGS|1.0|I previously purchased The 5 Love Languages and thought it was very good. Wanting to learn more, I read about the Men's Edition, expecting it to be different based on what the summary said. But the content is 99% the same as the original, not just the themes of the book but the actual words. I, and probably many others, was totally mislead by the write-up about it and wasted my money. Very disappointing. If you already purchased any of the similar books, do not waste your money on any of the others as they are all the same, as I found out the hard way.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|We've all heard of romantic comedies but shoot 'em up comedies are less common. Hot Fuzz is a guilty pleasure for those seeking to escape a bad day/week/year. Laughing at carnage might be wrong but it feels so good in this case.

B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I needed a new timewaster on the Kindle Fire, so I downloaded this despite not liking Angry Birds too much. This is far worse.<br /><br />The idea is you build a vehicle to get the pig from angry birds to touch a piece of a map. You can use a staggering number of parts like fans, motors, wheels, soda-pop rockets, and others to make your pigmobile, and each affects it in a different way. The goal is to get the map, and also get a bonus crate. A third objective varies by stage: a second crate, not using some of the parts, or reaching the goal in a time limit may be things you have to do. Clear puzzle levels to open sandbox ones.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are so many problems it's surprising no one at Rovio picked up on it. The interface is honestly stupid, for one. You need to click on a button just to see what all three objectives are, and click on a poorly marked book icon just to get picturebook explanations of each piece you have and what they do. None of these flash or draw attention to them, and the early stages don't help too much in getting used to the game.<br /><br />This is because it's rather complex. The problem is that they use the real-style Angry Birds physics on vehicles that can completely fall apart. So your first experiences will be making something, not deciphering the single vehicle configuration that will clear the level, and watching your pigmobile break itself into pieces from its propulsion systems. There's no point in even being able to build the vehicle, because apart from sandbox stages, every single stage seems to require a very specific configuration to win. Imagine Angry Birds, but having to find the specific spot on the map to build the slingshot, and having to figure out how long the elastic is to propel the birdies just right: that is this game.<br /><br />It's not particularly intuitive, either. I couldn't gauge the weight of the vehicle, and it's really only trial and error that will give you a feel for how the various propulsion systems work. It's also harder to get your rickety vehicle in one piece over specific spots, and you don't get a good sense of what can break it, or how it can tip over. I'm a veteran gamer, and usually I can get some feel to the control systems in games, but this one had me checking out Youtube walkthroughs just to get how I'm supposed to get a vehicle with a single wheel, a box of TNT, and four soda jets even to move without blowing up in a bad way. Early, too-this isn't a case of late level difficulty creep.<br /><br />While they give you wide-open sandbox stages where the objective is just to get a lot of crates, there's a lot of problems with them. First off, they give you access to pieces you don't encounter in the normal mode till much later. So you have no real experience with the spring when you get it in the sandbox. The maps are also huge, and there's so many parts that the complexity is increased too much. Especially since the game seems to want you sometimes to break the vehicle to get certain objectives in the puzzle mode. It felt like they should have been unlocked at the end of the game, and not so early. Maybe simpler sandboxes would have been better.<br /><br />Graphics are okay, my loading experience was okay, ads were in between each puzzle, and were tolerable. The gameplay though was such a pig that I didn't feel motivated to play. Pass on this.ion systems work.

B006Z1XY7E|5.0|Gotye has a bunch of very unique sounds on this album. I initially got into him because of the uber-popular &#34;Somebody That I Used to Know&#34;, but you need to dig deeper, because there's just a ton of great stuff on here.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I rate the trilogy 4 stars due to the fact that the 3rd book was a little bit of a let down.  I think Collins could have squeezed at least another book out of this series.  I feel as though she cut corners by skipping from one scene to the next.  The third book was just weird.  Every time a significant event happens, the story is just glossed over, and the reader is eventually &#34;read-in&#34; on the details.  I loved the first two books and couldn't wait to see how it ended.  I read very rarely, like 5 books in 5 years.. But, I read these three back to back to back.  They were exciting and suspenseful.  I would recommend this to anyone who liked the movie and wants to know how it ends.
B00881VLCE|5.0|What blew me away after I was playing this for a while that you could download more puzzles so you could do more with the same program. And what I liked even better is their prices for some of the fancier ones were only $1.99 (which I bought one) and there were a few. 99 cent ones as well. But to even make it SWEETER is there are also a number of freebies and the quality was just as good as the paid ones!!! It's a puzzle player's dream come true if you dont have the room to set up puzzles. The sizes on their particular puzzles run from something like 35, 54, 117, and 216 - although with the reinstall they are showing 288 pieces (and I got one of their puzzle games separate from the ones I wasn't aware of being able to purchase through the game and that game number of pieces were way up in the 200s but I don't remember what. *shrug* Not important)<br /><br />The only problem I have with the game is it'll say that the application has crashed, force close but then goes right to the game. But other times I hit force close and it goes back to the homepage. That doesn't happen often so I'm not deducting a star for it.<br /><br />What I WOULD like to see changed is the music. it's a short running loop and after a while it gets on your nerves and while I have the option through the game to turn the sound off or lower it on my Fire, I find that to be a pain. But I love the game so much I'm not going to drop a star for that either. Just do something with the music with the next upgrade. I'd also like to see the option of changing background colors because some of the puzzle pieces are hard to see against the dark background or else make it a more neutral color so you can see light and dark colored pieces more easily.<br /><br />Running on 1st gen Kindle Fire while I patiently (HA) for Christmas and I get my Fire HD which is sitting in my house beckoning my name :)<br /><br />Edited Jan 1st 2013 - After receiving my Fire HD for Christmas, this was one of the first apps I reinstalled and I have to say I'm extremely upset. Not only were the free sets I had downloaded gone, so were the paid sets. That makes me mad because I had decided that since the program was free that I would help support them by buying some of their sets and I can remember 5 off the top of my head,two of which were $2. Now I know that's not a lot but when you add all the ones I DID buy it amounts to a bit of money. I have a PM into them on Facebook and since its the holidays I'm going to give them some time to respond. IF I hear from them and my purchased sets are returned then I'll up my rating back to 5. But for now, the disappointment of losing all my puzzle sets has caused me to lower my rating. AND if new updates come out and I lose them again as some people have said has happened to them then I'm going to drop my rating even lower. If you're wanting more money then  charge for the app and make sure updates don't delete purchased (or even non- purchased) puzzle sets.<br /><br />But if you're ok with the puzzles that come with the app and the free puzzle sets that you don't mind reinstalling after an update then I still give it 5 stars.

B008G12ERC|4.0|It was going to be hard for Muse to improve on their last album - but the more I listen to The 2nd Law, I think they have, at a minimum, equalled The Resistance. Can't wait to see what's next!
B001RHPJBU|4.0|I happened to see this greatest hits album by accident -- I wasn't looking for a Phil Collins album. But when I saw the song list, and I listened to the teaser clips, I decided what the heck! A lot of good songs from the 80's that brought back many good memories for me.  A whim buy for sure, and how can you go wrong for $5?
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game, fabulous characters based on Star Wars characters, but with their own unique talents.  Absolute must have game for angry birds fans.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I always enjoy their albums and this one does not disappoint.  I enjoy the orchestral arrangements and am not always a fan of choral arrangements or the singing but these albums rank above the other ones in this type of music in my opinion.  This album adds some modern instruments to the orchestra and adds a different touch, but I enjoy the variation.
B008BGNMZU|3.0|i listened to this CD three times before i write this review.  i want to be as impartial as possible.  but i thought to myself, the fact that i had to force myself to listen to this music three times so that i have something to write about ...there is something wrong about this music.  don't get me wrong, this is a very listenable \\"light\\" jazz CD.  problem is, none of this music tinkle my spirit.  some of the tracks sound awfully similar to Pat Metheny's \\"Letter from Home\\".  you feel like James, Mason, East, Loeb are lacking in originality.  overall, flat, unimpressive and just so so production.  not impressed.

B007THA4FI|2.0|Not a book for adults but a book with a childish theme written around adults. J.K. Rowling should stick to writing for children and young adults not the mature reader.
0307594165|5.0|to the Oregon reader:  I have to agree with you, although I do not think she would be writing this in her sleep.  I have to start by confessing that I have not read Home nor the last two of Morrison's novels.  Long ago I grew tired of her same-old-same-old. I gave it a FIVE because I do believe she is one of this country's greatest ever writers, in her time, but it does seem that that time may now have passed.  I spent years telling everyone who would listen, about Sula, my favorite of all her wonderful books.  The woman is now 81 years of age, still teaching, and much admired, but perhaps her time for writing novels should move to writing short stories, essays.  I am an old  woman also and well remember being at Sweet Briar College in my mid-forties taking a class called \\"African-American Women Writers\\" reading Alice Walker, Margaret Walker, Shirley Williams, Paule Marshall, Toni Cade Bambara, and Toni Morrison.  I was blown away by these women and the way they could tell stories, tear your heart out, make it all seem so believable and true, which it was.  When told by my English professor that Morrison was currently teaching at Princeton, I told my husband that night that I just had to go up there (from Virginia) and take a class under her.  Of course, there was no way.  Now further on down the road of life, I am still fascinated by the wonder that was Toni Morrison and will forever admire her achievements and am sure I would go a fair piece to be in her presence, even today, but I am less inclined to read her these days.
1451695195|5.0|An excellent account of a near death experience.  It provides undeniable proof of life continuing on the 'other' side.<br /><br />The book is well edited and very readable.
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|Waste of time and money. This film is boring . I didn't saw so bad movie in last two years
B003WQT2YY|5.0|The 'film' is wonderful!  The acting is great, and the music is beyond beautiful!  The three hours of viewing passes all too quickly.<br /><br />I've already recommended it to family members.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Not sure what to think of this film. It had a sci-fi/horror plot that didn't live up to it's potential. The film went in multiple directions near the third act, and the audience was just left confused for the most part. The few entertaining scenes are not worth waiting around for.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed many of Nelson DeMilles books, but this one I almost put down before finishing.  The plot was mediocre and the incessant wise cracking wore very thin.  I did not find him amusing.  Would not recommend this book.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|Not the most exciting film, and not the best acting... but fans of the book will still appreciate the film for what it is worth. The 1st half of the movie is Edward and Bella making out, and the movie slowly picks up about an hour into it when Bella's baby and her fate comes into play.
B003KK6GOQ|3.0|I found that because it was in letters written to each other it was a bit hard to gauge time passed, i think because i like to picture in my head the main character and you never really get a good idea. But a heart warming story just the same enjoyed it!
B004Q3SGNK|5.0|This a great film for those who love really good cinematography or documentaries. It's based on a true story, directed by the same director who did Slumdog Millionaire. James Franco's performance is stellar, and the story is incredibly inspiring.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|My kind of book! its been about 2 months since i read it and i still think about it, makes me want to go over and do the hike one day.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Have you seen the scary movies in the past several years lets see saw # 289000 freddie 200902<br />halloween #  same ole same old. This is good gotcha type viewing. Not for everyone I know but great to me.<br />I would recommend this to any one who is tired of hollywood s flops of scary movies.
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|A good read, the father time element was a bit different as i like real life sort of stuff but still enjoyed reading it
B0020M99LC|5.0|Great, exciting movie.  Have seen it before, and would definitely watch it again.  A great addition to the Bond repertoire.
B007QUUJMG|4.0|Good book kept me intrigued until the end because i thought he had autism or something. Slightly repetitive because written in main characters tone and attitude.
B003G4W49C|5.0|If you want to read a good book that would keep you glue to the page from the start then this is the one. My only complain would be that they don´t act or think likes kids, but I think that´s a complain that would ruin the book if I were a kid, since i´m not, i truly enjoy the book.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Very much like a soap opera plot and was fairly predictable but i guess it is not supposed to be so much about the story line more so the details.....
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have loved this book series since day one, and I love Percy! Annabeth is a great role model for girls of all ages!  And although I do like the new demigods, the original camp half blood will always be my favorite. One thing I don't like though, is Jason. He has always seemed too flawless to be a demigod. But all together I love this book and highly recommend it.<br /><br />Camp Half blood Forever!!!!!
B004WKI204|5.0|excellent love the way she writes and her sense of humor. hope she writes more if she still has some stories left!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|As they always do, Dream Theater does it again with this album. I really enjoy listening to it and it has some great songs.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Not only are the actors especially well-suited to the roles they play, but the plot is riveting.  I love the subtle humor
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|the game is very fun and quite addicting. in fact this is the first game ever to sick me into buying in game money. I have no problem with that as it is my choice. I am upset because there have been multiple updates that are downright crappy. For over a week now I have not been able to even open quests, let alone complete them. Some quests I cant complete because I cannot scroll in the planting or store interface and the number grows daily. I have yet to see an annoument on these issues for Andriod or Kindle Fire, but they were able to post something on iOS issues. I have not received anything other than a form response to my issue submissions with an automated ticket #. I know there was a holiday, but there should have been at least 3 working days since my first submission.  I cannot recommend this game since the developers do not seem to support it adequately on the Android platforms, especially the Kindle Fire where it is incredibly expensive for a glitchy game.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I viewed the DVD and found it in excellant shape and the movie as great as I remembered.<br />I plan on showing the movie to the residents at a retirement home during December.<br /><br />I am sure they will enjoy it.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Amazing what a weak director can do to talented actors.  Truly brought out the worst.  I wouldn't have watched this for free if I had a clue as to how bad it was.  Since I paid for it I watched it to the end hoping for better but there was none to be had.
B008XG1X18|3.0|It was ok but I keep get emails it was very slow to so I did not relay like pinterser
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A very good read. Entertaining and funny. Not as exciting as some of the DeMille books but a good story.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A very enjoyable book that is a quick read.  This is not the great american novel but will keep you entertained.
B0053O89KG|5.0|If you are a Castle fan season four does not disappoint.  The twists, the quirks, and the quips continue unabated as our two favorite sleuths go about their business.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Ski Safari is a one-level game but--unlike some similar game types (e.g. \\"Nuts\\" [squirrel going up a tree])--the level is engaging, fun and lasts a long time, allowing you to make multiple mistakes without the dreaded end-of-game screen.  Your character has to out-ski an approaching avalanche.  In order to do so, the skiier has to jump over little cabins, ride penguins and abominable snow men, execute flips and go over ski jumps.  The first time I played it, I estimate that I went three minutes before being overrun by snow.  Lots of fun.
0956010903|5.0|This is an excellent collectors piece for the Harry Potter lover in your world. The book, itself, is rather small, but that adds to the appeal of the item, making it feel both rare and special.<br /><br />This special addition came with reprints of several of JK's drawings and notes. I handled them as if they were museum quality. The item is currently housed in my Living Room curio cabinet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|After months of hearing about this book, I finally took a few days for guilty pleasure and loved every moment of it. Well written, cleverly planned and executed, and with enough &#34;justice&#34; for all readers to simultaneously love and hate the ending. A great escape book that will keep you hurrying back to see what is revealed next. And you'll still be thinking about it for days to come.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Excellent plot with many surprising and interesting twists, but Jack Reacher continues to be portrayed as an over-the-top, non-credible superman.
1936608898|5.0|I read reviews for a variety of paleo-themed books, and chose this one based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, and I'm glad I did.  I read through 170 pages of the book in one-day, and hope to finish it in a day or so.  I love to writing style, I love how they give just enough information to backup what they're saying, but they don't go into so much detail that I lose interest.  I like the relatively informal writing style.  And I am excited to get started.  I feel like they make it simple to understand, and easy to follow.  I'm glad I purchased this book, and based on the first 170 pages, I bought a second copy for my mother to read.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is stellar!! I am continuously entertained by the different levels of play, and interchangeable backrounds. Awesome awesome awesome!!!!!
0634022296|4.0|This is a great book to have, either by itself, or in addition to the complete scores. I use the complete scores to cobb together a solo guitar arrangement, an example is the piano part in Obladi-Oblada, which lies well on guitar. Then, to practice, I play that part as I peek at the easy-to-follow chord and lyrics in the Songbook.<br />I, like others have done, took the book to Staples and had them spiral bind it for about $10.00. I feel the publisher should have done this--otherwise the book has little practical application. If they had bound it more conveniently, I would have given this product 5 stars.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I must say I bought these for my kitchen because I loved the colors and needed new utensils. The quality is amazing. I even bought these as a housewarming gift for a friend and she loves them too. I'd buy these again if mine magically happen to disappear. Ha ha!
1451695195|4.0|I was very excited to read this book from his perspective.  Since scientists generally rely simply on &#34;science&#34; and not GOD.  His take on what he experienced and what he saw when he vistied Heaven was like any other that I had read before.  I was very surprised at the way he described his views, feelings, etc. while he was visiting.  Not exactly what I expected but I wasn't really sure what to expect either.  A very good read.  I was overall very happy with the book.
B0091W0JPE|5.0|This is movie to watch over and over again. How cool is Humphrey or Rick!<br />\\"Of all the jin-joints of all the towns in the world, she has to walk into mine.\\"
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is very funny, but not as funny as the others A good and “a quick read “<br />I will definitely read the next book
B006O2QNOU|5.0|I love this type of movies. It gives me a glimpse of what is going on in places that on the surface i wish i could be at but not and rather not being there after watching and realizing there is a cost for everything. Here is a quote from the Dalai Lama:<br /><br />\\"In the past attempts have been made to create more just and equal societies. Institutions have been established with noble charters to combat antisocial forces. Unfortunately, such efforts have been undermined by selfishness and greed. Today we bear witness to the way ethics and noble principals are obscured by self-interest...\\"<br /><br />\\"...and life without morality reduces humans to the level of beasts.\\"<br /><br />How true this movie demonstrates exactly what the Dalai Lama had said.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good story well told but not great writing. People who like historical novels will like this but read Fall of Giants first.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Talked about hopeless romantic, i thought my case was pretty bad; however, Mr. Gatsby really tops it. I feel much better about myself now, haha.
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely love all of these books! Brought them with me where ever I went, couldn't keep my nose out of it!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|So I am a 42 year old woman who , lol, thought that I could play this. Yeah right.... but however my 22 year old son loves this game. So great game, great graphics just not for me.
0345803493|5.0|Again I love these books! If you've read the first...Its a must to read the second and third! Great books!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I played the PS2 version of Persona 4 last year and still I eagerly found myself downloading this title on launch day.  Why?  Because it's that good.  So good I couldn't wait to jump back in and solve a mystery with my friends in Inaba.<br /><br />And here it is.  It's back, and better than ever.  We all know the graphics are much more crisp, but what actually took me by surprise is how much additional polish they put into the game.  Menus are rife with color and I love watching the opening cinematic everytime I turn on the game.  It's like a bag of Skittles exploded, yet somehow all of the colors blend well together.  And the soundtrack is spectacular, and yes, there are some new tunes in this updated version.<br /><br />One of my favorite new features of the game is the updated Shuffle Time post-battle.  Instead of randomly choosing cards, you're given chances to score multiple prizes and go for a Sweep which will give you further bonuses on your next Shuffle Time.  It's ridiculously addicting.<br /><br />The skill cards are also a great addition that make it much easier to customize your favorite Persona to your liking.  Want a Jack Frost with Bufu, Garu, Zio, and Agi?  Farm the cards and knock yourself out!  I recommend giving them to the all new NPC, Marie, however.  That way you can get the skills whenever you want for a monetary fee.<br /><br />My only knock on the game is Chie's new voice actress.  I understand they couldn't get the original back, and while the new VA does a great job, it's hard for me to shake the feeling that something is off.  This is probably because her old voice is still fresh in my memory from recently playing the PS2 copy.  Teddie's VA is also new, but I think he comes really close to the voice of the original, and it was much easier to adjust to him.  Of course, if this is your first time playing, you don't have to worry about this paragraph at all.  They do a great job, it's just different from the original!<br /><br />Overall, I think everyone with an interest in JRPGs and turn-based combat should play this game.  It's a unique adventure with amazing personalities, and you'll have an unforgettable good time!
B0025UHKNS|2.0|Can't really rate properly as the product was defected. But what I could tell was it was not just turn on and go. Went back to my old standby Garmin forerunner 305.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|This novel was harder to get into than the others from Kate Morton. Some parts were rather drawn out in the first half of this book, at some stages I was even disappointed. The second half of the book, however became so much better and even waited with unexpected surprises - so I'm glad I stuck with it (because I was prepared to do so by other reviewers). It is a very good book comparing it to other authors, just didn't quite have the \\"kick\\" I was expecting from Morton's other novels.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|it was awesome! you can build planes and cars and everything else.  Lots of fun. Definitely worth it and I play it often.
1451695195|5.0|This book presents new and important information concerning consciousness and the afterlife.  It presents proof that consciousness exists without the brain and provides another witness to heaven and the afterlife.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for proof of an afterlife or anyone studying the nature of the conscious mind.
0547884591|5.0|Not only the tips and tricks in this book will make me a better cook almost instantly, the life advice and the thought process behind how this man achieves success and his goals should be a mandatory read for anyone. I find this book highly inspirational and will look to use as many tips as possible in my life. If there is a book you will buy in the next 12 months that will have the biggest impact on your life, I can bet you that this would be that book.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|_ pretty fun so far working great on kindle fire...nice retro game easy to play. smooth transitions side to side and good firing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love this series.  The story, the location, the clothes.  A fascinating time period.  i even bought the book &#34;Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey&#34;.  It is the story behind the movie, a good read.  Anxiously waiting season 3.
B0085RZGYU|3.0|As a new reader of Mr. Baldacci I was a bit disappointed with the book.  I thought that the plot was slightly confusing and over complicated although I guess he made it make sense at the end.  I didn't understand the Camel Club at all, they seemed to be a disjointed afterthought.<br /><br />He did develop characters well and he kept the plot steadily moving along but I could definitely put the book down, not a huge page turner but I was entertained enough to finish it.
B00338QENI|5.0|With a compelling story of a woman who, though she died young, had a huge impact on the medical community.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Great time - different, but much like the Angry Birds! It is one that is to be enjoyed. Careful though - there is an option to &#34;purchase&#34; items - you may not want to let the younger set play without supervision so that purchases do not occur when you are not looking!
0307346617|3.0|First - do not expect a central cast of characters or detailed plot - the author is up front about this (though it takes some time to figure that out when you are reading the book) when he calls it an 'oral history.'  Essentially, and the other reviewers have already said this, the book is a string of interviews from various parts of the world, all covering 'World War Z.'  I made it through, but was disappointed that a central character to relate to was never really brought into play.<br /><br />Still, the preview for the upcoming movie looks quite interesting.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like pinterest, but it will consume my time if I am not very careful. There is just so much to see and learn. This app works very good.
B00466HN72|3.0|The movie was cute, but I was expecting better.  I watched it once with my daughter and it hasn't been watched since :(  Maybe worth seeing once, but don't buy it.
B000BC8STC|5.0|Excellent performance by James Brown. Good song selection, camerawork was good. It was great seeing him live and his back up  band was also good
B004G6009U|5.0|This movie is very cute and my daughter likes all the songs they sing.  The great part is - as a mother, it is also very entertaining to watch.  We've probably watched it about 5 times in the month and half that we have had it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|kids love it... it is challenging enough to keep them occupied... some even hard enough I need to help out
B008JFUUIA|5.0|If you think aca pella is aca-awesome, I absolutely recommend this movie! It is hilarious. Prepare to be pitch slapped!
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Wow, this is a great album, but I didn't know it for probably fifteen listens. That's when the subtle, understated nature of the melodies in the songs had sunk in, and I understood what I was listening to. THERE ARE NO CATCHY SONGS, other than maybe \\"Bones of Birds\\", in my opinion, but this is an album I will be listening to for a long, long time. This album seems like the natural progression of an older, wiser Soundgarden. The pace is a little less frenetic. No \\"Never The Machine Forever\\" here. My favorite Soundgarden album is \\"DOTU\\" and this album is like that, without the wonky interludes that SG placed in most DOTU songs. This album is very fluid. In particular, the drums and bass are excellent. The guitar is solid, but not noisy for the sake of being noisy. Cornell's vox are spot on. He's about fifty, and his voice sounds better than Robert Plant's at the same age. Out of thirteen songs, I love nine, and the other ones are good. Signed, a Soundgarden fan since 1988.
0425264351|5.0|In this the first Reacher book, Jack is passing through the small southern U.S. town of Margrave. However, the town has had its first murder in years, just the night before, and being a stranger in town, Reacher is arrested by the local police. He soon realises someone is trying to frame him for the murder.<br /><br />I read this book years ago, but decided to read it again, as I seemed to recall it being a good story. I was not disappointed! It is a very exciting story, with good plot and some particularly nasty villians in it. A great start to the series!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read all the books and can't wait for the next movie to come out! The acting is top notch.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Well made and very true to the character of Katniss Everdeen. my 13 year old loved it! She has read all the books and thought this was awesome to have a keepsake doll of Katniss.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the game,  but after the last update the game keeps freezing &amp; kicking me out. getting frustrated enough not to play anymore.
B000V6583C|5.0|Pure smash and grind an album built with nothing but energy. One of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time!
B0007Y08QA|1.0|I am surprised by the huge number of people who rate this movie very highly. It appears I am one of the minority who wanted to turn off this film after a few minutes. It's a very dark and unnerving film. There is little to like or appreciate about THE MACHINIST and it falls into the \\"What were they thinking?\\" category.<br />There is one point to be made in favor of the film. It's clear that Christian Bale is a fine actor and he put his all into his role as Trevor Reznik. Reznik is literally wasting away from lack of sleep. He claims not to have slept in a year. He has lost a dangerous amount of weight and looks like a walking skeleton. It is shocking to see Christian Bale in his boxer shorts with absolutely no body fat and seriously underweight. Yes, he does remind one of WWII Concentration Camp victims. It is beyond unnerving.<br />Because of his lack of sleep, Reznik is becoming a liability in his job as a machinist. He works in some type of machine shop but I don't think we are ever told what they are making. It's clear that the job is dangerous and any lack of concentration can and does lead to accidents. Reznik causes a serious accident and soon he thinks his coworkers are conspiring against him. A mysterious man named Ivan follows up. Strange messages are posted on his refrigerator door. Can anyone be trusted?<br />Here is the pyschological thriller portion of the film. Are his coworkers conspiring against him or is lack of sleep driving Reznik insane? We know from the beginning of the film that a crime has been committed and I was determined to watch the film to the end to learn what had happened. THE MACHINIST is long and tedious and painful to watch. Despite his skeletor looks, Reznik knows a lovely waitress who fancies him. Also, the prostitute he visits regularly, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, is clearly falling for him. Buy why? Reznik looks so seriously ill that he should be encouraged to get to a doctor.<br />THE MACHINIST does improve slightly the last 3/4 of the film as things begin to fall into place--even is ever so slightly.<br />I watched the extra features on this DVD and Christian Bale admits to literally stopping eating to \\"starve\\" himself for this role. The cast and crew seem to be impressed by his dedication. There is lots of talk about this movie never had a chance to be made because of its story. Finally a Spanish film company made THE MACHINIST with filming done in Spain. Barcelona doubled as Los Angeles--How they turned Barcelona into Los Angeles is interesting enough. The point is Bale risked his life and health for this film and why? Did it earn him an Academy Award or acclaim? He says he believed in this film and it was a film he would want to see so he was eager to play the role of Reznik.<br />THE MACHINIST hit me on a personal level as someone who two years ago had a medical emergency where I could not eat or drink for two weeks. The extreme weight lost and medical problems that arose make me very unnerved that Christian Bale would INTENTIONALLY starve himself for this role. It was not worth the risks but I guess that is a dedicated actor for you.<br />Here was film that unnerved me in every sense of the word. Clearly, lots of people liked it but this is definitely not a \\"date night\\" for \\"family movie night\\" film.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I was very disappointed because I was really excited for the extended scenes and special features. However, the DVD does not have ANY of that! Apparently only the BluRay comes with that, but it is not advertised anywhere that this is the case. Wasted my money on a movie I've already seen.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It is hard to download purchased mp3s to my phone. The web page design prevented fully seeing the options and buttons.

B008KE3960|5.0|I really don't play Kindle games much, but I sure like this one. I bought all the specials I could for as long as I could, and I am still playing this game.
0525953728|3.0|There was a lot of hype around this book; however, it adds no new perspective to the whole Bin Laden event.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I have read  a lot of books in my time and met characters in literature that I wish I cold  meet in real life. Some of the characters are Katniss Evergreen, Clarice Starling, Bella Swan, Harry Potter and to add to the list Travis Maddox. Beautiful Disaster is about the relationship that happens between Abby Abernathy and Travis Maddox. When Abby first meets Travis she quickly seems right through Travis. She knows he is a player and has slept with most of the school by the time she meets him. She is immediately disgusted with his antics. This begins the slow and often turbulent romance that definitely breaks the typical boy meets girl scenario. There relationship is not typical but if you love bloody fights, constant arguing between the main characters, and lots drinking, OH! and sex. This is the book for you!<br /><br /> I think that the character of Travis is intriguing to me because he is not your typical hero. I also like the fact that he is very insecure but it is also an annoying trait that quickly gets on your nerves about him. You don't doubt for a minute that he loves Abby but for a guy that beats up people so easily you would think he would have a better self esteem. I do agree like most people who reviewed the book, he is definitely not boyfriend material and seriously needs some anger management. I enjoyed the story but thought the ending was not realistic.
0736092269|5.0|I got Arnold's encyclopedia ages ago but is filled with the older exercises. This one gives great tips, warnings, and artwork to show what happens and serve as great reminders to what work. Take a look at the core workout and stretching books from this author as well.
B009DKFSUA|2.0|Pitbull is a musical artist that is the friend of the Disc Jockey; His music is built to be played snippets at a time. A whole song becomes pretty repetitive after a couple of seconds into the song. Another bad point is that Mr. Worldwide (Mr. W.W.) has to introduce himself constantly along with the introduction of who he is singing with...Please if you don't know who that second voice is, look at the back cover of the CD or just don't worry about it - Just enjoy the music!<br />I can't believe that Chris Brown was hired to sing on this album - Hell Rihanna sings with Chris Brown in her album - Some people need to be more appreciative for the luck they have....But to digress!<br />This album is full of segways to go into and out of songs; in fact I'm sure there is a DJ who would love to take on the challenge of making a mega-mix with all the songs from this album. Pitbull, mainly this album that I'm critiquing, should be the poster boy for sexually-transmitted diseases or what you don't want your daughters to run into.<br />I'm sorry and would like to extend my sincere apologies for Mickey & Sylvia, Los Del Rio, and A-Ha for allowing Mr. P-Bull to use your music for his Horny-Dog Album. In closing, Mr. Pitbull, do you eat, kiss, and/or talk with that sailor-laced vocabulary mouth of yours? I'm going to take a cold shower because this album makes me feel cheap, dirty, and embarrassed of this album.

Rihanna must be most definitely unapologetic and deserving of the Parental Advisory Sticker in regards to this album especially with the opening song being so darn lased with F-Bombs. This is another one of those albums that I was more interested in the pictures that came within the CD insert booklet. Nice Photos - Next stop, some smut magazine for full monty photos - EZ money and no real tour needed.<br />No Love Allowed is a rather nice ditty if you enjoy the UB40-ish reggae atmosphere which I personal don't appreciate but I'm not going to say that I'm a dissection of the average normal music lover. I actually got more enjoyment from the two mixes of Diamonds that came with the deluxe edition of this CD and didn't like the original version of said song which is the first single from this album. Rihanna needs to maybe take a couple of years to create a better more deserving album to be proud of and which she owes her fans from seven years ago!
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Love this movie, the story line is great, teaches a great morale that fame and fortune aren't everything, and to value your friends
0307341550|4.0|Sharp Objects is a captivating &#34;Who Done It&#34; story that brilliantly exposes the gritty realities of small-town life often swept under the proverbial rug. If your life has been anything but wine, roses and happy endings, you'll easily be able to relate to the protagonist and her journey for acceptance, understanding and answers. A must read!
B008JFUTT0|4.0|The music of 60's funk-folk musician Sixto Rodriguez was relatively lost to time, at least in the U.S., where it had been put on cult-status life support by a handful of people like David Holmes [[ASIN:B0000640AP Come Get It I Got It: Mixed By David Holmes]]. This documentary, released in theaters, should finally give Rodriguez his due in the states.<br /><br />The story chronicles Rodriguez's resurrection (both figuratively and almost literally) in South Africa decades after the fact, where unbeknownst to him he had sold over 500,000 album copies even as he worked in obscurity doing construction  in Detroit. Not only did he have no idea of his popularity overseas, but he lived an almost homeless-like existence while his would be royalties were siphoned away by greedy record execs and bootleggers.<br /><br />The film is certainly a documentary on Rodriguez (AKA \\"Sugarman\\", a reference from one of his songs), and his music, but is more specifically a documentary on several people within the South African record world who try to find out how this \\"bigger than Elvis\\" musician truly lived. Rumors had him committing suicide on stage, and they get the shock of their life when they find out that he is actually still alive.<br /><br />Some have criticized the film for being more about the \\"search\\" rather than the \\"man\\" himself, but I find this unfounded.  For one, Rodriguez himself is painfully shy, and it is obvious that there are some things that he made off limits in his interviews (his wife, certain aspects of his family, etc.). While his story is amazing, there is only so much of it he is willing to tell, and to a large extent only so much of it that was under his control (to a certain degree he is an innocent bystander to his life's own outcomes). The historical backdrop of how his album had been adopted by the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa is amazing and also had to be told.<br /><br />Director Malik Bendjelloul ultimately does a nice job balancing the man and the search for the man, his music and its impact on an entire continent. What the music represented and did was just as important as the music itself, and the film is not meant to be an autobiography or 90 minute concert video (although you'll hear enough to be inspired to pick up the soundtrack).<br /><br />In the end, this documentary highlights what can happen through faith and discipline when it intersects with random chance and the dreams of others. While the choices he made were done only to live life according to his own unique ethos, the surprising results still helped to shape a whole country. An affirming story for all who strive for something and whose efforts seemingly go unnoticed.<br /><br />Special features include a \\"making of\\", as well as commentary and side-discussions with Rodriguez and Bendjelloul. Some minor flaws aside, a 4 1/2 star effort that shows what happens when people become obsessed with trying to share greatness that they believe others have overlooked.and the search for the man, his music and its impact on an entire continent.

0547884591|4.0|First let me admit I'm a big Tim Ferriss fan and was excited for the 4-Hour Chef to come out. For my entire adult life I've wanted to learn how to cook but have been plagued by the poor material that is out there. After reading through the first half of this book, I've gained confidence that this is something I can actually do and that is exciting.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have so far, and the reason for the 4 and not 5 stars, is that many of these ingredients are hard to come by. I've had to put in an order on Amazon for several of the ingredients that are required. I'm very excited to try the first recipe, but I'm still on a hunt for the lamb shanks required to make this.<br /><br />I hope there's a user-generated site that complements the book because I still have lots of questions. Specifically I'd like to know what substitutions you can make with certain recipes in case you can't find the ingredients. I also hope that lots of people make videos of the dishes because there are certain techniques that I'm not 100% sure about and a video would help clarify more.<br /><br />Overall though, this is a great book. Well worth the money. A word of advice, you MUST get the hardcover version. It's formatted completely different from the iPad Kindle version. What is displayed nicely on one page in the hardcover stretches across 5-6 pages on the Kindle. This is coming from someone who is a e-book junkie and wants to save as many trees as possible. Get the hardcover!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved the conveinence and many different ways in which I could view the movie. The playblack was excellent on my Xbox. It was a great family film with plenty of laughs, a good story line, and touching ending.
B002JI94J4|5.0|I recently received the Blu-Ray, but this review applies equally to the Miramax DVD of \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\"  (In fact, the Blu-Ray is made from a video transfer of the DVD, as opposed to an original film source, and so preserves the digital \\"jutter\\" that comes with transferring film to video.  If you have the DVD, it is truly not worth the investment to upgrade to Blu-Ray.)<br /><br />As to the film itself, I would like to address the sound issues discussed by previous reviewers.  Yes, in an age where we are all used to hearing the digital upgrades to the studio recordings on modern sound equipment, the sound will seem muddy.  When a source close to the project said \\"blame Apple,\\" he meant that the Beatles' licensing company had insisted that, from now on, the soundtrack must be authentic.  The 5.1 soundtrack on the DVD and Blu-Ray does modify the sound (and previous calls for an alternate original mono track should be heeded), but is made entirely from the original film track.  When songs begin, the sound is moved off of the center channel and out to the left and right channels.  A very slight delay is added to the rear channels to provide a sense of depth, but it does not come off as added echo.  (The reverb added to \\"Tell Me Why\\" was also on the original soundtrack album - along with a good deal of left to right panning!)  Basically, the tracks remain in their original mono, and, more importantly, in their original movie mixes.<br /><br />Aside from the obvious single-tracking of Paul's vocal on \\"And I Love Her\\" and John's in the intro to \\"If I Fell\\" (which, by no intent of the Beatles, became the mixes used on the U.S. single of those two songs), there are other, more subtle changes in the mixes made to accommodate the film.  (Guitars are brought forward when the camera is on them, the drums when it moves in on Ringo, and so on.)  There are also sound effects which were lost when stereo versions were substituted (such as when John knocks over the music stand during \\"And I Love Her.\\")<br /><br />In short, the sound may not be up to the albums we listen to at home, but it is what we heard in theaters in 1964 (if we could hear it at all over the screaming!)<br /><br />As to the picture, the widescreen video does cut off a small bit of the top and bottom of the picture we saw on the VHS tape, while showing a silght bit more on the sides.  It should be remembered, though, that the film was shot and framed for widescreen viewing.  (Note how the credits are placed far from the top and bottom of the screen.  There is also no feeling of cut-off heads or action missed offscreen.)  Widescreen was the norm in theaters in 1964, and most theatrical prints were made to accommodate them.  We did not watch a square picture in theaters when we saw the film in 1964 - we watched the Beatles explode across the wide screen!  The square picture on the MPI VHS version was a nice accommodation for square TV's, but the widescreen on the current release is far closer to the original presentation.  And plugging in the stereo versions of the songs may have been a sonic upgrade, it was a move away from what the producer created.<br /><br />I wish that the Blu-Ray had been an actual 24/fps transfer from a film source, and I wish that an alternate \\"true mono\\" soundtrack had been provided - but all in all, it's an excellent presentation the original film in its original form.  Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Two, the story is about as original as it gets, no serial numbers filed off of other writer's works. Three, the characters are ever so real, their emotional interplay both realistic and challenging. Four, the underlying message is profound. Five, though the book is a novella, somehow Sanderson captures a great deal of storytelling with great economy. Buy it.....it will be worth your while.

B009H442DG|4.0|I bought this album because the artists are donating their profits to their charities.  I like the idea of these two old friends getting together after several decades to record an album to support worthy causes.<br /><br />The arrangements are mostly traditional, with one exception.  Olivia and John have some A-list friends stoppng by.  The guest appearances from Barbra Streisand, James Taylor and Tony Bennett are quite impressive.  Obviously a lot of care and effort was put into this album.  Olivia's voice is still pretty remarkable.  John's singing voice never was that notable - it has matured into a kind of husky, avuncular croon.  This is nice old-school Christmas music, great background for an evening with friends or family.<br /><br />There is one original song on the record, I Think You'll Like It composed by John Farrar, and it comes out of nowhere.  I literally double checked to make sure my CD changer wasn't playing tricks on me.  It is energetic, country flavored pop.  I do like it quite a bit, but it is a complete departure from all the other songs on this album.<br /><br />Considering that this is a charity album, the production values are very strong.  The new song is a keeper.  The rest of it is pretty expected but perfectly pleasant.  Worth a listen.
1416572295|4.0|I was intrigued by the title How to Teach Physics to Your Dog and checked it out at the library.  I never took physics in college or even high school, but my sister is an engineer, and I thought maybe I could pick up a few key words to drop into a conversation to impress her.  And I love dogs.  I can't say I can even begin to understand quantum physics or quantum mechanics, but I love the dog Emmy, and I might be getting the hang of quantum dog bones.  Obviously you have to have some background knowledge and familiarity with physics to be a fair judge of this book.  However, it does seem that the analogies used with bunnies, squirrels, steak and dog bones to help Emmy understand the concepts must surely also help physics students as well.  I still don't understand physics, but I like the dog and the interaction between her and Orzel so much, that I am already 3/4 of the way through the book.  I am buying 2 copies as presents: one for a friend whose son is a nuclear physicist (so she can also pick up some buzz words) and one for my sister, the engineer, who is also a dog lover.  Perhaps if I had had a teacher like Orzel, physics would have appealed to me.
1250006341|4.0|I liked this book and it was definitely worth the purchase & space it took up in my carry-on luggage on the plane (it is pretty big and hard cover).  It told me a lot of what I already knew from watching the show...but added enough interesting insights from Julian Fellowes'  life to make me understand where some of the story lines came from... For example, he actually was at a garden party as a little kid when someone yelled out the country is at war (a scene that i previously thought was over the top).  It would've been nice to have SOMETHING from Maggie Smith (one of my favorites) and a little more from the actors... but there is just 1 chapter at the end about filming, and it is not technical at all... just basic stuff.  I learned a little about the costumes, for example (some made, some borrowed, some bought) - but I wanted to know more - which would've been a separate book I suppose.<br /><br />The one thing I sort of found really odd were the constant &#34;interruptions&#34; int the text...you read along for 3-5 pages and then there's like a random 1-2 page &#34;special&#34; about the dresses or the hair or with some quotes from the actors behind the scenes...so it's hard to read it straight through because of these sections... do you read them at the end?  In the middle?  I've never seen a book that does this...even classroom textbooks (which do this traditionally) limit the callout boxes to 1/2 page and only maybe 2-3 per chapter.

0547884591|5.0|This isn't the type of book you read straight through and put back on the shelf. You wouldn't jump straight into the expert material in any subject before learning the building blocks, would you?<br /><br />That said, I can see where many people were somewhat surprised because it is not written in a familiar cookbook-style format. I think Tim Ferriss is abundantly clear that writing just another cookbook, listing a bunch of recipes and assuming a body of preexisting knowledge, is NOT what this book is trying to be.<br /><br />It is a book on learning. Cooking is incidentally the skill he chose to demonstrate his learning approach with, probably because food is something absolutely everyone can relate to. I love to read about how these learning techniques are applied to many different skills. If you only want to learn how to cook, skip the stuff that goes off in other directions and jump right into the cooking part. (In fact, Tim encourages you to skip whole sections if you're not interested in the meta-learning stuff.) I do encourage you to follow the basic progression of skills though as he does a good job of sequencing the skills you need to learn and building on top of them.<br /><br />The reason I say that this book is really like 5 (very well referenced and well supported) books in one is the way it is organized. Each section is basically a ~100-150 page book in and of itself. The first section is called Meta-Learning and it is what I read straight through the day I got the book. While it is the shortest section, the Meta-Learning section alone is worth the price of the book. Apply these principles to whatever you are learning and you will owe Tim Ferriss a debt of gratitude far greater than the cost of the book.<br /><br />The second section, The Domestic, will teach you how to cook better than the vast majority non-professional cooks. It walks you through it in a way that is not overly complex (assuming a body of knowledge) but not condescending either (as Tim is the first to admit, he was a complete beginner going through this). This section absolutely could have been a standalone book.<br /><br />The remaining three sections (The Wild, The Scientist, and The Professional) teach you to go off the script, refine, and perfect your cooking skills. They do build upon concepts from the earlier sections, so they might not be as stand-alone, but I know tons of authors / internet marketers who would sell each section as a $10-20 separate book. However, if you are already a somewhat experienced chef, you could easily jump right in and derive a ton of value from each of these chapters.<br /><br />Lastly, there are a ton of additional and valuable resources peppered throughout the chapters, included in the appendix, or even online. Just the extras alone deliver a huge value.<br /><br />What I am saying with this review is that even if you're not looking to become an expert, or even a good, chef (skip the last sections), you can learn a ton about learning and cooking by just reading the first two sections. If you're not into Tim's anecdotes, meta-learning, or non-cooking related topics, then skip those sections.<br /><br />No matter what way you cut it, if you are even remotely interested in learning, cooking, or are a fan of Tim's writing then you are getting your money's worth out of this book. I would bet you have paid about the same price for 150-250 page books that deliver WAY less value.<br /><br />If you've read this far, buy the book.

0547884591|5.0|The first thing that struck me about this book was the quality. This is a great looking book with lots of color photography, interesting formatting and excellent typography. It's a beautiful book.<br /><br />The content was also good. While the title says \\"Chef\\", the book is actually about how to learn new skills quickly. It should be called the 4-Hour Polymath. Cooking is the vehicle that's used to illustrate the learning concepts. I'm a huge fan of both learning psychology and cooking, so this book was a good fit for me. Like Ferris's other books, the 4-Hour Chef includes a lot of interesting personal experiments and funny anecdotes. There's a lot of material, some of which won't be relevant to everyone, but he says that in the beginning.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to pick up new skills quickly, improve their cooking abilities, or likes reading funny stories. If you enjoyed The 4-Hour Body, you will like The 4-Hour Chef.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to someone who's looking for a classical cooking reference book. While there are a lot of recipes and good guides to various cooking techniques, the book isn't a general cooking reference. If you're looking for something that's cooking specific, I would point you towards Alton Brown's Good Eats books.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I don't agree with everything Tim Ferriss says - let's get that out of the way. I read the 4 Hour Body and now this book, and in my humble opinion some of the more scientific theories about weight loss and/or strength gain are pretty much \\"out there\\". I'm also on the Slow Carb Diet (TM) - of sorts. I think it works, but not because of Insulin moderation first and foremost, but by reducing food reward (google \\"Stephan Guyenet\\" for more info on this).<br /><br />Why am I mentioning these 4 Hour Body topics here? Well, simply because the first chapters of the 4 Hour Chef re-hash those topics quite extensively - and if you've seen presentations by Tim on YouTube on either of his previous books, you'll find some of the jokes/pitches/shticks almost word for word.<br /><br />Now, I don't mind all that. It sounds quite negative, but put that against all the recipes and useful tips and tricks in the book, and at least for the kindle version you can do absolutely nothing wrong. Even if you dislike entire chapters - like the WILD one - that still leaves you with all the others, and the book is written in a way that allows you to jump between chapters, discarding what you don't need or think you don't need (yet), and those parts which you find more interesting.<br /><br />It's been 6 days since I bought the book, and it already changed my life in that I'm now drinking perfect (or at least pretty darn awesome) cups of coffee using the AeroPress, and it led me to discovering Nathan Myhrvold, and ordering his new book Modernist Cuisine at Home. Maybe I'll come back and update this review in a couple of months and add more experiences regarding the book (e.g. how the recipes turned out), but I seriously doubt that I would ever revise the rating downwards.<br /><br />So: If you're even moderately \\"geeky\\" and you're interesting in cooking - BUY THIS BOOK. ;-)<br /><br />P.S.: Check out this post of my blog if you like - it also mentions the book and shows some of the gear I purchasedfor my kitchen: (EDIT: I had posted a link here and didn't know how Amazon would react - it was ommitted. You can still find my blog if you go to my username + .com and then search for Tim Ferriss)
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I enjoy Disney movies in general. This sequel is in some ways funnier than the Shrek films. Antonio is as usual outstanding in his timing. I would recommend this movie for adults as well as children.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|For those of you who like a real challenge, I would highly recommend this game. Fast paced and just great fun. It will keep you entertained for several hours.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|The actions scenes are done very well. This film will appeal to men and women. There is plenty of great eye candy for the ladies. The action scenes are bloody enough for the guys. I enjoyed the storyline very much. I truly wish that some of the deleted scenes had been left in. Some of them would have added greatly to the storyline.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Fun to play for any skill level.  Would definitely recommend this game.  There is even a  quick bonus game to playin the extras menu.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Downy delivers his one liners like a pro! The story was interesting and exciting. The action scenes are excellent, and a lot of fun. I would recommend this movie.
B000031WBV|5.0|Rubinstein is a poet and he plays these pieces with great delicasy and poetry, beautiful and the sound is surprizingly good.
B008CJ0KI8|2.0|It may grow on me but for now I really only like the one song. Sometimes I have to listen to music a lot before it grows on me.
B000SGSU58|5.0|This is a tense read, that keeps you glued to the pages.  I like the critically thinking and analysis of the cases.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game! so much fun figuring out the solution. would recommend to those who enjoy a challenge.  fun game.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|I do not normally like \\"tilt\\" based games, but thought I'd give this one a try.  The controls are simple, and provided that your phone's tilt sensor works with the game, easy to use.  The graphics and music are both retro-tastic... assuming you like things like that.  I can easily see this being an arcade game back in the 80s.
B007TK77QE|5.0|...........and thats a good thing! Totally different and depressing but a beautifully crafted novel about the inner workings of a small English village and the social and economic differences that lie within. Its not without its humour but don't read it expecting to be uplifted, its dark and gritty and nobody comes out of it smelling of roses.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love HOG like this one. I really like the preset tasks. Some of the word descriptions need better translation.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is very hilarious...love the star wars themed birds.  Levels are challenging but doable......great, great game!  Bought it for my kids - they loved it!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rebus is alive and well!!!  Loved this book and can only hope Rebus and Ian Rankin are ready for another.
