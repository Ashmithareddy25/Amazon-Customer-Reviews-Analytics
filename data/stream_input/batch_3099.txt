B00GBCMW9S|5.0|just a new version of a classic EMINEM album.. Lyrically it is what you expect it to be. Eminem brought some old characters back along with the old school tunes. Bravo
B00003CXBH|5.0|The music is one of the most beautiful thing I ever listened to. It is a classic and worth have the dvd.
B0083DJUMA|4.0|Great book, data based and very easy to understand the new trends that will affect the future of manufacturing industry. We will see in the comming years if this is true or not and the way the change happens, but something is changing, thats a fact.<br />its also very interesting the way this changes started to happen. We need an update from Chris, im sure thee is a lot of data to add since the launch of the book.<br />Recommended to those that are interested in the trends that are affecting business today and will shape the future of it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I tried my best to avoid playing this game when it was the New fad but once it became available on the kindle I must say it is my favorite past time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoy playing and challenging others to beat score. Only complaint is game is not consistent with the devices that you use.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game even though it's a little hard to get used to at first. I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 7 but that's just me
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am having so many hours of fun the greatest little puzzle game ever...I am a candy crush addict my friends are not happy with me ignoring them so much..can't wait to move up the levels.
B00005R5G9|5.0|It is just adorable and well put.  I love it every time I see it and I have seen it over 1000 times!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This story is heart wrenching but makes me appreciate my own life more. Khaled Hosseini is a master story teller.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, It is addicting. so much fun!!! I have played on my computer and now so happy to have it on my Kindle!
B00EMGUR60|5.0|hear is the best album of the year  if you are a hardcore lemmy fan this is no surprise  not only is motorhead  just as intense as usual but this cd seems to be very heavy biker bluesy . with 14 good tracks it's hard to put this album down  my favorites.<br /><br />1heartbreaker which is a good 1st track that makes on get on a motorbike and start something.<br />2 lost woman blues.  this track  should definitely have a spot on sons of anarchy its very slow and emotional and makes a man roll up his sleeves and do what he has to do.<br />3do you believe .  which is a fantastic rock anthem.<br />4 knife  Now this is a boogie track  to hit the mosh pit in style (if that's possible)<br /><br />heck there are so many good songs on this disc there's something special for everyone.<br /><br />motorhead deaf  forever
B007SGM084|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES.....I HAVE READ THIS SERIES FOUR TIMES....I am waiting on Grey's POV to be fully happy!  If you are wanting to read a book full of Sex, Possession, Drama this is it.....with a little spanking now and then.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have ROKU which has annoying interruptions sometimes lasting  for several hours. That's why I bought chromecast but, It is not any better in this regard. Also iphone remote is additional source of annoyance. So, I got rid of it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome.. I love this game.. needs to be more levels tho.. it was a nice challenge. Not to hard to figure out. Got frustrated at times but over all its a pretty good game..
0764137433|4.0|Tons of verbs, all conjugated properly including past tenses and perfectives and tons of notes on the construction and formation of certain words
B0040I09RM|5.0|Wow! Charlie is Awesome! The rest of the Crew is Amazing..now to catch up on the rest of the Seasons
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I was slow to get on the Candy Crush bandwagon and now that I have started I must admit I'm not thrilled, having to wait to play is irritating.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Loved this book, freakishly similar to self's ups and downs and most women's often perilous journey through life.  Though happy ending made self want to hurl grated cheese and Minstrels as too perfect, in manner of Kate and William's perfect life. Otherwise brilliant.
1446249182|5.0|Love his writing style!  He makes statistics fun and funny!  I'm taking an Advanced Inferential Statistics course through Capella University and both his text book (recommended) and Rebecca Warner's text book (required) are used.  I completely agree that two totally different writers helps one to better understand statistics.<br /><br />Robyn L. Bartlett
B005Q1W10A|5.0|So ... since we &#34;did&#34; season one, we had to go on.  Glad we did.  The characters are fleshed out and you begin getting a feeling for what the life was like.  Entertaining.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I wished I lived in Stars Hollow!  Love the relationship between Luke and Lorelai. I can't wait to get the entire collection<br />The digipack was not a good choice. They were just glued to to the cover and all plastic dvd holders have come loose. I won't buy a digipack again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It so truly depicts what it's like to live with mental illness, but it's still a lot of fun!
B0018LMZOE|5.0|I heard EGBDF when it first came out in 1971. At the time I had just gotten into The Moody Blues a year prior. I'd fallen in love with A Question Of Balance, and didn't hesitate to buy Every Good Boy from the local record shop. I automatically put it on the turntable and by the end I had goosebumps all over my body!<br /><br />This album is one the most touching albums I've heard by the Moodies. It really has a serious-down to Earth tone to it, compared to the dreamy albums from the late 60s. My most favorite cuts here are Emily's Song and My Song. They're both among my favorite Moody Blues songs. Nonetheless the album as a whole is amongst my favorites of all time.<br /><br />This album really grows on you. If you have doubts at first, you need to listen again. I happened to love it from the start. It was unlike a lot of music that came out in 1971. Rock and roll was heavily dominating the airwaves back then and to hear this was like an escape from reality almost. I can actually call the original 7 Moody Blues records my best friends.<br /><br />Tracks from the alb are as follows:<br /><br />1. Procession<br />2. The Story In Your Eyes<br />3. Our Guessing Game<br />4. Emily's Song<br />5. After You Came<br />6. One More Time To Live<br />7. Nice To Be Here<br />8. You Can Never Go Home<br />9. My Song
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the title says it all! Great pass time. Love this game,  my entire family is also hooked. Cute animations. Try it!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game is awesome! I started playing and it was great . Saw the and loved it . Problem is that it restarted on me. I was on a hie level.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A remarkable story about alienation, mistakes and redemption. I learned a new language: the powerful, non verbal Victorian language of flowers.
0345803485|3.0|It was an okay book. Your typical romance literature. I found the characters to be kind of underdeveloped and irritating, however.
0345472322|4.0|The book contains thoughtful research and ideas that I've incorporated into analyzing and changing my own mindset for the better. Also, it has opened a window into understanding the mindset of others.
0345803507|1.0|I am about 30 pages before the end and I literally just stopped reading. The &#34;plot&#34; is so thin and poorly executed, I am just over it.<br /><br />The sex scenes are fine, but it's only so many times I can read the same sex scene before I tire of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just watched the first movie and decided to start reading the books and I started with this one. I'm really enjoying it.
0345803493|2.0|Oh, silly E.L. James, why are you trying to add plot to your smut? You do it about as well as a porn movie.<br /><br />The romance part is better, but the characters are underdeveloped.

B002VECM6S|5.0|What a sappy story... or it would be if it weren't true!  The entire cast ropes you into the story right from the start and doesn't disappoint throughout!
006224454X|2.0|I hadn't heard of this book but bought it in an airport because I wanted something to read on the plane.  After reading the endorsements on the cover I thought it would be at least entertaining.  Wrong!  It's boring, poorly written and silly.....but at least it's long.  I would welcome a mild case of amnesia to forget I read this dribble.
B00CNIDH7A|5.0|Train has done it again! These guy's are very good song writers!<br />I have purchased all of their cd's up until this point, and they never disappoint!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent sequel. King is still a master of his craft. Some of the parts were very scary, especially when it revisit old friends from the shining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I am normally a slow reader but I blew through this fast. I can't wait to borrow the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to see candy crush finally for kindle fire!  So far works good, just wish all my lives carried over from app to app
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is very cool and i like to play it all the time. Its now one of my favorite.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun but beware I have pulled all nighters with this game before it is very addictive you should totoally buy it though
B00004YA66|5.0|My most favority movie.  When you think you know what will happen, you get surprised every time.  Classic suspense and amazing scenes.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|I saw this when I was a very young boy and never would have thought that I would have ever have even watched a musical but when I saw Grease it was so fun to watch and the music was up lifting and happy. So to see it again at home was a real treat and I still love the movie!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I use this all the time. It's really convenient to be able to throw Netflix or YouTube videos from my phone to my tv instantly without having to load up either the Xbox or the Wii.<br /><br />My only caveat with it is that you are very limited as to what you can cast to the tv. As of this writing, you can only do Netflix, YouTube, and Google Play. I've heard they will be expanding the roster of potential casting locations, but until then, I'll have to settle with those three.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I'm so happy that I found this book, I felt very identified with it. Great and easy reading! Enjoy it!
B000W8HC8I|5.0|I still till this day have not left a review here and felt like it was a waste of time, Jordan Belfort is simply amazing... I literally found myself waking up 2-3 hours before my normal time just so I could read the book. I finished it in just two days and could not place it down for the life of me. This has turned me into a HUGE Jordan Belfort fan, I am now going to be reading his second book and am looking forward to watching the movie this xmas as well. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK !
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|It was just like I remembered it from childhood.  Now I get to share it with my kids.  Good stuff!
0156034565|5.0|This is a great movie according to my standards.  The story is good, the acting is great.  What caught my eye to begin with was the unique title.  I am hooked on this movie too.
B0034G4P80|3.0|Its a great intro to the series, I hate the ending, it is a weak rushed battle sequence in a joke of a small town ....did they run out of budget? I saw better sets in RoboWars !<br />Overall its a watchable film great adventures and introductions.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|The CD was in excellent condition.  I have watched this movie so many times that I have lost count.  If you have seen Anthony Hopkins in a while, I urge you to see this movie.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|Seriously, I keep playing these puzzles until my kindle battery runs out. The only thing I don't like is when it's impossible to find a starting point without using a hint, which happens more often in the 15x15 than smaller.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Another John Green classic-I didn't want it to end. His modern yet poetic love story is inspiring that I would recommend to anyone.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Just a fun, I had 2 hours to kill movie that you don't have to feel bad stepping away from if the doorbell rings.  Probably better then the first one. Sorry SLY
B00ANAC32U|5.0|I totally love it, perfect fit to my Nexus 4, and it protects the phone in an awesome way, a couple of drops, and it takes the hit.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I gave it a 5 star because the quality of the picture.  Plus the TV series over all was an excellent series.  I ordered this when it was a Gold Box Special and it was cheaper for me to order this complete set then to buy the movies 1990 thru 2003 separately.  Glad I did when I saw the quality of the picture had improved.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the Format description was misleading.  It implies Full Screen and Widescreen available.  It reads... \\"Format: Box set, Color, Full Screen, NTSC, Widescreen\\".  This is misleading because it is Full Screen for everything except the last movie collection \\"Columbo Mystery Movie Collection 1991-2003\\", that is widescreen.  This was not mentioned in the \\"Editorial Review\\" either.  I felt this was deceptive.<br /><br />I have the complete series set I had ordered for my mother as each season was released.  The last two seasons 6 & 7 were released in 2006.  This complete set, I just received, is by far a better quality picture and was released in 2012.
B00D48BSBA|3.0|Overall the story line was good and gripping but there were several places in the plot that I didn't know how the events come to pass. I would rate the book higher if the author tighten up the story telling and not leave gaps.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Charging while in the car never really worked for me up until this little gadget.<br />This one with it's 2A output from each socket, actually charges my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 while the GPS software is on with display on.<br />No longer lost battery, just for driving with the smart-phone on.<br /><br />It does have a bit higher price tag than most car-lighter chargers, but this one actually works, so I deem it worthy.<br />I must have spent about the same amount on a bunch of useless chargers myself.<br /><br />Oh, and although it states Andoird on one slot, and iPhone on the other, we're an 'all-android' family, while some phones are 'picky', both ports work for most of the phones.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Yes - its better than the debut disc featuring Mike Mangini - this disc apparently contains compositions by the entire group including Mangini and is their best album in a while. Its very tight. The songs - though sometimes shorter - are still epic. I can't get enough of listening to it. ELP fans will notice a Rudess solo that is completely reminiscent of Keith Emerson, and the final epic 20 minute song could easily be Dream Theater's &#34;Close to the Edge,&#34; the landmark album that sent YES into the stratosphere way back in 1972 - again with a Rudess solo reminiscent of the Rick Wakeman creation in Close to the Edge. I can't wait for the tour - this is music at its best and I can't wait to see it live.
B0000X61VE|5.0|Only because I used to do this workout years ago do I know that this workout is awesome. If I was looking to buy this for the first time based on other buyer reviews I would have decided not to buy this. For all those saying that this isn't a good workout you must be doing it wrong or your lazy and didn't want to put in the hard work to complete this workout. Cindy Crawford has my respect this workout kicks your butt and I love it. I bought this years ago on VHS but over the years I just assumed that because it was made so long ago it wouldn't be offered on DVD or blue ray. I was pleasantly surprised to see it is still being made and available on DVD. No one had to tell me twice I snatched it up and now I'm that good sore from having experienced a good workout. This is the workout I immediately go to when I can't make it to the gym.
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|I have loved Donna Summer from the very beginning - when I was in a disco in the mid 70-s and they stopped the music to announce there was a new singer from Germany and they were going to play her new 20 minute dance tune, &#34;Love to Love you Baby...&#34; I was completely enthralled and never looked back. As each year went by, Summer just got better and better and indeed crossed over from disco to pop and carried on... Her voice was second to none - and between her writing - and the producers she worked with, earned her DIVA title with much deserved stars and exclamation points! THIS album is somewhat disappointing in that the so called &#34;dj's&#34; and &#34;remixer's&#34; become the focus and Donna's voice and/or the particular song being remixed become second place. Consequently you have an album with versions of her songs that leave you wanting to hear more of the original melodies and MORE OF DONNA'S VOICE! I have no interest in these dj and remix guys - I love Donna! Needless to say, the two best songs on the album are the Giorgio Moroder produced &#34;Love to Love you Baby,&#34; and the Summer/Moroder collaboration :&#34;La Dolce Vita.&#34; Hey Giorgio, anything new coming from you???!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|Dr. Panda's Airport is a great app.  My three kids love to play this game.  They are learning how to match, number recognition, and so much more all while having fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy Kindle Fire finally got it. So addictive. My husband hates that I have it. Lol but I love it! :)
B008JFUPFI|1.0|This movie is boring. The grand finale is the same thing repeatedly; smash the bad guy through the wall. If Batman was there, he'd have slapped Superman upside the head and told him to use his brain. Sitting in the movie theater, I daydreamed about Batman coming in and saving the day, because I was bored.<br />Kal's mother gets in minute of coolness, before she's returned to the same weeping woman watching her kid leave that she's been in all other Superman incarnations. Lois gets a few bits of being interesting, tracking down the elusive Clark Kent when nobody else has even noticed him, and then she's throwing herself on him. There is not chemistry between them, no reason for for her to suddenly fall in love with him, except it's scripted.<br />In the comics and other incarnations, Superman had a sense of humor, and a brain. This movie robs him of both, but does manage to get some product placement in.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app.  I've used it for awhile and its worked great.  It does what it says and it makes my kindle run faster.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantastic book. Friends have recommended it for years. They were right. I could not put it down. Can't wait to see the movie
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Never lags a little slow starting up other than that is great kids love it and I even catch myself playing it a lot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE IT MY SISTER AND BROTHER LOVE IT AND EVEN MY FRIENDS LOVE IT AND IT IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I don't like the outdoors.<br />I don't hike and I don't camp.<br />I was never a hippie.<br />But I loved this book!<br />It is well written.  It flows quickly.<br />There is drama, there are tears, there is humor.<br />She does not overdo the description of the scenery.<br />She learns and she grows.<br />It is a metaphor for all of us who have made mistakes,<br />learned to walk our own path and come out on the other side.<br />Well done!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|The novel is beautifully written and executed.  The theme of amnesia and never remembering your past resonates so strongly.  As individuals without memories we have little to value and are vulnerable.  A great read!
B00EKR61FM|1.0|a)As a gift for a fan who doesn't own the movies, or (b) for yourself if you don't already own them, or (c) if you only own, at most 3 out of 5, or (d) if you're wanting to upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray, this is a good deal.  In other words, the extras and the packaging are just not worth it.<br /><br />I have all the Blu-rays already and bought this for the hyped-up extras.  Absolutely not worth it.  It's really only second-rate webcasts and fan stuff I wouldn't cross the street to get free, and star interviews conducted by dopes and non-professionals.  Embarrassing.  I guess I'm surprised Lionsgate put the thing out with this little meat on the bone.  I really shouldn't be surprised.  They're just milking the cash cow.<br /><br />I won't buy any more Twilight stuff until they re-edit BD1 and BD2 into ONE movie with an hour of additional footage.  That I'd pay for.  Heck, I'd pay for ALL the movies edited with substantial dropped footage--not just deleted and extended scenes we already saw.<br /><br />BTW, I'm a huge Twilight fan, just not interested in being fleeced.  Which I feel this is...
B00B2GK4KW|4.0|I love the 'idea' of this punch but at times it is difficult to use.  I've recently bought another punch pattern and for some reason, the larger of a circle you make the pattern comes out different and doesn't line up correctly.  Also, when you press down to make your punch if you don't line it up right you will dull the metal and it will not cut neatly with future punches.  I bought the other punch pattern at a craft store and I was able to exchange it due to the dulling of the metal (I've only had it for 2 days).  This product gives me a headache when I use it but at the same time, I love it.  I love the idea and I love the end product......just don't look too closely at;  you'll then see where the metal doesn't cut it smoothly and it looks like there are 'fuzzies' everywhere.  If you have used this, then you will know what I am talking about.  I gave it a nice 4 star only because I love the whole idea of it.  If the end result of the punch looked horrible, I would then give it a 1 star.
B00633W614|5.0|Excellent!  The character development in the entire series is very well done.  It was hard to put this book down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This app is very much worth the money. I was totally engrossed from the moment I began. This game is challenging as well as intriguing. I am anxiously awaiting the next app!  Make sure to think outside of the box!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I have always liked movies about the Roman Empire, and I was enthralled by this one when I first saw it in 1951 at the age of eighteen. I was thrilled when I saw they had made a two-disc special edition, but was disappointed that there was no mention of English subtitles in the specs. I am now 80 and have a hearing loss, so I do not buy movies that don't English subtitles. I'm hoping that the movie has subtitles and you just didn't put that info in the specs. If I'm right, let me know and I will buy it immediately.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Everything was great but Tris... i was so sad. It was kinda a disappointment to me because I wanted Their future to continue. I wish it could have ended a different way
B008602KQI|4.0|The concept of this movie is very unusual, and may represent a better way for the world to survive than one war after another. I am disappointed that my once great peace-loving country, which entered wars after being attacked or honoring treaties with allies who had been attacked, is now starting wars under the guise of stopping communism or stopping terrorism, the results of which have been disastrous to our economy and to the deaths, injuries, and destruction they create without any significant gains.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Thought I was going to listen to some of my songs in my favorites, yeah won't let me scroll down through my other songs, yeah you get to listen to some music that you can't listen to on the web but what's the point if you can't listen to your favorites? I think they have a lot of things they need to fix. Which is why I am deleting this app. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Excellent cast, excellent story, excellent acting. When you have a great screenplay and Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, and Dev Patel being directed by John Madden, it's going to be good.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much, as I feel that it explained to extroverts how us introverts feel and work in social situations.  I would have liked to see some group work that extroverts and introverts could do together to get a better understanding of one another.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|For much of this book I was already planning a mediocre review, at best. More than once I almost gave up. The book is well done, funny (actually, laugh out loud funny) in places, & heart wrenching in others. Yet it had a slowness, an ordinary sense that plagued it. I am however so glad that I did not give up on it. In the final third, we begin to see that the struggle & almost drudgery of the stories uphill climb, crests & begins a rapid, heart pounding descent into the valley of a beautiful, suspenseful ending that holds you wrapt. It was at that moment I saw McKenna's brilliance. The slow, ordinary plodding of the plot wasn't poor design, it was BY DESIGN, as you experienced the emotion of the characters, developed so well you entered upon their lives. You experience their story, a dull, ordinary seemingly pointless lied, peppered only by shameful memories of pain & worthlessness until, as the stories intertwine, a victorious hopefulness is found. However, in the spirit of classic tragedy, will it be too late? You find yourself racing to the ending to find out. Examining adoption, abandonment, abuse, the sadness that lies behind seemingly perfect existences, & the hopeless feelings of emerging from a painful past into an ordinary existence McKenna has written an excellent, human tale on par with &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; to name a well known example.
0399255370|5.0|Absolutely fantastic and funny book! A totally unique twist on a kids book! You'll never look at crayons the same again, lol! My kids love this book! Very creative and cute idea, with really fun illustrations! Same author (Oliver Jeffers) as another of our kids' favourites about the boy who loved stars...I highly recommend for kids of any age...adults too!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting game love love love I give a five star rating can't stop playing it.<br />Just try playing it you will get addicted too.
0877180121|5.0|This is, hands down, the best book to teach a person to learn to play the piano, whether child or adult. I use this one and the next one in the series, before starting with the Schaum series. I use in conjunction with the John Schaum notespeller, level 1, and have had success in teaching piano for 20 years now. I highly recommend this book, as well as Part 2, as a great foundation for learning to play the piano. Perfect mix of theory, technique, and fun, with whimsical characters and fun activities throughout the book. Some well known songs are mixed throughout...highly recommend!
B00A0SICYI|5.0|Timeless movie. Singing, dancing, magic, and cars. The whole family loves this movie. One of our favorites that you're sure to love too.
B004TACMZ8|1.0|This is completely unable to reliably locate studs, even in a simple sheetrock wall, let alone a plaster on lathe wall. I tested it on a wall that is open on one side to provide \\"truth\\" and was extremely disappointed to find that the center was often found off by more than half an inch. This makes the device essentially useless. What is worse, it often failed to find the stud at all.<br /><br />UPDATE: I returned this scanner and bought a Zircon. The Zircon performed perfectly on the \\"wall of truth\\" and was accurate to better than a quarter inch. And cost less. Bosch stuff has been a bit of a disappointment recently, as I've had problems with a few of their products. They aren't made in Germany, and I'm starting to wonder exactly what I'm getting with Bosch for the extra money besides the false insinuation of a German made product.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I could really identify and relate with Ender Wiggins. Why? Because I AM Ender. See my full review at [...]
055338595X|1.0|I ordered the 5 book PAPERBACK set on October 12, 2012 and got the first 4 pretty quickly. I just got the 5th book and it is in MASS PAPERBACK which is 2.5 times the size of the 4 books I ordered over a YEAR AGO! I sent this one back and they reshipped the same damn book back, NOT the regular PAPERBACK LIKE THE 4 OTHERS ON MY SHELF!  Why can't I get what I originally ordered and why would you send me the same damn thing back that I just complained about?
B00EKHE1JA|5.0|Striker is an excellent model of the robot from the movie. Really the only thing that gave me pause is the hands and the painting accents.<br />All of the pictures I have seen of Striker have open hands and gold highlights.  Mine came with fists and silver highlights. I have not been able to find if this is indicative of a manufacturing change or if their are variants. It may just be too soon to know yet.
B005LAII0I|4.0|I enjoy this movie. It's light hearted without being mean and the story keep you interested while it moves along. Julia, Lily, and Nathan all give enjoyable performances. It's worth having in the home library when you want a funny relaxed movie.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|A happy bouncy feeling good song. Im certain it is one that most people got tired of hearing repeatedly on the radio, but for me, it was the summer song and I would always sing along. Few songs ever cause me to have such a reaction. Its a happy song to lighten the mood. As such its wonderful and always does.<br />This is the banjo of songs. You just can not be depressed with a banjo. its physically impossible.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|I just love Sarah's voice and style. I'm very happy with this album, take a listen to the sample tracks and pick up a copy of your own.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been addicted since Day 1!  Don't know what I will do when it's done.  Awesome and each level better than the last!  Keeps my brain motivated and craving more!
B00ERIUO02|4.0|Another great album by Katy Perry, just like the others it has a high replay to ignore ratio (many albums I buy I only really listen to a few tracks on regular rotation, over half the songs on this album have been added to my general playlist).
B0013F1D02|4.0|Overall a pretty good movie. Cast was well put together, story was interesting, and the script wasn't too shabby.<br /><br />I'd recommend to anyone that hasn't seen this yet. Good thing for Prime or I wouldn't have seen this film which I'm quite surprised.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books.  This is no exception.  Be sure you have time to read it as you won't feel like putting it down once you start.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Was looking for a simple calculator and this application is it....so far it is fine and easy to use.  Great for kids too.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Love everything Ken Follett has ever written.  Great book.  Will follow up and read all books of the Trilogy.  Exciting.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|i love this game but on level 3-1 you fall  of before you can move  .<br /><br />any solutions? please comment
B00471TLZS|4.0|Even after all these years, the movie still has heart and horrors and wonder in it. Too bad they couldn't do the same for the sequels.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is good, but you could get bord of the game  easily if you play the game for a long period of time
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I always thought this game looked a bit on the lame side, until I actually tried it.  It's similar to Temple Run, in the fact the goal is not to win but survive as far as possible.Unlike Temple Run, our hero is fully customizable, from the jetpack to the power-ups to his outfit (knight's helm and purple dress, anyone?).  It's also a side-scrolling game, which you don't see much anymore.  WHY ARE YOU STILL SITTING THERE?  GO MASH THAT BUY NOW BUTTON ALREADY!
B0068AWQQ2|3.0|Not to bad...it was a pretty good horror movie. At least it made sense and wasn't lame. Collin Ferrell is hot in anything.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really didn't like the end I wish that it would be more into detail about Christian proposal to Ana. Over all I liked the whole book.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Wow...I love scary movies. Lately so many are cheesy. This one actually had a story line and kept you interest the whole time.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This album is definitely not for people who like generic, run of the mill rap. If you like hearing guys talk about how rich they are, how many girls they bang, and how big their rims are, this isn't for you. If you like Lil Wayne, Kanye, Rick Ross, etc, this isn't for you.  As with most Eminem albums, you have to listen to multiple times to wrap your head around all of his lines and word play. He has an anger/hunger to let people know he's still on top of his game. As a life long Eminem fan this is what I wanted to hear from him at this stage in his career.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|I have NO CLUE WHY PEOPLE HAVE GAVE THIS MOVIE GOOD RATINGS. This movie was not the worse horror movie I have watch but it wasn't go either. I can't believe the Evil Dead in 1978 got out of 4 stars a 3.5. THAT IS A JOKE!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love it, but wish they would hurry up already and make their SDK publicly available, and add streaming local content.  They also need to add back in a way to get root on the device since they indicated they supported the idea of the hacker community running with this.  This device has the potential to become the next &#34;Kinect&#34; of hackability and use cases if they'd only open it back up!!  Once they do those 3 things (which I believe will very likely occur) I'll add my last star.  Yes, I'm holding my star hostage, deal with it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|LOVE THIS APP...if it didn't start force constantly.  every time I open it. have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. unable to play now... : (  PLEASE FIX!
B00EKR61FM|5.0|I LOVE HOW THIS SET IS PUT TOGETHER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WORRYING ABOUT SCRATCHING THE DISCS WHEN TAKING OUT OF THE CARD BOARD BOOK IT'S IN. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE MADE THAT A LITTLE DIFFERENT, BUT OVER WALL IT ROCKS! I LOVE HAVING THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THE BEAUTIFUL PICTURES!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game and was surprised how addicted I became. Playing only free games and enjoying it. It does get frustrating when you run out of lives and have to wait to play for free but that's the only downside. Fun for all ages.
B00992CF6W|5.0|they need a new update its been like since June they haven't had a update so they a update but its a great app its worth you money so get it
159562015X|1.0|I purchased this book &#34;NEW&#34;.  It is a book that is personal to the reader who buys it.  It has a page that gives a personal code that is unique and special to that book.  With this &#34;personal code&#34; the reader is able to go online and get their own &#34;strength survey&#34; and if that personal I.D. has been taken the value is of no use to the reader.  I actually emailed Amazon and expressed my displeasure for receiving a USED book when I purchased a NEW book and I have not received any response.  Totally disappointed!<br />This book is so important if you are purchasing it....GO buy it at your local bookstore.  Do not trust this website.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I got to hear Aslan speak, and I wanted to read his book first.  He has an interesting take on the subject, but I had read most of his theories before.  He is a charming speaker and a good salesman for his book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read! Couldn't put it down. I myself have lost a child and this book shows just how intense that horrifying grief can be and how intense many years later. It is also a good depiction of what forgiveness can accomplish. It did a great job of giving you a feeling on so many emotions and how people deal with those differently. Definitely recommend.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Great movie but my only complaint was a small glitch that skips over a scene before the big battle. maybe my copy has that small defect but it's annoying.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|I got the game but it's not working because it sees someing that I don't know but fix it kindle fire.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Jupiter's Cock! this is the Best show Ever!! too bad the series is over but hey all good things must come to an end. This was the perfect ending to a perfect show.
B006WMILQU|5.0|This is a classic adapted from classic literature. I think it is Henry James. Story line is still good. Look into it!
B008OTTSX4|5.0|.Excellent bands doing some excellent versions of the Greatest Band that defined hard rock. Even Sammy got in on the action. The flaming lips....ehhh i had to by pass their version. to freaking weird.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is the best hunter game I have ever played. I would give it 5 stars but I can't update and get region 5. But other than that it's rocks. Number 1 with me
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Bought it but cannot load it on my kindle. Or at least if it did down load I can not find it anywhere.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is VERY addicting! It's SO MUCH FUN. And even though you're wait g things, it isn't very gory at all! I definitely recommend this game! I love it!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Had a hard time finding an app to help falling asleep. Love it. Works great every time. Couldn't sleep at night with out it
B00BWQW73E|1.0|I am writing this review because I have first-hand knowledge and a bit of context that I hope will help readers interpret this book.<br /><br />I was in the room when the author pitched us the idea for this book.  I helped the author organize and schedule his interviews with Amazon executives and a few others.  Over the time the author was writing the book, I met with him numerous times and asked how things were progressing, and if there was anything he needed to verify with us.  On multiple occasions, I requested the opportunity to fact-check portions of the book and was repeatedly declined, other than a few checks on exact quotes.<br /><br />I was surprised to read the customer review by Mr. Kaphan that says \\"...I was allowed to read a draft of the chapter which covered the time I was there...\\" After reading that, I spoke to the author and asked why Mr. Kaphan received different treatment than Amazon.  Mr. Stone explained that Mr. Kaphan was insistent and that Mr. Kaphan is the only one who received an excerpt in advance.  I reminded the author that I too had been insistent.  He agreed, but said that we would have wanted to see the whole book, and he couldn't do that. I assure you that we would have settled for reviewing certain excerpts.<br /><br />Mr. Kaphan says in his review that he \\"...offered a number of corrections, some of which Mr. Stone was able to incorporate.\\"  We were not provided this opportunity and that is unfortunate because we could have helped.  In my view, this is an unbalanced treatment of the essential fact-checking process for a non-fiction book.<br /><br />Readers might rightly wonder why Amazon did not do more to review the book in advance.  As I hope my review makes clear, we tried, but were declined.  I hope this context is helpful.<br /><br />We went into this book project with high hopes.  With a more even-handed fact-checking process, the book could have been better.
B00G4SS24I|4.0|Sky Ferreira seemingly has been around a long time already, even though she's still only 21. After a number of singles, one-offs and a very promising EP last Fall called \\"Ghost\\", now finally comes the long-awaited debut album of the singer-songwriter. Before we discuss the music on the debut album, sorry but it must be said first: the album cover (a shot looking through the shower door of a topless Sky Ferreira--what is showing on Amazon is a cropped version) is simply shocking and slightly disturbing, frankly.<br /><br />As to the music on \\"Night Time, My Time\\" (12 tracks; 46 min.), it marks the continuing evolution away from the pop sound from the earliest days towards a more indie rock sound that already was beginning to show on \\"Ghost\\". Album opener \\"Boys\\" is far closer to a Joan Jett song than to that Britney Spears song of the same name. \\"24 Hours\\" on the other hand reminds me of the \\"new wave\\" sound from the 80s, as does \\"Love In Stereo\\", the next-to-last song on the album. \\"Nobody Asked Me (If I Was Okay)\\" is another guitar-driven track. The first half concludes with \\"Omanko\\", drenched in whirling synthesizers. \\"You're Not The One\\" is about as light as this album gets and comes at a welcome time in the album. \\"Heavy Metal Heart\\" doesn't sound like heavy metal at all of course. One of the very best tracks of the album is buried towards the end: \\"I Will\\", somehow reminding me of Kim Wilde's \\"Kids In America\\". The album closes with the title track, the only 'downer' tune on here. In all, this is a very nice debut album, well worth the long wait.<br /><br />I saw Ferreira in concert earlier this summer at the Bunbury music festival here in Cincinnati, where she and her 3 piece back-up band put on a tight set, bringing a mix of songs from both \\"Ghost\\" and the then-unreleased debut album (including \\"24 Hours\\" and \\"Ain't Your Right\\"). About 30 min. into the set, Sky's voice gave out and she had to cut the set short, unfortunately. I can't wait to see her in concert again at some point. Meanwhile, \\"Night Time, My Time\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!again at some point. Meanwhile, \\"Night Time, My Time\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0316219266|5.0|Brad Stone has written everything you want to know about Amazon but was afraid to ask! The Everything Store reads more like a non-fiction adventure story than a too-easily-boring book about an Internet company. Although assiduously detailed and annotated, the story of Jeff Bezos and Amazon as told by Mr. Stone is both exciting and unexpected. I literally found myself in anxious anticipation of what was coming next in the tale.<br /><br />Mr. Stone's writing style, as honed over many years of excellent investigative reporting, captured the essence of the Amazon story, told through the words and feelings of the people who actually lived it. Crisscrossing the country and conducting more than 300 interviews Mr. Stone's wealth of material and personal insight left me feeling that I had gained intimate knowledge of both Amazon's founder and his extraordinary company.<br /><br />I found the book to be a real page-turner, accessible to both those with extensive business acumen or to whom this will serve as an introduction to the business world in general, as well as the burgeoning Internet business world. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking insight into the workings of one of the most powerful companies of the 21st century, and to the man whose personal vision and drive continues unabated. We have certainly not heard the last of Jeff Bezos, nor, one hopes, Brad Stone.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|The writing is great.  This is an extremely well researched book.  Highly entertaining and informative at the same time.  No one will regret reading this book.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|doesn't feel as strong as some of gladwells other works.  However, it is an enjoyable read, fact filled and thought provoking.
B000HX499S|3.0|I loved the clothes and the too few scenes of NYC and who doesn't like Audrey!----as for the story it was sad.  First time seeing this movie and was shocked at the blantant sexism and the emptiness of all the characters....Regardless of the book vs the movie argument and the obvious Japanese stereotype---this was a deeply sick female who was abused  at a young age and from a poor background and had to marry some old grandpa when she was 14! She runs off to the city and becomes a self destructive hooker----I mean a 'Pretty Woman'....waiting for another old guy or a 'daddy' with money to take care of her....the part in the movie when she is crying over the death of her brother---a little too weird of a relationship, she is in her 'baby-girl' room and all you see is the shadow of the older south american 'daddy' figure....obvious symbolism of her past abuse....it's so Project Monarch...sad part is, this crap happens everyday in Hollywood and countries all throughout the MiddleEast, Africa, India, Mongolia, China  etc...Children that are forced into 'trama' become 'fractured' individuals---multi-personalities and have id confusion---they are stuck in the 'child-like' stage and can't and won't grow up----Project Monarch, look it up...<br />Funny how everyone is so defended on the Japanese stereotype---which of course would never be protrayed today, but no one is offended of the hateful stereotyping of women....which continues to be seen all over media today...you males have grown up in being educated on not offending men of different races, but with women in many countries who can't vote, human trafficking, honor killings, poverty---where is your anger and disgust?.....oh well, it's all so newworldorder--signing off.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was an enjoyable, suspenseful read.  I liked the three main characters and their stories.  It was hard to put down this book.
B00ESNE696|5.0|this is one of our favorite shows. we never miss it. it is hard to get locally so we purchase it.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A few chapters in, I went back to the reviews to see if I could continue reading what seemed an unrelenting tragedy.  Some reviewers said absolutely not, but I'm so glad I read the favorable reviews as well.  What a brilliant work, it became a page turner through some parts of which the theme from Candide seemed to play in the back of my mind.  It's a masterful combination of, as the book's editor says in a conversation with the author:<br /><br />&#34;...a coming-of-age story, a spy story, a love story.  There's an adventure at sea tale, a kidnapping tale, a redemption story.  You move through a number of tones including high tragedy, the ironic, the satirical, the tender, and the just plain terrifying.&#34;<br /><br />And, unbelievably, he takes an incomprehensible land and unknowable people, places them at the door to your heart and mind, and you're free to take them in and get to know them.  Some you'll shun, others you'll want to wrap your arms around and bring home, but there's not one character you don't care about one way or another.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was skeptical when I first heard about the Google Chromecast. But I pay $35 for just one movie date with my wife, so why not roll the dice. It is worth the price if we get two movies we missed in the theater. First advantage is access to Netflix original content. House of Cards was worth the cost of the device alone. Second advantage, I can Chromcast most streaming video from my computer. So if I miss an episode of The Good Wife because the football game ran late on Sunday, I can pull up the CBS website and run it. without crowding around the computer. Third advantage is the ability to control the Chromecast with my iPhone or iPad.<br /><br />Okay, the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there is content I can not stream. For example, a lot of my alma mater's basketball games are available on ESPN3. It won't stream this content. But, really, my wife would rather I stay in my home office to watch the game and let her watch Revenge off the DVR. This is not a big deal, but it belies the only problem with the Chromecast. Although I love the content presently available, it is very limited: Netflix and YouTube. I would like access to Turner Classic Movies library. Maybe that will come sometime down the line.<br /><br />(UPDATE)<br />I took the Chromecast with me on a weekend out of town with my wife. The hotel had a bland selection of channels and none seemed to come in HD. Plugged in the Chromecast and used my wife's Verizon Mifi and was able to access Netflix in the hotel room. When I returned home I had some difficulty returning the Chromecast to identifying my home wifi network, but after a few missteps it was back. I'm thinking of buying a second Chromecast to pair with my wife's Mifi for road trips. At $35 it is cheaper to have two than one AppleTV.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I will be brief: the writing is no longer from just Tris' perspective, which is an odd change up from the first two books. The characters don't have individual voices, which makes switching back and forth each chapter between Tris and Tobias confusing an  awkward. Chapter development seems incomplete at times. The story seemed to have every hot topic dumped in and not very well incorporated. The climax was heroic but seriously, who does that and can pull it off, except Shakespeare? Worst by far of the trilogy.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I loved the other books and the movies, after reading this book hopefully they'll make another movie.  Was very surprised whenI started the book ,but unlike many of the reviews I read-I enjoyed the book and only dissapoitment was I was done!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Watch it at least once a year.  Great songs, great period piece.  Garland at her best.  Margaret O'Brien at her cutest.  The rest of the cast is great!  &#34;Underneath the Bamboo Tree&#34; is &#34;our song.&#34;
B00CATSONE|1.0|An introduction to the author's ideas on self help. A short essay on Tesla that was a pretty average read. Then advertising for the book that this appears to be an excerpt from. It's free because it is a glorified ad.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|An interesting study in &#34;the butterfly effect&#34; theoretically applied to time travel.  Not a particularly engrossing novel, but it is an interesting study in how we could affect the future by changing the past.  Well thought ought out and a pretty good love story story with an interesting twist.  Anymore would be approaching a spoiler alert.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|This is a timeless horror movie.  Lots of things to notice even after viewing it in the past. You don't find new movies this good.
1469259176|5.0|If you have a child ages 8 and up - this is a MUST read!  I bought a copy for all of the 140 students that I teach and I hope it becomes a treasured part of their personal libraries.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This is a good looking clock with ads. It will not play your own music in the free version. I never upgraded because other reviewers commented that even after paying for the upgrade they still got ads and still could not play their own music. I am glad I saved my money.<br /><br />Today I updated it and it triggered an alert. When I considered all three negatives - no personal music, ads, and  adware- it was a simple decision to delete it. I replaced it with Alarm Clock 3 which has no ads, let's me easily use my own music and has very few permissions.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not your typical Stephen King offering.  Loved the story and the background research that had to go into this book.  I was impressed with the way Mr. King intertwined facts with his fiction.  Great book for any one interested in the 60s.
0316055433|3.0|A unique, inventive story captured my interest only to be halted by rambling descriptions and thoughts of the main character as he stumbles from one misfortune to another. His Russian friend, Boris, is especially difficult to follow as his conversations are indirect and he seems incapable of expressing his actions in understandable English. The author has a beautiful command of language, an almost poetic voice when describing art work of any kind, but I felt that some judicious editing would have made the reading experience a truly memorable one.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|She is becoming my favorite author. This is definitely a page turner. Hard to put down. The only thing I do not like about her books is there is always animal cruelty in them. I scan past it as fast as possible. I don't think the detail of these episodes is necessary.
B00138J0KO|5.0|This takes The Wall to next level.  The songwriting is unabashedly fragmentary -- every song a cruel tease --  the singing is histrionic, and the company immaculate.  Waters aside, this features Clapton's best playing since Blind Faith, albeit a totally different blues -- paranoid, odd meters, unpredictable, and showcasing a flair for depth and drama that he has never equalled.  Too bad both never collaborated again.  Believe me, you won't miss Gilmour if Waters, and not Floyd, is what you're after. (By the way, you won't miss Wright since none other than Michael Kamen is on keyboards.)<br /><br />The quality of the songwriting?  Waters employs motifs from The Final Cut, but he does this to great effect and never to the point of facile self-plagiarism.  However, the real highlight is the disjointed nature of the songs, which is miles ahead of what anyone is still doing.  In fact, while Waters was experimenting, the Floyd were merely replicating themselves.  This has to be the most exciting aspect of Pros.  Further, the melodies are evocative and hardly predictable, mostly encapsulating his quiet angst and open ire on the issues he touches upon.  It's a scathing piece of autobiography and wholly adventurous music-making.  In Floydian terms, it's wholly uncharacteristic yet ruthless, violent, psychotic, and human.<br /><br />I lived in Seattle when this was released and listened to parts of it first on the station KISW.  Strangely, the dj's incessantly mocked the single (\\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\").  The album itself was derisively panned in the US for not having the \\"stately\\" tunes of Floyd (I still remember the Rolling Stone review).<br /><br />Pros, however, is no attempt to replicate Floyd, and it's a shame Waters didn't take the aesthetic concept further with later albums.<br /><br />A must-have.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I wish I understood the concepts in this book 20 years ago so that I could apply them to myself then. Now I'll try to guide my children with what I've learned from it. A must-read for any American parent.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good Book.  It wasn't as good as the first one though.  About half-way through I started really disliking Katniss for some reason and it carried through to the third book too.  It was still a good read and if you read the first one you have to read the secon one, right?
B0015DROBO|2.0|Too slow and proding.  I didn't like this book or author style at all.  I did enjoy the movie, but not enough to go back and finish the novel.  I only read about 100 pages in and decided it wasn't worth my time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I made the tactical error of reading Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" on a train between my home in Richmond and New York.  It was an error because several of my fellow passengers were getting annoyed at my semi-regular eruptions of \\"holy s***!\\"  It has been a VERY long time since a novel's done that to me, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />At first the story seems simple--Amy Dunne disappears from her suburban Missouri home on her fifth anniversary, and suspicion almost immediately falls on her husband, Nick.  As the evidence piles up against him, the story alternates between Amy's diary, which paints a rosy picture of their marriage while acknowledging that Nick can be, well, less than perfect, while Nick tells a very different tale about how they went from well-to-do writers in New York to a midwestern McMansion hanging on with his salary as a teacher at the local community college.  The story progresses relentlessly to Nick's practically inevitable indictment for Amy's murder.<br /><br />And then the second part--and the first explosion of \\"holy s***!\\"--happens.  It is impossible to explain without spoilers, I won't even try.  This is the type of novel where every single time you think it's heading for a conclusion it veers sharply and changes the story entirely.  I did find some elements to be a little too convenient and/or unbelievable, particularly towards the end.  I will say that unlike many reviewers I felt that the ending was the only way this novel COULD end.  It would have been so easy to have a pat, predictible ending, and I credit Ms. Flynn for avoiding that.<br /><br />Based on my own experience, read \\"Gone Girl\\" by yourself during the day, because you'll be up all night turning the pages or startling strangers on public transport with admiring profanity.  Definitely worth the hype that it's gotten.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|I hate to use \\"kung-fu\\" as a blanket term for movies like this, but whatever. If you knew me personally, you'd know how rare it is for me to give ANY movie made in at least the last 10 years a five star review. At this point in my life, I feel like it's all been done before. Bruce Lee, Sonny Chiba, Gordon Liu, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, err... Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal, Van Damme. Yeah, that's right. Those guys too.<br /><br />This movie blew me away. I've seen it at least ten times and it still hasn't worn out its welcome. Iko Uwais is the real deal. The next Bruce Lee (how many times have you heard THAT before?). But it's true. I've never seen fighting like this. The Raid is low-down, dirty fighting. The choreography is just unreal. This is the anti-Crouching Tiger/Matrix. There is nothing beautiful or pure about the combat here. It's as raw as it gets. And it's amazing to watch. One of the most satisfying action movies in years. Can't wait for the sequel.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Great acting by Denzel, as expected. Somewhat improbable flying situation. Mostly it makes me wonder how many pilots have a similar problem.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|What a strange and wonderful story!  It was sad, funny and expressive and gave a quite different perspective on the German sacrifices during world war II.  I loved the narration by the persona of \\"death\\".  I thought the author, Marcus zusak did a brilliant job of creating a masterpiece.  It's the kind of novel to read more than once.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While a Happy and depressing story all at once, I don't think I've ever enjoyed a book more. One for somewhere around the top of my list!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I understand why this was a Best Seller.  The book captures you from the beginning and doesn't let go.  So many twists and turns, it really engages you as a reader.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this author.
B005NK69ZC|4.0|Great book and loved reading through it. Ellen has such a great personality that no matter what medium, whether it's TV or written, she will always shine through. If you're a fan of hers, this is a must read.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|He has such big dreams, and wouldn't give up on them even though EVERYONE was telling him he was ridiculous. He got his dream come true and still stayed true to his hopes and family and friends.  He gave support to his admirers.  He is a wonderful role model.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|Holy hell this is a stupid movie. I love me popcorn action movies but this isn't even fun. A lame plot, moronic badguys, no sense of danger for the cast, and a PG-13 rating to ruin the so-called &#34;violence&#34;. On top of that is just idiotic side characters trying to get a laugh by making lame jokes. This movie just doesnt make sense and is beyond ridiculous. Someone even uses a pager! A pager! They should have just cast Charlie Sheen and had him launch a chicken via longbow. Thats how close this movie comes to being a Hot Shots part trois. Horrible, horrible, horrible. If you want action in the White House, go watch Olympus Has Fallen. 100x better than this garbage.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush! Sadly you don't get enough lives and have to beg friends for help or purchase them. Or wait the twenty mintues for one. Super addictive and entertaining.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the book! It always kept me trying to guess what was going to happen next. This book really tells the truth about how secrets are kept.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks book.  But I never tire of the romance.  Enjoyed the ending and would recommend to anyone interested in a romance novel that is an easy read.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This movie shows incredible strength in all the characters. Very well acting! Very touching true story...love the photos at the end.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|In the beginning the movie was action packed and special effects were amazing.  Denzel Washington did a good job , as always but, the storyline was a bit old and tired.
B00008LOS1|5.0|THE WHO'S WHO NEXT ALBUM HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS I'VE EVER HAD.I HAVE HAD IT ALBUM,8 TRACK,CD AND CASSETTE TAPE.THE CD I HAD WAS BOUGHT BACK IN YHE NINTYS.THIS CD IS THE BEST REMASTERING JOB I'VE HEARD TO DATE,AND I'VE HAVE PURCHASED MANY OF THEM.I GIVE THIS CD SET FIVE STARS WITH EASE.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great app - provides hours of enjoyment.  Would be wonderful if XIMAD would feature more of their jigsaw puzzles to choose from!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Fifth in a series and can't wait till the next one comes out.  Enjoyed reading it on my Kindle for a change.
B000FC1K66|4.0|Slow read but worth it.  The store is wonderfully crafted and I enjoyed reading it very much.  I will read more by this author.
B0040I09RM|5.0|we love it. We had been wanting to start the series for a while. Once we started, we cant stop. It is SO good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really great book with a new and fresh storyline.  The entire series keeps me riveted.  Great book for students to read in social studies.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Great old school smokey lounge sound with a new school writing.<br />Just happen upon one of Lana Del Rey's videos online and fell in love with the sound.<br />Great buy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game although it is addictive and frustrating at times. Definitely keeps your mind working and your eyes working.
B00275EGWY|5.0|My son ask me to order it for him.The movie really move him.He said one of his favorites.He is hoping to join the Marines after high school.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|It is fun and I enjoy making my own defense and seeing if people can get past it but sometimes it freezes at loading and I have too wait for the app to close to try it again fix and I give 5 stars.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I had to read this book for English I dreaded taking honors English but the first 10 pages get you hooked I highly recommend it it's a easy read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I fell in love with Candy Crush when it came to Facebook. I kept searching for it on Kindle, with no luck. So I cannot even begin to describe my excitement in its arrival!!! Love the bright colors and the ease of play, plus I can connect with my Facebook so I didn't lose any levels!
B005EGXNLS|3.0|I like stories of this type of subject.  It was easy to read, not thick or real detailed.  A more envolved story might have gotten a higher rating.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|This movie is very cute and even my 11 year old son enjoyed watching.  Both my children saw it at the movies and begged me to buy it when it came out.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Have always loved this movie.  Great actors, great drama, well thought out.  Not sure how true it is, but does that matter anymore?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive, frustrating, challenging, and just overall a whole lot of fun!  I am thankful that there is a break after you use up your lives, so I can do other things!  I would highly recommend this game, just don't start playing when you have time restrictions, cuz you will forget about time!
B0050VA428|4.0|Probably one of my favorite Holmes stories (stereotypical, but true ;).  The Hound of the Baskervilles is a good story to start with if you are just getting into Sherlock Holmes.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|If you love Grisham, buy this book.  It is a fast paced page-turner that has a few haunting twists. I loved it.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I really liked this movie, it was action packed and interesting . I liked the interaction between the father and son, especially since they were father and son in real life.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It is amusing and doesn't require alot of imagination.  My six<br />year old granddaughter enjoys it.  It is colorful and easy to<br />look at.  I really like something more challenging.
B00E8AVNAE|5.0|My husband and I have been waiting forever for this movie to release!  We are big Danny Trejo fans.  There is just something about him that makes him fun to watch.  This movie's moral is very &#34;interesting&#34;.  I won't give it away in this review.  But let's just say that we think that the devil is tad confused.  It kinda made us chuckle about making a deal with the devil.<br /><br />At any rate, there is lots of action.  The &#34;F&#34; bomb is not the major word in the script but there is plenty of blood to go around.  It would never be a big box office hit because of the lack of a lot of special effects. It is just a fun movie to watch if you don't want to have to think about where the movie is going.<br /><br />I think that Danny Trejo has looked the same since I first saw him years ago in a movie whose title I cannot remember.  But I sure can't say the same thing for Mickey Rourke.  Had I not seen his name on the movie jacket, I probably would not have recognized him.  But Rourke does not have a major part in this film.  So I will not comment further about his faltering appearance.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|I can honestly say this is one of the funniest shows on TV! It is nothing short of brilliant, and each season not only delivers, but gets better and better - if that is possible! Even the peripheral characters are amazing - Laurie Metcalf gives an absolutely hysterical performance as Sheldon's Bible-thumping Mama, whereas Christien Baranski is superb as the ever-cold, ever-frigid mother of Lenonard. And who can forget Mrs. Walowitz - who can be heard constantly yelling uncouth remarks at poor Howard, while we get to see Raj visit with his parents who are most concerned about him finding a nice Indian Girl. There is nothing better and I can always count on this show to make me laugh non-stop!<br /><br />But I have to say that this season worries me a bit~not as funny as the previous seasons.  Hope this is not a sign of material getting stale.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Beautifully sung by Enya, nice cover for the music CD! She is a beautiful lady as well! Melody is just great!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game...too addictive. Want to keep pushing to reach the next level..LOL Trying to play without buying more lives...getting hard to do.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I couldn't stop playing this game once I started it! It was completely addictive. The storyline is great and the puzzles are unique. I can't wait for the next one!
B00DMM3WVM|1.0|A friend chose this for me and honestly I have not really<br />played it. I will give it another chance.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This movie was awful from the beginning. Will Smith is a pretty decent actor, but he should stick to that and not try to write again. The plot was weak, the graphics were passable, and the acting was inexcusably bad. I don't know why Will Smith had that weird accent, but it did nothing to advance the story. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS! It is not worth the cardboard used to make the cover.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|this book rocks! it is kinda sad but I want more!<br />I feel good for Alex and Conner Bailey !
B001EO748M|4.0|Good acting on the part of Jonathan Rhys Meyers who plays Henry the VII. At time very seductive and sexual scenes. May want to use parental guidance regarding children with this DVD.
B00CD4RPWM|3.0|The art work is incredibly good but the story is too abbreviated.  I am not generally a fan of graphic novels.
B0060D2QR6|5.0|great movie love it. i love the love story kind of movies. but aslo like soa also.thanks good movie. would buy it again
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Again I have not played this game.  I will certainly try<br />it in the near future and be glad to evaluate it at a<br />later date.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|We didn't finish watching it.  We were just not in the mood for this kind of life-drama.  Probably on another day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive game that will last for a long time. New special candies added while you progress. Fun for everyone. Doesn't require purchase to progress.  Luck helps though.
B000P0J02E|4.0|Johnny Depp is good in this film. Quite a character as well! Great series this  Pirates of the Caribbean! He is talented.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great to able to have books readily acceptable and a great selection to choose from. Make purchases from Amazon for gifts to friends and family
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This has been great for my wife who is in school.  She uses this to take pictures of her drawings for her lab notebook.  The auto-adjustment of images you snap photos of is great, and everything comes out looking almost like you had scanned it.  It works very well for small images and documents that you can get pretty close to.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book and have been suggesting it to friends all over!  I thought &#34;no more Nazi books for awhile!&#34; but this one isn't like any other I've ever read, it used different voices and some pictures to convey a life no one should have to endure.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|It is a fun movie, the kind that may not meet critical acclaim but has fun entertainment value for all.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|I am a huge John Frusciante fan so I of course had to read this book. It's a very exciting, dramatic, and fun-to-read story of Anthony Kiedis and his adventurous and dangerous life. I have no idea how he possibly could have survived all of the near death experiences that he describes in this book, but, I am glad he did...long live the red hot chili peppers.
B008BRC6NS|4.0|Good upbeat songs! Good pix on the cover! Good tunes to Dance to or Spin on you spinning cycle! You go girl!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the challenge!!  i play a little every day and so do most of my friends...keep up the good work
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best game I've played.  It is very addictive!  I play it ever chance I get.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|WORST written, published piece of fecal matter and such a waste of American $...I can't say enough bad about it or I'd have to go on and on and on...just horrible.  I mean really awful stuff.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I think ist a grate app its simple and practical and actually very<br />Easy to use but  it need Dome things
1551117223|5.0|I purchased this book for a college class on Sherlock Holmes, and was impressed by information included in this edition. If you want to learn more about Arthur Conan Doyle, his writing techniques, and the historical contexts influencing his two classic stories, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" and \\"The Speckled Band\\", then this is a great book for you. What I learned here will enrich and inform all of my future readings of Doyle's works.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|Good acting by most of the actors especially Tom Hanks! It was controversial in some American Churches however! Need to go into watching the film with an open mind! My favorite part is the ending when his female assistant, a french actress, learns something from him about belief in Jesus and God!
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Slow moving plot. The action you see in the trailers is about all there is.<br />Just did not live up to my expectations.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|This album took a few run throughs to really get into, but it is excellent. It's a somewhat different direction than Reznor's previous work.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Great, informative read. Made me appreciate all that our service men & women do for our country. Proud of this Texan. Mourn for the family & America. Recommend this for everyone. Wake<br /> up America and see what our enemy is doing to try to destroy all who are Christian. This is a religious war!
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|This movie is a great movie for a family or just with some friends- it is uplifting with lots of music!
B00902AKK4|5.0|I am greatly enjoying this game. It has a cute storyline, lovely graphics, challenging gameplay, and interactive controls. This app was well thought out and designed. I notice a lot of poor reviews based on the game's difficulty. This isn't a game where you can just lay back and slide through some quick, silly levels. This game uses a lot of logic and calculating, and can be very frustrating. If you enjoy a nice mental challenge like I do, then give this game a go.<br /><br />It has not crashed, frozen, or had any bugs so far, and I play on a Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
B002HNA95E|2.0|Have heard some of these songs before I believe on her Immaculate music CD! Do not like the cover's pix of her!
B00C7607BC|4.0|The Diamond Edition Bu-ray/DVD combo did  not come with a card board cover that usually accompany Bu-ray/DVD combos.  I feel that it was taken out on purpose and I was very disappointed.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works like a charm - downloads all You Tube videos to my Samsung Galaxy S3 with no problems at all.
B0054JELS4|5.0|best series ever. love watching every episodes that keeps you involved in the show. love all the charioteers in it
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Somewhat limited in what it can stream, but for the price it is fantastic. I use it to stream Netflix to my TV in my bedroom, and it's perfect for that. I also have an Apple TV in my living room, but I did not need all the features for my bedroom. The Chromecast does everything I need, and costs 1/3 of the price of the Apple TV.
B00EM764ZC|3.0|Does not have the ease of use that other apps have.  I love my kindle and this app is definitely lacking.
B00757J98K|3.0|Not all the songs on this music CD are really good! Would I recommend this to a friend? Probably not!!!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is a really good game. I hope they are working on more Snarkbusters. I have played all three and am going to play again.
B004132HZS|1.0|DVD is defective so never got to watch it. I couldn't find my receipt so never tried to return it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Detailed analysis of conflicts resulted in the historical Jesus becoming the Jesus of the New Testament and the role of the resurrection in early Christianity.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have this program on the desktop and I know I am protected against viruses.  I wanted the same for my kindle.  Now I know when I am traveling I am protected.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Cute game. Downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. Fun to play. Good graphics. I think it stops you after a few levels because they want you to buy the game.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another beautifully written novel by my favorite author. Thank you, Mr. Grisham. I would love this to become a movie with the same cast as 'A Time to Kill.'
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Used this app last night since I have trouble falling asleep. Set the timer, picked what sounds I wanted to hear an d I was out like a light. Slept so sound! Going to use tonight also! Love love love!
0143038583|5.0|This is a great introduction for anyone wondering why some people avoid conventionally produced food.  Michael Pollan describes his experiences in both worlds, not too aloof to admit he takes his family to MacDonalds, but also exploring why some have gone to great efforts to acquire or even produce food as close to nature as possible.  It was a real eye opener for me and I think everyone in the US and Canada can benefit from reading this.
0920668372|3.0|Simply for the story.  It's kinda creepy how the mom crawls into the bedroom and peers up over the bed....  The seller is fantastic though, great service plus extras!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|It has kind of a boring start to the novel.  I still haven't finished it.  It is not one to catch your interest right off the start.<br />I have read other books along this line I liked much better.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|No More Hell To Pay. The lastest offering from Stryper is a superb Album. This has a lot to offer the fans of the band as well as Metal fans in general. Killer Guitar Riffs, Great soaring vocals, Great Melodies, And really big Choruses.<br /><br />Stryper have really been on a roll lately. Their last 4 Albums have been absolutely Phenomenal. Starting with Murder By Pride, The Covering, Second Coming, And now this release No More Hell To Pay.<br /><br />This one ranks right up there among their best Albums. Soldiers is still my favorite Album from the band, But this is definitely a close second.<br /><br />Their are 12 tracks on this CD starting with Revelation. a Killer song with a huge Anthemic Chorus, And a solid vocal from Michael Sweet throughout this track.<br /><br />No More Hell To Pay is a bit more Progressive sounding that harkens back to they're mid 80's albums. Again this has a great vocal line with a really big Chorus. Great song.<br /><br />My other favorites on this Album are Marching Into Battle. Which is one of the heaviest songs if not the heaviest song on the Album. This one features a very Dark and plodding Rythym with Epic Drumming from Robert Sweet. His Drumming is very impressive on this CD, He is just Killing it here, Really slammin down on the skins.<br /><br />Sticks And Stones is another heavy track. A bit more uptempo with a solid Riff throughout. The Band really shines on this one and it's by far one of the Standout tracks on the Album.<br /><br />This is a fantasic release from Stryper. And it's one that you should definitly check out. And it's one that also has a lot of replay value to it. so go out and buy this Album and enjoy.
B00FKTDKTO|4.0|I really like McCartney's music. It is great that he has a totally new album. The more I listen to it the more I like the songs.
B0011UF792|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! Probably due to my catholic upbringing... I would recommend it to anyone who finds humor in making fun of religion.
0316010669|5.0|This was my first Malcolm Gladwell book and it blew my mind.  After reading this I immediately ordered &#34;The Tipping Point&#34; and &#34;Outliers.&#34;  However, this is the one I enjoyed the most.  Great reading.  Couldn't put it down.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Fun writing, backed by sound science, adding to the Low Carb diet class. I'd give it six stars, if I could.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|Not exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted one like grandson had but it was not compatible with my knidle, so was disappointed.
B00280LYHS|5.0|My 9 year old daughter just finished this series and loved it. And the books teach about Greek Mythology, you can't beat that! We like this author. Some of the content is a little intense, or sad at points, so gauge what you think your child can handle.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very good book. Looked forward to reading every chance I could. Hard to believe these trains existed .  These kids went through a lot!
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I read some of the reviews and they said it was to easy lol. I'm having trouble and still in the first part. This is my first game of this type. I hope to get better. But still can't find some of the things needed for part two
B00000K3D4|4.0|A classic from the 80's that does not get old. David Bowie is not only a great singer, bug a great actor as well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game to pass the time, and you do not need wifi in order to play.  Often times I am without wifi and can't play most games, but I can play my spider.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|It was a good movie and unfortunately a little too close to the truth we're finding out about some pilots.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I liked playing at first but Kindle users don't get notifications when updates are available. Then on the Tokyo update I lost over 500,000 coins and all of my overboard updates. Couldn't figure out how to get them back. Very frustrating.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent game, but it takes up too much of my time. :) I play it in the Vegas scoring mode.
B000VRSTEQ|5.0|Can't go wrong with Aerosmith!  All the hit songs on one CD is awesome.  Buy,  load onto play list and enjoy some great classic songs.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This was a great movie!  It will keep you in suspense, not knowing, from one minute to the next, what is about to happen.  It never occurred to me who was directing, behind the scenes, the four magicians.  Quite a thriller, with a lot of action.  Recommend to anyone who appreciates action with suspense.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Game is fun to play, annoying it's always trying to make you pay to continue or start over but then again it didn't say absolutely free, could show how new challenges could be done, overall simple game, cute graphics and sound, to bad it's not absolutely free.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I am drawn to books about the Holocaust, strangely. This is a book unlike the others. Narrated by Death, l glimpsed insights into the human condition in new ways.  I fell in love with Leisle, Rudy, and most especially with Papa.  The characters are revealed in such a way that it seems sure I  knew them. Highest praise for an unusual, emotionally written story. It speaks true from the heart.
B00000ITOY|5.0|This sorting board is well-made, and very versatile. My daughter likes sorting and stacking the pieces per their intended use, as well as arranging the shapes into patterns, adding the pieces to her block play, etc.<br /><br />I  highly recommend this product, and the brand itself.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book so much!  I read it in a day because I could not put it down.  I felt such empathy for ALL of the characters - even the unlikable ones.  This is the first book I have read by this author, but I am going to make it my mission to read all of her others.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device is inexpensive and works like it is supposed to.  I'm just patiently waiting for more apps to support casting, but I won't hold my breath.  This is not going to replace your Roku, but is good for that non-smart TV you have in the guest room or bedroom.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was one of the most and interesting and well hidden plot lines that I have encountered in years.  From the method of telling half the story in a diary to the author leading the reader to believe that this was a ho hum plot that has been done exhaustively.  After being lulled into this belief, she goes on to blow the readers mind by finishing the story with anything but a trite plot.  Extremely clever writing style.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a great idea on paper, but Google seems to put thing out too early.  I really like the idea behind this, but with such limited choices on what can be used I really haven't used it much.<br />Power - I have older TVs so I have to run the power cable to this, not the worst, but have to make sure I have an outlet available.<br />Ease of Use - Easy to figure out how to use it, just not always the best. would like it easier to use on the road in hotels.<br />Video Options - At first it was basically Netflix and Youtube, and what modern device doesn't have netflix in it.  I really don't watch much youtube but the Netflix does look nice.  I don't have Hulu Plus either so that is pointless, no android devices besides 1 phone.  who listens to Pandora on their TV? I have a Sonos system for that.<br />I wish they would open it up to more options since there are way more apps to watch movies/TV and besides running Chrome on a computer to send, I want to play other options.  Maybe in the future I will like this more, but right now I really don't use it.  Worth the price I guess.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|What a great read.  As usual, Gladwell ties relevant stories to his ideas.  There are other books out there that might say something similar, but you can just skim them for information.  When you are reading a Gladwell book, you don't want to miss even one word.
B001KZI2WW|4.0|it's been three months that I purchased<br />i almost wear it two or three days per week.<br />it's comfortable shoes but better wear sox if you take a long walk<br /><br />I am happy with my purchase and plan to buy second pair if there is good deal....
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|I liked this movie. There was plenty of action and suspense. At times, it was kind of slow and mushy. You could predict the ending.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Great little SDHC card reader. Gets a bit hot under load, but has no problems reading/writing any card I use. Transfer speeds are great. Definitely durable--even the string has held up after months of keychain abuse.
0763660531|5.0|My 6 year old granddaughter LOVES to draw.  She would do that all day if she could.<br />Her art work has already been chosen to be displayed in the principals office.<br />This book absolutely encourages children to keep on being the artists that they are.<br />It is beautifully illustrated and tells the story of a young girl who is lonely but through art finds adventure and a friend.<br />EXCELLENT
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great movie! I love the way it ended and shows a man really coming to terms with the damage he has caused both in his personal and professional life.
B00BEIYMIS|3.0|A good Halloween movie, but not real enough.  Those things just don't happen.  I hope anyway.  Well my fingers are crossed!
B00957T6X6|5.0|The bundle is inexpensive and convenient, but it gets downloaded to your kindle in one single behemoth super-book. It actually caused my brand new 2nd generation paperwhite to freeze up for a few minutes. This also breaks the &#34;time to end of chapter&#34; feature, as it recognizes entire books as chapters, and reports &#34;15 hours left in chapter,&#34; etc...<br /><br />I returned the bundle and bought all 5 kindle books individually for an even lower grand total of $19.50.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|Superb story. Got it in kindle edition and it was a different experience. Really enjoyed the mystery to solve aspect.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|I'm a STAR TREK fan......BUT this was lacking on the verge of ST wacked out brother find GOD??!  Could they have stolen anything else from ST 2 ??  Definitely have to come up with something better for the next installment
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|The movie made no sense. It's like they couldn't come up with an ending. It was crap save your money its not worth $4.
0792839749|5.0|The grandson just loves this movie! He will go around the house singing the song to me and it brings back fun times for me.
B00D3LA71K|3.0|It's okay.  He is great to look act, but another on the run movie.  I doubt I'd watch it a 2nd time.
1476747016|5.0|I love Pusheen. This book is a dream come true. I was SO excited all year- waiting for its release, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />EVERYTHING IS JUST SO ADORABLE AND CUTE. Creative, thoughtful, and clever. I do love the animated GIFs on the blog, but it is so beautiful to finally have Pusheen in print and book form!!!*<br /><br />A lot of comics were featured online with only some new comics. I'm glad though, I love the ones online! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I'm going to buy this book for my friends too.<br /><br />(*And it also joys me to have the Pusheen book in Kindle format and Pusheen in other forms: stickers, pins, a t-shirt, a stuffed toy, necklaces, rings, notepads... ummmmm yes, I am a Pusheen and Pusheen merch addict!!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|T he beginning was a bit different and I wasn't sure I liked it. Then, shortly I was hooked and it only became better as I was more enlightened. This book will leave you more enlightened
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Some tasks are obviously menial, but they get you to where you need to be. I would choose this over hidden objects every time. Give me adventure games and different story lines like this one.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|This album is for soft listing.  His version of &#34;Somewhere over the Rainbow&#34; is better then the original, and I loved the original.  You can not go wrong by  buying this album.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so a sum that I can play it all day but I got school that's how much I like this game
B009AMANH4|5.0|Excellent movie.  I loved every bit of it.  It makes you want to dig deeper and find out what is truth and what is fiction.  Lincoln was portrayed excellantly!
B008Y212PI|5.0|a very enjoyable app.  you're supposed to be able to solve all puzzles without hints but i find i still need an occasional hint.  highly recommend.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning. Listening to the silent memories of a 90- year old woman who has -sort of- been asked about the reality of a captivating situation that everyone seems to know a little about, but no one seems to know the truth- and you keep waiting for Grace to explain- a movie is being made about the &#34;situation&#34;, Grace remembers it all so well.. Will she tell it? What really happened? Is she a part of it or an onlooker? This book reminds me a lot of Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca, and when I read that Kate Morton loved her books, I could see why. This one may even be worth reading again sometime...!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it's fun you can fly make tree houses and other cool stuff I just don't now how to get on with a another person and go on YouTube and search up I saw herobrine in minecraft pocket edition I love love love and love minecraft it also helps you get ready for the computer version and my favorite thing is that you can type different seeds and seeing where your at ITS A LOT OF FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Good show ... enjoy having access to this series on amazon and the HD option is great.  Thanks for showings
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I enjoy watching Dexter over and over again. Two thumbs up.  It is always entertaining wit a true sense of justice.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|it is not user friendly.  I touch the screen with my stylus to move the direction of the hit and it releases.  Hard to control and you lose your moves.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The information in this book is very interesting.  I have not read the whole book yet.  So far so good.  It gives me a lot of food for thought and bring it to the table for discussion in my family.  We are looking for ways to be healthier and we started paying attention to how we feel after we eat a meal.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This app is so much fun!! I'm addicted to it! Can't stop paying it and now I've gotten my best friends addicted to it as well.
0393343405|3.0|Book gave impression that the author used other class lecture materials and somewhat related translated materials from Florence - all these included to bulk up what could have been a much tighter presentation.  Actually, the main material began at chap 10 and could have been much further developed.  Such further development would have addressed ideas developed by Plato and Aristotle and their contemporaries....as well as later philosophers...
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game it's very challenging and keeps me in suspense. The graphics are incredible and I can't stop playing it i would suggest this game to everyone<br />w
B007EC27QM|3.0|I bought this product just in case I would need a calculator for simple problems (adding or subtracting only), and that's pretty much all it's good for, though it gives you the impression that it can do more. It doesn't follow the order of operations and is essentially useless except for the most basic of math problems. Would I recommend it? Only for those who WANT to only do simple math. Since that was my intended purpose when purchasing it, I give it a couple of stars, though I think it should be free for a product as broken as this one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game!  the interaction with My Facebook friends is nice.  Spend a long time in levels and other levels can be bested fairly quickly.  Nice challenge and entertaining
0385537131|5.0|I have read every Grisham book! Always 'clean' and well-written. Amazon is my choice for books over the years. Thanks!!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|So cute!  As good as the original, if not better :). We rented this with 2 sick kids at home and they watched it over and over
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Oh Mr. King you can still bring it to the table! Loved this story, perfectly weird and unusual as I would expect no less! Cipped along at a good pace. Enjoyed reading what happened to dear old Danny.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have been trying to get on servers but thier s a glitch they you can't join a server<br />I have good internet or servers is down.
0307155102|5.0|A favorite from my childhood--even though it's been edited since my version, it's a great book and wonderful for babies and toddlers, and beginning readers!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham always makes you feel a part of the story.  Can pull at your deepest heart string at times.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a good game to play especially if you have some free time on your hands.  The downside is waiting for the lives to be restored. They should make a pay for version with unlimited lives that you can purchase and own. That way you can play when you like for as long as you like.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|well, you know what I mean. I think the creepiest part of the story is thinking about the zombies in the water. I will keep that in mind if we ever have another zombie war .
B003A3K3JW|5.0|This combination of Stravinsky and Revueltas makes for an explosive CD.<br />Both composers love opposites, contrasting lyric passages with orchestral eruptions.<br />There is furious chaos, pagan abandon and the tantrum of angry gods. Add lots of percussion and Gustavo Dudamel, and you get the whole range between boom box and high heaven. He wakes the dead. Listening to this recording is an event.<br />For me the only annoyance: Some passages are so low that one has to turn up the volume on the CD player. But next comes a sonic cataclysm that threatens your speakers. It's an annoyance with many CDs. I guess  it's the crime of sound engineers.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As always, Gaiman doesn't disappoint--I truly enjoyed the story!  Neat mythology to it, as well.  Detailed and well-written.  If there's any criticism, it's that I wanted more!
B002KGEORM|5.0|SoA is riveting, well worth watching. Prepare to become addicted, if you are new to Sons of Anarchy. Writing and acting are amazing.
1567184855|5.0|I read the book and found it easy to read and to understand. It gave examples of what happened to other people and what they had experienced. I had also ordered a book for my daughter too.<br /><br />Maureen Pocha
B00003CXIP|5.0|I loved this movie and even though I am a senior, it is a story that will be loved by all, especially young<br />boys.  Acting is great by all, so true to life.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Good theme. The two Navaho's were able to teach the others that the Navahoe are good people with strong character traits and sincere beliefs.Both main characters did a good job with their respective roles. The effort to utilize the Navaho language and to protect it was a good theme and supported the true contribution that the Code Talkers made.
B001KSJ08Y|5.0|I love this cd so much!! It has all the great songs i love! Such a great find! Couldnt be happier
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Not until the narrator reveals that people have actually tried to include chimps in their family life, did I let myself get hooked by the improbable plot.  The story held, the constant plot twists keeping me engaged.  The sequence of narration, and the spaker's comments thereon were effective.  I love the narrato's voice, and the fact she so clearly is speaking to me and &#34;you.&#34;  More than the story, I liked the scientific tidbits and Rosemary's commentary on how the mind (human and otherwise) works.  A compelling, don't put-me-down-story and actual scientific info re being human, each reflecting on and enlarging the other:  a successful and mind-stretching combo.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Explains basic science better than ever. For instance, the answer to 'Who was the first person?' surprised and amazed me! Students, teachers, parents, and adults interested in science will enjoy the rich explanations and answers to questions we thought we already knew.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's a nice device but you can't do much with it. It has around five apps but it's new so that's what I expected. My only complaint for now is it can't play my music that I purchased on iTunes or any of the videos on my if they are not purchased from the Google Play Store. So all they need to do is fix that and add a few more apps. Then I will give it five stars.
0439023521|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for my 12 year old daughter.  She LOVES this book. She read it only 2 days!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The detailsand twists and turns are awesome.  This book was awesome!  Not a lot of battles but great stories.  Cant wait for the nect one!
0812550706|2.0|Over rated and he is a mean hateful man. Read something fun and better conceived, perhaps Larry Niven or Ursula Leguin
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It works very good for the price.  Charge both Android and Apple devices at the same time with no problems.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is the best game 4 fr ee  I would like to be able to stay up and do this all.day
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I have to compare the two books.  While Sycamore Row was hard to put down, it lacked the genius of character development of Time To Kill.  Even the main character, Jake, you don't get to know him like you did in Time To Kill.  Haillie's. character, well I'm not sure that there's been a better character in any modern novel.  So...This was a really good Grisham novel, in his top ten, but it's too tempting to compare the two books, and Sycamore Row takes second place.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|My 2 and 4 y/o boys LOVE this movie!  I also love it! My son is so attached to the Belt stuffed animal - he even sleeps with it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is epic only if it had the neather and wolf's and enchanting and other things over all this game is awesome budder budder budder budder budder budder budder budder budder budder budder budder budder budder
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|The cover design and the &#34;Reflektor&#34; are good. Other tracks sound like &#34;fillers&#34; at times. Amazon, you changed the download process yet again--need to make it simpler.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|First out, this game is set up to take your real money. You'll need to purchase parts to make machines to work (example: Kimchi Machine) and that takes the real cash icon, which is from your real money.<br /><br />I've noticed in the goals that you'll have to do, it's set up so you'll have to spend the real cash they've given you at start, to be used so you're forced to purchase more with real money. Example &#34;purchase 6 super fertilizer&#34; (this takes 1 cash icon each) then in the same goal &#34;use Super Fertilizer to Fertilize 5 times&#34; - that uses all but one that you've purchased, but you can skip for 1 cash icon, but you've already spent 6, which you can't skip. So yes, it's set up to take your real money.<br /><br />At first start of the game, it walks you through a small tutorial - during the tutorial, you'll rip right through the items that cost you real money, and they know this because they don't tell you, during the tutorial, you'll have to purchase more, with real money, to get it again.<br /><br />Graphics are cute, but all in all, it's a money sucker if you want to get anything in the end... and no, even waiting doesn't get past the fact that you'll have to purchase pieces, to get your equipment to work. ..maybe you can count on the kindness of strangers to give you pieces? doubt it though, because I'm sure, if it costs you real money, it would them as well.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love game but hate to bug friends to play.some have made comments and I don't play should be able to earn lives
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Great book! It really captures the reality of commercial kitchen life while still capturing the author's love of food. Loved it!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Disappointment was the only word I could think of.  This book went no where....it took a bad left turn and left you wondering why MS. Roth even bothered writing the third book.<br />Read the first two books, enjoy them and create your own third book. This story could have gone some where and been very good.  So, so disappointed.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie although I didn't like the ending.  Absolutely great acting by Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage.  It's the kind of movie that you keep thinking about after you've seen it.
1401322425|5.0|This book contains some of the tastiest recipes I've ever made or eaten. They can take a bit more effort and time, so make it on a weekend. Before you die, you must make your own barbecue sauce. Better than anything you can get in a bottle.<br />The recipes are grouped by ingredients, which are then grouped by growing season and accompanied by gardening information. No, I don't grow my own asparagus. But it makes me want to, one day! This would make a perfect housewarming gift.<br />I don't get the impression that this is written for novices, but the recipes don't call for any techniques that a regular home cook wouldn't have. Same goes for ingredients--between your grocery store and a good herb garden, you should have everything.<br />Must try recipes: hot-and-sour rhubarb (!) crispy pork with noodles, broccoli and cauliflower cannelloni, and spicy pork and pepper goulash.<br />Jamie Oliver's books are always full of deeply flavorful recipes, educational, and beautifully photographed. You can't go wrong buying any of them. And this one is one of his best.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|As I read the finale chapters of Allegiant I started crying like a baby, it was heart breaking yet touching in its own right.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you like being stuck in a cattle chute and forced to the purchase counter, then this is the one for you. No other choice, no other selection. Sucks.
B00F91H666|5.0|Saw the movie first, read the book second (knew there was a difference goin in)- each has its own merits and there are some minor cross overs (and I mean minor) that make the book and movie have a hint of being tied together (other than the title they share)-<br /><br />Its a well paced movie, with enough scare factor to keep it a zombie flick.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Incredible development for Ender. In-depth and well reasoned discussions on the consequences and morality of what happened in his youth. A study in the importance empathy, tolerance, and imagining others complexly.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have all but one of Michael Buble's albums and bought this one without so much as previewing a single track. At first listen, I was rather disappointed. I love all the old greats and the album sounded too &#34;new&#34; and almost cliche.<br />But...<br />Then I started to put it on for my one-year-old son and dance with him to all the songs. Bingo! That's what it's for! It's not for listening to in a dark room to feel angsty and sad. The smiles on my son's face as we &#34;cha cha&#34; and jump around are priceless.<br />I do wish Michael Buble would sing some of the less famous standards and write some stronger tracks, but oh well. The duet between him and Bryan Adams more than makes up for it.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|This was a fun, twisty, folksy thriller that kept me guessing and left me pretty satisfied. The ending \\"petered out\\" a bit for me, but I never like to see a good story end. Could be made into a decent film, perhaps?!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love this book! I've read it twice now and I would recommend it to anyone, Stephen King fan or not, because the story is so good. It's written in true Stephen King style but it's different from his other books in a refreshing way.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|A fun time had by all- if you leave reality as you sit down to watch this.  Remember its based off a kids 80's cartoon show, which was based off a toy line- I'm not bashing any of those things- I grew up on them- and its was a fun time.  The movie is an action packed, ninja filled romp around the world.<br /><br />There are moments- when the thought goes through your head- &#34;what the heck&#34;- then you remember its a movie, based off a cartoon, where things were always &#34;wow thats so cool&#34;.  Let me explain: The movie just brings the cartoon fantasy to live action, and to see some of the fight sequences and special effects brings out the &#34;what the heck&#34; thought from my adult brain, but also triggers the kid side of my brain with &#34;wow thats so cool&#34;- thats what I mean.<br /><br />This second round of Joes, does not seem as well rounded as the first batch (but thats really not saying much).  The movie has a ton of plot holes, and things get lost in the story line.  GI Joe was never meant to be a literary piece, just clean simple fun- nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />I've read different reviews (not all on this site)- &#34;they destroyed my childhood memories&#34;.  This is loosely based on cartoon show, toy line and I forgot the various iterations in the comic book world. My childhood memories are still intact, yes I cringed a little during the movie, but hey its a movie nothing more.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|It was hard to use.  Navigating the game was a pain and very frustrating.  Although I will admit the graphics were nice.
1401322336|5.0|This book has appeared on many &#34;Best Cookbooks&#34; lists, and it's well deserved. This book has taught me, as a newlywed, so much about preparing fresh, cheap and flavorful meals.<br />Along with &#34;Food Revolution&#34;, this book served as a reference library for the first couple years of cooking in earnest. There are easy-to-read guides to selecting and preparing your ingredients. The most useful section teaches you how to compose a salad and make your own salad dressings out of a handful of common ingredients.<br />I also credit this book for introducing me to leeks. The roasted chicken breast, seasoned with butter and thyme, wrapped in pancetta (or bacon), and baked on a bed of leeks in a foil tray, is my favorite recipe in the book. I've also made the classic shortbread recipe, which caused an amazed teenage boy to ask, &#34;WHO MADE THIS?!&#34;<br />If you're not on board with Jamie Oliver yet, get on it! Each recipe is written not only to deliver supremely yummy food, but to instill a bit of enthusiasm into your cooking routine. I've said this before, but he's yet to do me wrong!
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Nine year-old daughter loved it! First, it's a cool black cat. Second, she was the first of her friends to have it!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|It was a good and interesting story. It kept my attention throughout the book, actually I couldn't put it down, but it didn't leave a long lasting impression on me as Stephen King Books tend to do.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I am a fan of Diana Krall. I think this CD is her best one! Her voice is so bluesey!
B00DWAFB2C|5.0|5 stars are because no-one else is doing anything remotely good in the music business now...<br /><br />Get the &#34;vinyl&#34; format - It melts the cd or digital quality - The album feels nice in the hands and the inserts are awesome
B006LSZECO|2.0|Despicable characters.  Plot not original.  Author does have clever turns of phrase and some of the writing is amusing.  I don't nudist and why this book received good reviews.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Just when I wondered how long they could go on with this show an exciting twist was introduced.to keep me wondering what would happen next.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Access same information from all Access devices with just one entry. GREAT
B009LDD5E0|5.0|I am such a total Gleeker.  I have now bought all four seasons and I am so pleased I have after hearing about Corey Monteith.. such a waste.. at least I can watch him.<br />The only thing I would have to say is make sure it works on your DVD player... this tape didnt because of the zone, but luckily I have an older DVD player, I was able to use.<br />Amazon - it would help if you advised which zone.....other than that...if you love Glee, this is fantastic.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I loved it<br />It was great<br />Good for teens<br />Reading the series next<br />Fire, then bitterblue<br />I def ship potsa
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Sebastian is more than a story of a teenage boy who loses most of a leg because of an untreated infection. In this story we are given a look into life as it was in Vienna, Austria just before and during World War I. The Schreiber's are a non-practicing Jewish family that includes Sebastian's parents Franz and Vera, and his grandparents Oscar and Rebecca. The family lives upstairs from the store they own and operate. Franz has run the store ever since his father had to quit working due to health problems. The business is successful due to two main factors, the family are not openly Jewish and the store is located outside the of Jewish neighborhood. Their location allows the family to serve a broader customer base than would otherwise be possible in a time when prejudice against the Jewish population is beginning to stir.<br /><br />Vera is lovable in her innocent ignorance as she deals with first one doctor and then another. However, she finds strength in her anger when a new friend gives her a way to get rid of the young housekeeper leading Franz astray. Rebecca is eminently believable as the cranky old woman, bed-bound with pain and unable to contribute to the support of the family in any way. Oscar is a dear. Throughout Sebastian's convalescence, he tutor's his grandson to help him keep up with his studies. Franz is the over-worked husband trying to support a family of mostly invalids. Vera helps in the store as her health allows.<br /><br />The supporting cast of characters that surround the various family members speak to a time when communities banded together to help each other. Nurse Liesl, who gave so much love and support to a frightened young man, and later his mother when the doctor wouldn't commit to anything after the second surgery. Philip Federer, the classmate that brought classwork home so Sebastian could keep up with his assignments. The teacher that helped insure Sebastian had no trouble at school.<br /><br />Sebastian's lack of self-confidence isa constant theme throughout the story. He must begin to face that demon when his father is drafted to serve in the army. Feeling his handicap will mean he never finds love, he nevertheless does. This is a beautiful story that was a pleasure to read. The very human foibles the characters have, their fears and how they overcome the trials they face makes this book unforgettable.<br /><br />I have already read one book by this author. This book is definably Fischer with his attention to detail, his depth of character development and way of writing. Lacking the tension of Luck of the Weissensteiners, most likely due to being set thirty years prior to that book, Sebastian is a comfortable read. This book sings to me of a love of history, the time period and the characters.<br /><br />I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B00EODUWQ6|4.0|Giving it a 4/5.<br /><br />Great premise - ending was a bit weak for me. Overall recommend to any/all sci-fi fans.
0141345659|3.0|The book was later than expected but it arrived in perfect condition. I am really excited to start reading! I've heard s many great things about it!
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|Love the girls Nerf line! My daughter always plays Nerf war with us. And while she does have a bigger and more advanced gun then this. She loves the fact that they made it for girls instead of the standard blue/orange colors. I really hope they advance their girls line. I myself as well as my daughter will purchase! We are just a Nerf war family lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great!  I have always wanted a game like this and I found it. Thank you so much!!!!
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|We didn't know if the story would be &#34;suitable&#34; for a 6 yr old to enjoy, so we grandparents decided to watch it first.  He loves transformers and Star Wars-type stories.  We think it's suitable.  And we enjoyed it ourselves.  Loved all the special effects as well as the storyline.  It reminded us of &#34;Top Gun&#34;: a talented but conflicted military hero who overcomes great odds to save us all. Wish there was going to be Pacific Rim II.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Beautiful photo story, that I had followed on facebook.  I would have enjoyed if some of the fb comments were included, but understand the limitations.  I purchased 2 versions, and prefer the Kindle version, as the captions are easier to read. ( The other is a gift.)
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|fan-tabulous ~ one of the best album from Dream Theater since Octavirum. For fans or causal listener of Dream Theater, you should get this asap
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a very good and powerful book about a young lady who had the courage to stand up for what she believes in. Malala is someone who will change the world for the better. I wish her and her family well.<br /><br />Malala's book also explains a lot about her culture which is very interesting.<br /><br />This is a well written and powerful book and I highly recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|There is only one thing that can make this game better having 100000000 bananas and 16244376484700 gs. So  over wihse  this app is SO AWESOME.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I haven't kept up with all of the Kay Scarpetta novels in the past couple years.  I enjoyed her tried and true formula: a puzzling case with challenging forensic clues....and a near miss in which Kay could have been killed.  I'm glad to see all the familiar characters are still there: Marino, Bentley, and Lucy.  I shall look forward to the next novel in the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great fun great fun cool fun fun really fun great exciting lots of fun stars full of fun love it
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Beautiful movie...I saw this movie in theaters and loved it! Got it for my home collection and LOVE it! It got here really quick too!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|One of the better Clancy books with the Ryan family.  Action is good and keeps you engaged.<br />Makes you look forward to the next issue.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Got this for the grandkids they have fun playing this. It is fun slicing thru the fruit. You get caught up in it.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Hilariously sexy, romantic and so much fun to read! Tangled is a delightful battle of the sexes romp that is sure to become a classic. I absolutely adored this book and it will be taking it's place at the top of my favorites list. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this one!
B00E9A656K|5.0|This game is just flat out AMAZING! There is a huge car list for a kindle game and console-like graphics. I'm surprised this game is free when it look like its $6.99
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|Allie Brosh has a talent for making one laugh, even when describing her battles with depression. It's a risky thing to read this book in public because of the frequent urge to laugh out loud. I simply adore her stories about the simple dog and the helper dog. The simple dog has crept into my heart. The drawings are hilarious. My only complaint is that the Kenny Loggins story didn't make it into the book. That one is probably my favourite of all her blog posts. If you haven't already, get yourself over to her blog to read her other posts.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an interesting, fun game. I enjoy solving puzzles, and this game challenges me. Call me a nerd, but I play Flow Free more than I play Candy Crush.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow is beautiful in this period movie.  She is a great actress and this is probably one of my favorites of hers.  The story is typical Emily Bronte.  The cinematography is gorgeous and the costumes are fun to see.  I enjoyed the movie very much.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Great Music a soft sweet voice very easy to listen to. I enjoy Renee music greatly. I recommended this album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutly love Candy Crush. When I am bored, I take out my Kindle Fire and I play Candy Crush.
0804137501|1.0|lots of highbrow ideas I've seen fail multiple times, presented in rudimentary explanations. Got halfway through it and just put it down.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Downloaded this game for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. I am also totally addicted to it. Good strategy game.
1572816112|5.0|This is a really good deck. All major and minor arcana cards have really descriptive pictures that match the card meanings well. Not to mention the artwork on each card is unique and amazing. It's also a good deck to learn on. If you're use to the traditional Rider Waite deck the transition will be a little challenging because some cards do have different meanings and the meanings are darker as well. It does come with a tiny booklet that explains each cards backstory which was really cool.<br />There's only two flaws with this deck. 1 The cards are really long 2 They don't have that laminated feel. Other than that this is the perfect deck.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Great Music a soft sweet voice very easy to listen to. I enjoy Renee music greatly. I recommended this album.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It is just a fun, silly,quick game. Anyone can play and have fun. I think most anyone would have fun with this game and it is free!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great alarm clock app. I have not encountered a single problem. It's very easy to use and versatile.
1878424319|3.0|The idea of staying present was taken from The Power of Now. This book is okay, but does not facilitate actual personal transformation as TPON does
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. So cute and entertaining. My girls love it too. Fun for all ages. Download and play today.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book is amazing.  I don't believe I would have taken it for its full value if my personal Chinese Medicine/Homeopathic Doctor had not said that the author was not exaggerating at all.  My doctor wanted me to read something that really impacted me at my age of 64.  It did.  One thing, where certain supplements are suggested...please use good sense.  I did not, in that I did start taking Curcumin which is Tumeric.  I have tested for being allergic to Tumeric before, but did not know in what way I was allergic.  Show me, or I don't really accept it.  It really showed me.  My doctor later told me that Curcumin would not have the buffers in it that Tumeric in mustard would and if I had checked with her she would not have suggested that I take it...so it goes.  That part is eliminated for me, althought Tumeric is wonderful for others.
B00DKEN3KC|5.0|This was a good movie, I bought it to watch on a vacation I was taking with my adult son.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Best ever!!! Great sounds n robots are amazing. I love it! Monster is very creative n loved it when robots killed it.
B00B9LNK5G|2.0|Grant's voice is OK but the text is often primitive and I don't mean because of the frequent use of the fxxx word, which is fine.  The style of his texts are conversational rather than poetic or musical.  His texts come across to me as very amateurish.  I purchased the CD because DNA magazine mentioned it saying Grant uses electronics in his work.  He does but it is not creative as Laurie Anderson, Vangelis, or even Enja.  His electronic style is very retro, which I realize is hot in some quarters but I find it very dated rather than creative.  Sorry to be so negative but this CD was a major disappointment to me.  Perhaps it may appeal to a niche audience.
B00G32PQNA|4.0|The dialog was so real that it almost felt voyeuristic!  I've enjoyed seeing the evolution of this relationship.  I was thinking, while watching, that this is my generation's &#34;Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?&#34;  and a romantic couple's version of &#34;My Dinner with Andre.&#34;  Very smart film.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love playing, only wish it was easier to aim well.<br />More addictive then is probably good for my grade point average.
B001EO748M|5.0|This is a very good portrayal of the Tudor period in history.  It has good story line and good acting.  It does have some nudity and adult situations that might make it unsuitable for younger children.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|My first live concert was Pink Floyd &#34;Dark Side Of The Moon&#34;. I was about 14 years old at the time, and although it was an amazing production, I really had no idea how significant the concert was. The DSOFM DVD in this release nearly perfectly reproduces the same show that I saw back in the early 70's. If you like Pink Floyd, you will love this DVD.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Very exciting stories about Sigma force and the characters that are there in all these books. His characters are very engaging and the back stories last through each book and are believeable
0099519852|5.0|This book opened my eyes to a new way to look at learning.  It is well written and easy to read.  I finished it in two days.  Great background.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great free app. Ads not to bad. I play on it lots everyday. I would recommend this app to help pass your time and fun. Small and quick app. Game crashed a few time, but overall great game.
B005544V6A|5.0|I typically shun Television as a rule. The rehash is offensively lazy, creatively tepid, and generally &#34;lowest common denominator&#34; in the target market.  Thank Goodness for Suits - quite simply one of the best shows on Cable or TV today.  Well written (compelling story lines), excellent Acting, and the Screenplay is SUPERB.  It's a joy watching these stories play out and the actors are really afforded the opportunity to invest themselves into the performances.  How refreshing.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor and watch the pilot and see what happens next.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|Great cd! Reminded me of Issues era Korn. VERY cool to see Head back! Been a Korn fan since 95 so thank you guys! You kick butt!
B008JFUNYG|4.0|I had mixed thoughts after watching it. On one hand, I was disappointed because I expected something along the lines of the original and it wasn't. They kept much of the storyline the same--a book, recited passage, the demon in the woods, possessions and chaos, etc. But they style of it was completely different--the original was funny yet scary at times whereas this film was all serious and never felt like it was anything but a horror movie. I believe the movie was very good, especially compared to what often passes for \\"horror\\" in this era but to me it wasn't worthy of the Evil Dead name. The Evil Dead is a cult classic that people will never forget and even the inspiration for this. But I have a feeling this won't become the cult classic like the other Evil Dead movies. In years to come, people will likely forget this one much like they did the ring or the mist. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong...Just not one of those that people will still be talking about or watching 5, 10, 20 years from now like they do the original.<br /><br />In some ways, it would have been cooler if they didn't call it \\"Evil Dead\\", changed it enough to move it out of the shadow of the original 1980's film and let it shine on it's on. It's a good movie but I also feel like one of the things that hurts it is when people watch it they're expecting it to be more like the original and it's not so then they're somewhat disappointed. But so is the hazard of doing a remake.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|There was too much fluff and &#34;my lord&#34; and not enough action. Where are Sanza and little finger? I didn't like the overplay of the Wall and Jon Snow.
B0091VYG86|5.0|A favorite movie for sure! Deep on so many levels! It was quite entertaining but, at the same time made you think!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Hinton blitz is awesome on the kindle fire. I just cant put it down. Very addictive. Defiantly worth downloading. Those who love bingo will most definitely love this game.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Eye opener as to what goes on in Pakistan as well as the viewpoint of a civilian under Taliban rule.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I was really moved watching this film ...I visited Thailand this year and stayed in the area where the tragedy occurred  .It must have been horrifying ...Naomi  Watts and the lad who played her eldest son were excellent
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Next to Tetris, this is the most addictive game ever.  Except that it's even more fun and amazingly innovative. Highly recommended.
B000ION23K|5.0|is a great movie my kids love it as well as I doo we are watching it most everyday .since we got the movie my lil boy stoped mase with the ants what is great
B0028K3192|5.0|Maxwell's latest.  If you like Maxwell, get this cd.  He is a dynamic artist.  Here are six more required words.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|My husband loves to play chess on the computer, and now he can play on our Kindle Fire HDX.  Love the idea of one or two person play; I plan to learn how to play chess and (hopefully) beat my husband at the game!
B00EB6F1TY|1.0|The first two Iron Man movies were action packed and family friendly.  I found this one to be slow and deliberately adult oriented in nature.  We became so frustrated while watching it during family movie night that we finally just turned it off.  I certainly wished I had rented it before purchasing it, but I thought it would be like the first two.  This is one of those movies where you just wished they would have stopped while they were ahead.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read Ender's Game before and decided to get this version  for my kindle anyway. I love the introduction. Really brings a new light  to the story I was not aware of before. Highly recommend this book to any reader.
B001U887WE|4.0|All expectations are met. It exceded my expectations, will use it for my benefit, have lived up to what I thought was a great bargain.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing solitaire, and this is a perfect version for the Kindle Fire HDX.  Love the different levels of play as well!
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun and a little addicting, good to relax with. I like that you have options of different swords, music etc.
B0086700CM|4.0|Very entertaining, not much brain required, just quick reflexes. Perfect for idle time fun, if you like this, try Temple Run 2, it gets better!
B007C3TVNA|1.0|Awful movie, impossible to follow.....read the book instead. It's worth it ! I like the book so much, I was very happy to order the DVD. I wished I'd save my money!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Mine craft is a very fun game . But sometimes it gets really boring.in my opinion I believe mine craft on x box is very funnier than it is on mine craft. And if you get the upgrades it is even funnier.a nd less boring on the kindle fire  . I hope you think this is helpful and get the game it is worth it!!
B00902AKK4|4.0|Fun game with unique take play and nice graphics that offers lots of levels and a nice challenge.<br /><br />Google Nexus 4
8866137634|2.0|This is a pretty poor quality product.  The pages are too thin and the over quality is very poor.  Feels and looks cheap.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|I started listening to Taylor Swift in the 6th grade. Now I'm a Freshman in college and this girl hasn't changed. She is an inspiration and a role model for girls everywhere. This album was so beautiful. The title is red, because that is how Taylor described her last love. This album has some upbeat songs and some of her usual heartfelt songs about her relationships. After having the privilege to see her in concert I am an even bigger fan than before. I can't wait to see what she does next. My favorite songs from this album are State of Grace, I Almost Do, Holy Ground, and Begin Again.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Took a few listens but its one of my favorite PJ albums. The album is a great progression for the band into there older years.<br />I dont think there is one bad song on the album. Even the rearrangement of Sleeping by myself is great. From what i have heard the songs sound even better live but inst that always the case with PJ?. I would highly suggest adding this to your collection. Great album for years to come. I personally dont think the band has even put out there best album yet
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This one and the original 101 games is good to have a varity of games to play. As you play, you earn points to unlock more games. So you can play your favorite one over & over and unlock new games to try.
B002RUA524|5.0|Rereading this old favourite was a real treat. The writing, characters and creatures were as enjoyable in 2013 as they were in the 1960s, when I first read the book. Gerald Durrell wrote wonderful dialogue and mastered the art of bringing the landscape alive. As a young boy in 1930s Corfu, he enjoyed amazing adventures and the kind of freedom that would never happen today.
1590171993|5.0|This novel really is an excellent experience, and I feel it will appeal to a broad audience because it mostly refuses to pass moral judgement (there is a refreshing lack of religious involvement too) and invites reader interpretation (the absence of psychological exposition is a good and bad thing here??) - I read in conjunction with the audio-book, and it worked.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I do not like there privacy policy and the utter foolishness of reporting all activities is absolutely absurd. I signed out of Facebook over a year ago and they did not make it easy. I had to go to Google to see how its done.Facebook days are numbered and many people are dropping it. Mark Zuckerberg needs to address the issue that many of the retirees (60 to 75yrs) are very smart college graduates and he doesn't listen to their suggestions about improving the website for elder retirees. Go Twitter!!!..Go to HELL Facebook. Mark does not get it. He is getting OLDER.
B004GYY714|4.0|I love being able to find whatever I want to listen to at the drop of a hat. We have no jazz stations in our area, but that is no longer an issue.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|I love it!!!!!!! it's an excellent tv show so interesting, so adictive is a little like 1984 by George Orwell
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Is a great invention, I charge the case along the headset at the same time, I don't have to worry about damaging the headset when I'm not using it, and I only have to charge it once a week!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like this game. The only problem I have with this game is having to keep buying 5 extra moves  for ..099 which really adds up. Sometimes I feel like I am being cheated because you can  be 1 move to winning and it pops up buy more moves or end game and retry. Outside of what I just stated above the game is fun.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen's writing always knocks my socks off and Dr. Sleep keeps that tradition going.  King's writing is always so accessible and I think I can speak for the majority of Baby Boomers in that his pop culture references resonates with this demographic.  Another thing I liked about this story is that he's toned down the gore.  All in all, a wonderful read, although not as enthralling as 11/22/63, which was definitely a 5-star story.
159463176X|3.0|I loved his two previous novels, so I had high hopes for this books. It starts out beautifully and with such promise.  However, the story quickly starts jumping around in a way that is confusing even for an avid reader.  Far too many characters are introduced but not developed.  I held out hope that it would get better...and while I found beauty in the ending, it wasn't at all what I expected of this writer. That being said, his writing is still poetic and moving and the story had it's shinning moments.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|This book was a good story and it was nice to find out what happened after the Shining...but it was not quite as&#34;gripping&#34; as I'd hoped
0385349947|5.0|Really enjoyed this book!  Highly recommended for young women.  Love the concept of  &#34;What would you do if you weren't afraid...???&#34;
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Once again the British come up with another good series.  The whole crew is great and I really like watching them work off each other.  They mesh so well as a team.  Enjoy!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Absolutely fabulous music with the most handsome guys singing it! Also purchased their Christmas CD which was fabulous also.  Buy it!
B004X6PRO6|1.0|I did not get past 17 percent on my Kindle....I read for enjoyment and this was not enjoyable to me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book was awesome i loved it so uch all of the action and stuff like that and it was good
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This Cd will rank as one of Sir Paul's best.... You dont have to be a Mccartney fan to enjoy this cd. I just wish I didn't pre-order it through Amazon. I did pre-order before the release date it took 8 days after release date to arrive and this delux package did not come with any of the extra's offered if I just went to the store like target - best buy or fyi they all offered additional itesm such as the cube - or postcard pictures
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I like this app it is quick and easy to enter a word to get good definitions it has a lot of information and helpful sentences to help you to understand the word better
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Omg!!! He's Back and thank God, rap today is starting to make me weary. The only negative to me was the first couple of tracks, Stop messing with RACHET HOES Em! There are plenty of us good girls out there that would love to take you for a spin!!!! I love his music though and I am glad he came out with these new tracks, better than most the tracks in these weaves I see in the Chi these days, LMAO! I am also loving the new sound, better beats, and of course his lyrics remain unparallel. First, CD I've bought other than the Carter IV. He didn't disappoint people, invest in this one!
1449410243|5.0|Hilarious. Perfect little book for cat lovers. Its cute, funny and quick to read. I highly recommend it. Check it out :)
B005EIS5IW|4.0|Cute<br />I really don't have 19 words to say about the book. Just one word, which was already stated: cute.
6305692572|5.0|This movie was a true love story. When you have true love, you can overcome anything in life and make your marriage work.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun and funny game it can be hard at some times but keep going know matter what at least I didn't give up
B00BD99JMW|3.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br />I was disappointed by the ending.  The whole book didn't have the same flair as the others.  It was enough to keep me reading though.  In the later chapters I was getting excited about Tris and Four, finally coming together as a couple and the thought of them being able to settle in after the revolution.  But then Tris dies!!!  And along with the other people who reviewed the book, I also agree that it isn't necessarily about having to have a happy ending, but at least make her death worth while.  It very briefly states what happens after all, and isn't the outcome a lot of people wanted.  No one even recognized her as a hero besides her small group of friends.  She wanted to do something great, for the greater good, but her fatal attempt falls short.  I felt empty from the moment she died until the end of the book.  It did not redeem itself after that.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Wow What a disappointing end to such an amazing trilogy. The book was horribly boring until about 100 pages from the end when excitement started to happen. However even the excitement ended up being not much of anything and the book ended depressing. The epilogue was the only part of the book worth reading...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Awesome book loved it I wish there was more then three books I also suggest the hunger pains its hilarious....amazing
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This movie tells the story about Japan's most famous sushi restaurant, hidden in a subway station, that has received the coveted 3 star Michelin rating.  The story also focuses on the unsung hero and possibly greater talent, Jiro's son.  The  film focuses on the complicated relationship between father and son and the almost impossible burden that comes from being the son of Japan's most famous sushi chef.<br />It is poignant and fun.  A real joy to watch, this film will provide you a rare glimpse into the stomachs of the Japanese people as well as the history of sushi in a country that prides itself on providing the best.<br />The film is all in sub-titles just so you know.  But, it is a joy to watch and I think you will agree after watching it.
B00021R7N0|3.0|Funnier than I expected, but didn't care for the nude painting or extra marital affair portions so I deducted two stars.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is my favorite game, when you do something it may take a while and bucks cost real money, but if your patient, you'll love it !!!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|are you kissing me just the best game ever it also has I don't know 50 levels and at at the. end there is princess that will either kiss you or scare you or you get to suck the princess blood so cool !or you such thief blood but thief sick so you get the chicken pox!so your even
B0060D0OWA|4.0|A little bit hokey, a little bit shallow and over the top, but a very entertaining movie.  Mr. Gyllenhaal seemed to be a little subdued, at least in dialogue, but I'd watch it again, maybe give it a better review.  I compare it to Hidalgo, which was epic.  This one, not so much...  Still would give it a good rating for action adventure.  They tried to have a good lesson learned, so it would probably be really great for a younger audience.  I think a lot of adult men would be bored and possibly not at all interested.  As a lady, I enjoy all the skill with the blades, all the special effects, and all the drama and theatrics.  It's just a little bit worn out with the plot line.  Expected a bit more.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Again,  excellent read. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Couldn't put it down.  I finished it in just a couple of days. I highly recommend.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|good  storyline.  believable character.  captivating.  looking forward to the sequel.  the love story was not an overwhelming distraction.  the lead charactor grew.  the ending took you back to the beginning.
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|Although I enjoyed Desire (1976) and even Slow Train Coming (1979), Bob Dylan didn't make another album equal to the greatness of Blood On The Tracks (1975) until 1983's Infidels. Co-produced with Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, his trademark sound comes across on this record. Him and Mick Taylor provide great guitar work while Robbie Shakespeare and Sly Dunbar give the album a reggae feel with their rhythm section. After a trilogy of Christian records, this was thought as more of a return to secular music as herd in \\"Neighborhood Bully.\\" While religious imagery is still somewhat present on songs like \\"Jokerman\\" in particular but there are also themes of love and loss as well as political protest on the greed of unions and corporations on \\"Union Sundown.\\" \\"I And I\\" is a personal song that could be seen as Dylan's struggle between his identity and public image. The album ends with \\"Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight\\", a beautiful and hopeful love song that may be out of place lyrically from the grittiness of the rest of the record but it is still a nice ballad that brings the album to a satisfying close.<br /><br />A controversy surrounding the album is a few great songs were left off of it, one of them being the brilliant \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" which was later released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 3., this album would be even better if it was included I agree but this is still a worthy release from a era of mixed albums from the songwriter. The ridiculously over produced Empire Burlesque (1985) and the weak Down In The Groove (1988) were made during this period but Dylan also made one of his best records at the end of the decade with Oh Mercy (1989), that and Infidels are in my opinion the two Dylan albums from the 80s that should be in any music fan's collection.
B000VE439Y|5.0|This is my personal favorite movie of all time.  I had to own it so I could torment/amuse my friends with it.  Support The Monty Python!  Buy ten!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, I finished it within a couple of days. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a good read to escape.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really like this game. It is challenging and the sound and graphics are right on. I however, also don't like having to wait or pay for lives. I especially don't like it if I lose lives after I pass a level but want to replay it for three stars.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great film!  My wife and I decided to view the film, because the next film , in the series, was due for release.  The North Carolina mountains are a favorite of ours, due to their beauty and the great trout fishing.  The exterior scenes of the mountains were breathtaking.  Jennifer Lawrence was great, in the starring role, and I am a fan of Donald Sutherland.  I highly recommend this film for anyone that is an action movie fan.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast is perfect and has worked great since I connected it. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to watch Netflix or YouTube on their non smart television.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This book will stay with me for a long time to come, for all the right reasons.<br />It resonates and amplifies the reality also in my life that life is but a fleeting thought.<br />I know I will spend many hours to come thinking about Hazel and August.<br />Hopefully without crying my heart out every single time.<br />Thank you John Green, for renewing my faith in modern literature.<br />Just when I was losing hope.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|The book gives a really good and scary insight about what it is like for someone with memory loss. Also is a good thriller with a great ending.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a very addictive game! Lots going on to keep you hooked! Good graphics and just the right level of difficulty to keep u playing.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|This is my second copy of this CD, we wore the other one out! Zac Brown Band is the Alabama of the 21st century.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas films.  It's good year-round, but it's especially good in the run-up to Christmas.  It's ten or so interconnected tales of different kinds of love: office romance, sibling love, hetero life-mate platonic love, parental love, even childhood it-hurts-so-much love.  I won't say it's all happy endings, but even thinking about this makes my eyes moist.
B0081336FO|5.0|I like watching &#34;Elementary&#34; on CBS, and I think this show is even better.  It's a smart show and makes you think!
6305428042|5.0|As a kid born in the late 80s, this is the qunitessential halloweek movie for me. It just doesn't feel like Halloween, or even Autumn until I was this. I will show this to my future children to get them in the spirit, too!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has the light side and dark side. The dark side as done to perfection creepy and spooky. Finally a game that takes hours not minutes.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I loved this movie, it was so touching, Richard Gere played a very special part in the story. The animal, Hachi, was very, very special as well.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Great album! This Kidd Rock album has a good variety of songs and you will not be disappointed by this collection of songs.
0689835604|5.0|My 1-year-old loves this book as well as the others in the series. I purchased the 8-book Karen Katz box set at Wal-Mart for $8, so save yourself some money and go that route if available.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Another great season!  It when it said it would - marathon-ed through it in 2 days.  If you watched the first season and loved it - you have to get the second!
0062255657|4.0|Neil Gaiman's books are clever and creative though they don't always have happy endings or at least what you would consider an happy ending. I was disappointed that the book wasn't very long but other then that I enjoyed it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Reading \\"Frealess\\" was the easiest and yet one of the hardest books to read. It was so easy to become attached to Mr. Brown (Adam) and his life struggles and to hope with his family and friends for his re-birth through Christ then the Navy. Yet hard knowing how the book ended, somehow you wanted an alternate ending. Mr. Brown's life is a an example that I hope I can follow in being half the husband, father, son and co-worker that he was to those that where fortunate enough to have him in their lives. I look forward to meeting Mr. Brown when that day also comes in my life, until then I am challenged to live as He did, Fearless
B0082FPIY8|4.0|I thought this book was terrific: uplifting, inspiring, funny and adventurous. The author touched a chord with me - as I'm sure she will with all other readers..
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was ... just so much more then I could have thought . It was emotional, in all aspects. There were sad parts that made you cry or want to. There were parts that made you laugh out loud. There were parts that made me so mad I could yell. But most of all there were parts that made you rethink the way you live your life and the choices you make, or don't make. I love this book so much !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good fun, but frustrating when you're stuck waiting for more lives. The true challenge is to play without spending money.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm so sad this is the last book! I was kind of disappointed at first the the ending started to come around but once I finished it completely I was happy. Maybe a possible continuance??? I hope so! Very good
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Tells you all you want to know about the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; restaurant business.  It is well written and very humorous.  I finally get why anyone would want to cook for a living.  Funny, I hate to cook.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|More levels please! Fun game otherwise, certainly keeps you thinking! Some levels are super easy while others make you think more.
B006TLFPKO|3.0|The Voltari (sp?) and the Cullens were easily the best part of the movie (and the series), and more focus on them would have been far more interesting and entertaining than than the story line and over dramatic and poor acting of Bella, Jacob, and Edward.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I so appreciate being able to get this on my Kindle!  The only problem I have is I can't connect to Facebook, what can I do to get the site to connect?
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I got to hunt animals that I never got to hunt before. The graphics are so cool.<br />This game is awesome
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I am a complete 'Lost' fan, so it was important to have the collection for the entire series at the time.  One of my all-time favorite series.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Well, after seeing two App bugs in the first 5 minutes of setting this up (had to hunt for the accept button - white text on white background; and cannot progress past the initial baby name, sex, and birthday - the next button does nothing), it is going back. If Withings cannot update the REQUIRED app for iOS 7 compatibility BEFORE the OS is being used, then this unit is not being kept. Imagine what will happen with subsequent OS updates. DO NOT BUY.<br /><br />This is not some kids toy. It is a $250 baby monitor that I would expect top of the line service with. Not a botched situation with \\"work arounds\\" to function.<br /><br />RETURNED
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I got bored reading this. It was interesting but it just got slow and I could only read so much before I finally gave it up as a book that just could have been edited better and left out the redundant parts after she recovered.
B00EPFEZJI|5.0|One of her best records ever, as you should  hear it.  Catchy Punk and mature Rock and Roll.<br />You will find yourself singing it all day long.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Batman is always entertaining. How many times can you remake the original story?  Bale works fine as the newest knight.
B00GDFVTZQ|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of Rayman, so take this review with perhaps a grain of salt, but if you liked Jungle Run, Fiesta Run is an deeper expansion of all the same themes and concepts. To advance in the game, you need only collect enough Lums (100 in each level) to free the imprisoned creatures, but perfecting a level unlocks a harder \\"invaded\\" version. Thankfully, there are no loading times, you can quickly reset a given level if you miss up (it's a rail platformer), and the gleeful music and colorful environments make it enjoyable to grind out a perfect score. (There are also \\"gadgets\\" that you can purchase with in-game currency--the Lums--that make levels easier: the ability to keep going after taking damage, or even a guide that tags the level with helpful icons to ensure that you collect all the Lums hidden within it.)<br /><br />In a slight shift from the original Jungle Run, there's now a world map (similar to Candy Crush's, only without the pay-to-play unlocking) that maps out exactly where you'll earn art/character upgrades--as well as when you'll earn new powers, like the ability to punch, to glide, etc. This is a handy way to keep track of your overall progress--and even more motivation to keep running. (There are achievements, too, if you've linked up your game to one of the systems that tracks it.)<br /><br />There's easily ten hours of content here, especially if you're a perfectionist; don't hesitate!<br /><br />(Incidentally, I played this on my smartphone; it looks crisp and clear, even on a comparatively small phone. And there was one ad that I received upon initially booting up the game, for a different Ubisoft mobile title, Prince of Persia. Not even close to being a deal-breaker.)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|WOW! A novel that brings up the question of What would you do if you only had a short amount of time to live? Who would you spend it with? What would you do with them? A very powerful book that I think kids and THEIR PARENTS should read.
B000059590|1.0|I have made many purchases through Amazon, but this one was not a copy from a manufacturer, someone copied it and is selling it on your site.As you know, there are serious penalties for copyright infringement. I spoke to a gentleman at the FBI and he directed me to the proper division to report this.  I have spoken to your customer service department, and they assured me that this would be investigated. So far, I have not heard from them.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|If you are a ddie-hard 'Lost' fan, you need to make your collection complete.  I struggled a bit with the final episode, but if you sit and reflect, you can see where the writers were going.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I hate this game it Sucks there's no point its a waste of time you will hats it. deleted do not download it is a waste should be free such a rip off
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like it because it keeps me out of trouble and its really working thank  you so much.<br />I hope you come out with another game like this
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I have all seasons and couldn't wait to add this to my collection.  The show is full of drama, action, suspense and humor.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|If you love Dexter, every season is 5 stars! This show is always interesting and never fails to creep me out at times.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This is the first stylus that I've used and I love it. It's very comfortable. I use it to take notes with my students on my Ipad. It did take me a day or two to get used to it, but it's pretty easy to get used to. I thought the weight of the stylus would be a concern, but it doesn't have any effect on my notes. Every now and then I might have to redo a letter because of the angle I was holding the stylus, but it's not a big deal.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Great story! Reminds us that anyone in life regardless of financial status can be trapped by their own vices but in the end honesty with oneself is the only answer.
0425220931|5.0|Victor, &#34;Bass Player of the Year&#34; three years running in Bass Player magazine, has been called the &#34;Carlos Castaneda of music.&#34; This book is a must-read for musicians, wanna-be musicians, and music lovers. It is very much about embracing the universality of music, not just the technical aspects.
B000NQRR1Q|3.0|I love Johnny Depp and discovered that not all of his movies are the greatest.  It's OK.  Acting is fine, story is not so much entertaining for me.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|We watched the 2013 version of the &#34;Great Gatsby&#34; and it was OK, but what I remembered from the original, I had to get it!  It was even better than I remembered and so much better than the newest version!
B00DVKOYBM|2.0|Unfortunately this game if you don't win from the beginning then it wants to force you to buy coins. Not worth my time.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book reports on actual studies supporting the benefits of the so-called Paleo diet. The grain industry must be up in arms. It's definitely worth a read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game hate that you run out of &quot;lives&quot; otherwise addicting and good way to pass the time. Highly recommended and nice way to play with friends/ family
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game has amazing graphics and quality of the operation of the game. This game is fun and has lots of options. I suggest this game first because it is free ans the best racing game I have played.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Absolutely love this show. It's an interesting take on the villian since he's actually doing a service by getting rid of other despicable characters. I definitely intend to get the whole series. Plus they did a great job on getting guest stars who actually intrigue the viewer and are almost as popular as the title characters themselves.
B00BUKODDO|5.0|This is Burton and company at their very best.  One reason the recording is so very good is that Gary Burton himself,<br />personally was the producer.  He got every lick down just to perfection.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|It took me 2 or 3 months to get through this book.  That 's what makes it so painful.  How someone can get involved in such an unhealthy relationship is beyond imagination.  The sexual games don't offend me it just isn't something that turns me on.  It's boring and stupid and so unreal as far as human relationships evolve.  I'm sure there will be or there already is another book where they live happily ever after, but I won't be reading it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is Lots of fun,its just the thing for sitting down and  Relaxing can't wait for the next levels.  I recommend it for all ages.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Its really fun but it crashes my kindle fire A LOT. But it is totally worth it since I usually don't have people to play magic with.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A little slow to start but a good read once it gets going.  We wanted to read this before the movie came out so it was passed round to all of us.  Enjoyed by all.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The very beginning is so interesting you just want to keep reading, this is the best read by John Gresham.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another classic.  If you like Grisham this is a must read one of his best books to date.  I couldn't put this one down.  The only reason that I'm glad to be done with this one is so that I can resume with my life I haven't done anything but read this book since the moment I started it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is awesome. But  it needs to lower the prices own stuff.<br />It is still so awesome.

B00FAX6XQC|2.0|The graphics in the he are amazing and all, but honestly, there are some or problems that have been iffing me ever since I started playing games from Glu.    1.) PRICES    One issue I've been having with this game is that the items are too high priced and there isn't enough in-game support to allow you to attain something of value. Like, persay, the weaponry in Blood & Glory (talking about Glu games in general). Some items will cost nearly $10,000 or so for any type of special stuff to happen. Same for this game, but for the game to be less difficult, you'd need actual money, something some of the consumers of your games don't have. The Howitzer sniper in the game is 1,499 Glu Credits, maybe less, which is equivalent to $30.00, maybe more, and if money isn't a resource to the consumers, May the game will have support for such buys as well. Guess again. The leveling up in this game only allows 1 Glu Credit per level up and as you progress, you see that you would need more credits and leveling up is harder. The 1 Glu Credit per level is nice and all, but it's pointless after the 7th level.    2.) Weapon Variations    Okay, some of the weapons in her are nice, right? Yeah, they are, but pay attention mainly to the stats of those weapons. See the Specials, or the Fire Rate of the weapons. In the rifles, the Fire Rate will become increasingly slower, making it much harder to take down two or more targets with a lung shot before they dart off, let  alone heart shots. But what has really posses me off is that all of the weapons requiring Glu Credits (especially rifles) have a variety of specials whereas the weapons that require the default form of game currency (in-game money, not Glu Credits or in relation to Glu Credits) are... Basically.. S***.

B000IKQMFO|5.0|Acting is great, scenery perfect and a really good story. Helen Mirren is perfect and the American characters make it worth figuring out all of the other accents.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This book is not a filler in the series.  It is an excellent read with plenty happening and fantastic characters.
0345803507|5.0|This book was in perfect condition! I loved this series. I wish there were more out there not exactly like this book but similar.

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington is fabulous all the way through. The plot may have been a little predictable but the acting is superb. You will not find more gripping, thrilling seven-minute-long airplane crash scene in any other movie. It was heart-pounding and incredibly realistic.
B009RH973I|5.0|This works great.  When I first got my Kindle fire I was always worried that it was so thin and easy to break.  This makes it feel much sturdier and the feature where you can stand it up is great.  I love it.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Well I love my facebook and being able to read my news feeds on my kindle is great.  Too bad you can't play your games though.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|15 minutes into the movie, we turned it off. Really...who needs half a dozen vomit jokes, fake splattering guts, etc. before you even take the time to develop an interesting story line? I love Ryan Reynolds, but this part just left me flat. Bridges (another fave of mine) tries too hard, so his characterization of an old western lawman is too over-the-top. We've wasted too much time watching movies that we didn't like - so our new rule is \\"if, after 10-15 minutes, we don't care what happens, we turn it off.\\" Let me save YOU the 15 minutes!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The story hung together well.  Maybe a little of the rabbit out of the hat action.  Some nicely written images - but not a 'knock your socks off' literary piece.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great app. Love taking pics with this app. Easy TO use way better than others. No problem with video or any of the other complaints. Great app!
B000FC0P9E|4.0|Wasn't my favorite King book but great for reading while exercising. I think someone from Boston area would enjoy more than I did.
B005BLYSQK|3.0|Since this bargain box set is a repackaging of a similar 9 CD collection previously released by Decca, I am reposting a revised version of my original review.<br /><br />In some circles Andras Schiff's Schubert is considered indispensable. It's certainly copious. Besides the solo piano music, Schiff has accompanied tenor Peter Schreier in the three great song cycles and joined chamber musicians for the piano trios and Trout Quintet. His fans will gravitate to the 9-CD box set of Schiff's solo Schubert. Immediately it should be said that Decca's sound for this series is quite variable; it can be hard-edged and the pianoclangy and pingy. Few of the recordings are warm or intimate in sound, at least on my audio system.<br /><br />This box set would be  good news if I enjoyed Schiff's polished, smooth, almost anodyne approach to Schubert. At times his performances are like very talented sight readings. The surface is undeniably refined and controlled to the nth degree, but no matter how different the character of each piece, the pianist glides along like a swan on a summer pond. If I turn to a specific series of pieces like the first set of Impromptus D. 890 and the six Moments Musicaux D. 780, Schiff's mellifluous style brings out the music's charm. But as soon as he launches into the first Impromptu, in the serious, often turbulent key of C minor, the pianist's foursquare phrasing and indifferent expression are telling.  The second Impromptu, which could be a second Raindrop Prelude by Chopin, shows off a pearly touch, but the left hand is anemic. The flowing third Impromptu, again very Chopinesque, is pleasant enough here, but Schiff shows so little involvement that I'm baffled why he has earned such acclaim - a moment's comparison reveals the superiority of Perahia, Uchida, Brendel, and others in these very popular pieces.<br /><br />The Moments musicaux have attracted serious interpreters on the order of Edwin Fischer, because despite their inconsequential title, these are emotionally subtle, musically challenging works, considerably more so than Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words. As one would expect by now, Schiff is better at the quiet ones, like No. 2 in A flat, than the bolder No. 1 in C. But one only has to listen to his clipped once-over-lightly treatment of No. 3 and its famous march tune to feel that he isn't trying very hard, relying on an easy, assured manner to get by.<br /><br />Since Schiff is credited in some circles with the utmost in intelligent and cultivated playing, we can turn to the forbidding challenge of the posthumous sonata in B-flat D. 960. To begin with, the piano sound is wooden and unappealing, but this is insignificant compared to the pianist's solution to the difficulties of the first movement - he simply ignores them, setting a steady tempo, a dynamic of mezzo forte, and that's that.  Extolling him for such a reading strikes me as empty-headed. He proceeds to rush the sublime Andante sostenuto, missing its emotional light and shade by substituting, once more, a steady tempo and dynamic, along with his accustomed pearly touch.  The Scherzo skips along in a lively manner and isn't objectionable.  the finale displays a bit more finesse and is probably the most successful movement, even though its devoid of playfulness or joy.<br /><br />Needless to say, I find very little to admire in Schiff's approach to a composer he obviously feels a personal affinity with - his glib phrasing and emotional detachment are the opposite of what Schubert's unique piano writing demand.<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 1 in E major, D157<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 13 in A major, D664<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 3 in E major, D459<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 6 in E minor, D566<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 14 in A minor, D784<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 17 in D major, D850<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 5 in A flat major, D557<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 9 in B major, D575<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 18 in G major, D894<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 15 in C major, D840 'Reliquie'<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 16 in A minor, D845<br /><br />Piano Sonata in F sharp minor D571<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 8 in E flat major, D568<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 19 in C minor, D958<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 4 in A minor, D537<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 20 in A major, D959<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 2 in C major, D279<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 11 in F minor, D625<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 21 in B flat major, D960<br /><br />Hungarian Melody in B minor D817<br /><br />4 Impromptus, D899<br /><br />6 German Dances D820<br /><br />Moments Musicaux (6), D780, Op. 94<br /><br />Grazer Galopp, D925<br /><br />Allegretto in C minor, D915<br /><br />Klavierst&uuml;cke (3), D946<br /><br />L&auml;ndler (12) D790br />Piano Sonata No. 15 in C major, D840 'Reliquie'<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 16 in A minor, D845<br /><br />Piano Sonata in F sharp minor D571<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 8 in E flat major, D568<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 19 in C minor, D958<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 4 in A minor, D537<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 20 in A major, D959<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 2 in C major, D279<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 11 in F minor, D625<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 21 in B flat major, D960<br /><br />Hungarian Melody in B minor D817<br /><br />4 Impromptus, D899<br /><br />6 German Dances D820<br /><br />Moments Musicaux (6), D780, Op. 94<br /><br />Grazer Galopp, D925<br /><br />Allegretto in C minor, D915<br /><br />Klavierst&uuml;cke (3), D946<br /><br />L&auml;ndler (12) D790

B0074D3CAQ|1.0|I bought this book because it got great reviews. I should have read only the 1 star reviews instead because those people are right.<br />Harold Fry is an idiot who thinks it's a good idea to walk 600+ miles in yachting shoes and a windbreaker to save his friend from 20 years ago. Harold and Queenie didn't even have much interaction in the time that they even really knew each other. The characters along the way were dull, and had nothing to contribute to the story. His wife Maureen was such a pill, no wonder he decided to walk.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|“A Talib fires three shots at point-blank range at three girls in a van and doesn’t kill any of them. This seems an unlikely story, and people say I have made a miraculous recovery…. I know God stopped me from going to the grave. It feels like this life is a second life. People prayed to God to spare me, and I was spared for a reason—to use my life for helping people. When people talk about the way I was shot and what happened, I think it’s the story of Malala, ‘a girl shot by the Taliban’; I don’t feel it’s a story about me at all.”<br />From Chapter 24, “They Have Snatched Her Smile,” I am Malala<br />Malala. I write that name, and the recognition is near-universal. Like Cher and Madonna and others before her, only one name defines her—Malala, the girl who was shot by the Taliban and survived.<br />In October of 2012, awareness of Malala Yousafzai, though worldwide, exploded as the news of the attempt on her life lit up every cable news network, every news web site and the social media. She had been shot in the head, and we couldn’t help but believe that her sweet, strident voice in support of education, especially for girls, had been silenced forever. That she survived, mind, voice and values intact, is a miracle. She gives the credit to God and her doctors, and I agree.<br />I began reading I am Malala: The Girl who Stood up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban and immediately heard her voice telling the story. Christina Lamb deserves a great deal of credit as co-writer because although Malala is an intelligent, talented young woman, certainly capable of writing this autobiography on her own, when in this last busy year could she have found the time?  Instead, Ms. Lamb, a journalist familiar with Pakistan and its history, obviously completed a great deal of detailed research as well as many, many interviews in order to share not only Malala’s story but the history and culture of the region of Swat where Malala grew up.<br />I spoke of the voice in the book. It never falters. I was constantly aware of a young girl’s love and joy surrounding her family, her friends and her teachers. With the amount of historical information conveyed, one would assume that it could get boring to those of us who find history tedious. But, no. I felt as though Malala herself was whispering in my ear, occasionally putting her hand up to her mouth as she sometimes does during interviews. And the beauty of what she was whispering!  The valley of Swat appeared before me as a little bit of heaven dropped down to earth, and rather than enticing me to close up the book with a yawn, the chronicles of its people, the Pashtun, and of Pakistan going back hundreds of years enthralled me.<br />This is a marvelous book, beautifully written, and one as important as The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank. I highly recommend it, especially to girls in middle and high school.<br />At the very end of the book, Malala says, “I am Malala. My world has changed but I have not.”  I think that about says it all.poke of the voice in the book. It never falters.

B005IU1OMA|4.0|I saw this video playing on a screen at a casino in South Lake Tahoe and was amazed by the visuals.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, it is much less inspiring with the sound on. Most of the music is utter crap. There were a couple of good songs, though. I think one of them might have been the last one to come on.<br /><br />Still, I would advise you to play it on mute and maybe turn on your own soundtrack.
B00CLNVOL8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie when it first came out. When i saw it Amazon Prime, I had to let my 2 kids watch it. They really liked it so much that we also watched Sister Act 2. I am a big fan of Whoopie Goldberg in her earlier movies, and highly recommend them to anyone who likes clean fun comedy. .

There is a hard plastic/rubber stand thing on the bottom that helps the case sit flat and also adds a little more protection. Only really room for the camera and attached lens plus memory cards and spare batteries and maybe a DC cord.
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|HOLY CRAPOLA!<br /><br />Ok, ever since I saw that movie \\"OutBreak\\" Y'all remember that movie... with that little ugly monkey that came \\"thisclose\\" to wiping our butts out of existence? Yeah that movie. Well ever since then anything that's Bioterror related, anything with the C.D.C stamp on it, causes me to break out into a cold sweat. Within good reason. I'm sure you understand. So it's without question that this book had me going bat s&$# bonkers while reading it.<br /><br />The Bioterror plot is what kept & held my attention. Had me captivated & scared. Very, VERY intense. Lots of twists & turns & shock factor reveals.<br /><br />The life of the family surrounding the main characters & their plights, is what added a little seasoning to this story as well. It was interesting, but it also had me doing this a few times...<br />*WTH?* O_o<br /><br />But for most of the novel I was so scared & eager to know what was going to happen, that I was just looking like this...<br />O_O<br /><br />Yes, yes, YES... I would recommend this read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best one of the series so far! Can't wait to read the next one! Can't believe the twists and turns!
B007MDB548|5.0|Absolutely amazing movie! I mean it, really. I am a 33yr old dad, wife is 30yr old mom, and we both cried the first time we watched this (sad to say right?) Our daughter loves all things Disney because we do as well. Anyone who love Disney and has a little girl will fall in love with this story. I will not ruin any details, but needless to say, this is just as good as all the other mainstream titles (Tangled, Wreck it Ralph, and all of the AMAZING movies like Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc.) The thing our household seems to love the most is the fact that it truly tales a story that flows in and out of characters, world areas, events, and conclusions.<br /><br />A wonderful addition to a little princess' collection....and a great value to boot!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So, with the popularity of Smart TVs, I know most people won't &#34;need&#34; a Chromecast but I hang on to TVs until they die so I have two non-smart tvs in my house and these are the simplest way to get Netflix/Youtube/Amazon Instant Video on them.<br />Also, this is a great way to stream non-traditional video services to TVs (vimeo/HuffPost videos/etc). If you pull it up full screen on a laptop you can stream it fullscreen and then alt-tab away from Chrome and still putter around on your laptop. I like having 100 things going on at the same time so this is only way to do things.<br />No super long HDMI cables. No clutter. Just this piece of tech and power cord that is actually the standard mini-usb/cell phone charger style cord.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A heartfelt story of a man and a woman destined to meet for reasons neither could imagine. Jamie is an insecure farmer who spent his first ten years in deplorable conditions in an orphanage run by nuns. Lydia was the daughter of strict, critical parents, her father a pastor and her mother a joyless, demanding woman. How their lives entwined makes a touching read.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Who doesn't love the classic original untouched Star Wars and the ability to watch the messed up re-edited version....all at the same time.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Wonderful tale to start one of the most classic stories of American movie history. The actors/actresses picked to portray these characters were perfect to a tee (including Franco, who seems a bit &#34;prickly&#34; in real life and seems to have to confront that attitude as a younger Oz who is tasked with great challenges throughout the film.) This movie has one key element that makes movies great; replay value. Myself, wife, and even our daughter who will be 3 in Jan. love to watch this movie whenever one of us suggests it. The humor and vibrant colors are perfect for children of all ages.<br /><br />If you like the new live action Alice in Wonderland, or anyother live action Disney movie of the last decade for that matter, you will enjoy Oz as well.
B00849F82E|5.0|And it was enlightening!  Clear thought and rational arguments.  GK was a genius champion of Christianity.  As &#34;dated&#34; as it might seem on the surface, the discussion is remarkably apt to our own increasingly secular environment.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As Hazel and Gus fall irretrievably in love you feel it with them. At no point do you feel \\"sorry\\" for them but rather delighted for yourself to have been a small part of their lives. You will remember them and the way they faced oblivion together.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|The plot was a little weak.  Didn't like the fact that most of the movie was about the lickers.  Not a very imaginative plot if you ask me.
B00A196SE2|4.0|I love Gossip Girl! Although the boxed set is rather simple, still came in excellent, brand-new condition and one day early. Can't wait to watch it! Good deal for all 6 seasons! Other stores sell it, but often costs around 30-40% more! Free shipping to my door and came one day early. Four stars because it didn't come with a book or exclusive episode guide like other TV series box-sets. Great product, and greater show!
B00ESB6GBY|1.0|NOT THE SAME LOVEABLE CAST AS ALL THE OTHER SEASONS. YOU CAN TELL THERE IS TENSION OR SOMETHING OFF. AND MARSHALL IS HARDLY IN ANY EPISODE AND HE WAS THE BEST CHARACTER. COMPLETELY DEVISTATED BY THIS SEASON!
1451666179|5.0|Absolutely, the funniest concepts ever.<br />Bought for my teenage daughter, she loved it, so did I and now it's been lent out to friends. I hope the author continues, would be an awesome show. Good buy.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|love it Omg This was really good I suggest everyone see it  Denzel was amazingthis is definitely a must-seesimply great acting
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|From the first minute of play I was amazed at this game-  the graphics are like none I have ever seen. The people who designed this are simply brilliant, and made a classy and sophisticated puzzle-- down to every detail. I'm hooked!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse performs flawlessly, and the software you download from their website makes the mouse extremely customizable. The buttons on the side are perfectly positioned, I was worried they might get in the way and be obtrusive, but they're positioned great even for people with big hands. The mouse is a little light, but with the weights you can make it much heavier(while still not as heavy as i'd like). The LED's are a really nice touch, and goes great with my set up. My only real complaint is with the LED's; if you aren't a fan of blue, and you change the color, only the LED on the center of the mouse change, the scroll and buttons to the front do not change from blue, however this is not a big deal at all and just a heads up.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely the best mouse for the price by far, it has great response time, extremely customizable, and it feels very comfortable in my hand. Couldn't be happier with it.
B000002J1U|5.0|Just received it today!!  I love it!!  A++++!!  Awesome!!  Fantastic!!  Amazon is like a XMAS WONDERLAND!!  I will be doing all of my shopping here!!  Amazon is #1!!  Amazon has a Great music store!!  Awesome!!  best place to find what you are looking for!!  Outstanding!! :o)
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The streaming only works for Youtube and Internet Browsing. Also when watching Youtube on full screen, it doesn't work: showing just a black screen, seems like a connection issue.
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|This was a great find for my daughter's room when we purchased our new house. She looks at Rapunzel every night before going to bed.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This is a really good book and explains everything from the next 4 books which are very good books too

B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|I really liked this album. the music was sort of all over the place, but that's hat makes it fun
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Such a cute movie. Kids & parents can both enjoy! Kept my kids 4 & 6yrs entertained on a long car trip.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|Gravity is a tense, spare, visual masterpiece, which depicts Space as both beautiful and terrifying. Sandra Bullock's heartfelt performance was Oscar worthy, and George Clooney was also excellent. What I particularly liked about the film was the economy with which the story was told. There were no wasted scenes or lines. In that way, it reminded me of another Science Fiction masterpiece, the original Alien. I read that some idiot studio executive had pressured Alfonso Cuaron to add \\"flashbacks, a love interest for Sandra Bullock, and an action packed helicopter rescue at the end.\\" I am happy Cuaron resisted and stuck to his own creative vision.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is the BEST show ever!  Very interesting indeed. Wish there was more coming in the future. So sad that Mathew had to die; very sad ending!
B000OVLINI|3.0|Too little happened for me for in most of the book. Great writing and the whimsical feelings kept me interested. I would recommend this book but it won't go into my top 10. I didn't feel too attached to the characters nor were there those moments where I would let something burn in the oven to finish off a chapter.<br /><br />Fermin was adorable and Daniel was sweet. The other characters were great in description. I wish I could come up with Clara and Julian's alter ego. The adventure of finding what happened to the mysterious author was a slow climb with a big pay off. Give it a go when you're feeling up for a light read.
B0081336FO|5.0|great show, great acting, great plots. Love the modern version and all the little quirks that make him Sherlock Holmes
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the greatest horror films ever made. When I heard he was making a &#34;sort of&#34; sequel to Alien, I was immediately interested. Needless to say, this glossy, expensive crapfest was a crashing disappointment. The incoherent plot and senseless casting (Noomi Rapace?) were bad, but what was worse was the stupidity of the characters. The blue collar space truckers of Alien made intelligent, logical decisions about how to deal with the creature. As pointed out by another reviewer, the supposedly highly educated scientists of Prometheus made idiotic decisions that not even a reasonably intelligent child would make.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has a way of weaving a tale!  Love love love this book.  I look forward to her next novel!
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|i tried downloading it after many fails it worked ive been trying to play it but i keep getting a message saying its not responding i updated hoping that it would fix the prablom and it just slowed my divice down and it still dident work please fix this because i would really like to play it
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the story and how well it brought the book to life. I can't wait to see the next one!
B000002W9Q|5.0|All the great classic songs from the Dirty Dancing Movie. A great CD to add to my collection, to anyone's collection.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Good stuff, very intuitive and easy to use.  If you haven't calibrate your monitor before, don't be intimidated, it's not rocket science.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Nikon produces are aways the best. The rear lens cap I purchased fit like a glove.  I would purshase it again.
034580404X|5.0|The best  books I have read in a really long time.  I enjoyed each and everyone and wish there were more.
0793563836|5.0|I got this book to help me get restarted in playing the bass after a 30 yr hiatus.  Straight forward and pretty easy to follow
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show.  Great characters and plot.  Funny without being overly dramatic or stupid.  Highly recommended for anyone that likes time period or historical shows.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Easy setup, awesome that I do not need to deal with cables but it is not a flawless experience yet for me
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best app game ever!!! thanks for the great updates. I am always excited to see what the minions will do next!
007174889X|4.0|The standard medical comprehensive volume set.  I use when I really need to know the whole story on a disease process
0765325950|4.0|I finally finished the Wheel of Time series. I realized that I started reading this series around '97-98. I expected to be blown out of the water but wasn't. Too many plot threads left unresolved and too many seemed hastily tied up. As for the ending, I found it corny and cliched. Rand changes and no one bats an eye. He figures out the way to defeat the Dark one is to do what everyone has been telling him to do since book one. Cheesy. Still, I'm glad it's over and there's no way Jodrdan can continue writing this overly long series.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It is a quick read and of course there is no character development as its about Zombie's and a lot of death. More than anything it reveals what a pathetic<br />unprepared race we have become. That is something to consider!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great page turner, you will find yourself staying up late to read! I cant wait for the next book. S<br />The story has to continue
0634049011|5.0|Holy smoke...it teaches me things I didn't know about the fret board.  It really helps me understand how and why notes are played where they are.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game has great graphics and is challenging with every fight you do. work your way up and be the champ.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I think I messed around and downloaded this from facebook or something and I just kinda got swept away with this game. I love bingo no matter what. Its always convenient for me when I'm bored.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The author has a great ability to use the psychological mind, what if???? And to allow the reader to hear the characters internal dialogue.  That dialogue makes the characters seem very real.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is so much fun! Just like the arcade games, with more challenges such as prizes and puzzles that you can do. Definitely recommended!
B0016BP0PW|5.0|If you like the Beatles music you will like this movie. If you like the time period of the Vietnam war and the college students during that time who were trying to do what they could to stop this war you will like this movie. It shows both sides of what was going on for the students. It shows student deeply believed that with love and kindness things could change. But it also shows the omes who were trying to use this as a way to bring about violence of those who were protesting.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pros: Very fun and enjoyable and it makes you think. Cons: U don't get any clues or hints and I think u need them in order to keep progressing. This should come with the next update.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is the best book of the series. Read it. Now. You will not be disappointed in your choice. Trust me.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|First things first: If you're contemplating a Chromecast, you need to know that it essentially lets you do one of 2 things.<br />1. Stream certain compatible services (like NetFlix) directly from the internet to your TV. In this mode, the Chromecast does all the networking with the internet service. Your desktop / laptop / tablet / phone acts as a fancy remote control, but does not actually stream any service itself.<br />2. Stream ANY content visible in a specific tab of your Chrome browser to your TV. Your Chrome browser needs the Chromecast app installed (free from Google). In this mode, the system running the Chrome browser does all the networking with the internet service, receiving its stream, then re-streams it to the Chromecast which then displays it on your TV. For this to work reliably, you need a fairly modern fast processor, preferably multi-core, lots of RAM, and a fast wireless router capable of wireless-N. You'll find the specifications on Google's Chromecast page. The system running the Chrome browser deosn't need a wireless connection itself, but it does need to be connected to the router that the Chromecast is connected to. If (like me) you're a Brit, you'll be pleased to know that services like BBC iPlayer and itvPlayer work just great in this mode (assuming you can connect to those services in the first place).<br /><br />Performance: In a word (for me anyway) - stunning! NetFlix works great, and I can use my ASUS tablet as a remote. However, more important for me, even video 'tab cast' from my desktop's Chrome browser looks just as good on my 55' Sony Bravia as it does on my desktop's monitor - sound is excellent too. I tweaked the Chrome app's settings to use 'Extreme' high bit-rate, and saw a noticable improvement in high-speed motion (soccer from BBC iPlayer). It just works. Bear in mind my notes above regarding specifications. My desktop is a home-brew 4-core i5, 2GHz, 8GB RAM, running Win7 64-bit. My wireless router is a very fast ASUS RT-N66U. Your mileage may vary depending on your equipment & router. I got myself a Logitech wireless keyboard with built-in trackpad so I can control the Chrome browser from the comfort of my sofa.<br /><br />Installation: For intial installation, you MUST use a device that has a wireless connection. A desktop wired to a wired router WON'T work. I used my aging ASUS Transformer tablet just fine for this. When the Chromecast first powers up, it establishes its own wireless network (e.g. 'Chromecast1234'). You set your device (e.g. tablet) to connect to this special network. Once done, use your device to setup the Chromecast, pointing it to your 'real' wireless network. IMPORTANT: Your router MUST broadcast its SSID (network name), otherwise the Chromecast won't be able to see it and connect to it. There seems to be no way for you to manually identify a non-broadcast network (at least from my ASUS tablet). Google, are you listening? This is just plain DUMB! Once setup, the Chromecast connects to your real network, connects to the internet, downloads some updates, then reboots - ready to use. In the meantime, you can reconnect your device (e.g. tablet) to your real wireless network.<br /><br />Gripes (and why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5):<br />1. Woefully inadequate documentation. You shouldn't have to be a computer-literate person with networking savvy to get this working. It's a $35 consumer device. It needs consumer instructions.<br />2. Requires your wireless network to broadcast its SSID, even after initial setup. No other device has this requirement (e.g. Roku).<br />3. While the Chrome 'tab cast' app works well, it doesn't relay your mouse pointer or gestures to the TV screen, making it difficult to navigate the web page on the TV (at least, I couldn't find a way to do it). Note: The Chrome app is a beta version right now. Hopefully this will get fixed in a final version.66U. Your mileage may vary depending on your equipment & router.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The author has a way of forever introducing new characters and not until far into the book do you start putting all the pieces together; a pretty good read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Extremely addictive. Seemed easy as pie until I got to stage 14..or it might be 15. I'm still working on it lol. Its a test for me trying to get rid of all the gray jellies! I highly recommend this game.
0156027321|4.0|Interesting survival story but I liked the movie better. It is very slow at times to get through.Loved Richard Parker
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love it even tho sometimes my kindle freezes up. love the graphics<br />it's addicting trying to solve the puzzle by collecting items to open up the next puzzle
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Lots of fun in the beginning!  Sooner or later you have to purchase coins and/or diamonds just to play for more than 5 or 10 mins at a time.  Other than that, it's a blast.  Worth a try at the very least.  I did enjoy playing when I had the required energy to do so. The pipe puzzles are fun
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I liked this &#34;trial&#34; game and one of these days I will think about purchasing it. Its kind of crazy when u get into these games then it just stops u in the middle to &#34;buy to continue.&#34; I feel its a waste of my time.
B00125WAWS|4.0|Great video about winning against all odds and I lovel Densel in anything he does. I gave it to a girl on our school debate team.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Best bang for the buck. No problems playing processor intensive games like DayZ. Why spend a ton when this workhorse is still around. It overclocks very well, also.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|my husband loves it, he cant stop listing toit hope to find movie for him. metallica is great anyways right.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|If you're a purist you might not like this film. But people who appreciate new interpretations of classics will love this. The action is great, dialogue is interesting, beautiful cinematography, good directing and acting.
1476727651|4.0|The story picks up very briefly where The Shining left off. You find out how Danny & Wendy are coping after the hell they had endured. Danny retains a friendship with Mr Hallorann, & this comes in handy when two of The Overlook's more frightening denizens arrive in the Torrance's home...<br />Dick helps Danny to banish Mrs Massey & Mr Derwent for good, & helps him to retain some shred of sanity.<br /><br />Afterwards, the story leaps to Dan, the man, when he is somewhere in his twenties. He is just waking up after a tawdry one night stand full of sex, booze, & cocaine. After stealing the woman's money, & moving the \\"canny\\" out the reach of her neglected & abused toddler, Dan departs.<br /><br />It seems that the apple didn't fall far from the tree in the Torrance lineage; Dan is just as much an alcoholic as his father had been. He is a drifter, & holds a job for as little as it takes to buy his next bottle, then moves on, if he hadn't already been fired. He moves from place to place without a backward glance. Essentially, he drinks to suppress his shining; to keep it locked away where he won't have to face it or remember that terrible winter in Colorado.<br /><br />Over time, Dan settles in one town & is forced to join AA. His life starts getting on track. He holds a steady job in a hospice, where he earns his Doctor Sleep moniker. While at an AA meeting, Dan absently scrawls the name ABRA in his notebook, not fully comprehending why.<br /><br />Abra is born in a town 20 miles from where Dan lives. As she grows, she develops her own & much more powerful version of the shining. Her parents are at a complete loss as to how to help Abra handle her gifts, & so she reaches out to Dan, whom she has psychically sensed & located. They communicate long distance in some unique ways, before physically meeting 10 years later. They also have a friend in common, whom helps her family reluctantly accept the bizarre meeting of Dan & Abra.<br /><br />Throughout this, the True Knot is introduced to the story. They're psychic vampires who have been around for centuries. They hunt & literally torture to death any child they find who has a gift like Dan & Abra. They call this essence steam, & it provides them with longevity & replenishes their body & overall physical health. It is during the torture & murder of one of these children that Abra first unwittingly becomes linked with the True.<br /><br />These freaks are headed by Rose the Hat, who, when she learns of Abra, will stop at nothing to find her & harvest her steam. This eventually leads to a final confrontation at the actual site of where the Overlook once stood. It forces Dan to stand up & face his demons, while attempting to save not only Abra, but himself.<br /><br />I do not want to give more away. I really enjoyed this book, & plowed through it. It is creepy. Sinister. Yet, not able to top The Shining in the fear element. I ended up liking Dan. I hadn't cared for his character much in The Shining, & wouldn't have been upset if Jack's roque mallet had done its work.<br /><br />One of my issues is with the True Knot itself. You never really learn how they came to be as a group, or as quasi immortal. It is noted that they have been around for centuries, but not much else is given, aside from how they have blended into society. Their nicknames for one another didn't bother me, they were merely odd.<br /><br />My other slight issue is the title itself. I don't care for it as a book title, nor as Dan's nickname at the \\"hot spice\\". I understand why it was given to him by his cohorts. Something about it just bugged me.<br /><br />All in all, those two issues are minor, & didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book. I like Abra. She is a fresh, tough, spunky character, & it would be nice to read more of her one day.
B00E7SXPVW|5.0|I like the extra songs that were never on the album like sappy and I hate myself and want to die. The second disc remixed is excelent.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love the game but hate the time wasting ads. Guess that's what you get with a free app. Will try the purchased app to see if it's better.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This is a fun movie! Typical Hollywood summer blockbuster with a lot of fun thrills, nothing extremely new and innovative or beyond normal. It's not a really scary movie, more action and special effects. Made for the everyday person.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a fun game. Stores your data for the most part when you uninstall. It's a good quick game. Best with an internet connection.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|Kept thinking some profound idea was waiting for me just around the corner, it drew me in but in the end felt like a long read that did not, ultimately, speak to me.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|It took a few listens to fully appreciate how good this recording is. There are some truly fine songs, the best of which is, arguably, &#34;Survival.&#34; Some of the songs show some maturation in Marshall Mathers' personal life. In the first cut, &#34;Bad Guy,&#34; Marshall Mathers kills Eminem. In &#34;Headlights,&#34; he apologizes to his Mom for badmouthing her and blaming her for his problems, puts the blame where it belongs: his Dad, who left Marshall and his Mom when he was only two months old and never sent child support money. Marshall now says he understands that this forced his Mom into the position of having to be both mother and father to him, and he forgives her for her shortcomings. Make sure you get the Deluxe version of this recording. The extra five tracks are worth it.
B007SUW24W|2.0|For girly fans of John Mayer, Gavin degraw, Dave Mathews, Jason mraz, dido. This is girls feel good music.<br /><br />It's the typical sweet guy singing soft songs about sex, being drunk, melodrama, drugs, relationships with horrible rapping girls will like. Reminds me of late 90s music. All the teenage girls will have a crush on this guy for a few years and make a joke of it when they're older when he's forgotten. There is so much more better music out there, sadly people here really don't care to seek them out. Real music with real innovation like bjork, the knife, m.i.a., yeezus by kanye west, sarah mclachlan, nine inch nails, pink Floyd, grizzly bear,tool, beach house, the xx, deftones, foo fighter's \\"skin and bones\\", my morning jacket, m. Ward, and more. Seek them out, you'll never want to go back to this boring \\"been done\\" music made to sell to immature hopeless idealistic romantic teenage/college girls.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|This game is fun to play. There came a level I was never able to figure out, so I gave it up. I would download again and retry if there weren't other games I currently was playing.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|we all need to be reminded of what can happened. Everyone needs to understand what occurs when countries ignore dictators and the agonies they impose on their people

B00EI4V3X2|2.0|FINAL EDIT:<br /><br />After some use with games and movies, I've come to the conclusion that this headset just isn't worth the money. The build quality is just not good. At first it didn't bother me as much, but after a week it's become seriously annoying. You can just tell that it's not a quality product - each component is probably the cheapest available option. It felt like I had spent a lot of money so I really wanted them to be good but they just weren't...<br /><br />It does it's job \\"okay\\" but, in the end, it's not worth $150. It just isn't. I bought a pair of Sennheiser's that will work with the PS4 and the difference in sound is unbelievable! The best part? The Sennheiser's were $50 cheaper. So that's where my PX4 experience ends. Turtle Beach is officially on my list of \\"popular but poor quality brands.\\"<br /><br />I'm returning my PX4s on Monday.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I bought this in anticipation of the PS4 release. I've been using it with my PS3 in the meantime.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />For a headset, the sound is pretty darn good. If these were standalone headphones, then I would expect better for $150, but factoring in the wireless capability and the mic, I certainly can't complain.<br /><br />The surround sound works well - it definitely gives you that cinematic feel.<br /><br />Since it uses a wifi signal, the range is excellent. There is no signal distortion or anything of that nature.<br /><br />They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.<br /><br />EDIT: Adding detachable mic to the pros list.<br />EDIT: Adding battery life to the pros list. The battery lasts forever and charges relatively quickly.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The build quality could be a little better. Nothing's breaking, but the plastic is cheap and the WiFi box feels hollow and far too lightweight.<br /><br />Getting these to work with the PS3 was actually a challenge. The instructions don't clearly show how to set everything up. In the end I realized that I needed to hold down the \\"pairing\\" button on the WiFi box while also holding down the power button on the headphones. That was the only way I could get them to actually connect. While this is definitely not a deal-breaker, it can be sort of annoying.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />This is a decent headset, even for the price. I would go so far as to recommend it to anyone looking for a gaming or cinematic wireless headset. I wish the plastic was better quality, and I wish it was heavier, but other than that everything is built pretty well.<br /><br />The lack of proper instructions was annoying. There isn't even a PDF on the Turtle Beach website, which is something that really should exist. Still, with some trial and error, I figured it out.<br /><br />All-in-all I like them and look forward to using them with my PS4.<br /><br />Cheers.

B00003CXBK|4.0|A Miyazaki classic. The images from this movie will stick with you forever, even if the moral threads are left a bit loose by the end.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|It was upon request to read this classic. The request was simple. To identify ones self from another's point of opinion. The vain psychology of you, predisposes is a stain. Summoned from gentry to wild passion or the lacking of. To me the book identifies my pleasure with listless excitement. Demise seems closer as your youth follows folly careless precision. This precision follows a mad desire.The desire to understand ones self  through Oscar Wilde's meandering psyche. A very good read a must for vanities sake an a pleasant read.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I bought this movie for my son's 4th birthday party.  Good news is the DVD arrived in good shape.<br />Bad news is since we watched it on TV the swear words were sensored.  Whoops!  Didn't realize the swearing until we watched the DVD.  Still a classic movie and I love that my kids love 80s movies like I did growing up.
B00FDSV4TA|5.0|This is not a far stretch for Chester given his other solo Album,but for fans to lock players in one band well this is why you don't draw a box around your favorite band, This is a match made on the charts for the new STP release and i hope to hear more of this new power group.. Just when everyone said the 80's were dead with power groups and new bands behind a frontman were over.. Many new projects have gotten the same review like Scott Ian from Anthrax formed his power band with nothing but more to come so lets all hope this will continue a undeniable trend of new music and excellence...
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I enjoyed it, but seeing the show on Netflix I thought I would find out more about the backgrounds of the other cellmates.
B008NW67E0|2.0|Very very very slow.  It did not keep my interest for very long.  I did not like it to much.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I pre-ordered No More Hell to Pay from Amazon and found the cd waiting in my post office box on the release date (November 5, 2013). I was cautiously optimistic as I downloaded the MP3 version via Amazon's Autorip feature. But, believe me, my fears were misplaced.<br /><br />Upon my donning my earbuds and pressing play, I was totally blown away. It was suddenly the mid-eighties again and the Yellow and Black Attack were back! From the heavy crunch of Oz Fox's lead guitar to the Michael Sweet's flawless vocals, the members of Stryper are once again in their prime. Fox's riffs are heavy and melodic, the lyrics are decidedly Christian and thought-provoking, the drum and bass work is steady,  and Michael Sweet's vocals have never sounded better. This is simply their best album yet. I give it five very bright stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and does not get old.Its really fun when you compete with your facebook friends.I give a five star
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  I actually learned some things about how the law works in a murder trail.  I recommend it.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Let me start off by ignoring the wireless aspect. This is a great a headset, its comfortable, its durable, it sounds good, the 7.1 is great the microphone quality is quite good. Along with the capability of programmable buttons (that I admittedly don't use much) its one of my favorite headsets I've owned. So whats the problem?<br /><br />Well....its wireless. How is that a bad thing? The wireless aspect of the headset makes it so incredibly finnicky. There are times either by interference or who knows what my headset is reduced to a paperweight that does nothing but blare high-pitched tones and static at me for upwards of 30 minutes a time. Other times my headset will decide to randomly turn off even when the batter is fine. From what research I could conduct, apparently if the headset has trouble talking to the bluetooth receiver it'll automatically shut off. Suddenly this headset that at times can be 30ft from the receiver can not go 18 inches.<br /><br />While its possible that I got a defective product or that I apparently live in a high-interference environment, it just spoils this great headset. And it seems the problems I have are relatively widespread on the logitech forums with the general support response being &#34;I don't know&#34;<br /><br />In the end, i'm giving this headset a very generous 4. Because take away the wireless aspect and I have literally no issue with it. My point of this review is you need to ask yourself &#34;Do I really need a wireless headset?&#34; If your answer is no, you may want to consider getting the wired version and not having to worry about things like interference and battery charge.

B00G6HW8II|2.0|I'm slowly trying to learn Hungarian, so I foolishly buy almost every Hungarian language app that comes out.<br /><br />This one, like most of the others, is next to worthless is you really want to learn a language. It just gives you mysterious phrases to memorize. Let me explain.<br /><br />Consider the Hungarian phrase \\"Jó napot kívánok\\", which translates to \\"Good afternoon\\". Most apps, this one included, just present the phrase and tell you nothing more. So you have no idea why \\"Jó napot kívánok\\" has three words, and \\"Good afternoon\\" has only two. And you have no idea which Hungarian word corresponds to which English word. That's no way to learn a language.<br /><br />Now consider the best Hungarian learning tool I've found so far, the basic Pimsleur audio CD course. Unfortunately, Pimsleur relies solely on audio dialogs and has no written material.<br /><br />But Pimsleur includes the details! When it comes to Jó napot kívánok = Good afternoon, Pimsleur also tells you that jó means good, napot really means day, and kívánok means I wish. Pimsleur further tells you that kívánok is used in formal conversations, and is often omitted in informal conversations.<br /><br />It takes Pimsleur only a few seconds to explain all that. And now the user knows so much more! There is no reason why any app can't do this.<br /><br />There is a second major flaw in apps like this one. They put the vocabulary in ridiculously large groups. For example, the Hungarian \\"First need phrases\\" section here has 27 entries. So before you can even begin practicing (using the exercises), you have to learn 27 new words and phrases.<br /><br />That is just not reasonable. A language app should give you five to ten new words to study at a time, then allow you to practice using just those words.<br /><br />So, yes, I'm very disappointed in Language Coach. But I will give the developers of this app credit, and two stars, for one thing. They included many different kinds of practice exercises. That was a very good idea.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was exceptional.  I couldn't stop reading it from the beginning.  It was very sad and it brought me to tears at times.  It was a truly wonderfuly book.  A must read.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|One of the better modern era horror films.  There were plenty of creepy moments.  In some ways, it reminded me of the horror films from the 1970's.  I remember watching The Amityville Horror when I was eight or nine on cable TV.  It scared the heck out of me.  This film is in the same vein as Amityville, The Changeling and The Exorcist.<br /><br />Not as good as The Exorcist, but I would definitely recommend.  If you enjoy supernatural terror, this one is for you.
B00D1X0576|5.0|Does what it says it will do, hence the 5 stars I give it. As with most apps I download, after a couple of days I never use them again, so it is with this app. It's there if I ever want to use it.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed this book to a large extent. I constantly felt interested in the book the entire time. The only problem I have in the book is that the very beginning is confusing and difficult to understand.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad the kindle app store finally got this app. Its my favorite game.  I think Amazon and Kindle are doing a great job giving customers value added applications and services.

B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Boo!<br /><br />Very neo-victorian moralistic message. I should have judged the book by it's tea room cover and not it's great reviews.<br /><br />(strong) Moral: Your guy may be a killer or a cheat, but stay with him for the good of your six year old kid. Since I relate to the average six year old better than the adults in the story I would say, &#34;kill the toxic relationship and let the kid sort it out in therapy later.&#34;<br /><br />Children aren't cotton candy and haven't we learned already that you can't stay together for the sake of the kids?<br /><br />Boo! Boo!

0670024856|5.0|This captivating fictional saga focusing on the Whittaker family begins when Henry, a poor young boy is banished from England to sail with Captain Cook in the late 1700's. His job is to collect botanical specimens for Kew Gardens in London. This journey changes his life and the destiny of his family. Henry finds the adventure and riches he desperately seeks and begins his future in the new world of Philadelphia where the Whittaker name becomes everything he'd ever dreamed. He settles on a magnificent estate called White Acre and summons the world and all its riches as he pleases. Alma, his daughter has the intelligence and wit of her mother Beatrix and just a touch of Henry's drive. Suddenly when Alma had believed with all her heart that the study of botany is everything she'd ever need, she finds she wants more, she wants love. This novel takes the reader through decades of change, some the most interesting history of the modern world. Scientific discovery at its very best. The authors research was extensive, years and true love of botany must have accompanied Ms. Gilbert on her SOAT (as its been nicknamed) journey, the characters are phenomenal and captivating. Descriptions are meticulous. But, my fellow readers, I must tell you, it is LONG. It requires time and patience to complete. 500 pages. The writing is excellent, it is the polar opposite of Eat Pray Love of which the author is most famous for. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Well done Elizabeth Gilbert, WOW!  [[ASIN:0670024856 The Signature of All Things: A Novel]]

0761158820|5.0|Our 7 and 9 yr old children love these monsters! The stories about each monster are very entertaining, and after making the toys they are fun to play with. Some of the difficult ones required a bit of adult assistance, but the instructions were clear. Recommended for a unique gift.
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|An apt subtile for PACIFIC RIM could be &#34;It's exactly what it appears to be.&#34; Del Toro's latest film depicts an invasion of giant monsters (kajiu) and humanity's defense with giant robots (jaegers). It's mixed martial arts on an epic scale. Oh, sure, there's a story told between bouts where ever more imaginitively designed creatures from the deep engage increasingly cooler robots in constatntly larger, more destructive street fights. In one, the jaeger uses a naval destroyer as a bat! The characters and story are predictable and cliched and yet...I liked them. Sections of the story, involving Charlie Day (as a scientist with a clue on what the monsters are up to) and Ron Perlman (as a black marketeer specializing in distribution of extracts of kajiu body parts) play like a live-action anime. Del Toro has clearly thought out his universe. It's a simple puzzle, but the parts fit nicely. Additionally, the film is appropriate for younger viewers, 9 and up, who aren't that afraid of their own shadows, Any romance is chaste and any gore is limited to the blue goo running through the kajiu bodies.<br />Unfortunately, extras are limited. There are several 'making of...' featurettes, but they are quite short. It is well known that Guillermo was to direct The Hobbit until problems at MGM dragged on so long, the window on his schedule closed. With the release the the extended Hobbit, we get to see the gold standard of Special Editions. For now, PACIFIC RIM goes wanting in that regard, resulting in fewer stars from me.
0440243688|5.0|THIS RATING WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE ITS THE HIGHTEST AND THE BEST RATING I COULD GIVE LEE CHILDS AND JACK REACHER
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really enjoyplaying this game. It has great graphics and is fast paced enough to keep you on your toes. but I can't. stand it when it kicks you out and takes away your points and/or doesn't give you the points that you have earned. if y'all could fix that then I could give it a five star rating.
0316055433|2.0|First, I have LOVED reading this book.  However, I reached page 746, and the next page is NOT 747, but 647, with the remainder of the book a duplicate set of pages 648 through 695.  I will wait to replace my copy and finish reading the story before posting a bona fide review.  This is so disappointing!
B000WCDBKM|4.0|If you liked &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34; and the &#34;The Seventh Sign&#34; you'll enjoy this. A mystery that is sort of spooky and hints of demonic powers. I'm not particularly a Johnny Depp fan, but he was very good in this.

0385523912|5.0|One of the best nonfiction books I've read.  Gives readers an astonishing look at ordinary people's lives in North Korea, the most repressive, and maybe the most dangerous, country on earth.
0307341550|1.0|I liked reading Gone Girl so I immediately read Jillian Flynn's other books.  The setting in this book is so stupid and unlikely that I, not able to write directly to Jillian Flynn,  wrote the editor a letter about the silly way she described the town and setting.  The book says there are about 3000 people living in the town and it is not a suburb or even close to a large city.  She describes the town as having many graceful Victorian houses (there would possibly a few in the size of a town) and neighborhoods of McMansions (her words, not mine and not likely to have \\"neighborhoods\\" in a town that size).  She mentions several restaurants and bars (also too small to have several) and the silliest thing in the book is the ladies at the white-tableclothed restaurant mentioning that a Gap was coming to their small town.<br /><br />Ms. Flynn is from Kansas City and lives in Chicago.  It would not be hard for her to venture 45 miles from her city to a small town to find out what rural living is really like and then develop her town and her characters.  I have also been to the bootheel of Missouri, her setting in the book, and there are no similarities between actual small towns there and the setting in her book.<br /><br />Her lack of research made the story so ridiculous I began to laugh at the book instead of taking anything in the plot seriously.
0393343405|5.0|Fascinating book. Mr. Grenblatt shows the book hunters in the 1400's, gives a look at the times, and tells how some of the Roman writers returned to relevance and significance after nearly vanishing. Again, fascinating.
1465414444|5.0|Just got his today.  It's a Xmas gift for my son, who is a World of Warcraft player so can't say whether he likes it or not yet. But I think he will. It's got beautiful artwork.  A great WOW gift
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers that the two points of view in the story were not truly distinguishable, which is a shame, since Four's character had been drawn pretty strongly in the first two books.  I also think the twist ending was disappointing.  Similar to the Hunger Games, I think the author went overboard on the \\"war is hell\\" theme at the expense of the reader's satisfaction with the story.  Maybe that's because it's YA and she wants to drive the point home.  But I think there were too many gratuitous character deaths.  I also think the genetics plotline was thin.  All points others have made.<br /><br />I tore through these books and was sorry with the way it ended.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I absolutely loved this, I am going to go back and read it again. Inspiring, motivating and also has some really interesting and  useful concrete suggestions for creating. Even my hubby who is not pursuing a career in creativity read part of it and got really inspired.
B00F031WB8|5.0|As a veteran guitar player of four decades, I still view Hendrix' music as being relevant today.  I can't listen to one of his songs without discovering a new riff.  He is one of the greatest players in history.<br /><br />The film is excellent.  They went to great lengths to find material that explained where this guitar hero came from and what drove his musical ambition.  He pretty much played guitar every waking moment.  His guitar became an appendage of his body and its voice was the voice of Hendrix' soul that still speaks to us today.  I'd recommend this film to everyone because I love his music so much.  I'd recommend this film to every aspiring guitar player, too.  If you want to be one of the greats, this is the path you must follow.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|It lasted six years and it was adventurous and surprisingly eventful. With Walt Disney and ABC Studios behind the wings, we were expecting a family series and yet at the same time rather strong in plot. And we got what we expected. Right to the end and I must say this last episode “The End” was not disappointing but totally artificial to give the last kick of life with and to a happy ending though clearly beyond death. The bucket had been kicked a last time long before and everyone was lying alive and well at least six feet underground. That final magic was possible because of two elements in the series, the first one being the axiom of it and the second one being the result of a systematic treatment.<br /><br />The axiom is that we are stepping beyond the real world into a world that is antipodean to anything we know in real life. It is done with a plane that crosses the wrong line one day and crashes on an island that is not listed on any map. This is close to Stephen King’s Langoliers. Planes are tricky and they can cross such magnetic limits between here and over-there, I mean the real world and the other side of it that is just as alive as ours but in an inverted terrible way with a few holes in the hedge for some rabbits to come in and out.<br /><br />This island is a traditional myth in American culture and you will like it tremendously. It is a permanently tropical island that is, as we finally learn at the end, volcanic and there is some kind of a cork on top of the lava tap or hole that could destroy the island with a volcanic eruption that would restructure it completely. To make that lava hole or tap a menace to the whole world is maybe excessive but it is magical because we have always been fascinated by this volcanic reality and we are struck with fear every single time we hear about such an eruption. The island is in fact a series of islands, at least two and they are a microcosm of a world in which several projects have been carried out and on which several populations are living in the most hostile way possible.  The themes of the series and this island are numerous.<br /><br />First a mad science project, the Dharma Initiative that wants to sound Buddhist or Asian and that wants to harness the natural and powerful energy of this volcanic force for the improvement of humanity. First it wants to control the inner force so that it would no longer influence the world, cause catastrophes. That would require the presence of a permanent colony of scientists and technicians to fulfill the task. Other crazy scientific projects exist like about the case of the fertility of women since on this island all pregnant women who were impregnated on the island will die and the baby along with them. Some scientists are brought onto the island to study and solve this problem.<br /><br />At the same time different people are helping up that initiative or lurking behind it because there is a profit to get out of it, a commercial profit, a scientific profit that might become commercial, etc. The economic vultures are roaming around and over this island. At the same time there could be a medical profit for it because people are cured of their diseases and healed of their wounds on this island, and yet that is not that simple since at least one, Benjamin, develops a nasty cancer there and pregnant women die of their pregnancies. But it is true Benjamin goes out of the island regularly because there is one simple and single way to get out of it: with a submarine. Another mythic element that sends us back to Jules Verne and his 20,000 leagues under the sea.<br /><br />There are older populations too. First a shipwrecked pregnant woman who will give birth to two twin boys will arrive one day on the island, be saved by another isolated woman who lives away from some local population that lives in very primitive conditions. The latter woman who delivers the two boys kills the mother and raises the two sons as hers. One will remain faithful to her, Jacob; one will move to the other inhabitants and will start building some way to get out of the island. The woman will destroy the village and kill all the inhabitants. Then Jacob will confront his nameless brother, kill him and send him into the volcanic hole that produces light and this brother will be transformed into a smoky revengeful spirit who will only try to get out of the island. Jacob has to select a candidate for his succession because he knows, sooner or later, his brother will manage to find a way to kill him, which happens soon enough.<br /><br />This nameless spirit can take the form or appearance of a dead person and he uses that trick to assume the body and identity of one of the wrecked passengers from the plane.<br /><br />Another group that is, as such, rather short-lived is a marooned group of US soldiers who are safe keeping an Atom bomb that was abandoned here. The point is that this group is led by a certain Richard who becomes the direct associate of Jacob and as such eternal (???). Another is named Whitmore who wants to get and take possession of the power in the island to make a profit out of it. Later on a certain Benjamin arrives and will have Whitmore expelled from the island.  This Benjamin was the son of a member of the Dharma Initiative and he will cross the line and go to the US soldiers grown more or less wild, and then with these he will eliminate the people of the Dharma Initiative and he will take their equipment over with the US soldiers and Richard as his own troops.<br /><br />Then several lines will give Richard a very old origin and bring a Black Rock sail boat on the island, a sort of slave ship. Another scientific mission will get marooned here too and one woman will survive and give birth to a daughter who will be stolen by Benjamin and his troops. You add a couple of polar bears in this tropical island, just for fun, and a lot of boars for food. You make Whitmore plot his come back to recapture the island, the desire of the smoky spirit to get out off the island, the intrigues coming from Jacob to select his candidates and successor, and many other events to make things more complicated and even bring a real jet on the second island and you will be lost in translation, and you will enjoy it.<br /><br />The second interest of the series is the survival techniques of humans who don’t seem to know what cooperation and democracy mean as soon as they are in an emergency situation. The relations between the various members of every single group are explored in detail and what’s more they have plenty of opportunity because Benjamin causes a severe disruption to the time line of the island that can shift from one time to another, going back 30 years at one time, while the real world is going on three more years. Those who had escaped had a real like during these three years and most of them are brought back thirty years back onto the island and they manage, without knowing what they are doing, to bring the island back to the time of the main catastrophe that is simply erased from the world’s record and then we have the characters leading normal lives in Los Angeles at year zero while the escapees from the island live a life that goes up to year +3, while on the island, those who were trapped there are living in year -30. And there the escapees from year +3 manage to get themselves back to year -30 where they meet those that had stayed behind on the island and had been transferred thirty years backward. Imagine the situation.<br /><br />That’s the most important fact of this series, the systematic treatment of the plot and story. It uses all kinds of flash-backs and flash-forwards without any real pedagogical help. We navigate from one time to another, from one group to another, from one place on the island to another and we little by little build a consciousness that gets all the time more abstract and less respectful of any time line at all. We are becoming time-obsessed timeless viewers who enjoy living in some out-of-time meta-time that is like the time line of Mars and Venus merged together forward and backward. This is possible only because we are watching a TV series. That kind of timelessness is nearly impossible with the cinema for instance and would be very difficult with a book. As for that it is a very good TV series because we are able to remain afloat in a time treatment that should drown us in a sea of pebbles bombarding our brains.<br /><br />The last remark is about life and death. One cannot live but with the memories form the past and what happened, happened. These recollections, even when they become unconscious are always present in your mind and they come back in some flashy impulses sooner or later and repetitively. This is quite true and Sigmund Freud would agree but it is maybe slightly too behavioral for anyone’s normal taste. People seem to be more or less doomed to start all over again their own mistakes and their own behaviors and actions. The absolute symbol of this impossibility to change is Hugo who no matter where or when he will be fat because he has become fat when he started overeating when his father left him and his mother. The coming back of his father, the winning of a lottery, his sojourn in an island where there was no fat and no chocolate bars, though they managed to get some with the left over resources of the Dharma initiative, he manages to be running around and having an extremely active wild life and yet he does not lose one gram.  But James “Sawyer” is not better. Jack the doctor is just the same, etc., etc. The best character in that line of behavioral limits is the only Black character and his son: traitor by definition, he betrays several times, manages to sell his companions in exchange of his own return to the outside world, and he will of course find himself in an impossible situation that will lead him to signing up with the wrong chap, Whitmore actually, and finding himself signed up too with Whitmore’s arch-enemy and being the saboteur employed by Benjamin within the team employed by Whitmore who are supposed to go to the island, recuperate Benjamin and destroy everything and everyone.<br /><br />I would not say this is racial prejudice but we must say minority people are not exactly saved. There is only one black woman that is worth anything, but she is married to a white dentist.

And it is revealed they are all dead, which explain why Claire’s son Aaron and Sun and Yin’s daughter are not present: they had been entrusted to other living outsiders in the real world before the mother Sun and the woman Kate who had taken Aaron under her protection in the absence of the mother Claire who had stayed on the island.<br /><br />Then we come to this vast idea that life is death in this real world and death is life on the virtual side of this real world. We can live happily ever after because we will die and be reborn in full bliss on the virtual side of this real universe, in other words we will be reborn in the cleaned up and conflict-free recollection of the island of extreme adventure and dramatic tragedy. We can see how Walt Disney and their authors are mixing, for all faith alike, but not quite for all human ethnic groups, the Christian, Buddhist and Islamic visions of life after death and life before death reunited in one single reality that does not know what a time line is and prefers a timeless tiered spatial reality.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Unbelievably poor product for a major company like Google. The inability to redirect audio to &#34;airplay devices&#34; is a major flaw in this product.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, follows the book accurately.  I'm looking forward to the next movie. Would reccommend parental review bfore showing to sensitive children.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|(I'll try not to put any spoilers in here)  Although this isn't necessarily the ending I wanted, I thought it was a very good, heart-wrenching end to this series.  I enjoyed the way the book was written from both Tris and Tobias’ point of view.  I couldn't put the book down and sacrificed sleep so I could finish it quick!  I am a little embarrassed to admit this but the ending had me balling like a baby from the important Tris chapter all the way until the last page (sorry, trying not to give anything away)!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I bought this cause it was free and it looked dumb as in the title and I do reveiws but this is one of the funniest game that I have ever played and comes with a awesome music video that teaches you not to play by trains and listen to them.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Love the combination of actors and the premise of the movie.  Maggie Smith and Judi Dench do not disappoint!  Love the setting and support cast.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Liked it. It was challenging. I like the fact that you can find stuff or play a mini game instead.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Please update it. glitches are really bad like if you stand still it flashes. a tutorial would be good for new crafters, too. But survival doesn't work very well. It won't let me pick up items after I craft them. please fix! :(
B000067J1Q|5.0|I bought this to replace the video.  Wonderful classic movie and well preserved on DVD.  Love the opening panorama, great remembrance of my trip to Salzburg.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|This is &#34;Men In Black&#34; with the dead. Jeff Bridges is always worth watching, but the rest of the story is ho-hum.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Not bad got slow in the middle but real good in the end. I would recommend it part for history and part for just decent reading

B005S9EJ14|4.0|Im only giving 4 starts because the movie was absolutely excellent!!! Its a wonderful movie that will change anyones perspective. Judie Dench and Maggie Smith did a fantastic job on this movie. It was amazing and tear dropping. However the box it came in was very light plastic and seemed to not be put together right
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|If you followed this case as it was publicized through the media when Jaycee went missing, you will definitely be interested in reading the real and personal details that she provides in this book.  You will be disgusted and sickened at times about the treatment that she was put through under her captor, but I think she shows her bravery in publishing the sick details of her lost childhood.  It's amazing how a child who went through what no child should ever have to suffer, has grown into an adult with a greater understanding of life and triumpant spirit.  Read it, i urge you.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I liked how they tell news story events, and how it is represented to the public Their concept in news reporting is very informative and dealt in depth.
0399165274|4.0|I love Forsyth, but this was not one of his best. It did not have his usual detail and insight.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze Runner is a great book for teens and adults.  The plot is mysterious and full of surprises.  I found the book to be a page turner and I could not put it down.<br />The story takes place in an area called the Glade that is surrounded by a maze.  A group of boys (the Gladers) are trapped in the Glade and none of them have any memory of their old life.  The Gladers don't remember any details about themselves except their names.  The boys have made a life for themselves in this terrifying place, and their only hope of escape is to try and solve the Maze that surrounds the walls of the Glade.  The Maze is a dangerous place, filled with terrifying creatures that are half monsters and half machine.  These creatures are called Grievers, and they exist solely to sting the boys with a deadly poison.<br />I constantly found myself wondering how the boys got trapped in the Maze, and really wanted to know if they would be able to get out.  I really identified with the boys and wanted to know what was going to happen to them.  Overall it was a great book that kept me in suspense.  However, my only criticisms would be that it was difficult in some parts of the book to follow what the boys were saying because they used a lot of slang, and throughout the book James Dashner sometimes did not do a good job of helping the reader visualize the Glade.  Overall the book was great and the ending was surprising, depressing, and made me want to buy the next book.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I like this movie.....I have close to the entire series so I watch them very often...I am waiting to see if there will be another one
B00E9PMMPI|4.0|the blu-ray transfer looks great in HD. it has held up well and was as awesome as I remembered fr childhood
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I find it to be a great game of strategy as well as giving me the opportunity to use my brain.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|well worth your time. Has the same fell of hunting, but its free! I Ma in love with this game.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Pretty fun so far, and it has really good graphics for a Kindle game. It runs a lot smoother than most other high res games.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|A story requiring a clear head and attention to detail in order to keep the plot authentic - well done - a riveting read!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Wasn't quite what I had expected.  Enjoyed the action and the tension.  Kinda surprised that this was only rated PG-13.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|A concept with great possibilities, but tediously executed after a while; good special effects; effective filming, but ultimately tedious; I wanted it to be over
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A sensitive and well written novel.  While dealing with a tragic situation, the humour and pathos feel real and well balanced.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've. been playing for a couple hour's. its very addicting<br />I would recommend this for anyone one maybe keep an eye on the little ones tho they could spend real money if they hit the right buttons
B00ETHPJ1U|5.0|It's great that we now have so many versions of this wonderful music, where previously there was very little. We tend to forget how forgotten this music was - virtually nobody knew BWV147's &#34;Jesus bleibet meine Freude&#34; (Jesu, joy of man's desiring) until Dame Myra Hess started using it as an encore in her concerts in the 1930s. Now we have Harnoncourt/Leonhardt, Rilling, Koopman, Leusink, Gardiner and most recently Suzuki. Something for every taste and pocket, traditional, HIP, modern instruments, &#34;old&#34; instruments, contraltos, counter-tenors, boy sopranos, the works.<br /><br />I collected this entire set as individual sets as they were released by SDG. SDG meant &#34;Soli Deo Gloria&#34; (to the glory of God alone), which was how Bach signed off his cantata scores, but it was also apparently &#34;sod Deutsche Grammophon&#34;, after the famous falling out with Gardiner over its refusal to issue the set, which led to Gardiner doing it himself. I'm pleased to see that there seems to have been an element of kissing and making up, because this set includes four non-SDG pilgrimage releases, which DG Archiv issued. So, everything that was recorded on the pilgrimage (plus Vol.28, the Ascension Day cantatas, which were recorded later) is available.<br /><br />So, what commends Gardiner over the competition? Nothing really - this will always be a matter of individual taste, and the dedication of the others to this wonderful body of music is no less than Gardiner's, and their approaches no less valid. And of course there will always be individual cantatas where one will prefer someone else's version over Gardiner's. Bach is said to have liked brisk tempi; Gardiner, with a choir that appears to be able to perform miracles on command, seems sometimes to take it to extremes and not allow the music to breathe properly - one example is the wonderful opening chorale of BWV137 (the hymn still sung in churches as &#34;Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation&#34;), which is, to my ears, taken far too fast. However, these instances are overshadowed by all the times that Gardiner (to my ears) gets it dead right - the marvellous BWV140 (&#34;Sleepers, awake&#34;) is done to perfection. Overall, the standards of performance and recording are extremely high, and Gardiner's thoughtful analytical essays on the music are a pleasure to read. Bach's deeply-felt Lutheranism was at the core of his very being, and therefore of this music; Gardiner understands this completely and seeks to bring this out in performance, and in general succeeds admirably.<br /><br />In short, this is an outstanding set available at an outstanding price, and it belongs on the shelves of every Bach lover.ation&#34;), which is, to my ears, taken far too fast.

B009POHHPS|3.0|The problem with Flashpoint, for all its hype and &#34;universe changing&#34; implications, is that at its heart, it is a tired old time travel tale. It just didn't feel as engaging as (for example) any of the DC crises. It felt like an Elseworlds story that you read, enjoy, and forget.<br /><br />So yeah, someone (and it was a surprise to me just who) is messing about with the post-52 timeline in the DCU, and Barry Allen wakes up to a world completely changed. Thomas Wayne is Batman, dealing with the consequences of his son Bruce being shot down outside an opera house... No one has ever heard of Superman, and Aquaman and Wonder Woman are at war. Hold your breath... the world is about to end.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the title is a convenient excuse to merge the DCU with Vertigo and Wildstorm, the story lacks soul. Sure, there are several character variants and moments that are well written, and the art is great as well... but if you've seen Back to the Future 2 or (insert favorite time travel movie/ story here) you're familiar with this one.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Barry Allen as the 'returned' Flash you might like this. I liked him in Blackest Night. I thought that crossover justified his return better than the title I didn't care for at all - The Flash: Rebirth. Flashpoint is somewhere in the middle. Not as good as Blackest Night, not as bad as Rebirth
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I loved this book. It was so very different from her others. I love historical, botanical fiction and it fit the bill with a romp through nearly 100 years of one family and the height of botanical exploration. Highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm hooked on this game. It's awesome! I just hate it when I run out of lives and have to wait!

B00BUVPIRS|1.0|I bought it for my Kindle HDX 7\\". $6.99 at the time.<br />A new game looks great up until your character can run forward. Then it rotates the game upside down.<br />Locking or unlocking the auto rotate screen setting has no effect on stopping it from being unplayable.<br /><br />Rotating the Kindle just causes the game to flip upside down to you again.<br /><br />I deleted the game and then re-downloaded it. Same error making the game unplayable.<br />Waste of money in my case.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|This is a delightful book!  The story is simple, but well expressed.  It has great illustrations and may capture the attention of children up to age 7.  I think the age group 3 - 5 may be slim for the entertaining nature of this tale.  Other reviews detail the books narrative, but I want to highlight the thinking my son did as I read it to him.

He's a great classic actor, never (that I can think of) did he play in a movie that had &#34;questionable&#34; content or could/should be referred to, as &#34;inappropriate.&#34;<br />I wish there were actors like him today. He was a charming, funny, romantic and just a nice guy in every movie I've ever seen him in. I think I've seen just about a good thorough chunk of them.

B009NQZVKG|1.0|Typical boiler plate &#34;thriller&#34; with a predictable plot and cardboard characters, although there is a bit of interesting history incorporated. Bad guys are hard to kill, good guys make amazing escapes and the novel plods on.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez is modest, full of good cheer, and honest about how romantic relationships can be doomed, and how your heart can become permanently shriveled by them. He isn't sentimental nor self-pitying. He also doesn't seem to be impressed by the huge reputation as a musician and a poet he inspired for forty years in South Africa, now that he's aware of it. He continues to do physical labor in the abandoned homes of Detroit, a now bankrupted and destroyed city, regardless of his newly building reputation in the US and Europe. He's a true romantic, with a profound understanding of the tragedy of love.

B0052TDGQO|4.0|Can't wait until he starts recording his own music, but understand the promoters were in a hurry to release this after he won American Idol. &#34;Water Tower Town&#34; is great, and something you can relate to if you grew up in one!
B009RWPAA2|4.0|The songwriting on this album is really good.  I believe they cover new ground and new sounds while still retaining the Deftones feel that was first fully realized on their &#34;White Pony&#34; release.<br /><br />As far as the actual mastering and mixing of the music goes; though, it is a bit of a let down.  I purposefully did not pick up the CD when it was initially released because I knew the songs were over-compressed to a point that I would end up not listening to them anyway.  When I found out the compression of the vinyl was supposed to be less than what was experienced on the CD, I made sure to pick it up as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, while the compression appears to be a bit less than the CD, it still doesn't give the listener a rich, full, dynamic experience that one would hope for.<br /><br />Is it worth buying?  If you are a fan of Deftones' past music I would say yes.  There is nothing groundbreaking with the quality of the sound here, though.  They can do much better and have done so (Around the Fur is pretty dynamic).
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely. Interesting twist.  Actually had me contemplating how most people would react if placed within this senerio.
B00F2362IE|2.0|This game seems to freeze up a lot and my son hasn't even really played it yet. My husband and I downloaded this on his tablet that he is getting for christmas and were messing with it to see if he could play it but it was already freezing up and having issues playing. My kindle is the 16GB edition so we have plenty of memory/space on it. I was kinda disappointed seeing that we paid 3.99 for this app/game with the issues we are having. I am leaving it on the kindle for my son so we will see I know he would love the game seeing how he absolutely loves TMNT but if it keeps messing up we will delete it and lose out on the 4 bucks. My son is 3 1/2 and I am sure he will be able to operate the game without any issues.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Perhaps I'm biased. After all, I wouldn't be married if it wasn't for Allie (true story) and I've met many of my dearest friends because of our shared love of all things HAAH. Either way, I was so excited for this book that I read it in a couple of hours while loudly cackling to myself, and I pointed out so many passages to my mom that she pretty much read it, too. The dog chapters were my personal favorite because I have simple dogs and a Fun Police helper dog, but I don't think there was a single piece that I wasn't happy with. I don't mind that some of it was from the blog, because I love those stories to bits. My only regret is buying the kindle version. I wish I had a hard copy now that I know it's a rainbow.

B008602KQI|4.0|Exciting and intriguing.  Make me eat 2 bags of popcorn before I knew it.  Recommended for a rainy/snowey day with the fire a blazin!  There you go chief.
006202406X|2.0|A boring completely predictable book.  No new ideas here.  It fell flat like the Matrix trilogy, first story awesome... Second story good, builds up story... Third, reality worse than expected story. The book felt forced and unoriginal.  We don't need the book from fours point of view, we just need him to be the man with four fears, not the insecure idiot he becomes in this book.<br /><br />I recommend saving your money for the first and second movie.  Make up your own happy ending.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Cameron Diaz is hilarious in this movie. I wish I could've had a teacher like her. Not to mention what Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel add to the comedic storyline.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|If you liked this, you might like Alan Dean Foster's &#34;MidWorld.&#34;<br /><br />In my opinion it is very different. The Natives are green.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|This is an awesome book it has helped already with so many issues.  A must read if your working on personal improvement.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Full of heart and feeling.  No other words can describe it better.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|All their music is just stellar!  This cd is probably my favorite one of theirs.  The music really hits you hard.  You can't help but to love it!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Love this movie and in 3D is even better.
1937053571|5.0|Holy Demi-Gods! Jennifer Armentrout has done it again. She's delivered an exciting, fast paced, thrilling, swoon worthy and action packed ending to one of my favorite YA series. I love the rich Greek mythology that really came to life in this book. Some of the Gods even have a sense of humor (Apollo).... who knew. I like how Jennifer made the mythology come to life in Sentinel. It was fabulous. Seeing the Gods and the characters in this book together was awesome. Literally. They bring the action, danger, and taking those thrilling scenes to a whole new level.<br /><br />I don't know what I can say about Alex and Aiden that I haven't already said before. Alex is just as feisty, and snarky as ever. I love that she can be this fierce butt kicking heroine and then have this sensual and snarky side. She's strong when she needs to be, and I love that she has learned to not only trust in herself, but in those who are around her and love her. Aiden is the one that's grown the most in my opinion. I love that he's learned to loosen up more. For his part, he's still that scary, don't piss off Sentinel who wouldn't hesitate killing someone who harmed Alex. Even though he can be a force you don't want to mess with, I love his protective side. His love for Alex is undeniable and yes, totally swoon worthy. I love that he lets her do what she's fated to do. Even though he doesn't agree with everything she does, he lets her be her own person, and supports her in that.<br /><br />Then there's Seth. Oh Seth! Yes, I am Team Seth. In saying that, that does not mean I'm not Team Aiden, because really I love both guys, and I'm Team Alex. But I seriously I totally love Seth! He pushes Alex like no one else can, and I loved seeing how much he's come to care for her. And it's funny at how much he can also push Aiden's button. Let's be honest, it is hilarious to read about Seth and Aiden's bickering over Alex. Also, I KNEW IT when it came to Seth in this book!! I had my suspicions about some of the things he was going to do and I was right! Those things, meaning his true intentions and his choices came to light in this book. No I'm not going to say what those are, as you'll have to read the book. Seth totally shows his true colors in this book, and I swear I loved him even more so for doing that. Don't worry,  he doesn't compete with what Aiden and Alex have, though I do love the bond that Seth and Alex have as well.<br /><br /> One of the things I've loved about this series is the character relationships Jennifer has created. The supporting characters play such a huge role in this series and I love how they've all come full circle. I feel like with each book the characters have not only grown stronger, but they've grown closer together. Even if some of them don't like each other, they grow to have this unease trust, if that makes sense. I've loved reading the snarky things they say to each other, the humor that's every present, the heart felt moments & heart ache they've shared, and sacrifices they all made for each other. Not to mention the swoon worthy moments that each book has had it's share of. Yeah.... those! Jennifer's characters are characters I've come to care about and love reading about.<br /><br />What I wasn't excepting with this particular books is some of the gut wrenching things that happen and are discussed, especially between Alex and Aiden. It definitely made the two of them look at their relationship on a more serious level. It also gave the over all storyline a more mature feel to it. Not that the previous book didn't have that, but there's a lot more at stake in this book than the previous ones, and it needed to have a bit of a more serious undertone to it. There's a lot at stake for everyone involved in this story.<br /><br />I'm normally a reader who needs closure with an ending of a series. There have been very few books where I was okay with not having everything wrapped perfectly, because it fit with the story. This is one ofthose books. I thought the ending was great, as it focused on Alex. Yes I wanted the other characters to be present for the ending, but as much as I wanted that, I felt that it wouldn't have been as fitting to have them there. You'll get what I'm saying when you read the book. They're there, just not physically in the scene. The ending of this series focused on the two people it needed to. In my mind, the other characters's stories continue, while I know how Alex's and someone else's ends. It's beautiful and gives me the closure I need while at the same time has me wishing this series didn't end.<br /><br />If you're a fan of this series, Sentinel is a must read! *There are well written, non graphic sexual scenes, mentions of sex, mild language and the discussion of teenage pregnancy in this book. I will note that the characters in this book are 18 years & older and are mature characters.those books. I thought the ending was great, as it focused on Alex.

B00B52F278|5.0|Great ending to a superb series!!  If you like your violence, drama and sex &#34;over the top&#34;, then this is a must have.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super fun and addicting! My 4 year old loves it, we take turns. He usually gets more turns, he says he wins!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't stop playing. Diffidently recommended. It's addicting but in a good way. A good game to have on my computer and phone.
B000WD66BM|5.0|Had to have all their cds.  It's like an addiction.  Once you have 1 nightwish album, you have to have the rest.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  So fun to read a book from the male point of view.  Drew is a great character, he is fun, and grows on you as the book progresses.  If you want to laugh, cry a little, love the people in the book, read this.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Good movie the plot was ok but I wouldve liked to have seen more story line besides blowing ships up.
B00FAODMNS|5.0|I have ordered this case because my previous hard case made my new iPhone 5s feel bulky. So I decided to try this snugg leather case for protection. I have to say it is even better than I had imagined it would be.<br />My phone is protected from possible scratches  in my purse and I have a small outside slot for drivers license or credit card for a quick dash to the store or gym.<br /> The phone slides up with the pull of the magnetic strap for easy retrieval and access. The leather case is not bulky and feels nicely compact yet soft. The phone is securely held in the pouch when in the purse.<br />I have received many compliments from friends and strangers.
B006O2QNOU|3.0|Though it was a good story and well acted with a seasoned and capable cast, it was not quite s good as it could have been.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books are amazing and anyone who likes fantasy should read them. I couldn't put these down, I'd have to read and then promise myself I'd do something productive after a chapter, many lost hours of sleep with these great books.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Excellent job of this game<br />LOVE it going to play this game for a few days atleast to see how it goes
B0068THAGY|3.0|As predictable as a Spielberg picture can be. Overtones of Goonies and the like. Entertaining but definitely for the younger set.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons: A song of Ice and Fire is amazing. There is a cliff hanger at the end that eats me up inside and I can't wait for the next book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A good game. It lets you be creative. Also I love the idea of making your own village. It really seems as if the characters are rite there in front of you.
1419705849|5.0|My 9 year old read the whole book the day that it arrived.  I think it gets a big thumbs up for that - first time he's ever done that :-)
B00AQMQBKK|1.0|If you win the 'toss', then the glyphs you need show up quickly. If you lose the 'toss', no amount of re-draws, special powers, or other items will bring up the needed glyphs.<br /><br />The only game mechanic is a random number generator. Everything after that is fluff designed to fool you into thinking you have the ability to influence the outcome.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this to come on my kindle fire and I played this mostly all day thx so much for bringing this game on kindle fire
1582406723|5.0|The Walking Dead is an awesome comic about zombies taking over the world. Read the comics and watch the show, they're different from each other and both excellent.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I downloaded Candy Crush to see why my oldest daughter plays it non-stop. It is fun and I find myself returning even I'm frustrated about not getting 3 stars on the levels!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I love this movie, you can't go wrong with any of the Toy story movies. Perfect for big and little kids alike.
B005VT42BS|5.0|It is one of the few things on this kindle that doesn't make me wish I had bought a galaxy tab.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is awesome if you can get Facebook on your kindle fire cause this game is also on Facebook and you cant play most of the games on Facebook anyway
B008PUF3VS|2.0|While the basic idea of having the Camp Commander's boy meet his death, replacing his Jewish friend, the details of the story are overly contrived and do not ring true.
B004EFYZ1C|2.0|Doesn't do anything that other apps don't do better for free. Used it once for a couple of minutes then deleted it.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This is one of the best manning apps that I have played. Challenging,with many different layouts. Like the easy to see tiles.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game! Don't listen to bad reviews those peeps just have slow devices! Very fun you could play it for hours
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Very insightful and reassuring regarding the behind the scenes interactions of previous presidents as they perform the most difficult and stressful  jobs in the world.
B0009UC81A|3.0|It was an OK picture but prefer the second one more. I got tired of the car chases in this one but the music was great.
B003AMAOW4|4.0|Weird seeing Wagner's Lohengrin in modern dress and seemingly set in the 1920's, once you get used to it that really doesn't matter because with any Wagner operas what matters is the music and the singing, in this version the singing is totally superb, Jonas Kaufmann as has been said before is the successor to Jon Vickers, he is the epitome of a Wagner tenor, lots of power extremely pure tone and he can act, he is the tenor of this century what is more he can sing anything, I have him as Cavaradossi in Tosca and he sings the mezza voce just as brilliantly as the high powered notes, Anja Harteros is Elsa and what an Elsa she is absolutely brilliant a truly fabulous soprano with the power and the presence made for Wagner, Wolfgang Koch is a Telramund who really is demonic in his demanding the charges against Elsa, Michaela Schuster is a really nasty piece of work as Ortrud, the way she goads Telramund into trying to destroy Elsa is frightening in her actions that really show that she is going to do whatever it take to destroy Elsa, the rest of the cast is just as excellent. The only thing I can say about the orchestra under direction from Kent Nagano is absolutely brilliant. Once you get used to the modern dress this has to be the cast and the production that Wagner himself would have chosen.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|We adore MLP:FiM in our house and own all the dvds. So of course when this came out, we snatched it up. I was hesitant about it since high school drama is not high on my list of things that entertain me. Nor did I want my kids to become interested in petty drama. HOWEVER - this movie was a wonderful surprise. As you would expect, it is more about friendship and the importance of all the characteristics that make up the elements of harmony. I think there is a great lesson about bullying that I even reference when talking to my own kiddos (7 and 5 yrs old). &#34;Do you want to be a bully like Sunset Shimmer?&#34; &#34;No, Mommy!&#34;<br /><br />I really love the way the Mane 6 friends are translated into young ladies. Great animation, great lessons, great songs. If you love MLP:FiM, you will love this!
B00CTT9646|4.0|This is a great gift set with a nice display of the phaser.  Mind you, the phaser does not have light/sounds/controls of any kind, even though the &#34;barrell&#34; does spin like in the movie.  The plastic stand is sleek looking, but it is cheap plastic.  The bluray is great, the extras are nice (not superb, just typical interview/behind the scenes stuff), and the packaging is adequate.  If the phaser (and it's cheap plastic stand) were made a little better, and the bluray had some more extras, I would have given this a five star rating.  But if you love the movie like I do, and want to have a nice phaser display (not for cosplay), then this is the set for you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fault in Our Stars was such a sweet but sad book. I probably shouldn't give away the ending but it was just a touching way to end a beautiful novel. This is one of the few teen fiction novels out there that love in an unique way. High school love is one thing but when people so young have experienced so much in life, it sets an entirely different tone.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|After reading Hosseini's other books...I was disappointed in this one.....Maybe, I was expecting more... a hetter story line?  I kept putting it down and not picking it up for several days....then had to go back 3 Chapters to get the  story back...too many characters and too many &#34;time&#34; changes.
B00004CXYO|1.0|I have received this DVD that says it can't play because of a regional code error. I do not understand why this would even be sold to me if it can't play in my area.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great plot twist ending<br />A can't wait to read the next one<br />10 out of 10<br />Expect the unexpected yep
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Well-written, literary novel with depth of characters, moral dilemmas, and realistic scenarios. There were a few moments when I'd had enough of the characters' day-to-day lives but it moved on quickly enough. Loved the way certain truths (such as long-term marriage) were portrayed.
B00785P2QC|5.0|But still a great game. For being free you will get everything you want from Sim City. I just wish it had natural disasters. Fires are fun and all, but I want a tornado, or volcano.
B00GHIX46G|2.0|I saw a meme the other day that sums the show up nicely, \\"Super secret government agency... puts their logo on EVERYTHING.\\" The show walks too many lines without being anything at all. It's supposed to be suspenseful but is also chock full of lightheartedness. It's fantastical, yet our main characters are all humans who we never see at the peak of their own performance (i.e. special agents that never fight anyone). There's an element of intrigue, yet it only appears in select episodes and when it does it's not very well done.<br /><br />Basically, this show falls victim to trying to be everything while succeeding at being nothing at all.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A beautiful story of personal growth and grief. Enjoyed the blend of story with historical information on the trail. Great summer read.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Heard a lot about this game but am dissappointed that you have to pay or ask for help or lives.  I will probably remove from my kindle.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|The dictionary could be a bit more fun and interesting. For children to want to look in the dictionary more often then just asking someone what does this mean.
B00E8S2JZ4|2.0|I've been trying to sum up how I feel about this movie for a long time. I think that there were some good scenes (the introduction of Smaug and the fall of Erebor, the battles against the orcs were excellent, the trolls were funny). However it carries on far too long, the musical scenes should have been completely cut out along with 90% of the Elvish scenes, the goblin action scenes are some of the silliest action I've ever watched, and there is a massive problem with the story.<br /><br />**Spoiler Ahead!**<br /><br />If Gandalf can simply summon eagles at will to carry the group anywhere they want to go without limitation, then why not use them all the time? They were constantly being attacked on land by stone giants, trolls, goblins, orcs, and then at the end **POOF!** he summons giant eagles to fly them all much closer to the mountain, saving time and even more anguish. If I were in that group I don't know if I wouldn't put a sword through that wizard's belly the next time he went to sleep. What a sadistic jerk!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive challenging  you will find time in your busy schedule to play this fun game with the restful music and bright colors of candy all your senses are pleased.
B008476HBM|3.0|I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it to just about anyone. I don't wanna give away too many details about the plot. Excellent read!
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|Helen Fielding's newest instalment had every possibility of being an epic failure; taking an already much loved character, classic plot lines and disastrous/hilarious situations and throwing it on its head! Bridget is back, as clumsy, accident prone and muddle headed as ever, in an excellently crafted addition to the series. From the first, kindle typed page, I couldn't put the book/ iPad down - invested in every word, every movement in Bridget's new journey. Recommend to old & new Bridget fans - I promise you won't be disappointed.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|All episodes have been digitally remastered and looks great. Great pilot episode, &#34;The Cage&#34; with Hunter and Leonard Nimoy. Great collection and great deal.
0525953728|5.0|This is a great read. Captures your thoughts and allows for you to seem to be in the picture painted by the author, draws you right in to the story. I do not see why anyone would be worried about this book revealing any top secret military maneuvers, training practices, or weaponry - it doesn't! I already knew about everything like that is talked about in the book. I live near Joint Base Lewis/McChord - we know a lot more than most the people in office do apparently! I highly recommend this book.
B00447G29S|5.0|Our family LOVES this movie...We watch it all through the year as well as at Christmas. So they were very excited to see it in 3D.We were not disappointed...The 3D efftects take this movie to the next level!!!! We felt like we were a part of the movie...This will definately be at the top of the movies we watch over and over again for the holidays....AMAZING!!!!!
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I have bought Melissa & Doug's reusable sticker pads for my son, my daughter, and 2 birthday parties in the past month.  They are a gem, because they are a great price and SO loved by children.
1451666179|5.0|This book was amazing. Thanks, Allie, for making me laugh about s**** things. I don't think I've ever read a better description of depression. All around funny and honest book.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|Cornwall's Saxon Tales was a great series but this story was a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />I started reading Cromwell's &#34;Archer&#34; series and loved all three of the stories for their historical and geographic scope. The Saxon series, by contrast, are all set exclusively in England. But the tales are good and the characters both believable and likable.<br /><br />But this one seems to me to be getting a bit formulaic.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Besides the moments of the plane in distress, the rest of the movie was average! Not sure how this was academy award worthy.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|A nerd's fantasy come true. Every geeky thing you loved growing up becomes party of a grand puzzle.<br />The story is rote and somewhat predictable, but the enthusiasm and imagination of the writing more than make up for it. A very fun read.<br />If you are in any way a nerd, I recommend checking this out.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intelligent an funny...though some of the solutions these guys come up with are a very long shot!  Great entertainment, and a little bit of education about the legal system as well.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This story could never happen today. Before we had the ability to search for people using the internet two South African men decided to investigate the cause of Rodriguez's death. Rodriguez is an American singer/songwriter whose music was described by many South Africans as &#34;the soundtrack of their lives.&#34; All of this takes place between 25 and 30 years after Rodriguez recorded and released two albums. This is the story of the search and the unexpected results for all involved.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|Loved the show.  Kept me engaged the whole time.  The characters and dialogue were very real.  I hope to see other movies from this director.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|A good waste of time.  I love puzzles, and pulling out a kakuro puzzle every once in a while is a nice diversion.  The interface clicks nicely, and doesn't get in my way.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is one of my very favorite King novels. I've read The Shining probably over 10 times and each time not only does it scare the crap out of me, but I seem to enjoy it more than the previous reading and take more out of the story. I not only love it for the story itself, but because it takes place in my home state of Colorado starting in Boulder and then moving up into the Rockies. Sidewinder is a fictional town where the Overlook Hotel is located, but if you visit Estes Park, Colorado you will find The Stanley Hotel on Overlook Drive which is haunted as well ;-)<br />I just finished reading Doctor Sleep which is the follow up novel to The Shining and I am really happy to know where Danny and Wendy landed after the Overlook and Sidewinder.<br />The Shining is a superb and haunting tale and for those of you with a little 'shine' in ya, I know you'll connect with this book that same way I did.<br />Enjoy it!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|what can I say?  The books are brilliant,  tried on Kindle and then,  went out and bought the entire series in hard cover,  I love how kindle is portable and easy,  and its a lower cost if you wanted to try a book if you love it,  then go buy the hardcover, George RR Martin,  he is the best author,  one of my all time FAVS,  he ranks with Tolken, the hobbit,  lord of the rings.... and he is my favorite!  Tolken and George RR,  what a tie!  both brilliant!!!  if you are watching the Game of Thrones,  you can do yourself the best favor ever!  READ these! they rock!  NO doubts,  YOU will love them!
0316322407|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I strongly admire Malala and the person that she is. The book opened my eyes to the culture in Pakistan, similar to the way that Kiterunner opened my eyes to the culture in Afghanistan. A very well written book and great read!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|So far this is a fun game!  Hope it continues to be fun and relaxing.  I like games that are not too hard just to relax and unwind.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Could not get it to work and this let me and my 6 year old down because we both are big fans of the Minions......
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read the entire series because my wife likes to talk about books she reads and she encouraged me to read them.  However, it seemed that the story line jumped all over the place and it ended very abruptly.  It was an ok read but, far from the best I've read.  If you haven't already read them, I'd suggest the Harry Potter books.  I'm also reading Eragon, at the moment and it is a much better read.
B005DZ35RC|1.0|We love this move and had recently lost our DVD copy, so we ordered this to replace it.  Unfortunately, what we were shipped was a USED/OPENED and REPACKAGED copy of this movie.  The cover was damaged and it did not come with the factory seal over the side opening.<br /><br />I have to say that I am pretty disappointed that Amazon would ship this product as &#34;new&#34;.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Awesome performance.  You still have it Brad.  Good to see that your still ahead of the game in this competitive business.  I also dig your cool swagger.
0307744434|5.0|So so good and imaginative - I loved this book. So imaginative, so rich w/beautiful images. Part love story, part mystery, I savored every second of it. The audiobook narrator is a bit over the top, but that just kinda lends to the other-worldly feel of the story and he does a great job w/the different character voices. I really hope the author writes more - either continuing this story or a different one. i will be buying it!
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Very different.  Gives spirit of hope for youths.  Good to see successful actor spending time with his son to introduce him into the business and provide a new generation of entertainment.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|A horror/exploitation genre fan must-have!  Gruesome and disgusting, yet poignant and satirical.  The film will leave you questioning your sexual conceptions, your morality, and your decision as to what movies to watch.  Keep in mind that the film is highly stylized: do not expect a realist approach like most cannibal movies.  The cinematography is almost over-done, such that it takes you out of the movie.  But, who's to say they weren't doing us some type of favor?  Look hard for the film with 104 minutes worth of content.  The 103 minute version cuts out from the film's most discussed scene.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|Great movie I watched in theater as a teen to now share with my teen daughter who enjoyed it as much as I did.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|This was cute. Yes, cute is definitely the best word I can find to describe it. I didn't fall in love with Northanger Abbey the way that I do most Jane Austen adaptations but I still liked this a lot. Part of me wonders if the problem is that it is only about an hour and a half long. I'm used to at least three hours and feel like I definitely wanted more.<br /><br />Catherine was endearing with her love of books, her sweet face, and her even sweeter manner. Henry was handsome and charming. Together, the two of them were sweet. There was no passion though. I've come to expect longing looks that speak volumes, soulful stares, the brush of a hand that is like a declaration of love. I didn't really get any of that here and I wanted it. Perhaps that's not fair thought because I think this was supposed to be lighthearted and not so heavy on the dramatic love and longing.<br /><br />This was GOOD thought. Cute like I said, sweet like I said, and more than a little adorable.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|I hate it when people think these reviews are about 1) the service they got from the seller or shipper, 2) the unique physical defect that the casing for their product may have, like a crack, but does not affect the content of the product and they let their overall rating of the item reflect this although they love the item to the max! 3) think that the songs for this &#34;greatest hits&#34; album were necessarily put in order of greatness, with no.1 being the best and moving down the ranks as you go... Can't you see that it's a general compilation dude??? and that they've placed the track in a logical order for a nice track to track flow for the listener, while at the same time saving some of the best for last??? Smh...<br /><br />What I do like are fair reviews that really review the item itself. Not everyone has to love the album like me, but I understand why these people give a less than the maximum rating based on their logical comments, and I appreciate that. I agree with a former comment that says that this album is misunderstood by many and not for the die hard, hard core, world tour Goo fans who know tons of other band hits, other than what's reached the radio. This album is more for the avid radio listening Goo fan... after all the title of the album does specify &#34;The Singles&#34;... so what do you expect? Anyway, that's my 2 cents and just know that I love the album and think that it's a great compilation. Take care. Later!
B008JFUPPI|3.0|This was actually a 2.25 for me. I waited and waited for my chance to be able to rent this movie. The trailer was great. It stars Ryan Reynolds, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Bacon in and ACTION movie...I mean it's a trifecta of awesome that I really didn't think could be anything less than fantastic. I was wrong. It was so much less than fantastic. After about 30 minutes I lost interest in what was going on and was tweeting and reading articles online while still kind of watching the movie. It was shooting for that comic book, far fetched, crazy amazingness that is pure fun but it missed the mark. The movie just felt a bit ridiculous and boring. Oh well, sometimes even a trifecta of awesome can't save a movie I guess.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|I usually enjoy a good action packed film, but this film was a little over the top for me. It was more violent, and more cheesy than I expected and I would prefer. There were a few things I liked about this film. Angelina Jolene was stunning as Fox - she is convincing as a cold blooded assassin. Morgan Freeman is pretty incredible as a bad guy.  The storyline moves at a breakneck pace interwoven with incredible graphics and plenty of action.<br /><br />If you go into this movie with the right expectation it is enjoyable. Just be aware it is cheesy and over the top violent.
140006922X|5.0|Easy read, that was well researched and supported.  I enjoyed every page, in fact the only negative I can mention is; I did not want the book to end.  I highly recommend the book and look forward to reading other works by the author.<br /><br />As Tony the Tiger would say ---- GREAT!!!
1936608898|5.0|This book is mind bending. It has changed my life & health for my family.  Main stream agriculture, factory farms, drug companies, medical professionals, pesticide companies, chemical companies etc... will all hate this book.<br /><br />Who in their right mind would let their kids play in a sand box filled with the pesticides they eat.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Too much like real life around here every day.  I like things that are unique and didn't feel this<br />&#34;had it&#34;.  The ending did have a great twist though.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|The book was quick paced and written in such a way to just make it flow effortlessly - I finished it in three days. But, the point the author was trying to make was so heavy handed, you felt bludgeoned. It felt a bit too obvious. And that made the characters a bit too cardboard and not very relateable. As a reader, I felt more like the author was insulting me than respecting my intelligence and allowing me to come to conclusions about what he was trying to say. There was little thought required reading this book.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|definitely a good read. I've read it once before and I decided to reread it and I still cannot put it down!
B001EC3JME|4.0|This is a great holster for the Mag &#34;XL&#34; series - just the right size. I have the XL-200, and it fits snug, but not in a bad way at all. Since the XL does not have a flared head to keep it from slipping out of the bottom of the holster, you want a secure retention system.<br /><br />I can't comment on the durability yet, but the stitching throughout looks well done. All in all, for the price this seems like a good deal.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is just like doing a jigsaw puzzle at home. It takes your focus away from stress of day to day things and has great photos.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Very good storyline. So true how the world works. Movie to watch again and I given a four star rating
B00CO4GO7I|2.0|A lot of guys will like this book.  It's full of &#34;war stories&#34; sure to generate a testosterone rush.  Can't imagine why any woman would find the story enjoyable.<br /><br />I got bored about halfway through.  Like, much, much more of the same.  I found myself counting the &#34;Kindle percentage&#34; until the end.<br /><br />The guy is surely a American hero ... but I guess I got reminded a little too much.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game I'm so happy this app is now available on the Kindle fire. I almost brought a IPad but now I'm sticking with my Kindle.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|perfect app for me although if I could control the game like the payed version but a free make your own robot
B006TKP2B2|4.0|I feel very conflicted about recommending The Windup Girl. It is an entertaining read, and it's very well written, with some truly poetic passages. It makes some worthwhile observations about human nature, colonialism, corporatism, peak oil and genetic engineering. The story also examines sexism and racism in a way that may make the life experiences of the oppressed accessible for privileged readers. But it also contains some very graphic depictions of some of the most vile, misogynist sexual violence and abuse I have personally ever encountered in genre fiction. I have to question whether these passages are strictly necessary to advance the themes of the story. A case could be made that they serve a crucial function in depicting the ugly consequences of patriarchy's relationship with capitalism, and perhaps the book would be less effective without them, but they also feel exploitative, and they are quite likely to trigger readers who have survived abuse.
6304712936|5.0|Good movie, and it got better,  I can't believe they pulled it off.  I jumped to my feet once like it was a sporting event.  For an opera.  Amazing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have long been a Stephen King fan, but I have not loved every book, nor have I met many that stand on the same plane as The Shining. This is not the same story, or even quite like it, but it is very, very good. Deeply captivating, tender, raw and complete a tale as might ever be found.
1476729085|5.0|This was a great read and I like the main characters a lot. I might have to revisit them again sometime.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Simply easy to play. Like this game a lot. Would recomend this game to all. Enjoyable to play all the time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb racing in an awesome game with a huge variety of vehicles and tracks that are to my knowledge unlimited!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this game because it stays interesting.  Each level is different in some way and challenging.  It is fun!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|An easy read, the plot wandered around a little more than I thought was necessary. I will keep the author in mind !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Oh my God, I absolutely love this story!!! This man is a dream come true. Can't wait for the film.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. It has been a great way for me to de-stress from each day whether after classes or just a break in between working.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I used to imagine being a commander of a great fleet of star ships and secret bases on earth. I would imagine battles in great detail. This book gave what was missing from my battles. How to command fleets of star ships without controlling each one. Orson created an incredible story. Humans don't only win a war, they learn from their enemies how to be better humans.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This was a book I could not put down.  I have recommended this to all my grandchildren.  She is a true inspiration!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am hooked on this game!  Love it, love it, love it, love it.  It is challenging, yet rewarding What more can I say.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is such an awesome show and it just keeps getting better and better. Plus it's full of hotness.  .
B0058UXHHK|3.0|When I started reading this book, I thought I was going to enjoy it.  Her visions, etc.  But after a while, her naivete (anyone with smarts knew the guy next door was probably in law enforcement from the get go) and the author dragging the story out made me skip the last many pages, especially towards the end.  It would have been better (in my opinion) in a shorter version.  However, it was a good story for a free book and for someone who likes ridiculously saccharin romantic books (I'm not one of them).
B000F39M9W|5.0|I love the \\"Rite\\" and now own 5 versions.  I'll leave the critique of the performance to others, since I was looking for a better sounding recording.<br /><br />And I found it!<br />(I am using this to audition speakers for a DIY speaker building group)<br /><br />I also own the '58 Bernstein (2013CD) and 60' Stravinsky versions, which I find are sonically overwrought.  Its like they were trying to impress early adopters with  with \\"glorious hi-fidelity\\" .  But I feel they overdid it and ended up with unnatural balance and some extreme left - right panning.<br />I prefer the Bernstein / Israel Philharmonic recording sonically to both of these.<br /><br />But on this LAP recording the overall soundstage is fantastic.  From the opening notes of \\"Night..\\" you realize there is something special about it.<br />I think there is some close mic-ing going on, especially on the softer parts in Rite. This is so they don't get lost.  I would've preferred they left it alone, but its not obtrusive.  And when the forte's and crescendos kick in, it is very impressive indeed.  The overall presentation is smooth and understated and not digital sounding at all.  The bass drum is very deep and prominent, so be prepared!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great for a free game. Problem is that after a couple of leveling ups it gets incredibly annoying to get to the next level.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|A beautiful album, and even better on vinyl.<br />Very nice gatefold jacket, and big book inside.<br />Super heavyweight, very clean sounding.<br /><br />Bought at a local record store this time.<br />I think the rebirth of vinyl is going to bring back the small local record shops.<br />More shops are popping up here in Michigan. Hopefully they'll continue to<br />make high quality pressings such as this.<br /><br />Again an awesome album by Jack.<br />Free mp3 download code inside.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|this turned out to be just another zombie movie... i expected more. maybe i'm just not a zombie movie guy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|as addicting as people say!!! i kept waiting for candy crush to be free on my kindle fire and finally got it!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a good eye and hand coordination game. My children and I have contests to see who can get a better score.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|just as fun as the other angry birds. always an added challenge. would definitely recommend this game to others. great
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|It was a pretty good game.  I wish the story was a bit longer.  The game feels a bit short.
B007Q53IQ0|4.0|Love this movie. Mixed feelings about the amazon format though, for some reason like a dufus didn't realize there wasn't an amazon channel on my apple tv ... will have to try downloading it or streaming over airplay.<br /><br />Also, THIS IS NOT THE HD VERSION! I assumed when it said &#34;HD available&#34; that there would be a formatting option when I viewed it ... no, you have to click somewhere else and buy the $15 version.<br /><br />Movie: five stars<br />Amazon formatting: still deciding
B00005JMJG|1.0|I found this movie to be nothing more than tooth drilling brain scatter and a waste of exceptional talent.  There was no point in this movie that grabbed my attention; thus praying for its end and an end to its misery.  The insanely goofy characters (who's backstories must have come from an insane asylum) were an insult  to script writing, not funny or entertaining and should be hung by the neck until dead.  The film jumped around like mexican jumping beens for no apparent reason, leaving loose ends everywhere it went, adding little, other than a pretentious need to be artsy.  This movie left me angry for, other than the complete waste of time, the serious dent to Jim Carry's genius film resume.  If there were minus stars; this would be the time to use them.<br /><br />My guess is Jim and the directors found themselves with far to much useless and agonizing footage and tried a hail Mary, by cutting it into small pieces and haphazardly jumbling it on the cutting room floor, taping it together with little or no rhyme or reason and with a straight face called it a cult film contender,<br /><br />I am guessing the five star ratings are for the animal house soft porn?
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This book was so sad and cute. My favorite children's book. Always makes me cry. I've never made it throughout one reading without tearing up.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Like to know what's going on all over the World. Always miss the news on tv so I go to see the app.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It is not easy to fly,walk or build on minecraf but you should get survival craft it is so fun and easy and also get survival craft right now
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This Gmail account and then the same time of glory and a b this way the same as we'll<br /><br /> done and a how to make playwriting
B002JCSWV6|5.0|this is my feel good movie, it makes my heart soar.  a country came together, and you feel the power and strength of a man who had been in prison for 27 years, fighting to bring black and white together.  I love it.  Great performances by all.  My favorite scene is when Matt's character brings home the tickets for his family to attend the championship, and has the extra ticket for the family housekeeper.  It shows so much.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I absolutely love it its a life saver. It puts all your info in lin one convent place. It great for note taking and organizing info.
0345529057|2.0|I thought I was getting a fantastic price for this set, and now I see why. I have to say that I am pretty shocked at the poor quality of these books. I bought this set as a gift for my husband, and I should have paid extra for the hardcover set. This does not make a nice looking presentation for a gift. Normally, I have lower standards for myself compared to gifts and I would not have thought twice about flimsy paper or binding. This has changed my mind. The pages are so thin that I can see the words on other pages, which is really distracting when trying to read. It is also very hard to read due to the extremely small print. I have a really hard time looking past the low quality and getting into the story. I fear I will tear the paper every time I turn a page. All is lost if I do, because then my husband will know that I am reading his books while he is at work. Thankfully, I have not noticed any missing pages yet as other reviewers have mentioned. In short, this makes for an embarrassing gift. Either pay more for the hardcover editions or wait for a better quality set that includes all of the series.<br /><br />There isn't much to say about the story that hasn't already been said. The only thing I can add is that I find it much easier to keep track of the characters while reading rather than watching the show. And like most avid readers, the show just can't match my imagination.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have used this only once or twice but its useful in a way that you can stream videos directly from your cellphone or laptop.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A story that stays with you long after you finish the book. You feel betrayed time and again, but don't try to think too far ahead; enjoy the well-crafted ride.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|As I came to the end of this compelling, tragic, heroic book I was reminded of a line from Milton's Paradise Lost... but with a twist...\\"justify the ways of man to God.\\" Their heroism is inspirational. Marcus Luttrell's belief in God and His Providence  is remarkable and a challenge to my own questioning belief. His story of such terrifying hatred and profound tribal honor among a people, the same yet so different in their humanity in the Hindu Lush mountains should be required reading for all Americans to truly understand why freedom isn't free, for politicians to understand the true sacrifice required when they send men and women into a battlefield while they sit far removed in their Ivory Tower of political expediency, and the press to understand that they are not the story and their responsibility to report fact, not rumor.  I am utterly moved and my perspective will never be the same.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Had slight trouble with it deleting the word I had not selected but other than that I'm thrilled to have a great app on the kindle fire that takes advantage of the capabilities. Great user interface and simple to learn the features! Thanks for a great app
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I read the book about a year ago and felt that it was mostly unrealized potential.but since there has been so much hype about the movie when this came out on Amazon Prime I thought that I would give it a try and see the movie had managed to fill in some of the holes from the book. Unfortunately, they had not. Well the movie isn't quite as flushed out as the book (what movie is?), it does stay fairly true to the original story and I thought the lead actress in a reasonably good job of making a character who was less than ideal into a reasonably likeable heroine.if you have some time to kill and can watch this for free this movie will fill the gap but I wouldn't spend any money for it.
B00000INEX|5.0|Beautiful photography, captivating toys. The background music has become a part of my grandson's recognition.  This is music composed by one of the greatest classical composers of all time.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Probably one of the very best authors out there right now. A pleasure to read this light hearted tale. It was too short though.
B00EZPCZ5O|3.0|On paper, it seems like this album could have been a real tour de force. The material is darker than the whole high school vibe I felt from Crash Love, and the music is (mostly) more aggressive as well. Havok shows more vocal range here than in the last couple of albums, spending a little more time in the lower end of his reach. My first introduction to him as a singer was in Son of Sam, the Samhain &#34;tribute&#34; band, and I started collecting the AFI discography in order after getting hooked on that. I've been waiting to hear him play around some more in the range he used for &#34;Michael&#34; for several albums now, so it is a treat to hear it. I just wish the vocals were higher in the mix!<br /><br />The production confuses me. The drums sound almost artificial, or like someone is playing an electric kit in several places. The addition of keyboards/synth/whatever contribute to the cluttered sound. As a guitar player, it bothers me to hear songs where the guitar seemingly disappears for half of the run time, and when it finally comes in for the swells in the chorus, the mix is so muddled that it still feels like it is dropping out half of the time.<br /><br />Besides the production issues, my other big problem with the album is that a lot of the songs come off very same-y. With the vocals pushed down in the mix, some of the beats and instrumentation just run together. Worse still, some songs start strong with a great introduction only to peter out into more of the same-y poorly mixed biomass you'll be accustomed to by that time.<br /><br />There are two or three songs that are strong enough to stand on their own, but most of the album feels like filler. Hardcore AFI fans will buy it and defend it to the death, because that is what they do. If you're not a big fan, maybe you picked up two or three of the last five albums, this might not be for you.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Awesome movie, blew my mind how cool the action is, totally worth it, its now one of my favs all time
B008DM4OTA|5.0|now they always won't to look in my ears and in my mouth and lessen to my heart and this makes my heart happy to have found a game where thay learn so much.
B0087GF8ZG|2.0|Light stays on for only 10 sec. Too short. It is supposed to be 30 sec. Sending it back tomorrow
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I had seen the movie &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; some time ago, but chose to read the book before I started the Sycamore Row.  I'm glad I did!  The sequel is great and the two books should be combined in a single two story book so people get the full effect. Thank you John Grisham!
006202406X|1.0|I know that people are unhappy with ending but I thought the entire book was awful. I loved the first 2 books in this series but I have read free kindle books that were leaps and bounds better than this one.
B00G9QLP9Y|4.0|I just liked it! My grand daughter had the best time looking up family and friends my self I like it for pin pointing where I'm going! :)
0385341008|5.0|The book was described to be in fair condition, but really it was in excellent shape. I was very happy with the condition, the price and the quick mailing.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Speakers arrived on time.<br />Very comfortable and fits snuggly on my head and ears.<br />The sound is amazing and I am loving it.<br />Comes with a nice pouch.
B00BD05PEW|4.0|The Papo Carnotaurus is a typical, impressive Papo dinosaur----beautiful detail and painting with a dramatic action pose. My biggest complaint is that is somewhat small for the price (it is 7-3/8 inches long and 4-1/2 inches high compared to Papo's Allosaurus which is 9-1/2 inches long and 4 inches high). Also, I wish the arms weren't so close to the body which gives the model an odd \\"armless\\" impression at first glance.<br />Among Papo's carnivores, I would rate it just behind the Papo Tyrannosaur and Allosaur. I recommend the Carnotaurus for anyone's dinosaur collection---especially if the rumors are true that the Carnotaurus will be the featured dinosaur \\"villain\\" in JURASSIC WORLD---the upcoming latest sequel to JURASSIC PARK.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is my favorite! My second time reading it, making sure to finish it before the premiere! So excited!
190949013X|5.0|I loved everything about this book, from the cover (beautiful and elegant) to the way Kendall and Payton manage to achieve their goals. Written with great empathy and understanding, even the side characters were nice people. Kristen Zimmer managed to make an agent look human, too! Well done- will keep my eyes peeled for her next!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This series pulls you in, but I do feel that author is taking advantage of our $$ by ending these books at an awkward time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this on Facebook on the computer and was excited to get it on the kindle. I actually like playing it on the app versus the computer.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I personally havent played this game, but my kids all have it downloaded on their devices.  It is one of those games that they always gravitate to.  If you are looking for a game to download for a 4 to 10 year old, this is it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My mom &amp; dad got this game for their phones &amp; I wanted it SOOO bad then one day I see it!! FINALLY! Haha but my mom says I can't get very far with out Facebook so big bummer
B00DH4BL4U|5.0|anyone who hates ibra would have to admit its brilliant i read it 3 times and never got tired of it.LOL
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I just love this movie!!! The whole family enjoys watching it, which is always a plus. I recommend it to families, but also to adults...you will definitely enjoy it. I love that it comes in dvd, blu ray, and the digital copy so we can watch it any way we like.<br /><br />The only downside is that it is just the first one...it would be great if it was a combo pack of #1 and #2
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Very motivating to take the stairs instead of the elevator, or going to sleep early. I like the dashboard in their website and also how integrates with other services like Endomondo.
B002ZG997C|3.0|I try to find decent Christian movies for prison inmates to watch as a group and I went ahead an ordered this one. I'm not sure if I am going to submit this one yet. I enjoyed it on a surface level, it had that Clint Eastwood feel to it. the initial violence was maybe over the top, but in a world where men have resorted to bestial behavior, what can you expect.<br />The Biblical message was pretty good and I loved the fact that it promoted Scripture memorization.<br /><br />Simple, cheesy, good for a view.
1439190976|5.0|Great Book. I study and analyze management, leadership, and organizations. This product would be an excellent choice to add to a management and or leadership graduate course programs syllabus.
031623480X|4.0|People need to eliminate all the grains not just gluten, some may try this advice and give up when it doesn't completely work for all, all grains are a problem for most people and animals. Grains completely interfere with our omega balance. Animals that are fed grains have a shortage of omega 3, this follows through into the meat, milk eggs etc, causing an even bigger problem when we consume the many products made from them. A lot of gluten free products are so loaded  with additives they are not a good option. It is harder to give up grains than sugar, it would be easier if people went gluten free as a step toward getting off  these addictive grains.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I think it's terrible that you have to pay to play . While I enjoy playing its discouraging.....when asked if I have the game on my kindle. I  inform others they cannot play because I cannot afford to find charges on my account.
B005LAJ22Q|1.0|Be careful buying movies, bought this new and they didn't work. So disappointed so now have two sets that don't play and had to down load off internet.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|there is no skill reguired<br />a lot of luck definitely reguired<br />mind numbing after awhile<br />really a lot of luck

B00ELERCO8|1.0|This app does not work on my Kindle Fire HD.  When I tried to capture a document it pops up a message \\"No back face camera\\".  Since the Kindle Fire HD only has a front face camera, the application is useless on this device.

B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Let me say that I've met airline pilots, and they are the most serious people I have ever met.  The idea that a coked-up drunk pilot can get into and pilot a jet liner is unbelievable.  The movie then turns into a two-hour AA session.  Yawn, yawn, yawn.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Great movie. My daughter, husband and I love this movie just as much as we love the wizard of oz ( if not more ).
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is an awesome game the graphics are extremely good and the hunts are very interesting.  This is a very awesome game.
B003097A9W|5.0|All five albums have some great tunes, and I believe of the 5 albums, my favorite album is &#34;Otis Blue&#34;, and it is kinda hard to say which song is my favorite b/c I enjoy all the cuts but if I had to chose 2 favorites I would say &#34;Ive Been Loving You Too Long&#34; and &#34;You Don't Miss Your Water&#34; and I believe what makes this album so good/successful is that it was recorded within a 24 hour period with the help of the successful band (Booker T. & The MG's) and the powerful horn section (The Mar-Keys) to back him up. It's quite sad that he passed @ the peak of his career, BUT his music still lives on, and im sure if he were alive today, he would still be @ the top of the charts
B000AGTPUU|5.0|It's the most magical 3D animated Christmas movie of all time. I love this movie. I'd recommend it to everybody.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great game and great graphics!! It feels like you are really hunting!!  I have been playing for only short time so I hope it gets harder but so far it delivers what it promises.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|I love this game on the computer and now its on the kindle!  Ignore all those bad things the other people say. If you play this game on the computer this is exactly like it
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is an enjoyable but convoluted story.  It took me a while to figure out the connections between the characters.  Once the ah ha moment arrived it became a untypical love story about three typical women.  One horrific event ties theses women together and twists and turns abound all the way to the epilogue.
B00BDAP66E|2.0|Page manger needs the latest update to function well. It keeps prompting us to update and yet we can only be 're route to the Amazon app store with the old version.

B00BHWG3GU|5.0|Amazing, so nice to hear a live performance from one of my hero's.  Hope to hear more of the tour.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|The game is fun so far but the graphics are absolutely horrible. Very blurry and certainly not what we have come to expect!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall is one of the best James Bond films to come along in quite some time.  Daniel Craig does an excellent job portraying the classic Bond image.
B000W8HC8I|3.0|Mama's struggling with some of the silly behaviors but finishing it nonetheless.  She says it is unnecessarily detailed on some stuff but that is what people like.
B008JFUNNM|5.0|Director Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy, United 93) did an amazing job of taking the real life experience of a freighter captain and his brush with deep sea piracy and make a film you'll be holding on to the edge of your seat throughout.  Writer Billy Ray (Hunger Games, Flight Plan) did an amazing adaption of the book written by Richard Phillips and Stephen Talty and made the sea adventure extremely feel real, intense and packed with emotion.<br /><br />Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, Philadelphia) does a tour-de-force performance (again), especially at the end, of a ship's Captain who makes quick and rational decisions in the forbodding  inevitable face of real deadly danger that is approaching his ship. Based on a real happening, the story is a simple one, but how it unfolds is dramatic, energetic and quite often `hold-your-breadth' thrilling. Peaking at an emotional climax at the end where you'll be relieved and overwhelmed with the outcome of the entire adventure.<br /><br />This is a truly adventurous thrill ride of fear and anticipation. Tom Hanks is just amazing to watch and completely real in his convictions for his character. From his basic love of his wife played by Catherine Keener (40 Year Old Virgin, Into The Wild) as he leaves his home to take his ship, to the calming `take control of the situation' attitude when the threat of looming boats, just two miles from the ship, are getting closer, to the intense direction and misdirection toward the pirate crew who actually board his ship to take control of it.<br /><br />The real adventure occurs when Hanks is tricked off his own boat onto the lifeboat and taken as a hostage with thirty thousand dollars from the ships safe. There are moments of anguish, fear and competition amongst the pirates and it's when the US Navy and Navy Seals are brought in to defuse the situation that your heart doesn't stop pounding.<br /><br />Basically it's about a band of pirates want to take over a barge and sell its cargo and hold hostage its crew, all done miles off the coast of Africa. Hanks is the captain of the boat and with a minimal crew he learns how to survive with only his experience, wits and a desire to live for his wife as his tools.<br /><br />With this being their first motion picture credit, Barkhad Abdi playing the Pirate Captain,  Barkhad  Abdirahman playing the wildly crazy eyed `first mate' and the young teenager Mahat M. Ali do an incredible job of playing a rogue band of pirates trying to steal a 30 million dollar barge filled with cargo and food. The three men are as intense and focused as Hanks is making the scenes that much more dramatic to watch,<br /><br />This is such a wonderful film and very dramatic in its realism that you forget your just watching this film and not part of it. It has some really intense moments coupled with some extremely emotional outcomes and will leave you relived when it's all said and done. Mr. Hanks has done it again. He is truly an `Actor's Actor' because he excels in making you forget what you're watching him do is not real.hostage its crew, all done miles off the coast of Africa.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Amazing!  Luttrell tells it from the heart of a patriot scorned and demonstrably bitter about the silliness in Washington purveying irresponsible rules of engagement for special forces activity.  They need to butt out!
B006K1IIHA|5.0|One of the best British series on television. Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing in the role. The writing, dialogue and stories are amazingly interesting and intriguing!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Yet another great album by the Deftones. If you loved their previous work, skip reading this and buy it now! It does have a mellower feel to it, but Chino still rips it up on some tracks. I have no doubt that this will be another Deftones album that i will listen to for years to come!
B009NNMBFW|5.0|Disney's is back with a slightly more fun animated feature and heartfelt spin on an old Hans Christian Anderson story called \\"The Snow Queen\\" which was first published in 1945. The original story is a darker version compared to what Disney is presenting you (as always loosely based), but it is considered one of the most acclaimed of all his Fairy Tale story's. Certainly the longest in length and the most illustrated of Anderson's works. It's called \\"FROZEN\\"<br /><br />This film features a wonderfully and positively adapted screen story by Chris Buck ( Surf's Up, Pocahontas), Jennifer Lee (Wreck-It-Ralph) and Shane Morris (The Dukes of Hazard: The Beginning) and then turned into an adapted screenplay by Jennifer, yet the film is impressively directed by both Chris and Jennifer themselves.<br /><br />The story is about two sisters who end up losing their parents and living alone as the only heirs to a kingdom. One sister is special (in a very private way) and the other just fun loving, trusting, and adventurous and truly loves her big sister so very much. That is, until the big sister has to shut all of the kingdoms doors for what she believes is a very good reason. Enter a semi-interested Prince from another Kingdom and a rough `Ice Breaker' with a feisty Reindeer as a companion and you have a really fun, heartwarming and colorful adventure. Did I mention there is a magically hysterical snowman too?<br /><br />The younger sister is Anna who is perfectly voiced and sung by Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars, Parks & Recreation) and her older sister (who is The Snow Queen she discovers later) is impressively voiced and sung by Idena Menzel (Glee, Enchanted). Their acting talents provide the perfect combination of what sisters can be really like. Now add an obnoxious Duke who wants nothing more than to overrun these two sisters kingdom who is voiced by Alan Tudyk (Firefly, Wreck-It-Ralph) and a foreign Prince named Hans who is voiced by Santino Fontana (Submissions Only, Royal Pains),  who has his own agenda of a sort and you have a wonderfully well thought out film with some scary and very happy moments.<br /><br />Now you always need a hero and I won't spoil who the actual hero is in this film, but banded with a series of well caricatured trolls, an ice selling character named Kristoff voiced and sung by artistically Jonathan Groff (Glee, The Good Wife), a wonderfully creative snowman named Olaf perfected voiced by Josh Gad (21, The Internship) and a reindeer named Sven with a slight attitude and you have some wildly wintery fun all through the movie.<br /><br />With music by Christopher Beck (Pitch Perfect, The Internship) and lyrics by Kristine Anderson-Lopez (Winnie the Pooh) and Robert Lopez (Avenue Q, Winnie the Pooh) there is a wonderful Broadway-style showstopper-type song sung by Idena called \\"Let It Go\\" that will amaze you. She sings it as she realizes her choices and destiny never matched and as she transforms into The Snow Queen, the art and colors will overwhelm you. Especially her dress!<br /><br />Another fun song comes from Olaf called \\"In the Summer\\" which will have you laughing out loud because Olaf dreams of sunning on the beach. (Remember he's a snowman.) The puns and fun lyrics continue in many of the memorable songs including the two sisters beautiful duet \\"For The First Time In Forever\\" and the Prince and Anna's comical song \\"Love Is An Open Door\\".<br /><br />The production and artistic design in this film is amazing and magically brought to the screen by designer Michael Giaimo (Pocahontas, Christmas Is Here Again) while the entire color scheme and overall visual effects were perfect orchestrated by Steve Goldberg (Tangled, Fanatasia 2000).<br /><br />This film has a much more real story and drama dealing with the two sisters and it is sprinkled with some very funny humor throughout. A great family film for the season and much more engaging than Disney's \\"Brave\\" several years back. With the music thrown in with great care like Disney's more popular and entertaining \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", \\"FROZEN\\" is sure to be a family favorite as it teaches everyone what a true loving sacrifice is all about. You should go see it with your family and your friends!reat care like Disney's more popular and entertaining \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", \\"FROZEN\\" is sure to be a family favorite as it teaches everyone what a true loving sacrifice is all about.

0316055433|4.0|Ms Tart certainly gets an A for effort, but Theo Decker's frail shoulders are not strong enough to carry 771 pages of epic misadventure.  The author is brilliant at detail, creates wonderful situations and characters, knows a lot about drugs, and tackles some big questions.  Still, the novel does not hang together, she loses control about half way through, and I found myself becoming increasingly bored and disenchanted with the text.<br /><br />Much has been noted of the borrowings from other authors and the use of the famous Picasso quote. Some of the borrowings don't work: Theo's mother seems to have floated in from a Truman Capote novel and Kitsey is Daisy Buchanan lite. Like innumerable American authors before her Ms. Tart devotes time and talent to the puerile antics of the American aristocracy. We've heard all this before, it is not original,or even interesting. Tart is truly formidable when she creates  outlaws and losers, she also does well with dogs, little Popchik is  not the least of her characters.<br /><br />The  meeting between Theo and Pippa is pure magic.  The little dog, the dark, highly decorated bedroom, the wounded girl and her morphine lollipop.  Wonderful. Writing on that level is probably hard to sustain so Pippa doesn't surface as often as she should. Instead we get way too much of the idiotic rich girl and her unfortunate, but entitled, family.<br /><br />The Las Vegas section is flipping brilliant. Every time Boris appears the story perks up, he's had a rough life, but his spirited response to misfortune is like a tonic or a line of coke. When Theo is with Boris he seems most real and most human.<br /><br />This book is by no means a masterpiece, but Donna Tart is a very good writer.  I see her as a detail person, a miniaturist, and I have no idea why she insists on writing these unwieldy tomes when she could probably achieve perfection if she worked on a smaller scale.
0446547638|4.0|The book was not bad but it was not Nicholas Sparks' best book.  The ending is very...different.  It was an easy read - I had enough time, so I was able to finish it in one sitting.  It was interesting enough to capture your attention throughout the book.  I don't think you should go into reading this book with the mindset of The Notebook, Message In a Bottle or The Lucky One.  Those are more recent but they are very traditional Nicholas Sparks.  The Best of Me is different, so if you go in thinking you'll read something similar to The Notebook, you will be disappointed.
B002QNTNL6|2.0|This is a dull, predictable and silly movie. Its characters are shallow and the acting is mediocre. There is some entertaining quality to its silliness.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|It's an amazing documentary of old-style, hardcore musicianship replete w/ a singular obsession: create the best music possible w/o the ubiquitous modern frills, bells, and whistles. And the all-star cast is just plain fun to watch.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|good stuff to use and reliable and exactly the way I wanted it. I am happy cause I have no problem.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is fun.  Some of the directions could have been clearer.  I don't understand how they expect all the ingredients to be removed when you don't even get them before you have used up so many turns.  Haven't figured out what causes them to come down.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|In one word-WOW! This is Stephen King at his finest. The Shining is still one of my favorite King reads and by far the scariest book I have read (IT is a close second!). I highly recommend this book for all of you Shining fans-hard to put down, great character development and story movement.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad this game is finally on the kindle! lots of fun;<br />addictive!  I really enjoy playing this but seem to be having a problem connecting to db.  What's up with that?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesomeness, beautiful colors and hours of fun. You and your kids will love playing together and on Facebook.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Of all Christmas music I have heard over the years, this is the absolute BEST. Il Volo has done such a great job, their voices blend together in the most unique way. They are the most talented artist I have listened to in many a year. If your looking for greatness, you will love Il Volo's Buon Natale. Take time to listen to their other cd's. They are perfection! LOVE THEM, LOVE THEIR VOICES..\\"THREE VOICES : ONE SOUL\\".
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Wow, wow, wow. I'm so sad this series is over, i didn't want it to end, but everything reaches its end eventually. The book was filled with hotness, romance, action, suspense, everything you love in a book. It was very well written and it kept me intrigued all through. The ending was expected and not expected, Jennifer sure surprised me and i loved it.. now i need the last of the lux series...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game! It is challenging and fun. It was well worth the download and I am enjoying it very much!

B007TNQ7EY|3.0|This  game is fun and all but I die every time I get run over even on full life please fix that and please make the graphics better it's just frustrating
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|Wonderful, well told story!  This was one of the best movies I have seen in awhile about the disadvantages of being handicapped and how it was overcome in real life.  Acting was first rate!
B003ASLJK4|5.0|loved the movie
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use this app for taking simple notes, reminders.. stuff like that.. I understand there's been an issue about User privacy. but, I like it so far. I use an iphone, kindle fire, macbook pro at home, windows 7 at work.. and use evernote across all devices..
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I constantly need to delete and redownload the app. Freezes alot and most definitely needs an update. Won't load when I refresh the page or try to search videos.
B009SCRERI|5.0|Actually, I wanted this on a CD, but put it on my Kindle Fire HD by mistake.  After watching it, I'm so glad I ordered it on my Kindle!  I will be going out of town to my daughters house, and can show this to my granddaughter on the Kindle :)
B008K8VDPU|4.0|awesome app. I have 2 little girls ages 10 and 5 and they just adore this app. I just wish there were some more modern songs programmed to the music library.<br /><br />.

B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a story that was written amazingly well. The author truly gave a voice to the characters. I really enjoyed the parallels between the characters and their stories. I highly recommend this book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is a great game to keep your kids entertain  when your at the doctor ,dentist and other places . I hope your kids enjoy it as much as mine
B0070Z4LLW|5.0|I think this prequel is fantastic. I'd recommend watching the the one with Kurt Russell right after watching this one. It leads right into it and so you'll get a perfect double-feature. Don't mind the negative reviews. This movie is perfect!
B008JFUR10|1.0|comm'on.. best movie ever made? Teens today never have seen &#34;Gone with the wind&#34;, &#34;Ben Hur&#34;, &#34;Citizen Kane&#34; or &#34;Peyton Place&#34; with really good acting.<br />This movie &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; is totally waste of time. To bad that everything has to be loud and a lot action today.<br /><br />Picture quality and sound are good - no question.
B008R96NIY|5.0|For anyone who would like to get a better insight in how frictions between countries can end in a conflict, for anyone with love for the Balkans and their history, for anyone who would like to get a better understanding of the recent history in former Yugoslavia, for anyone who was impressed when visiting the place where archduke Franz-Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo, for anyone who was onset to learn that the Archduke was killed with e Belgian revolver (FN Browning), this is thé book to read.
0887307280|4.0|There are some excellent revelations about business in this book, but unfortunately they're buried under a mountain of dirt.<br /><br />NUGGETS:<br />The first half of the book was much better than the second. One huge takeaway from the book is that many businesses fail because the wrong people, and/or people with the wrong mindset/expectations, start businesses. There are some people with \\"technical\\" skills (be it baking pies or whatever) that like what they do but assume they would be better off running their own business and not having a boss. They think knowing the \\"technical\\" work of a business means they know how to run the business, but they're dead wrong and this is the reason many small businesses fail. Lesson is if you really love the \\"technical\\" work you do, don't start your own business, just get a job for someone else and then you won't have all the other responsibilities of a business owner that these \\"technically\\" focused people end up loathing (accounting, sales, admin, hiring and staffing, etc). Another excellent nugget is about how businesses should be a system that runs without you, rather than something that is dependent on you for it to succeed; that your goal should be to develop a system that could be replicated thousands of times by low skilled, ordinary people (giving the example of franchises).<br /><br />MOUNTAIN OF DIRT:<br />I came away with a couple pages of notes of great stuff, but it was so annoying that there was a lot of filler, and the author had a style of delivering this advice by recounting a dialogue with a bakery owner rather than just coming out and telling you the advice. This got very tiring; the author seems to consider his audience a high school dropout stay at home mom that's thinking of starting a business. As another reviewer put it, \\"verbose\\" is a nice way of describing the author.<br /><br />MY ADVICE:<br />Buy a used copy for cheap, or better yet, borrow from a friend or library and SKIM through the book at an increasingly faster rate the farther you get into the book. I think the best revelations on entrepreneurship were in the first half.<br /><br />WHO IS IT FOR?<br /><br />If you are a stay-at-home mom, complete business beginner, then this book will be of more interest and value to you than a business student and you should read with more care. If you're a working professional considering quitting your job, this would be an excellent read (first third of the book) to assess your thoughts.<br /><br />If you're a business student or someone more savvy and well-read on business ideas, this is still a must-read but it must be skimmed or you will fall asleep before you finish it. And realize that there are some valuable nuggets buried under a mountain of dirt. You walk away from the book feeling enlightened from those several great pearls of wisdom, but by no means do you feel ready to go out and start a business.
0307346617|5.0|Very good book, but different from the movie which was good also. I like the witnesses( survivors) prospective in the book .
B0002TJGQS|1.0|Crap. Didn't last more than a few months in a calculator that I virtually never use. Seems to be the case with some items on Amazon, you get a good product that is just expired or damaged or otherwise not up to normal standards.

0767836324|5.0|Hook is a classic.  I purchased the DVD to give to my grandson.  Insert &#34;poem they do when Robin Williams is going through his exercise routine&#34;  - or &#34;the smack talk at the dinner table&#34;  my grown kids can quote it, but I can't.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Man was hysterically out of control. Lives the life while he could. I needed a shower after reading but couldn't put it down
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addictive, this game is to much fun and even the most novice of players can play. Great job to the developers.
B000002KHF|5.0|It's Van Morrison. What else is there to say? Great sound. Some songs I hadn't heard before. Liked them. Pleased.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|I bought this about a year or so ago, and my niece loves it. It doesn't exactly &#34;crawl&#34; or roll, its kind of just rocks back and forth and they can push it. But it was still a hit for me. I guess it just depends on the kid though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing continuation. I fell in love with the characters. This book is the perfect set up for what is to come.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I love this CD! I hadn't heard most of the songs on it when I bought it, so I was a little scared at first, but after listening to it I now have nothing to complain about. If you like this type of music I do recommend the buy. Would make a good gift too.
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|I had to watch this movie for a class I'm taking, and it was absolutely beautiful! I cried at the end!
0553288105|5.0|One of the best novels of Asimov. An imaginative description of an alternative universe, as never read in other novels. A great plot and interesting characters. Excellent science fiction work.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's pretty a nostalgic game. However,  it is a laborious app that let's you pay for more gimmicks. I have to deal with the levels without using gimmicks.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Well worth the cost.  He gets some of his old school style stuff in there, has some good sampling from different genres, and all in all a great album.  I only wanted to skip 3 songs out of 20, not because they sounded bad, just not personal preference was all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game I love the different levels of the can<br />Me I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I didn't

B000002ITW|5.0|This is one of the best live albums I've ever heard it's up there with Bob Marley & The Wailers 1975 Live! and Nirvana 1994 M.T.V. Unplugged, not a bad song on here, vocals are strong, clear as crystal, soaring effortlessly. This c.d. is on constant rotation I'm just in love with it, if you like any of there solo work you will really enjoy this record it's a little gem.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|So simple, honest to a fault, and refreshing. It's neurotic and crazy and normal all at the same time. I can't pinpoint what I love about it. I just love it!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is a good collection at a very fair price. We have not watched any of these yet but do look forward to having the time to watch them. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The product was packaged well and arrived in good condition.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end of the book was great it tied everything together and<br /> the book was action packed. I think this book deserves a five star rating
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Best show ever! It is smart, funny and addictive. The series starts off kind of slow but don't get discouraged. Stay with it through the first 2 episodes and you will be hooked.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is where the whole story started. You can just imagine this really happening. I could not put the book down!

1427207267|5.0|I love this book. I am a teacher and it is a classic. I had an old copy and wanted a new one and I figured I would buy the book and the cd together. I looked for it on Scholastic but Amazon has a better price. If you are a teacher, you know how great this book is. I teach kindergarten so it is extra perfect.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The price I payed was a bit much, but it made for a good Christmas present. I really liked the story and and had some funny parts to it.
B00574Q7PQ|5.0|Lots of action that kept us on the edge of our seats!  I would recommend it if you like suspenseful action/adventure flicks.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Its an inspiring tale about a little girl who lost her way home it shows that girls have  power. I LOVE it
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|The writing style is just not for me. It was cumbersome, cluttered and I lost interest four pages into the novel. I know other people liked it in reviews. Viva la difference.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|This book has really helped me realize the importance and value of money and how millionaire strategically use their money wisely.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I couldn't get through this book it was so bad and that is rare for me!  I hated how the character of Bridget had not grown at all since the last book even though she had been married, gave birth twice and widowed.  Very disappointing book,what I read of it.
B000P407K4|5.0|A real study of the Cold War era.  Also a good look at the Strategic Air Command B-52 flight operations.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Even though it makes sense at the end, I didn't like the change in authors voice. The ending has nothing to do with my rating.

B005FJ79DM|3.0|I will watch any Jane Eyre adaptation...but this one left me wanting more.  More story. More content. More chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Michael Fassbender did an excellent job as Mr. Rochester...but I did not enjoy Mia Wasikowska as Jane. I just didn't feel the chemistry between the two...and there should have been.  The 2006 PBS Masterpiece Classic adaptation of Jane Eyre with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson is still my all time favorite...(Timothy Dalton's version is a very close second...)
B00338QENI|4.0|Fascinating - almost seemed like fiction but full of sad reality about the times those things took place. I worked at both Johns Hopkin and Crownville so it was especially interesting, Good job of making science real
B008Y212PI|5.0|I was glad to find this.  I have these puzzles in spiral book, but it is not as handy to take with me
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This is the beginning of the king and Maxwell series, and gives me a great start on a series I didn't know about till looking for the newest book in the series.  It's a great read!  Couldn't put it down once I started.
