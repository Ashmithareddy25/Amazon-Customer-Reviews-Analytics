B007TMON8M|5.0|I got this game to challenge the Mind , also thought it would be fun to see what 1 missplaced support can cause , it is a very well built game , it has good graphics speed of the game is good , needs a seperate remove button I caught myself removing when I didnt want to , It helped that it was free with Amazon to I will recomend to anyone who wants a challenge .
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was so similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. After reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" this book was almost the same! I became bored with \\"Rared For You.\\"
0345803485|4.0|I read this book after all the mums in my mother's group were reading it and was told it was like \\"Twilight\\" for adults. I loved it at times, and also hated it at times, I would have loved to slap Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" into next week if I could of, and the ending left me somewhat annoyed, but all in all i liked it and I will read the next books in the trilogy - I hear there is more of a story in the next 2 books too.
0345803507|5.0|Love it!!!!! Would be a great book to read with significant other. Me n my boyfriend read it together and it was very amazing
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Did'nt take the book too seriously.  Just some light hearted fun reading for the summer.  Had a lot of laughs.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|The Dark Roots Of Earth is breathtaking, amazing, fantastic from beginning to end. It's an old cliche for a BAND say that their most recnt album is their best yet. But for the people who buys the records, this is indeed rare....And I think this is the best Testament album ever.<br /><br />They were not kidding. They went for the best to produce them: Andy Sneap. The recording is sharp, melodic, furious . Chuck Billy, Peterson, Skolnick, Hoglan Christian, they are at the top of their game.<br /><br />I'm still mesmerized by htis album and listening to it repeatedly.
0440243688|5.0|Another excellent Reacher novel !  Went thru it in one sitting. Now having withdrawal. When's the next one ? I'll preorder it  for sure.

B004GYY714|5.0|Just found out about this product about a month ago sports talk , all kind of music stations just a great tool to have.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I bought this DVD for someone who has early onset Alzheimer's because a) she loves children and b) moderate to advanced Alzheimer's patients tend to love watching babies on a screen (this, from my experience as an Activities Director in an assisted living community years ago). The DVD delivered in bringing smiles and capturing her attention. There's no narration, just snippets of the lives of four babies in four different cultures - from birth to first year. For our purposes, it didn't matter that there's nudity in the video, however I probably wouldn't show this video to kids - it depends on what you want to teach them and when about the human body. Nothing is distasteful or disrespectful, to be clear, and it can be a great educational tool. I would love to find a video of just babies and their gestures/faces, but this is a great substitute.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Went in as a skeptic, came out a believer. This movie was really good albeit slightly rushed toward the end. From what I've heard about the books, they had to rush things toward the end to get the next movie on track. Would highly recommend. Rented this movie from my satellite provider and ended up buying the bluray, it's that good.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Suspensful, a good story, interesting characters. I hated to stop reading every night. Hope the author writes more like this.
B002DJZJT8|4.0|Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon as well as the other actors had you sitting on the edge of your seat. great actors and great acting.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|As of this review I have played the game to two endings.<br /><br />This game is the fusion of the classic \\"chose your own adventure\\" books and a \\"point and click adventure\\" game.<br /><br />This is a mature game, there is blood, detailed text about dead bodies and modorate swearing, So this is NOT for kids. Another reason is the large amounts of text to read, and then there are the many conspiracy theories about various historical events. The game makes sure to let you know when you start the game that this is a work of Fiction, much like a book might let it's reader know.<br /><br />Ok, on to the game it's self. The narritive of the game follows a young man in collage who has been kidnaped by a masked person, known only as [Zero]. When the \\"game\\" finnaly starts, you are tasked with solveing a number of puzzles to exit a quickly flooding room (even if there is no time limit for the game). The puzzles take story breaks to fill in information from the story side of things, and introduces one of the primary elements of the game... What is a [Digital Root]?<br /><br />After escape the main cast of nine characters are quickly introduced and numbered. And the story really takes off.<br /><br />On a 2nd play through... You have the option of fast forwarding the wall of text unless you get to a point you have never seen before, this really helps cut the wait time to get back to solving the mystery as you are highly motivated at death, to figure it out. It is also hinted at, that you \\"the player\\" are the dead spirt of the character trying to prevent your own demise. (the exsample was of \\"Automatic Writing\\" predicting the future by your dead spirt possessing your body in the past)<br /><br />This story with a puzzle game in it, has many different and interesting things to say inside it's fictional setting. I hope the next game in the will feel as fresh as 999 did, because it is a tense and wild story.<br /><br />Breakdown<br />Graphics 9/10<br />Story 10/10<br />Controls 9/10<br />Music & Sound 9/10<br /><br />Overall 9/10<br />The game is long, but just like a good book, you can save at any time.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really Loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I read the book with a big ass smile on my face every time. I am a hopeless romantic & I felt the connection between Anastasia & Christian. I also loved the way they joked around with each other. I just Loved the Book & so did everyone of the girls in my family & though the guys complained that we paid more attention to the books then we did to them, At the End They learned to Love Christian & Anastasia too. Romance does = sex if your lucky so why not mention the good parts too. My opinion.
B005F96URI|4.0|AWESOME MOVIE.  This movie was Kill Bill, Scott Pilgrim, Sin City all rolled into one. Even if you arent a fan of anything other than kill bill, you probably will like this. It reminded me of the cheesy karate movies from when I was a younger, but with a funny and cool twist.  It was edgy, creative, funny and FULL of action. It was so creative, we were very impressed.<br />LOVE the fact that I didnt see any nudity and only remember a few cuss words, which is rare in movies nowadays. They feel that if we want action or to laugh, they have to stick boobs and butts in our face or use foul language throughout the movie....not so with this one.<br />We laughed and were wowed throughout this movie.
0807014273|3.0|I love the book.  That's why I ordered multiple copies for a Sunday School Class study.  And at $6 a copy, what could go wrong?  The actual books are practically pocket-sized, however, and the print is very small.  Besides, the shipping and handling was another $5 per book.  So I ended up paying $11 for each of the $6 books.  Despite the quality of the contents, maybe not such a good deal this way!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Movie was awesome, creative and fun EXCEPT for the overtly disrespectful treatment by the female chef towards the main character. Her hitting him, etc. didnt need to be in the movie. I hate movies where they make the man look like a complete idiot where the woman must mistreat him in order to \\"straighten him out\\". I think this is a feminism push that degrades men. I dont have an issue with her being assertive, but it went too far. Otherwise I loved it.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|Schwarzenegger played Conan but Momoa is Conan.  He is what I saw in my mind when I was reading Conan books in the 50y's.<br />I realy enjoyed the movie and I watched it twice this week.  i thought the movie was well put together and had lots of action.  It should have grossed alot more than it did.  It will become a cult movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So happy I purchased this work out video!  I have worked out every day since I recieved it and now almost done with level 3!

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using Pinterest. I love it even more now that I don't have to carry my 17&quot; laptop to use it. However, I've been having some issues with the app freezing rather frequently and force-closing.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Post-apocalyptic North America is controlled by Panem, a dictatorial state which enforces control through discipline and fear. Every year, two 'tributes' from each of Panem's twelve districts are chosen at random to do battle to the death. The survivor of the carnage becomes rich and famous, and the people are reminded of the Capitol's power. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sister's place in the games, and must find a way to win despite her lack of experience and training.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is an adaptation of Suzanne Collins's YA novel of the same name and closely follows the events of the novel. Like the book, the film pits Katniss Everdeen in a fight to the death against twenty-three other youngsters, including her fellow contestant from District 12, Peeta Mellark. The story is divided into two distinct sections, the first involving Katniss's selection and preparation for the games and the second depicting the contest itself. This shift in setting and tone halfway through the film helps sustain and the tension and drama through the movie's running time (which, at almost two and a half hours, is fairly long for a YA movie).<br /><br />The script closely follows the plot of the novel, apart from a fairly elegant solution to the problem of the book being based on Katniss's heavily-internalised experiences. In the novel Katniss can only speculate on the motives of the people running the game, but in the film we cut away to what's going on the game control centre and with President Snow. This expands the scope of the film a little and helps set up the sequels rather better than the novel, which was not written with sequels in mind and didn't layer in a lot of foreshadowing for what would come after.<br /><br />The movie follows the book in presenting the Hunger Games as a satire on modern reality TV shows, but through the visual medium is able to take this a lot further through film clips of people commentating on the game like it was the latest season of The X-Factor. Unfortunately, rather like the book, the film also does not take this satirical edge far enough, instead opting for raising questions and then not exploring them far enough. This problem also extends to the story's use of violence and morality. As in the novel, Katniss and Peeta are never put into a position of having to kill any of the other victims of the game, only the 'bad guys' who revel in it. The movie cops out on putting Katniss and Peeter in real moral quandaries, which is a shame. The film also has variable CGI, with depictions of the Capitol's cityscape looking decidedly sub-par in places.<br /><br />Aside from that, the film works pretty well. The movie is quite long but there's a lot of plot to fit in. Director Gary Ross has a crip, fast-paced directing style that moves us through the novel's major story beats without sacrificing too much atmosphere. He often finds concise ways of giving us backstory and worldbuilding information without having to waste time on exposition, which keeps things moving along nicely.<br /><br />Performances are pretty good. The movie hinges on Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss and she nails the role perfectly, bringing the required mixture of anger, determination, bravery and guilelessness. Josh Hutcherson has to settle for merely being good in the role of Peeta, with more established performers like Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson and, of course, Donald Sutherland fufilling their roles with aplomb. Sutherland brings an air of real menace to the role of President Snow that bodes well for the sequels. Lenny Kravitz also impresses in the role of Cinna, though this role has been cut down from the books somewhat.<br /><br />With a good script, economic story-telling and solid performances, The Hunger Games (***½) is overall an enjoyable movie. It loses some of the depth of the secondary characters and subplots over the novels, but on every other level is avery respectable adaptation. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).
B0086700CM|4.0|Can be glitchy, I know I swiped but some how my runner falls off the cliff...  Or gets attacked by the monsters, or burned by the fire, or runs into a tree... I swiped why didn't you jump?
B008CP93S0|3.0|Be warned the trailer makes it seem as though your going to watch a cute, funny , hippy dippy romcom kind of movie. NOT SO!! Lots and I do mean lots of constant swearing and sex focus. I mean seriously who the heck spends that much time in their daily lives talking, thinking about and having sex. There is almost no story line here, I kept waiting and waiting and wating for it to pick up or get funnier or SOMETHING! I am not that hard to entertain. I like to just go with the flow of the movie and be surprised , moved, shocked...whatever, I do not over think my movies ,I do not try to jump ahead and figure it all out, I just ENJOY them like it is suppossed to be.<br />This I did not enjoy very much. I gave it 3 stars because I did laugh at a few scenes and once I thought about it I could sorta see a message of some sort, maybe. I don't know it was flat and forgetable. I actually paused it  and showered then came back and it wasn't any better.<br />Eh!

B004J713JW|4.0|The Blu Ray is spectacular visually however Billy's audio is too prominent for most of the show. It sounds like they ripped Billy's audio right from the soundboard without mixing it. Also, Billy's singing doesn't quite match up with his lips moving. Almost 5 stars if not for the audio issues.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|been waiting for this one. I prefer glu over gameloft games but I digress the true reaason for the post is to be among the first to review it. me thinks it not too bad
0671015206|5.0|I purchased this book because I needed to write a report about it for my high school economics class. I was very happy with the copy and it was in excellent condition when it arrived. It arrived in time and helped me finish my report. I found the book very interesting and it gave me a lot of insight on the typical American millionaire. I was very happy with the product and would purchase from the provider again.

B008BM9L72|5.0|This book is definitely not for everyone! I am actually surprised that it is a main stream publication, as quite a lot of it is basically soft porn. That said, it is completely different to anything else I have ever read and I really enjoyed it! Aside from the many and detailed sex scenes, I enjoyed the story line and the way the main character, male, develops. I am working very hard at the moment and think I just enjoyed and easy read! definitely not for prudes or for discussion with your parents or teenagers though!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My new favorite.  And with an ending like that it makes you want to run to the second book cause you just can't wait to find out what next

0425263908|3.0|I read this book because it was on the NY Times Best Seller List.  It is very well written but the plot is too much like 50 Shades of Grey.  I gave it three stars because of that.  I would recommend it to someone who hasn't read 50 shades.

B002W7J3SO|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock made many fine movies in his career, but North by Northwest is to me one of his very best.  Hitchcock is at the top of his form here not only in direction, casting, and pacing, but also with his classic 'wrong man accused' motif, first seen in The 39 Steps.  Here it is played to perfection by Cary Grant, who is magnificent throughout as the man in a situation not of his making. Eva Marie Saint is also superb here; her repartee with Cary Grant comes off very polished and sophisticated, and her character's transformation through the movie is quite convincing.  James Mason too plays his archetypical villain character here with great aplomb and style.  Martin Landau also comes off very well as his particularly nasty henchman.  In the end, all the parts come together to make a truly exciting thriller, well paced, with an iconic conclusion at Mount Rushmore.  Definitely not one to be missed by Hitchcock fans or fans of the genre.
B007Q476KU|5.0|I just wish I had seen it on the big screen but it was a great story very well done.

B007TMON8M|3.0|Some of this makes no sense. On the Snowy Roof level I put in my blueprint and it failed. Tried umpteen different ways and all failed. I decided to start from my original plan and bingo, I got three stars this time.<br /><br />Three stars because it does work fine in my Fire and it is easy to use. And I'm not an engineer so I can't judge whether it has good physics or not, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Some of these have been really hard for me to get done.  I really feel both sides of the emotions of being really dumb or fairly smart to find the answers.  Good luck to you!

I am now onto the third book and can't wait to finish it so I can get on with reading something more exciting. Some of my friends have really enjoyed the book so I guess you would have to make up your own mind.

1439152799|5.0|The Distant Hours by Kate Morton was beautifully written, with a bittersweet love story as the main plot theme. The author has two stories linked together by the main character, Edie. The book is focused in the present with flashbacks to the beginning of WWII, and includes different points of view, depending on which character is the main focus of the chapter. Kate Morton often writes a scene from more than one point of view, giving the story almost a three dimensional edge.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book thoroughly and read it nonstop over the course of a week. I use the word bittersweet because of the ending and revealing of the truth the three sisters have held for over fifty years. Edie learns a lot about the Blythe sisters and also learns to understand her estranged mother and in the process herself.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book for anyone who likes books with vivid descriptions, a sense of suspense and atmospheric setting.

B00006J3WH|5.0|I wouldn't expect anything less from Joss Whedon, he has done an excellent job in composing the lyrics and making it as natural as possible for the Scooby Gang. Everyone's voice is amazing.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I want to make one thing clear in this review. My five-star rating is for the movie, not the Blu-Ray edition of the film. Having just watched it on my system in Dolby Digital 5.1 all I can say is one thing: THE TERMINATOR needs a SERIOUS remastering job.  Picture quality is barely any better than my own DVD copy. And unless you have a system that can do the audio in uncompressed PCM 5.1, there is absolutely no improvement in that area, either. If I have to rate the Blu-Ray instead of the movie, I give it only 3 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, I'll get to the movie itself. It is a brilliant action adventure dealing with the subject of modern technology; it depicts a world where technology itself escalated to the point where we lose all control of it and it winds up destroying us. Watching THE TERMINATOR, it became clear to me that James Cameron wasn't lazy when it came to writing the screenplay. Every angle is clearly thought out, especially in how the events are linked; how one act is ultimately tied to another one.  In THE TERMINATOR, and every other film he has done since then, Cameron demonstrates how story and characters are the most essential thing to any great movie.<br /><br />By now, everybody knows the story. In 2029, the world was all but obliterated in a Nuclear War. Machines were fighting a war against the human survivors. Then the machines, in a last desperate act, send an unstoppable killing machine: The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back to 1984 to kill a young woman (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to the man who will lead the human survivors in the war. At the same time, the humans send a young soldier (Michael Biehn) to protect the woman from The Terminator. The story is rather clever. If you really pay attention to the film, you'll discover what I was talking about in how everything that happens, from the future to the present, is completely tied together.<br /><br />I remember when this movie was advertisedon TV in October, 1984. It looked like a really wild ride of an action movie. I missed the opportunity to see it in theaters. I saw it for the first time on VHS tape the following year. I knew about Arnold Schwarzenegger as a champion bodybuilder, and also from the two Conan movies he did in 81, and 82. I thought he was a man with a great physique but a terrible actor. I didn't think he would ever be able to make a movie that didn't depend on his muscular body, until I saw THE TERMINATOR. We see him naked in his first scene, and that is that. Schwarzenegger had to actually act in a movie, and his task in this film is to make you believe he is this machine; that there is a metal skeleton underneath his flesh and blood. He succeeds this task with the way he moves his eyes, head, and body. Watch carefully and you'll see he never blinks except in one scene where he fires a handgun.<br /><br />Another man behind the camera steps out to make us believe in Schwarzenegger as a machine when The Terminator is injured. That man is the late Stan Winston. There is a sequence where the Terminator is damaged and has to do some maintenance on his right arm and left eye. You see Arnold slice into his arm to work on the mechanism that controls his hand movements, and pull out his human eye from the socket, revealing a red metal eye. It is amazing how Winston makes this illusion completely real. I often wondered how in the hell he did it. (I recommend reading THE WINSTON EFFECT, which was published two years before his death in 2008; it shows exactly how this was all done.) We later see Schwarzenegger with additional damage to his face and more of the metal skull underneath. It never occurs to the audience that this is all a makeup effect. Everything is just so seamless.<br /><br />At the time I saw THE TERMINATOR I thought it was one of the most violent motion pictures of the 1980's. It wasn't until I saw the other films Cameron wrote and directed, including ALIENS (1986), THE ABYSS(1989), and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991) I discovered something else about the movie after I watched it again: It is still a violent movie, but it is also extremely intense. The more intensity a motion picture delivers, the more it drives you to the edge of your seat. And that is something you cannot do with violence alone. That intensity became a pattern with every film Cameron has directed in the 28 years since THE TERMINATOR first came out. It made Arnold Schwarzenegger into a star, and James Cameron into a real director. He has been one of my favorite filmmakers ever since that day in 1985 when I first popped this movie into my VCR.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on my first gen Kindle Fire. I especially love the way it ovrelays the NexRad radar image over Google maps. Super helpful.
B00846REIS|3.0|Shallow. I read the enire book and could not find a single character I actually liked. I promptly deleted the book from my Kindle after the last page was read. As for sequels--purchasing and reading would be a waste of time and money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ok so I bought the 1st boom just to see what the hype was all about.  Then ended up buying the whole trilogy! Utterly addicting, loved the books
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie reminds me of adventure classics from the 30s to the 80s.  The only thing comparable lately has been movies ripped off this original source material, like \\"Avatar\\" and the Star Wars prequels.  The movie starts establishing the title character as an angry, alienated man, then takes him to a strange world that he only slowly realizes is Mars.  Through finding new relationships and purpose the character is redeemed and becomes the man he couldn't be back home.  There is plenty of action, superb CG animation, and a touching romance.  As well as a cliff-hanger ending that will leave the viewer wanting more.  A first-rate family action movie, with the first Disney \\"princess\\" who is both a scientist and a warrior.<br />The criticisms of the performances are completely off-base regarding Lynn Collins, who is superb, and misunderstands the arc of John Carter's character, who is played much more winningly at the end than at the beginning, exactly as the story requires.<br />The quality of the transfer is great, especially the Blu-ray, which is even sharper than the film print and really shows off the effects.<br />If you liked the first \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Rocketeer\\", or just about anything Errol Flynn was ever in, this is for you.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|George gives us more of the same in this second book of his enormous epic tale and it seems that he is hitting his stride.  The cliff-hanger endings of each chapter get annoying though, especially when you realize that the narrative thread will be picked up only in the next book.  The added, or revisited, fantasy elements that George includes work to make the saga richer, darker and considerably more interesting.  This is the book that will draw you completely into this character rich series.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was totaly awesome! The only thing was the pursuit was not long enough for me, that being said the book totaly unfolded into this awesome awesome story that left me craving more I cant wait till the next two come out!! I have already preordered both!
0525953728|5.0|Once I started it, I couldn't put the book down and finished it in one night.  It is truely unbelievable how thin the fine line is between success and failure.  This book was a very easy read and detailed and just an FYI...it does not divulge any classified information like people have been saying.  This is just a first hand depiction of an event that has been the subject of many documentaries on TV.

1936608898|5.0|The book itself is a wonderfully written guide explaining the ins and outs of the philosophy and science behind the Whole30 program, with plenty of real-life stories thrown in. Having read the book, and then completed the program, I have to say that it is the best thing I have ever done for myself! I lost 6 pounds, lost body fat, all while never feeling hungry and continuing to reach new personal bests at the gym with weight lifting. My skin on my face, and the chronic acne on my back, cleared up completely, and my hormonal cycles have started to regulate naturally. I would recommend this to anyone who isn't satisfied with doctors prescribing things and wants to truly heal their bodies. Try it, it's only 30 days!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Excellent book and in arrived in great shape.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.
B008B1VYP0|3.0|This album isn't as bad as people and critics have made it out to be, but that doesn't make it good either. What really plagues this album is poor songwriting. With the exception of probably 5 songs, none of the writing on this album catches you as easily as the songs on previous Maroon 5 albums. That being said there are some gems on this album. \\"Payphone,\\" \\"One More Night,\\" \\"Ladykiller,\\" \\"Fortune Teller\\" and my personal favorite \\"Love Somebody\\" are all great Maroon 5 songs. If Maroon 5 had taken their time and crafted each song better we would've had a hit album on our hands, but that's not the case. Hopefully their next album will be better.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|How many more books in the series? I'm eagerly waiting for the final book. Very enjoyable, with lots of surprises.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this film adaptation.  It lacked important character development sequences, and haphazardly reassigned story details to other characters (seemingly at random), and new irrelevant sequences were added in.  It is as if the screen writers only took an executive summary and tried to flesh it out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun app just wish enrrggy generated faster.  the kids all want a turn on this one too!<br />worth playing! 5 stars!

B008EQIEWS|4.0|I've heard and read some bad reviews about this movie, but I liked it. It was a fun movie to watch, and I think I enjoyed it better than the first one. I probably would have enjoyed it more in the theater with the big sound and everything, but I watched it on my Kindle Fire, and it was still pretty good.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I think this book was an easy read but definately not something I would normally read. I will read the rest of the books but I have to take a break and read others in between.

B004VFOT4I|2.0|I recently picked up a VHS copy of this at a local thrift store for almost nothing. Having never seen it, I was looking forward to an exciting 3-hour musical. What a disappointment! Virtually the entire film lacked consistency and cohesiveness. Though some of the musical numbers were quite good, the acting on the part of Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave was unimpressive. Overall, the film was very labored and there was little to connect one scene to another. If you want a truly excellent rendition of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, get a copy of the 1997 film, First Knight starring Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond. The acting is first rate and the film is filled with action and does not drag along like Camelot does. Overall, I was not at all impressed by this film, especially when comparing it to the musicals of Rodgers & Hammerstein or My Fair Lady.
B00499QUK2|5.0|If you haven't watched Sherlock already, do it. It is seriously one of those shows that is so awesome it has a cult following and you literally die a little inside when it is over. Fair warning, each episode is longer than the typical show, but the season only includes three episodes. It also takes longer for each season to be made. But while this means you will be in severe pain waiting for your next Sherlock fix, the wait is totally worth it because it is like a really long fantastically made movie when it does come out.<br /><br />If you have any taste at all, you will love this show.
B0013KTGAG|3.0|I'd say this is a pretty solid, introspective film.  It is NOT the film for someone looking for light sci-fi action or science horror; there are elements of action and horror, but there are also long periods of little movement.  Much of the story is really more of a psychological drama.  It starts off fairly slowly, but picks up radically near the end.  As the description indicates, this is the story of a small group of people on a mission to save the world against odds that are not impossible, but very small.  Even the smallest error could spell failure, and failure means the extinction of all life on Earth. No pressure.  The storyline picks up right before an unexpected find; the Icarus II locates a beacon from the long-lost Icarus I (and if there is ever a sign that your trip to the sun might not work out all that well, the fact that the name of the ship is the ICARUS would be it; I mean, really?).  Decisions have to be made and things start to fall apart.  What I liked: -The storyline was intriguing and made me think. -The actors were well cast and did a fantastic job, particularly Murphy and Evans. -The special effects of the Icarus itself were great, particularly the long-distance views of Icarus and the sun.  Thinks that were well done, but not to my taste: -The movie maintains a very tense astmosphere the whole time, even before things start to go wrong.  I would have preferred to have some lighter moments, particularly toward the beginning when they were still setting up the story line. Jokes among the crew, them relaxing together, that sort of thing.  Instead, even the 'relaxation' scenes tend to be very heavy and loaded. -The action effects are very flashy.  There is a lot of camera blur and pictures randomly popping up for a fraction of a second, and jumping from one scene to another, and I'm only glad I didn't watch it in the theater because it would have given me a massive headache.  What I didn't like: -The story starts after they've already been on the mission, just 8 people in a relatively small space for 16 months; and yet they come across as mere acquaintances.  16 months with just 8 people.  Come on, friendships should have formed by now, somebody should be having an affair, someone's getting a little too close to Icarus (the AI)--something should be going on other than just a group of acquaintances going about their individual lives.  All I really saw was some mild-to-moderate dislike and equally mild attraction between a few of the characters.  In a setting like this, the relationships between the characters SHOULD have been a major part of the plot, but it only seemed to touch on them lightly. Don't get me wrong, I think the individual characters were well-written; they all had distinct personalities.  I just think the character dynamics were rushed, like important parts of the story were edited out.  It made the story feel cold, even when it should have been hot. -There was a villain (as indicated in the previews), but they introduced him too late in the movie to have much impact, and gave very little of his background.  He was scary, but also very random.  Honestly, I think the movie would have been better if they left him out all together and focused more on the other characters.

B007I2BZIE|1.0|I'm a huge Rush fan.  They're one of my all-time favorite bands.  I have all except for a few of their albums, and I love the period between 2112 and Grace Under Pressure in particular.<br /><br />So I got this album when it came out, and really didn't get into it except for the first song - Caravan.  But after reading all the raving reviews of it on here, I decided to give it a some more listens and time before I posted a review of it.<br /><br />Now I have listened to it all the way thru several times, and I still don't really like it.  Like others have said, it mostly sounds the same except for a few good music jams here and there like in Caravan and Headlong Flight, and except for a couple of acoustic songs that don't have much to them.<br /><br />Even in those songs I can't really take Geddy's voice.  Hasn't anyone else noticed how whimpy it's gotten on the last few releases?  Almost like he's crying.  His voice has never been the strength of the band (their musicianship and song writing has), but even when it was screeching in the old days it was at least tolerable because the music was so great, and the late 70s and 80s is probably when his voice was the best.<br /><br />So I'm not getting all the rave reviews.  There's just not much to like here.  Do you guys really think any of these songs will be remembered in a few years, let alone 10 or 20 years like their old stuff is?  Maybe Caravan, but that's it.  I mean at least Snakes and Arrows had some good instrumentals.  Personally I wish Test For Echo was their last album.  They've been milking it ever since.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|Product looks great! It has the same metal finish as a MacBook Pro so it looks sleek and professional. My only problem with the stand is that It's higher than I thought , and the angle of the dip is less acute than what the picture illustrates.  It's almost a 90 degree angle , which is basically a flat surface.
B00026WU82|4.0|I gave my son an old boom box with tape player and my old lady  whale sounds and relaxation tapes. he's in his forties and said to be sure to include some sixties tunes for nostalgia (tho he wasnt born till 70). I didnt have any so went on line to find cheap tapes..I was thinking about what I would give him about the sixties to give him an idea of what it was like...and I thought of Dylan (I also thought of cream, hendrix, taj mahol, ravi shankar, beatles, credence clearwater revival and more. My budget is tiny so I could only pick a few and I decided Dylan was one you never hear about anymore but he was the sixties and no collection would be right without him. So here's to social activism, caring beyond oneselves, the lack of greed or need for power..to Dylan and the 60s.

B00003OSU4|4.0|The Newport Jazz Festival has had a somewhat spotty history since its establishment in 1954.  Many residents of the upscale city disliked the traffic, the noise, and the racially mixed crowds.  Even so, in the 1950s and early 1960s, the festival thrived with performaners ranging from Billie Holiday to Judy Garland.  As time passed, however, the tone of acts would change to such a point that even Led Zeppelin played the Newport Jazz Festival--and very nearly caused a riot in the process.  For a time the festival was actually split between Newport and New York City; these days, however, the festival is held at Fort Adams State Park.  But whatever the festival's ups and downs, in 1958 a novice filmmaker captured the event, and the result was memorable indeed.<br /><br />By his own account, director Bert Stern was really more of a still photographer than a motion picture director, and he had still less experience with documentary.  He originally attempted to create a storyline for the film, but when that notion failed he simply let his cameras focus on whatever pleased him.  The result is as kalediscopic as the music itself, with scenes of Newport, qualifying races for the Americas Cup, crowd scenes, and of course the musicians themselves.  Probably the most iconic image to emerge from the film is that of Anita O'Day, \\"the Jezebel of Jazz,\\" who on the spur of the moment embellished a black coctail dress and black hat with white feathers--and then proceeded to knock it out of the park with performances of \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" and \\"Tea for Two.\\"  But there's much more than this: Jimmy Giuffre, Thelonious Monk, Dinah Washington, Big Maybelle, Chuck Berry, and Jack Teagarden all take memorable turns as well.<br /><br />Most of the acts get one, perhaps two numbers--but then we have Louis Armstrong, memorable with several songs and particularly so with \\"Old Rockin' Chair\\" in his classic duet with Jack Teagarden.  And the show closes with the legendary Mahalia Jackson, whose great voice rings like through a bell ending with \\"The Lord's Prayer.\\"  There's certainly nothing to fault in any of the performances, and the semi-surrealistic quality of the cinematography lends an on-going interest as well.<br /><br />At the time, JAZZ ON A SUMMER'S DAY was controversial for showing blacks and whites sitting together in the same audience and playing together on the same stage.  Today it is a little controversial for the fact that several of the scenes--the apartment sequences and the famous \\"dancing on the roof\\" sequence--were actually staged by director Stern after the fact, and some question whether or not this disqualifies the film from any claim of being a documentary.  In my opinion it doesn't much matter.  It's a great film about music and visual impressions of music, and that's what really matters.  The DVD includes a \\"making of\\" documentary about Stern and the film.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />Remembering Benny Surrattgreat voice rings like through a bell ending with \\"The Lord's Prayer.\\"  There's certainly nothing to fault in any of the performances, and the semi-surrealistic quality of the cinematography lends an on-going interest as well.<br /><br />At the time, JAZZ ON A SUMMER'S DAY was controversial for showing blacks and whites sitting together in the same audience and playing together on the same stage.

B00005JPFH|5.0|I know there are many people who think this is the worst of the trilogy, but I must disagree. This third and last Maguire movie gives us closure. Too, it had Maguire playing many different subroles within Peter Parker. The nerdy Parter, the cocky Parker, the cruel Parker, the jackass Parker, the Parker who did what he wanted due to arrogance, etc. This allowed the character to grow and the movie to show the many different facets that existed in the Peter Parker/Spiderman persona. The multilayered performance gave us insight into the many torments and demons Peter Parker & Spiderman have had to endure. The last movie was about losing his confidence; this movie was about him being overconfident.<br /><br />I liked Flint Marko and identified with him greatly. A Vietnam-Vet, rejected by society and oppressed by New York cops. A man who by his own words was not a bad person, but had bad luck in his life. He is an example of the typical down-on-his-luck American from The Great Recession. Marko, like most men, was a neutral man. Not good, but not evil. His amorality made him the most realistic of all the super-villains in the original Spiderman trilogy.<br /><br />Seeing Venom for the first time was a shock to me. I never thought he would make an appearance in the movies, but when the character did I was noting but pleased.<br /><br />The culmination of the love triangle between Harry Osborn and Peter Parker was a joy. This, in my opinion, was a drag in the series, its only real weak point in my opinion. Indeed, I'm glad the new Spiderman movie has avoided that for the most part. Even the comics and cartoon versions never had this. In the end, Franco's alturistic sacrifice made the movie's (And Series) climax a triumph.<br /><br />Buy this DVD for the extra backstory (Somewhat Apocrophyl I Might Say) concerning Ben Parker and his murderer(s). That added another layer to the Spiderman mythos. I enjoyed that at the time and most Spiderman fans will too.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I think that it was lovely. I related to it on some levels. I felt as afterwards some things in the world actually made sense to me, which occurs very rarely. I like being able to understand things. I would consier myself to be a wallflower, as the main character was, which drew me in, illustrating the good and bad of being so. I enjoyed this book because how it made me feel during and after.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|Everyone is a critic.  I enjoyed the book and thought I had figured out the ending but not quite.  In fact, I would have to say there was no ending.  It was more of an explanation of the story but to me it left the door open for a subsequent book.  Sort of reminds me of the Stephen King Dark Tower series where each book set up the next book, then the last book ended with the beginning of the first book.<br /><br />I enjoy thought provoking fiction but this book did not really do that.  To me there were a couple of major parts of the story that were not explained but were only implied.  It was sort of mental time travel and you never really knew what time you were actually in until the last chapter.
B008602KQI|4.0|The Hunger Games was a very entertaining and thought provoking movie. I have to admit I did not read the book. Sometimes that can be a benefit. You end up spending more time comparing the movie to the book instead of rating it on it's own merits. I would highly recommend it.
1423136802|5.0|I cut my milk-teeth reading Greek and Roman mythology, devouring everything I could lay my hands on before I was 12. Coming from a British-Sri Lankan family, it was the mythology I knew best as a child, and my mother and Nana would tell me stories of the Greek gods, titans, and heroes. It was one of my favorite genres growing up. I only discovered and learned how fascinating Indian mythology was much later. In those days, the bookshelves of libraries and bookstores didn't have much Indian mythology or even Asian mythology to speak of. But I soon ran out of Greek mythology to read and all I could find was the same stuff regurgitated over and over again, often quite grim and boring. The movies were much better. I remember loving Clash Of The Titans and cartoons that featured references or episodes revolving around the myths. Comic were my go-to place during my teens and 20s. I was even thrilled to pieces at a passing reference in the 80s teen comedy Adventures In Babysitting where the garage mechanic is supposedly Thor passing as a mortal on Earth. But then I grew up and moved on to other things. Life happened. I got so blas&eacute; I remember changing the channel when the movie adaptation of Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief was on a few months ago, thinking 'Ah, another Harry Potter rip-off.'<br /><br />But recently I was looking for something different to cleanse my palate. I'd recently rediscovered fantasy and also YA fantasy. So I picked up The Lightning Thief. And a few hours and a few hundred pages later, I was blown away. Riordan manages to condense character development, action, fantasy, humor, emotion, all into a few well-turned lines. He does it so smoothly, mixing it all together like a great cocktail. Most YA authors barely manage to juggle romance and fantasy, or humor and satire. He throws it all in, stirs the pot, but then doles in out in lovely dollops. Entertaining as a Hollywood summer blockbuster. Fantastic reimagining of the mythology set in contemporary times. Simple characters quickly but deftly sketched. And it's as funny as it is fun! I love the wit most of all. That ability to turn an elegant pun or clever comeback while still keeping the action moving and the mystery intact. Riordan does it wonderfully. I'll admit, I'm now a fan!temporary times. Simple characters quickly but deftly sketched. And it's as funny as it is fun! I love the wit most of all.

0307592731|3.0|Perhaps I expected too much from this book, but from the reviews I read and the interview with Oprah that I watched, I thought it would be more introspective.  The book was somewhat interesting but was more of a journal of her hike than the process she went through mentally to come to terms with the loss of her mother.  Granted, the hike was long, perilous and something that most of us would never do, but I was not looking for an outdoor adventure book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I got the authors name from another up and coming fantasy author(Michael Sullivan). All i can say is i loved this book. If you like Rothfuss, Brett, Sanderon, Weeks, Abercrombie and Martin you will definitely enjoy this book. Book 2 cannot get here fast enough.
B000PKW73S|5.0|Every book that James Waller has published come across with a lot of relevance to places I've lived and experiences I've had. It helps when reading Waller to look at all the books he's written and check the publication dates and then read them in order as they relate to each other with some of the characters being the lead and more developed in one and then another person in another.
0307592731|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Wild while I was recently backpacking solo.  I have two comments.  Our wild places are shrinking and there are an increasing number of us who need to retreat to them.  I found it very interesting that the original concept of the PCT was to extend all the way down to Patagonia.  Perhaps Cheryl you would consider giving a portion of the proceeds of your book to continuing to preserve and expand these places.  Would be terrific.  Second, we still hold on to some fairy tale myth that finally settling down and getting married is \\"found\\", \\"resolved\\", nothing more to do after that.  I had a tumultuous and adventurous young womanhood, then found the love of my life (or so I thought), had two incredibly fabulous children (the youngest pair to just complete the Great Divide mountain biking trail), and am just now healing from an incredibly difficult divorce.  The biggest and most challenging adventure begins with saying \\"I do\\" and having kids.  A great majority of us have a long way towards \\"found\\" in developing ourselves as relational beings and revising the way partnerships, especially, between men and women, are formed.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|So I had to read this for myself after hearing all of the mixed reviews of it. I was thinking it was going to be a lot different. I could relate a lot to this book, which is why I think I liked it so much, but it had nothing to do with the BDSM or the sex. Just their relationship as a whole. I tend to be a generally shy person when it comes to the opposite sex, and so I could understand how it was difficult for Anastasia(ANA) to discuss her feelings with Christian and send them through email instead. I am the same way. I was intrigued by their relationship because I wanted to see if he was going to bend his rules for her. They both made compromises in who they were for the other, and isn't that what a relationship is about. So, now, I can't wait to see what happen next. Anyone got book 2 on Kindle I can borrow??

B008KWHL6G|5.0|A fantastic but all too short record from Two Gallants mixes elements of Bob Dylan and White Stripes to give the listener that strange feeling that he has heard these songs before, despite the fact they are all brand new. From the opening strains of \\"Halcyon Days\\" to the fading chords of \\"Sunday Souvenirs,\\" The Bloom And The Blight is everything indie rock should be. \\"Broken Eyes\\" is very Dylan-esque, complete with the harmonica, while \\"Ride Away\\" has that White Stripes feel with a big sound from the instrumentation while the lyrics hint at a heartbreaking story.<br /><br />Two Gallants is made up of just two people, Adam H. Stephens (vocals, guitars, keys) and Tyson Vogel (drums, vocals, guitar), but you would never know that without looking at the credits. The sound is full, the songs are complete, the simple fact is this is a great album.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Scalzi takes a different route on this final book in the trilogy.  The ending of \\"The Ghost Brigade\\" was alluding to this.  With Zoe, both Sagan and Perry have \\"settled down\\" and have formed a family on the colony world Huckleberry.  However, duty calls and as a family they are on a new quest to a new world.  Decent plot twists at the end.  Gotta read it because it is the last book.  Probably would have given it 3.5 stars if I could break the ratings down that way.<br /><br />Happy reading to all!
0345522478|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Jim Butcher's DRESDEN FILES series (not his FURY series) and having exhausted the Dresden books, I have been looking for another series to latch onto.  I read the Robert Jordan books (disappointing), and the Game of Thrones books (also disappointing) that are available to date - and I don't recommend them.  But until now, I haven't found anything with the fast-pace and wit and personality of the Dresden File books I love.<br /><br />This book series is not quite equal to Dresden, but it's pretty close.  Kevin has a good writing style - doesn't get things too complicated and doesn't overkill on descriptions, but sticks more to action and conversation.<br /><br />Before this book series I hadn't read much about Druids in any other books so it's neat to discover what they're about and capable of (as per Mr Hearne anyhow) - and it's interesting to also be learning about the ancient Greek mythological gods and such too.<br /><br />In this book, Atticus is the last Druid and thousands of years old - he has a dog he can converse with (thru thought) and they have some good chats. His \\"friends\\" are his lawyers (Hal is a werewolf, and Leif is an old vampire), and an elderly widowed neighbor (you'll love her) who enjoys her Irish Whiskey a lot.<br /><br />Best advice - quit reading the reviews and start reading this series!  Chances are high you're going to really enjoy it!<br /><br />TIP:  If you find you're enjoying this by 1/3 or 1/2 way through, start ordering the rest of the books because they're quick reads and you'll want the next one in the series ready when you finish this.  :-)

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Read it over a few days, on and off.  I enjoyed the stories, so much so that I would get caught up in them and not want to stop reading.  I didn't view anything to be \\"sensitive information\\", but it's clear he walked a thin line in what he did give details on.<br /><br />Really, anything in this book could already had been found somewhere else, like google or the discovery channel, history channel, military channel.  He just put it all together in a package that many people would read, as opposed to scattered about.<br /><br />For me, the bottom line is, if he did half of what he claims in the book, the guy is a real hero.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of Stephan Kings better books and I have read plenty. What a great concept.  The idea of traveling back in time to change a major event in American history was so thought provoking. I sent several days thinking about this particular event and how it effected us all.  I was impressed with his research and was intrigued enough to want to research some of the people on my own.<br />I could hardly stand to put this book down.  Thanks Stephen King for a good read.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Some like it hot...but hot it's not. I can't figure out the appeal. I think I like better grammar and more content. It's very lightweight and repetitive. \\"Christian is is beautiful, so sexy>\\" \\"Anastacia you are so beautiful.\\" How many times do you need to read that! The movie won't have much dialogue. No style, no substance. I was hoping it would build like most novels, but that was not the case.Kind of kinky. If you like that sort of thing go for it!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|The author has a wonderful turn of phrase and great grasp of the english language selection appropriate but seldon used words to accurately describe the various emotions portrayed in the book.

B005LAIH9A|5.0|And I really wasn't expecting to enjoy it at all.<br />Movies like this find an audience because people can genuinely relate to what the characters are going through.<br />With the first film the kids were all in high school and I was already in my mid/late 20's.<br />I also don't remember acting that way in high school.<br />Granted the movie had some funny moments but for the most part I simply couldn't relate.<br />Same with part two when they're in college.<br />I figured what the heck I might as well at least say I saw all three of them.<br />So I rented this one.<br />And now that the kids are all grown up, done with school and have entered the adult phase of life I found myself laughing frequently.<br />Granted, they're still the same immature unrealistic bunch of brats they were from the first film but the brats turned in an excellent performance this time around.<br />Listening to them complain about work and adult life was something I could finally relate to.<br />I won't go into the plot details aobut each character but to summarize...<br />Great acting, direction, score, story.<br />I was expecting it to drag but none of it did.<br />The joys of adulthood.<br />Who says you can't be an adult and still be a moron?<br />I liked it enough that I'll end up buying it.<br />Recommended.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|The Iron Lady, 2011 film<br /><br />A woman buys a pint of milk at a grocery. [The story proceeds slowly. What was its purpose?] There is a flashback to the bombing of WW II. Margaret helps her father at his store (like a good daughter should). The TV tells about an explosion at a Brighton hotel. Next Miss Roberts is chosen as a Conservative candidate for Parliament. She explains her viewpoints. [The film keeps skipping from the present to the past. This is confusing to anyone who knows little of her history.] Margaret will marry Dennis but wants to be more than a housewife. In retirement she watches old home movies of her children. \\"They grow up so fast.\\" She wins a seat in Parliament in 1959 (because of a divided opposition). \\"Welcome to the madhouse.\\" She makes a speech. A strike stops garbage collection and other services. There was a coal miner's strike over lowered wages circa 1972.<br /><br />Margaret decides to run for leader of the party on principle. A man advises her on her appearance to attract voters. She takes voice lessons to project her image. A friend is killed by a bomb! In 1979 she became the first woman Prime Minister in the Western World. [The film jumps ahead again.] Baroness Thatcher was called \\"The Iron Lady\\". She cut the budget and privatized services. [So how did that work out for the British?] Did she \\"change the face of history\\"? Did her policies cause a drop in industrial production? Were people becoming impoverished? There was growing unemployment. Bombs are set off! The Argentinians invaded the Falkland Islands. Maggie said sink the Belgrano (as it was returning home). An Exocet missile hits British frigate. The British retake the Falkland Islands. This victory proves popular and boosts her standing. She asks for new taxes on everyone and accuses those who disagree with her of cowardice. [Has she grown proud and arrogant?] There are disturbances in the streets.<br /><br />The jumping back and forth in the first half of this movie makesit difficult to follow if you know little of the details of her life. It should have followed the historical sequence. You see actors who represent actual politicians; they are unknown to those who know the details of British politics. Thatcher destroyed the national coal industry to make the country dependent on imported oil and gas (as far as I know). This benefitted these special interests. The future will decide if this was a correct decision.<br /><br />There was a military coup in Argentina in the mid-1960s (part of the \\"Alliance for Progress\\"). It led to the oppression of the people. The attempt to reclaim the Falkland Islands with an invasion. This failure led to their overthrow and a more democratic government. The same thing happened in Greece a decade earlier. Is there a lesson here?<br />I wonder about the powers that first backed Maggie Thatcher then switched to a new leader (she was rejected by her own party). There was not mention of this in the movie. Was Great Britain in better shape after her reign as Prime Minister? What corporations promoted her?

0385738773|4.0|Thomas and his friends have defeated the Maze and the Trials. They have defeated grievers and crazed zombies. Now the truth is beginning to unfold whether they like it or not. With one last test to complete the blueprint Thomas must make choices that he never thought he would have to and uncover the truth behind Wicked's actions. The last installment of a fast-paced dystopian series that will have you at the edge of your seat!<br /><br />  The Death Cure was quite mysterious in the way that Wicked was labeled as evil from some characters while the main character was positive that it was evil. This controversy gave it the edge it needed and made us, readers, want to know what the truth is. I loved how the end was wrapped up with a twist that I did not expect and it always amuses me when I'm caught off guard.<br /><br />  I enjoyed how difficult it seemed to be in the place of one of the characters. They must have been emotionally and physically shocked after an episode like this and the sacrifices that they had to make added to its intruigingness. I also liked how James Dashner was quite bold and killed off some, if not, many of the characters that we've seen since the beginning *cry*.<br /><br />  The last book of the series brought back many memories for me especially since it brought back many things from book one such as places or people which we thought we would never see again. Of course if you read them all in a sequence it won't be as memorable but for me who had to wait for all three books I had amazing flashbacks emotions!<br /><br />  I think that the past novels brought so much high expectations for our \\"grand finale\\" that it kind of disappointed me. The characters seemed to run around a lot and didn't do much fighting encounters which troubled me. It was mostly a game of hide and seek and Wicked had the upper hand. Also the plot didn't remain untouched throughout the novels and this disappointed me because I liked to finish series but when I pick up a book I like to be on the same story line when I finish it.<br /><br />  Overall the book was great but somewhat disappointing considering James Dashner's great techniques!ok I like to be on the same story line when I finish it.<br /><br />  Overall the book was great but somewhat disappointing considering James Dashner's great techniques!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I became an instant fan of the \\"Longmire\\" TV series now airing on cable TV. The writing and acting make for a compelling procedural set in Wyoming (even if it is rumored to be filmed in New Mexico). I'm a former Wyoming resident and they're selling me on the series' authenticity.<br /><br />Having said all that, I was happy tap into my Kindle Fire to sample \\"The Cold Dish,\\" Craig Johnson's 1st in the Walt Longmire series of books. He brings the characters to life, gives each of them his/her own well-defined persona, and weaves a fascinating crime tale. Johnson lives in Ucross, Wyoming, and brings the landscape and people to life in vivid fashion. He carries me back to the Cowboy State with each reading. Craig Johnson makes you care about his cast of characters. He leads you logically along the mystery trail, springing delicious surprises as the tale unfolds. The books are much better than the TV series. I will have to read the entire Walt Longmire saga.

It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\"<br /><br />A society in which courage is still identified with a man/woman with a weapon in hand, above thought by Atticus/ Lee is a definite way, not a fragile hope for peace. The book not only touches upon the problem of racism Americnas were dealing with at that point of time, but also touches upon the fundamental values of a man. And that is why i feel the book has been acclaimed globally.<br /><br />The book is as much about how a society should acknowledge existence and dignity of all its people as much it is about probing what are fundamental human values a person should pursue. The values of Atticus are so fundamental for humans that the book would continue to exist on the shelves of book stores (online or otherwise) because the values would continue to exist. Well, i do not want to insinuate French revolution here, but the simple words which can be chosen for the values the book brings forth are: freedom, justice, equality, fraternity, and compassion.<br /><br />Thanks and regards,<br />Pravin<br />[[ASIN:B008F4TOKK Once upon a time in the land of Jasmine Revolution and some short stories]]

B005LAIHAO|3.0|There was plenty of time during this movie to run for snacks, come back, and not miss anything. This is certainly not one of Bruce Willis at his best, and the entire cast of acting was not to exciting. Will Shaw takes a trip to Spain for a family vacation to go sailing for a week. But, all hell breaks loose when his family is kidnapped by intelligence agents, who are anxious in recovering a mysterious briefcase, and he finds himself on the run. This reminded me very much of a movie I watched in the past. I believe it was with Harrison Ford, and 'Frantic' rings a bell, except the kidnapping was his wife, and he was on the run. \\"THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY\\" was too slow, boring, and not much action. Although the theme was about conspiracy, family, and kidnapping, the plot needed work. Overall, the movie had a lot of room for Improvement.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Masterfully written story dripping suspense from page to page.  Clever use of real time story telling alternating with with past time diary entries creating a page turner that will isolate you from your family and friends for awhile.  Several big OMG revelations keep you guessing and turning those pages all the way to the end.  The ending of the book is the only part I found lacking.  You will enjoy the read and then make your own judgment about the way it ends.  Great book club selection.  You could discuss it well into the tiny hours.

But, this is what makes catch-22 a unique book. although the randomness is evident, but so is the sense derived out of randomness. does it discuss futility of war? yes it does. does it challenge the whole concept of courage as we understand of it being possessed by every martyr of a war? yes it does. does it challenge the belief that every law is benevolent? yes it does. and in spite of handling such serious issues, does it make the reader laugh? i think, yes- it does make one laugh till the guts are about to spill out.<br /><br />thanks,<br />Pravin<br />[[ASIN:B008F4TOKK Once upon a time in the land of Jasmine Revolution and some short stories]]

B008EL4YX6|2.0|I thought this would be interesting and fun.  However, it got boring very quickly.  Basically, at each screen, you have to plan out how you are going to play before even starting.  It then becomes a puzzle game (spend 5 minutes studying the screen before starting each time), and then you have to remember your plan (like remembering 20 chess moves) while you tap the screen  the right number of times at the right speed at the right time.  When you get done with each screen, it's less the thrill of victory than it is the relief of having gotten through it.  The game seems original and has some appeal, so it gets above 1 star,  but since the thought of playing it again brings a groan to me, it gets no more than 2 stars.  I would not buy this again.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a surprisingly funny, and well done movie, I was impressed with the story line that developed. Would recommend to others.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I sat here, debating whether to give this book 2 or 3 stars. I settled on 3 because the writing is good even if I wasn't as thrilled with the story and the characters.<br /><br />First, the writing. The author gets points for pacing, voice, characterization and description. \\"Other than several improper dialogue tags,\\" she shrugged, the writing is professional and engaging. I visualized the story and the characters easily. Ms. McGuire is talented. Of that, there is no doubt.<br /><br />The problem comes where the plot and character choices are concerned. An author can write his/her characters how ever s/he wants, but will the reader like them? I liked the characters in general, even though I don't get into tattooed, tough guy heroes, but the author lost me along the way with their interactions and choices.<br /><br />(Note: In the book EASY by Webber, the tattooed hero won me over in the end, but not in BD.)<br /><br />*Plot spoilers ahead...*<br /><br />Abby befriends tough guy Travis. Fine. She loses a bet and has to stay at his place for a month. A little odd (and convenient for the plot), but okay. I can roll with that. The problem comes when he misbehaves while she's there.<br /><br />Later on down the line, the heroine gets angry because Travis hits a guy when he's upset with her (and knocks her down in the process), saying 'red flags are going up all over the place...'<br /><br />What? So they didn't go up when he got drunk and bedded a girl in the living room? Then two at one time? I'm sorry. I would have left right then and said screw the bet. I don't care if the they were only friends. That would have ruined him as boyfriend material for me forevermore. Yet not only does Abby stay, but she continues to (platonically) share his bed, then enters into a romantic relationship with him.<br /><br />Even if we let that slide, what about when he goes berserk and trashes his room - breaking the mirror and the door - all because she left at the end of her month's stay without saying goodbye? That wasn't a bright enough red flag? It would have been for me.<br /><br />I liked the supporting characters, America and Shepley, but even they did some things that didn't ring true. When Travis finally has a legitimate reason to go ape-shit, America turns on him. It didn't make sense.<br /><br />There were plausibility issues, too. Travis beats up a guy in front of his football teammates in the cafeteria and not a single one retaliates. I don't care if the guy deserved it. The football boys I know wouldn't stand by and not dive in. And I don't care how strong Travis is or what kind of rep he has. By sheer numbers, they could have taken him. What do they do, though? They sit by and do nothing, then happily sing back-up when he pulls a Ferris Beuller and sings on the table the following day.<br /><br />And while we're on the topic of beating the guy's face in... Travis does this in a college cafeteria twice, being seen by the 'cafeteria ladies' the second time, and never gets in trouble. Huh? Where were the cameras and the disciplinary committee of the school? He doesn't even get questioned over the two secret fights that result in raids/police intervention. I don't buy it. Even if he got away at first, the bruises on his face would have given him away. And after the second disaster, he stands around the scene for some time. Sorry. He would have gotten questioned by someone.<br /><br />*End of major spoilers*<br /><br />The fact that Travis gets away with everything without any consequences is simply not realistic.<br /><br />He also loses points for being an inconsiderate lover. Unless the author failed to make it clear (which I doubt), he never bothers to see to Abby's pleasure in bed. Only his own. He lost points with me over that, and he didn't have many left to lose.<br /><br />As far as the ending, it's happy, but not really. The thought of these two messed up kids in a codependent relationship embarking on a life together left me shaking my head and picturing nothing but a future filled with disasters--none of which would be beautiful.<br /><br />It's a wild read, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy parts of it, but it's not my kind of romance. Read at your own risk.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I fell in love with this story and the characters. It is an achingly wonderful heart-rending fantastical story unlike any I have ever read. It invaded my dreams and filled my senses.  I hope to read many more books by Erin Morgenstern. She has a rare gift - she can bring fantasy to life and make you believe the Night Circus exists because of love. I felt the creative power of a transcending love between two magicians and their desire to delight the other. I believed in fairies as a child and I believe in The Night Circus. Read it and be swept away into another world. You'll be glad you did.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is a welcome distraction that challenges you to think. It is rather unexpected and pleasantly surprising. I love how it starts off simple and then it gets tricky. It is a great game for people who like puzzles or challenging mind games.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A very different book compared to what I usually read. It kept me interested and I did not want to put it down.
B007TMON8M|1.0|The most realistic crashing app simulator I have ever played. Convincingly simulates a total crash within 4 seconds of loading the main menu. Seriously though, total garbage, 0 stars if it was possible.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have fallen in love with this movie.  I have actually seen the movie five times so far. The movie is very interesting to me that I started reading the Hunger Games books.  These books are wonderful.  Yes they left out a few details in the movie, but the director can't fit every detail from the book into the movie.  The movie is already 2+ hours long.  Great casting also.
B0035JRVR8|4.0|A MUST SEE,perfect for those going to Italy or wanting to remember a special time they spent in Rome. This is a feel good movie with Audrey Hepburn in her first staring role.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not my usual type of books, but since I heard all the hype I read the first 2 books and decided to finish the set. I skipped through a lot of the sex I mean really who has that much sex ever??
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator for those of us with ageing eyes. Easy to read,  easy to operate too. A no brained for sure.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are a good time stretcher with easy game play and difficult reaction times. many varity obviously but takes a while to get new levels tho. rate  6.5 / 10
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|Amazing cast.  I much prefer this to the more recent anniversary edition.  There are far more brilliant vocal moments here!  You can't be sorry purchasing this.  After seeing the Broadway production live several times, I still never tire of listening to this over and over again on my long drives.  Dream cast for sure!
B003QS9WIE|1.0|The title says it all.  Call us movie snobs, but this movie is a waste of time. The movie jumps around, the twist is stupid, and the outlandish historical claims about significant contributors to our society, including Tesla and Edison are inexcusable.
0374532281|5.0|This book does an incredible job of delving into the emotions and complex relationship of modern men. Mainly about Pat Peoples relationship with his Father, Brother, Mother, Psichiatrist and friends.<br /><br />Incredibly funny at times. Extremely fun to reed always.

B007SGM084|5.0|Wow! What a story. The author uses words that draw such a vivid picture. Just finished the first book, can't wait to start the second.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved this movie, and it was as good on the small screen as on the big screen! I do have to admit though that there were moments where I thought the CGI was done really crappy, such as the big moment when Katniss and Peeta enter the arena on the chariot. It was obvious that the crowd was a green screen.
B008WHTFL8|5.0|The Darkness is back! After a long break, they come back with an album that reminds me of the first album, Permission to Land. Great songs and a lot of fun to listen to. Highly recommended if you liked the first two albums.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Yes, this book is very dark and intense, but it is so captivating! I couldn't put it down!! I read this book first and then proceeded to read Gillian Flynn's other two books, Sharp Objects, and Gone Girl. I loved them all!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|This was awesome.  Some parts could've been better, but all in all, I'd put it in the top hundred action/adventure films of all time.  The terrible shame is that because this did so poorly at the box office there won't be any more of them.  That said, I'd suggest not going into this with any major expectations--it's not Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark--but it is a fun ride.  Should've been called \\"Princess of Mars\\" though (like the book).  \\"John Carter\\" is a terrible title.<br /><br />As can be seen from the majority of reviews, most people really liked this film.  But as others have noted, there were some big flaws in its marketing.  Disney is developing a knack for screwing their own films.  They've come out with several films in the last decade that should've done better--deserved better--than the response they got.  I've worked with Disney in the past, and anyone who has had to work with them can tell you: they have their own way doing things.  I worked for a company that did closed-captioning for Disney, and they were the biggest pain in the neck.  Despite knowing nothing about this kind of work, they insisted everything should be done a certain way simply because the guy in charge of that department had his own opinions, which as it turned out were based on one conversation he had with a deaf friend of his wife's.  Forget all the research and testing my company had done; because his wife's friend liked such-and-such, every Disney film would be captioned that way.  I suspect this kind of thing permeates the Disney way of doing business.  I can just imagine that the person who deals with marketing heard something his daughter once said, and therefore, the multi-million dollar marketing campaign gets designed by a ten year old.  Well, whatever the case, they need to reassess their methods, because there are a few franchises that never got off the ground due to their own mishandling.  And unfortunately, the creators of these films lose out, the companies involved lose out, and we the audience never get to see what could've been a great series of films.

1455502758|5.0|Most of us have had contact with cancer in our lives - we've either experienced it firsthand or know (or known) a family member or friend who has had it - and in each instance it's been horrible, an experience unlikely to provide you with much and likely to take a lot from you, if not everything. But most of us aren't Christopher Hitchens - if fact none of us are, and that's why we know who was. He was a unique voice whose essays, columns, articles, and books made the person reading them much more enriched having read them.<br /><br />\\"Mortality\\" is his last book (though I'm sure further anthologies of unpublished material will appear in the years ahead) detailing his fatal encounter with esophageal cancer, from discovering it while on a book tour promoting his memoir \\"Hitch 22\\", to the final pages which are scraps of notes for future (and now forever unwritten) writings.<br /><br />But it's not a sad book. Hitchens was ruthless in his approach to subjects and he is no less so when dealing with himself and \\"the alien\\" (which is how he characterises his cancer) - no sentimentality or feeling sorry for himself is allowed on the page.<br /><br />He is informative, funny, and stubborn all at once when writing on the reaction among religious groups when news of his cancer was reported with some Christians instigating a \\"Pray for Hitch\\" day - a day he encourages everyone to ignore. He also reinforces his atheist position, almost aggressively, writing \\"What if I pulled through and the pious faction contentedly claimed that their prayers had been answered? That would somehow be irritating.\\" As if he wanted to die to once more further his argument that there is no God! If this book shows anything it is that death and the prospect of death does not change the person, and that Hitchens remained dignified and his own person right to the end.<br /><br />There are essays on coping with the cancer treatment which is almost as bad as the cancer, and a fantastic piece on Nietzsche and the etymology of the phrase \\"whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger\\". The book is full of rich writing displaying a luminous and inquisitive mind, questioning death, the mundanity of illness, and moving from issues of existence to anecdotes of past columns such as the time he underwent waterboarding to experience how bad a torture it is (very bad as it turns out, traumatising in fact).<br /><br />Also included is a foreword by Hitchen's editor at Vanity Fair Graydon Carter and a moving afterword by his wife Carol Blue. Our culture lost a brilliant mind on December 15, 2011, and \\"Mortality\\" is a fine coda to a man who lived life fearlessly and wrote some of the best reportage of the last 50 years. Christopher Hitchens remains an essential writer to read.nd the etymology of the phrase \\"whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger\\".

B003K16P3M|4.0|I liked Graceling. Katsa had a well-developed personality from the moment the book began. She did become stronger and there were moments of self-discovery where she realized she was more even if you'd suspected it all along. Po was wise beyond his years and clever. He was generally likable. Bitterblue was tough and smart. The characters in this book were just wonderful, and liking a character just means a lot when you're reading a book. Why read about a character you don't care about?<br /><br />The story itself while some parts were wonderful - like Katsa declaring her independence - some parts may not be suitable for certain age groups - when certain characters do the deed in no uncertain terms.<br /><br />I liked the storyline. I liked the characters. I liked the world Cashore built. It was worth it.

B008MEM24S|5.0|I downloaded the game for my kids to play but I ended up getting hooked to it myself. I love the graphics, the voice overs and the fun challenges. It works amazingly well with my kindle fire. I've gotten through 30 levels with no performance issues at all.
B00006FDCD|3.0|Steven King's 'It\\" was a Ok video, a pale comparison to the book. The casting, even though it was a TV movie from the 80's, was suspect. But the good news is, I hear producers are looking to remake 'It\\" for the cinema, with a proper budget and a top director. Too often King's books never get a proper budget when that make the transition from book to film. Over all if you wnat to remember your childhood from the 80's its a good 10.00 dolare spent.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I got what I expected. And it looks wonderful. Anyone with an interest in Minecraft or Lego should definitely look into buying this.
B005LAIH9A|4.0|It was an ok movie, but the plot was predictable.  I wish they had evolved Stiffler's character a little more...how long can a man remain an immature douche?  My husband enjoyed it much more than I did.  Maybe it's a guy thing.
B0055DNH0C|4.0|I usually don't buy full albums because you end up with many songs that I never listen to. But this one really surprised me for having a variety of good rhythm songs as well as others that have a different style that you would not expect from Pitbull. Overall a good buy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Yet another story set in Nazi Germany, but what an original telling. It was such an interesting perspective and so moving. I read the last parts through tears both sad and happy. Make sure you have a tissue handy.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I feel like a kid with his first notebook. When I turn on one of my devices,  I see Ellie in bottom right hand corner sunning with my other devices. WOW, the first part of this review was done on my Fire. I wanted to remember a post card sent from another author, then went ahead and did this little review. BTW started my third notebook, one just for author reviews.[[ASIN:B004LOMB2Q Evernote]]
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I wanted a driving game that wouldn't take up too much space on my Kindle fire. I am in it more for the game experience as opposed to the graphics. This game fits the bill. You truly get to drive. The graphics remind me of 80's level graphics (which is great for me because that is when I thought video games were the best thing since man walked on the moon!)<br /><br />Fun game, works great, and isn't a space hog like some more graphic intense games can be.
B008OM0M4U|4.0|I have never liked any of Sasha's movies or public appearances.  But this one was completely different.  Maybe because I have been to several countries in the Middle East, but I think most people will find it entertaining.

It loads faster than the other paid pdf readers by far and seems to load pages close to you in a more logical way than the others. I have a pdf book approximately 70mb in size and it does very well. It does not have many bells or whistles but gets the job done.

B000SVZIDA|4.0|Not what I expected, but better than I expected. The sets were completely over the top. Coming from a photographic background, I was visually enthralled at almost every scene. The imagery was stunning. The acting was average, the plot intriguing and predictable, but overall nicely done. Kidman, no big fan am I, but she delivered. . . . bgs.<br />.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Omg this game is the best game ever! so happy I downloaded this. I could play this game all day and all night
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|There is more hype to this movie than there is greatness.  The picture quality is what you would expect from a Blu ray DVD.  But I didn't see anything spectacular.  Same goes for the surround sound.  It's not one of those movies that makes you go Wow when you hear the sound.  If you can get it for a good price it is worth it.  But if you have to pay over $15.00, wait for the price to drop.  They often do.
B008602KQI|5.0|Although I initially felt I would not enjoy The Hunger Games movie I quickly learned that there was much more to the movie that meets the eye! The actors were superb in their roles and conveyed a very in depth portrayal of a futuristic battle for humanity, life and love!

1401322786|2.0|I was very excited about \\"the time keeper\\"; I am a fan of Alboum's work over-all, but do think his work can be hit or miss.  Though I am sad to say it, this book, for me was a miss.  I bought it the day of release and read the book in about 2.5 hours.  I think the only reason I kept reading it was because I was waiting for it to get better-after all, it had so much potential!  I was waiting fo the life changing message-the message that would inspire me to savor every moment. What I found was a greedy old man who, at 86, could not accept the end and a typical teenager who is shy and unsure of herself.  I think Albom made Sarah a bit too sterotypical for his own good.  Being raised by a single mom, neglected by her father, chubby and akward when it comes to boys?  Check, check, check, and check.  It was very difficult for me to relate to both Sarah and Victor because they were so cookie-cutter, almost like Albom did not have the TIME to develop them as characters we would relate to and root for.  I also think time is good.  If, like Alboum states in the book, man's days are limited so they can realize how precious they are than would it not make sense for days, hours, minutes to be counted as well, if only for the same reason?  I think Albom was confused on what he wanted to teach us this time around--does he want us to appreciate the time we have by not recognizing it?  Or value the life we live because we appreciate time and it's limitations it inheritely has on all of us?  I gave Albom 2 Stars because I did adore the love story between Dor and Alli (Father Time and his wife)...and when all was said and done and I was reading the letter from Albom to his readers, he mentioned his own wife and his own love story, and I cried, because it was authentic and beautiful, and real.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I heard about the book from a friend, she had heard rave reviews about the book.  At first my initial interest in the book was the erotic nature of it.  Soon after I started to read the book, I found out why it had rave reviews from friends, but I found that once you get over the initial shock of the explicit nature, the story it self is spellbinding, you really want to delve into the story to find out what makes \\"fifty\\" click, the anticipation alone to find out what is behind his behavior makes this book a page turner, and can't put down until you know the whole story and how and if their \\"happy ever after ever happens\\".  Definitely learned a few things along the way toooooo!!!!  That was a plus!!!

I dropped it two days after i put it on my phone.  Dropped it at my phone-holding height (i.e. i was looking at it; I'm 5'7\\"), and it was fine. Basically stylish case, keeps the iphone looking like an iphone, good/easy to apply screen protector.

0307352145|3.0|I am an introvert and well-aware of it. I've done my fair share of reading and research on introversion for self-help and as a former psych major. If you have this type of background, the book is completely worth skipping.<br /><br />When this book came out, I was excited that finally someone had written a book on introvert strengths and perhaps on advocating for better inclusion of introverts in the workplace rather than just on developing coping mechanisms for our loud, loud world.<br /><br />Of course, that is a lofty vision. Cain does discuss the strengths of being introverted: introverts are creative, rational, perceptive, intuitive, etc. She also mentions workplace dynamics that work great for introverts. She also tries to combine anecdotal stories with research data to form conclusions about introverts and extroverts.<br /><br />It does seem grand but at times her logic is flawed. In her world, it seems that people are either/or. In her book, there are no nuances in extroversion and introversion. She does recognize this and the current limits of available research but in attempt to make sense to create a psychological portrait of introverts, she bunches up studies that though may be related to introversion but oftentimes seem tangential to the books topic. The book ends up being a hodgepodge of research on personality traits that don't jive with being outgoing, friendly, and outspoken. While the book is very readable, it lacks a lot of focus and cohesion.<br /><br />One area where Cain seriously fell short is in her description of extroverts. She paints a picture of extroverts like they are unfaithful, impulsive, irrational, reckless beings with animalistic tendencies. For those of introverts who already think that extroverts are strange, strange people, she does nothing to fix that. For extroverts, she may not only offend - which does nothing to bridge gaps of understanding between extroverts or introverts - but she can confuse people who do identify with extroversion.<br /><br />I did enjoy what little there was of accounts of historical figures who were introverted.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a step in the right direction. Most books on introversion are self-help books that merely state the obvious (Introverts need recharge time!) and that only require effort on the introvert's part to participate in the workplace, community and relationships. Cain attempts to write a book that will push society to better accommodate introversion. It's an attempt at a book that both introverts and extroverts can read for better understanding and acceptance of introvert behavior... but sadly, it falls short.<br /><br />Worth a read - simply because there aren't many other books out there that take this approach on this topic. Some people may find the information new but to those of us who have done our reading and are looking for a tool to better advocate our place in society, it does disappoint.troversion.<br /><br />I did enjoy what little there was of accounts of historical figures who were introverted.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a step in the right direction.

B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy the game but they have it set up to where you have to buy investment points if you want to get very far.
030788743X|2.0|I thought this book showed a lot of promise. I read the free sample and fell in love. I recommended it to everybody I knew and waited eagerly to read it myself. I didn't have the money to buy it so I waited. When I was finally able to read the rest of the novel I was very excited. The first few chapters are so perfect but then...<br /><br />I just felt like it was lacking in the complexity that it deserves. Things become too linear and predictable. There is a strong absence of people of color, queer people and women in much of the book. The ending fixes some of that but not all of it. It seemed like too little too late, you know?<br /><br />The writing is funny and Ernest Cline makes very interesting choices. The references and history are fun to follow but the actual emotional core of the story just kind of collapses after chapter five.<br /><br />Maybe I got my hopes up too high after loving the sample. Maybe I spent too much time away from it. I don't know. It just felt like much of the book could have been stronger.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I read so many books and see so many TV shows and movies, that I can almost always figure out \\"who done it\\" in the first five minutes or the first 50 pages. That was not true with Gone Girl. It is the best written and best plotted book Ive read in a long time. Gillian Flynn has an amazing ability to get inside her characters minds and describe in great descriptive detail what they are thinking and feeling. I told a friend \\"I have never written a book, but if I had, I would want it to be as good as this one\\". I have given Kindle editions and hard cover copies to five of my friends. Some were male, some were female and their ages varied greatly. All of them without exception raved about Gone Girl. Honestly, do yourself a favor and buy this book. I think you will soon be buying more copies as gifts. I am deliberately not saying anything about the plot because to do so would deter from your enjoyment.
1594484805|3.0|Drive  by  Daniel Pink<br />The author discusses briefly some of the chief ideas of what motivates different groups and individuals.  What is new in challenges and how should we respond?  When does the carrot and stick work?  The discussion moves to autonomy, purpose and mastery and how they apply to motivating ourselves and others.<br /><br />The last section is a toolkit for different groups to try.  The result is a fair survey of  the area and suggestions for books and links to more information on topics.  You'll need to use these sources to seriously tackle changes.  The work of Mihaly Csikszentmihali and his idea of flow are covered well. What conditions increase flow and how can we increase it?  Am I better today than I was yesterday?<br /><br />This is a useful intro, but you'll need a lot more reading  for it to be useful.

Chess,Atlantic,esp.Motown,and the LA studio scene in the mid-Sixties to the early Seventies, Gamble and Huff churned out hit after hit with a musical organization without peer. If you ever liked any of the many hits by the many fine vocal groups that came out from Gamble/Huff you owe it to yourself and your grandkids to get this set. It's the best sounding and programed of any compilation that's ever been available. This is Smithsonian worthy---no lie.

Albert Finney is wonderful as Daddy Warbucks, Carol Burnett is absolutely hysterical as Miss Hannigan, and Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters make a great couple of cons.  The movie sticks to the classic comic strip story line and shows us what growing up in a NY orphanage during prohibition could have been like. The music is great and you will find yourself humming one or two of the tunes when the movie is over.  I absolutely recommend it!

B008JAGG38|5.0|This is a Perfect movie!  Could of done no better for an ending of a good era/series.  Funny and not that Stupid-funny. FUNNY.  Got all the old crew back with nice cameos here and there. MUST-SEE!
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I saw the film first and then I was persuaded to read the book.  I knew the story as everyone I knew at work had read the books and so I decided to give them a go.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked the clear writing style and I that it was told through the eyes of Katniss.  This gave the effect of making her slightly unreliable in that she does not see how other characters see her and finds reading people difficult, which makes her all the more interesting.<br /><br />This had a great pace to it and I read it in nearly one go.  I had to keep turning the pages to find out what happened, even though I already knew!  This is the sign of a good storyteller and if I downloaded the whole trilogy as a result, then Suzanne Collins has done her job well.  The only thing I would have liked were more details as to how Panem happened to be a post-apocalypse world.  I don't know if this will be revealed later in the trilogy but that would have been nice to read about in the first novel.  Nonetheless, I'll be reading the sequels.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book hurt me and made me angry, but I couldn't stop reading it. Martin is a brilliant writer. I can't wait to see what unfolds in the future.
1455508977|2.0|I love Nicholas Sparks' books but this one was not my favorite.  I had never seen the movie and decided to start with the book.  It was really predictable.  He did a good job setting up the characters but I knew what was going to happen at the end without having to read to the last page.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's easy to prevent your kindle from being used for in-app purchases.<br />You're 5 year old can show you how.
B008XG1X18|5.0|when pinterest first came out, I got the beta and then lost interest, too clunky. this, however is fun and easy to use.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As is usual with many young adult books, it is really worth your time, and you don't have to be a young adult anymore to enjoy it!  Well-written and compelling.  I didn't read it for a long time partly because sometimes all the hype isn't really true.  It's true this time.  A great read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game.  Helps pass time when I have ti wait for doc appointments.  Hubby loves it too.  Easier to take our tablets.
B001FW58D6|5.0|After 1 show I was hooked.  The way Abrams builds his characters is amazing especially Walter.  It's entertaining and challenges your mind with the intricate plots and clues.  You find yourself really connecting with the characters and rooting for Walter, Peter, and Olivia.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love how it lets you know that you will need to charge in this amount of time if you're doing this, but you have that much time if you're doing that.  Very useful!  Much more helpful than just telling me your battery level is here.  Great app!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I can't wait for part 2. Not as good as the original alien & aliens, but left me thinking about the possibilities.
0061914177|1.0|The ideas are solid but the execution is weak. It's the kind of thing you'd see in a magazine article, not in a full price hardcover book. It's more like an outline than a fully fleshed out and thought-out, well-written book. Yet the subject matter is relevant and certainly of wide interest. That's why it was a disappointment. I really wanted something more solid from this.
B007L96VCY|5.0|Remastered version sparkles when played on 21st century gear.  Details of the fine recording are revealed, making the experience even more enjoyable.  You probably already know all about Ram, if you liked the album before you will like it even more remastered.  If you are not familiar with this work, buy it and prepare to be surprised.  Ram does not sound dated in the least, even after 40 years.
0385344228|5.0|The end of this book had me saying wow! Very suspenseful! It sort of ended the way I imagined but still solid ending. Strong on the storytelling and the intelligence, I'd recommend this taught family drama surrounding 14yr olds and murder. Landay knows his stuff around the legal system. He really knows 14 year-olds! In fact, all his characters jump off the page vividly and dramatically. The imprisoned grandfather was a gem of a character, wow!<br /><br />It has flaws, a couple of story things were a little too convenient, a little too long-winded in places...(but smartly economical in others). The father's strange enabling had me scratching my head a lot. All in all highly recommended, I'm happy to find another brilliant author.<br /><br />Would make a great movie - Alec Baldwin is Andy Barber.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read all three of the books and they were incredible! I couldn't wait for the movie to come out. I was afraid to watch it however because in MOST cases the movie is an awful representation of the book, but this was not the case for the Hunger Games. They did a wonderful job; they kept in everything that was important, they didn't really take anything out, and the actors portrayed the characters perfectly. I can't wait for Catching Fire!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use and pretty straight forward.  I like the large and simple display. It is fun to use and recommend it. I mainly use it for budgeting and basic calculations.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this, finding it original, refreshing, insightful and a non-stop thrill ride, with themes that ran deeper than who would die and who wouldn't. Which is why I was disappointed in the sequels as I don't feel they lived up to the promise that excited me in The Hunger Games.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|Remastered McCartney reveals an amazing solo effort by Sir Paul.  All parts are by McCartney with a little vocal help by wife Linda. The details of the tracks are crystal clear, especially the percussion bits.  The odd tracks, especially on the bonus tracks, may have not been commercial at the time or at any time, but are charming and sometimes very funny.  My favorite tracks are timeless, though over 40 years old, and are presented perfectly through remastering.  Sir Paul worked on remastering the Beatles library, then began to tackle his favorite solo and Wings recordings with a high quality result.  If you wore out your original McCartney, replace it with a remastered version.
B008KWHM6U|4.0|Beacon is a great album.  The first seven songs on the album are show-stoppers and grab the listener with immediate and enjoyable hooks.  The last four songs on the album are very good yet different.  One can almost see the band shifting its formula and maybe this is due to the band growing up a little.  Although, the Northern Ireland trio deliver in its sophomore album.  They show that great sing along hooks, snyth-guitar dance beats, and a band who knows themselves well works.  Beacon has great replay-ability and is showing that TDCC is going to be around for a while (and may have the U.S. charts in its sights).The reason it may receive less than favorable reviews is because it is being compared to its predecessor, \\"Tourist History.\\"  One of the best releases in 2012 so far.
B00785P2QC|4.0|lots of fun but a little hard to understand what to do. not sure how to get invest points either. friends had trouble trying to play with me._
B008ZTW7OU|4.0|My favorite album from The Sheepdogs remains \\"Learn & Burn\\", but their latest self-titled album is still a great addition to their discography. This was an \\"automatic buy\\" for me, and it doesn't disappoint.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I am halfway through the second book, and it is stuck at page 674.  Customer rep says publisher needs to fix. In a book this long it's a real problem!
0385742886|5.0|Very emotional, thrilling, and real. Great prequel. You feel for the characters as they go through the events during the Sun Flares and their lives after.
B007TMON8M|4.0|Another cool app that is even cooler that its free. Theres some really concepts to this game but, I'd rather play on another cool app i downloaded recently called Rage of Bahamut well worth your time and real addictive. If you enter the code pky09690 u get loads of in game money and a free rare card. Check it out. Just type in the code at the end of the tutorial.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The last book to the trilogy, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" feels like a completely different book from the other two. The book is fast-paced, heart-racing, and twist after twist, shock after shock. After all you experience with these books though, the ending is somewhat of a disappointment - leaving too many lose ends untied, like the author ran out of space and had to finish fast. You feel defeated, and craving for more, not satisfied - after all these books, the ending does not have enough satisfaction. I still love the books though, and would re-read them!
B004UXUUDA|4.0|Sarah's Key is not a bad film.  If you had never seen \\"[[ASIN:B00012QM8G Schindler's List]]\\" or read Anne Frank's \\"[[ASIN:0307594009 The Diary of a Young Girl]]\\" or been exposed to stories where \\"the events of the past are uncovered by someone in the present, affecting that person in the future\\" you might think Sarah's Key extraordinarily packed with pathos and humanity, along with a withering indictment against the Holocaust.  The always-wonderful Kristin Scott Thomas is featured as a modern day reporter who researches a story about Jews who were rounded up in Paris in the early part of the Nazi's control and extinction.  As good as Scott-Thomas is, her \\"story\\" is a small and comparatively unimportant one compared to the portions set 70 years ago.  Meryl Streep's recent \\"The Iron Lady\\" was all but ruined (in my opinion, as Streep won the Academy Award) by the flashback sequences between the later years Margaret Thatcher - who was senile and feeble - and the earlier, robust Dame Thatcher who rose from plain beginnings to be prime minister.)  So it is in \\"Sarah's Key\\" - sticking to the Holocaust story would have made a stronger, shorter, movie.  It is important, as Holocaust \\"deniers\\" unintentionally remind us, that we NOT forget the atrocities of history lest they be repeated - and to honor the victims.  There have even been superb post-Schindler's movies - from \\"[[ASIN:B0026IUXME The Pianist]]\\" to \\"[[ASIN:B002YCVX5S Inglourious Basterds]]\\".  Sarah's Key, like [[ASIN:B00628RVV0 The Boy in the Striped Pajamas]], slightly diminishes the narrative of the Holocaust by diluting it.  Still - not a bad film.
B003QSMC18|5.0|love this movie! for kids and adults alike this movie is another Disney success. I have seen it a few times slsn sosj
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Have yet to actually watch the DVD - but enjoyed the movie in the theater which is why I bought it. My son did not see it theatrically - so I await a nice moment when we can watch together and I can relive the thrills while my son lives it for the first time. Downey and the rest of the cast have an easy chemistry together and Mr. Harris is properly impressive as Dr. Moriarty. this one is a lot of fun.

B00005T7I1|4.0|I recently bought a big thick book of 4-star movie reviews by Roger Ebert and bought this movie based on his description and recommendation. It helps in watching the movie to understand a couple of things about it, such as the fact that it only uses the colors used in the original Dick Tracy comic strip. (I believe it was 7 colors.) Also, according to Mr. Ebert, there are computer generated elements in every scene of the movie--or put another way, it is a completely computer generated make-believe world. I enjoyed the acting and the originality used in the creation of the movie. I would recommend it

B001IF252C|5.0|Firmware 1.03 is all you need to know.  The problems are all gone and as of now, this is what you will get from the Apple Store, not sure how back the Amazon stock goes.  In this particular issue, make sure you get firmware 1.03, if you need, go through the Apple Store, save yourself the grief and get it there on this one, unless you know the version.<br />Nice that they also added a USB port, to reclaim what you lost with the power also using USB.  Great idea, Apple.  Apple Store guy was happy to check the firmware in the back room.  As of September 2012 that is what they have!<br />I really hate that they progress everything every 5 years or sooner, but this work around really works.  Do not get brand X, this works as I have reported.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I just downloaded thisvgame and can't stop playing!  Help I may nwver be seen again if I don't. run out of levels!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|In hindsight, I'm not sure what I expected when I ordered this book.  I had just read a review in the magazine the author had been a critic for.  Great review for a thriller with twists and turns.  Well, that much is true and the book is well written.  In fact, it's very wordy.  However, I'm one of those people who likes to care for at least one of the characters.  The more I read, the more I hated both the husband and the wife.  Each chapter was written from either the point of view of the husband or the wife and the chapters would jump from present to the past and back.  Eventually I began to jump around to chapters in the book.  Something I never do. Would I recommend this book.  Maybe but not likely.  It left me with a sour feeling when I finished it.  I would probably avoid future books from Ms Flynn.  I recently learned this book will be made into a movie...one, rest assured, I will not see.
B00005JKDR|5.0|We were so excited to receive Monsters Inc for our child. We had lost our movie while on a trip and never found it. She was so excited the day we received our new Monsters Inc!! We watched it immediately!!<br />Thanks so much !
0525953728|4.0|I purchased this book after I heard about it on the news. Originally I was totally against the fact of our greatest warriors giving up operational secrets because it sets a precedent for future operators. Personally thought the book was a good read which went through a few other missions but mostly focused on the Bin Laden raid. I don't think this soldier released n e info I haven't read in other seal books but certain things need to be kept quiet.
B0069UP2PI|1.0|The premise of this movie was fairly straightforward. A virulent virus, much like the Spanish flu of 1918 that killed somewhere between 40 and 80 million people, is spreading rapidly, endangering the life of Kate Winslet and all of humanity. Normally, I would hunker down with a bowl of popcorn and a quart of ginger ale to watch a movie like this. But I found myself getting very bored after only a few minutes.<br /><br />The first problem with this movie is that it was horribly written. There are whole sections in which the characters say nothing, but just move their mouths to the accompaniment of tense music. Those were the good parts. The actual dialogue was so devoid of emotion that silence was preferable. And the characters were so bland and undeveloped that it was impossible to care whether they lived or died.<br /><br />The second major problem was the premise. Supposedly, an infected bat bites a banana which a pig in Hong Kong then eats, and when the pig is slaughtered, the cook who prepares it for consumption doesn't wash his hands, and then shakes hands with Gwyneth Paltrow, who touches her face and then gets sick and dies. What kind of virus is this? It can be transmitted via saliva like a herpesvirus, survive going through a pig's GI tract like an enterovirus, end up in the blood somehow like blood-borne encephalitis-causing viruses, then get transmitted again via an object (hands), and then enter the body through the mucous membranes (mouth and/or nose), somehow end up in the lungs, and then migrate to the nervous system. It was as if the writers wanted to have it all - a virus which could be transmitted equally by saliva, feces, and blood, and which could survive both interferon-containing saliva and the depredations of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, as well as live outside the host on various objects - and which can kill you in a few days.<br /><br />If, in fact, a virulent neurotropic virus could be transmitted in this casual a manner we would all be dead. (Spanish flu, by the way, only killed people who had previously caught a different flu. When the two viruses combined in their hosts they formed a fatal new virus.) We are surrounded by viruses - of all types - and the reason they haven't killed us all is because viruses mutate rather quickly into less lethal forms so as not to destroy their hosts. We may not need them, but they need us. What neither of us need is this movie.e dead. (Spanish flu, by the way, only killed people who had previously caught a different flu.

B008MEM24S|4.0|love this game....this one is just as addictive as where's my water!! has my talking like the crazy scientist all day!
B008602KQI|5.0|best experience next to IMAX. this movie is immersive and is fairly true to the book.  One of the great stories of the decade.
B0000041DF|5.0|This performance of the Rach 3 may be my favorite. Argerich plays with incredible speed but a lightness and sprightliness of touch that is astonishing. Compared to her performance, Horowitz (whose performances of the Rach 3 I love) appears overbearing and plodding at times, with uneven technique. Argerich on the other hand displays remarkable evenness in her playing.<br /><br />In terms of her performance, the Rach 3 is stronger than the Tschaikovsky No 1 on this disc; in terms of the orchestra, I find it the opposite. I'm not 100% thrilled with her performance of the Tschaikovsky, except for the final movement, which she begins with intensity that literally stunned me, and which she carries through to the end. I would get this disc first and foremost for the Rachmaninov -- many consider this the best recording of that piano concerto available. It is a remarkable performance.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|My daughter loved this movie! Getting it in 3D is even better.This set has both versions (3D & regular))and a set of 3D glasses.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible application. It has audio Bibles and devotionals that are very nice. It helps make my faith in God stronger. I love it.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|--note before I start the review--<br /><br />The games themselves are on the disc, but they have to be installed onto the PS3 in order to play them. Be sure to have around 2GB of free space on the hard drive, if you want to install them all. The soundtracks are also on the disc, but they have to be exported onto the hard drive. From there you can download them onto a flash drive, (or, with one of the early PS3s, an SD card).<br /><br />--Review for Journey: Collector's Edition--<br /><br />I'll do a review for each game first, then I'll finish with a review of the Collector's Edition bonus content.<br /><br />*Flow*<br /><br />This game has you start as a basic microscopic organism. Using the Dualshock 3 controllers Sixaxis technology, you will move around eating food and attacking other microscopic organisms, as you dive deeper down into this unknown cesspool.<br /><br />The Sixaxis motion controls can be a little disorienting at first, but after playing around with it for 5 minutes, they will become second nature. From there, the game flows (pun not intended) pretty smoothly. Using what the developers call \\"Dynamic Difficulty\\", you can adjust the difficulty of the game to your liking. There are these two special kinds of food, \\"Up food\\" and \\"Down food\\", that takes you into shallower or deeper levels, receptively. The deeper you go, the more difficult the game becomes, but by eating the Up food, you can return to previous levels, beating enemies and eating more food to grow more segments (segments are basically units of health). This will make the deeper levels easier, but if you forego from eating food, you won't grow any segments, making the deeper levels harder, as enemies make short work of you. This is an interesting addition to gameplay, and makes for some good replay value.<br /><br />There are five campaigns, and the credits, to play through, each played by a different creature. Each creature has different abilities, which help keep the game fresh and interesting. The visuals still hold up pretty well today. They are colorful and vibrant. The soundtrack is amazing, and blends well with the game itself. As you eat certain food, the segments on your creatures body pulsates, adding a tune that is in accordance with the music that is playing. All in all, the game will take 1-2 hours to complete, with another hour or so if you're going for the trophies. It is a short, but fun experience, and is a great addition to this collection.<br /><br />*Flower*<br /><br />This is a truly unique one-of-a-kind experience you'll find only from Thatgamecompany. You start off in this bleak room with a flower pot. By using the sixaxis controls to move over the flower pot and holding a button, you will be whisked away to a lush green field. From there, by controlling a single petal with the wind, you must collect more petals from the flowers strewn across the landscape. Doing so will unlock more areas and cutscenes. The game is separated into six areas of which I won't spoil. It's better if you don't know them beforehand :)<br /><br />The sixaxis controls in this game are amazing. The game wouldn't be the same if it used the analog sticks instead.  The animation, the visuals, and the soundtrack are all great, and they work in unison to create such a unique and compelling experience. As you move over each flower, they make a sound in accordance to the background music. This makes the soundtrack that much more immersive. The animation and the visuals are still good to this day. They work well to bring this game to life.<br /><br />It is an emotional and relaxing experience from beginning to end. It is an artistic masterpiece come to life. It will change your view of what games are and what they can be. Ultimately, words don't do this game justice. You are going to have to experience it first hand to truly appreciate what it has to offer. If you are looking for something different, something that you likely haven't experienced in a game before, then this is for you.<br /><br />*Journey*<br /><br />You start off as a robed figure in the middle of a desert. You must go through this desert looking for clues on how a civilization of similar robed figures met their end, and to eventually reach the mountain that looms in the distance throughout the entire game. This is ultimately a \\"hero's journey\\" from the hero's \\"Birth\\" and through different parts of his/her life.<br /><br />The graphics in this game are great. Foregoing the more realistic style Flower had, Journey goes for a more impressionistic art style. This gives it a more fantasy, dream-like, feel. The graphics really work well to pull you into the game world, as if your experiencing this first hand. You will have fun sliding down desert dunes, flying high above the sand, and just exploring and finding secret areas in the game.<br /><br />This game wouldn't be complete without a compelling soundtrack, and, the game's composer, Austin Wintory delivers it in spades. It's dynamic when it needs to be, and more subdued when the game calls for it. It helps compliment each aspect of the game, and sets the mood for each part. It helps you become even further immersed into the game. It's nice to see this Collector's Edition come with a downloadable version of the soundtrack, because it's a great edition to anyone's music collection.<br /><br />This game is Thatgamecompanys first attempt on online multiplayer, and, in my opinion, one of the best online experiences I have ever had. Just don't expect the traditional experience online multiplayer, because, just like this game, it is entirely unique. As you travel across the game world, you might encounter other players without any indication that they have showed up. If you want, you could completely ignore them, moving along by yourself. If you choose to join them, you can let them know where you are with your call (hold down the circle button) or you can just walk up to them. You won't be able to see their PSN ID, and you can't chat with them through a typical in game chat. Their, and your, only identification is a unique symbol seen when one lets out a call. Instead of the typical chat systems most games employ, you communicate through your calls and your characters movements. This works surprisingly well, as they help you find secrets throughout the game, and vice versa, as you both work together to get through the game. Even though you can't communicate through words, you both form a bond that trancends language. Also, at the end of the game, you can see the PSN ID of each person you met, appearing right next to their unique symbols :)<br /><br />Just like Flower, Thatgamecompany continues their tradition of making games that flies in the face of traditional game design. You will be hard pressed to find a similar experience in another game, except maybe Flower. And just like Flower, it is an artistic masterpiece come to life. It's a game that makes you think even after the experience has ended. Just like the game is about a hero's life journey, it might make you contemplate about your own. Again, it's a game that words don't do it justice. If you are looking for something different, this is a game for you.<br /><br />*Journey: Collector's Edition Bonus content*<br /><br />From Developer's commentaries of the three games, to a 30 min documentary of Journey, a Flower Developer Diary, concept art and screenshots, three minigames and the game soundtracks, there is plenty here for the fans to enjoy. It is all accessible from the games menus.<br /><br />The menus themselves are pretty basic. Each menu looping video of the game in action, and the different options displayed on the right hand corner. Nothing special. The problem is that each videos controls are very minimal. You can pause, turn on/off subtitles, fast forward to another chapter, and exit out of the video playing. Also, there is no interface or menu within the videos themselves, so I had to guess which button does what, not to mention there is no telling how much time each video lasts or how much is remaining. Scrolling through the concept art is a bit annoying as well, but you can actually export the art to your Picture section on your PS3, making it much easier to manage. If only you can do the same thing with the videos :P It is a bit of an annoyance, but not big enough to ruin this package.<br /><br />Each Developer's commentary is a video of one of the Developers playing through the game, while the other developers talk about it. They give you a bit of insight into the development of each game and some of their own personal experiences with each game. It is interesting to hear their thoughts, and makes you appreciate the games even more. The commentaries lasts as long as an entire playthrough of each game, so they are basically about 1 hour to an hour and 30 mins. The Journey documentary explores the development behind the game. You will see early designs of the game and it's main character. You will hear how the soundtrack came together. They also explain a little about the story of the game, among other things. It gives you a greater appreciation of the game, and for the developers who made it.<br /><br />The concept art and screenshots are great, with hundreds of images to look through. The soundtracks are amazing. There is likely some tracks you will be listening to over and over again. Once they are exported to your PS3, you can put them on a flash drive and download them to your mp3 player, CDs, etc. so you can listen to them while on the go.<br /><br />The three minigames are games from Thatgamecompany's 24 hour game jams. They basically give their employees 24 hours to create a game from scratch. Because of the very short development time, the games are a bit rough around the edges, and aren't that deep. You will likely play through them a couple of times and then forget about them. They are nice little time wasters, but not incentives to buy this game.<br /><br />The game also comes with some nice avatars and themes. The themes are on the disc but the avatars are codes you have to use with the PSN. There is around 20 avatars from Journey and Flower, along with 3 themes, 2 from Journey and 1 from flower. There is also a code for 1 free month of PS+. I have used the service, and have found it to be a great deal with plenty of freebies and discounts, among other extras. Try it out and see if you like it or not.D, and you can't chat with them through a typical in game chat. Their, and your, only identification is a unique symbol seen when one lets out a call. Instead of the typical chat systems most games employ, you communicate through your calls and your characters movements. This works surprisingly well, as they help you find secrets throughout the game, and vice versa, as you both work together to get through the game. Even though you can't communicate through words, you both form a bond that trancends language.

If you are looking for something different, this is a game for you.<br /><br />*Journey: Collector's Edition Bonus content*<br /><br />From Developer's commentaries of the three games, to a 30 min documentary of Journey, a Flower Developer Diary, concept art and screenshots, three minigames and the game soundtracks, there is plenty here for the fans to enjoy. It is all accessible from the games menus.<br /><br />The menus themselves are pretty basic. Each menu looping video of the game in action, and the different options displayed on the right hand corner. Nothing special. The problem is that each videos controls are very minimal. You can pause, turn on/off subtitles, fast forward to another chapter, and exit out of the video playing. Also, there is no interface or menu within the videos themselves, so I had to guess which button does what, not to mention there is no telling how much time each video lasts or how much is remaining. Scrolling through the concept art is a bit annoying as well, but you can actually export the art to your Picture section on your PS3, making it much easier to manage. If only you can do the same thing with the videos :P It is a bit of an annoyance, but not big enough to ruin this package.<br /><br />Each Developer's commentary is a video of one of the Developers playing through the game, while the other developers talk about it. They give you a bit of insight into the development of each game and some of their own personal experiences with each game. It is interesting to hear their thoughts, and makes you appreciate the games even more. The commentaries lasts as long as an entire playthrough of each game, so they are basically about 1 hour to an hour and 30 mins. The Journey documentary explores the development behind the game. You will see early designs of the game and it's main character. You will hear how the soundtrack came together. They also explain a little about the story of the game, among other things. It gives you a greater appreciation of the game, and for the developers who made it.<br /><br />The concept art and screenshots are great, with hundreds of images to look through. The soundtracks are amazing. There is likely some tracks you will be listening to over and over again. Once they are exported to your PS3, you can put them on a flash drive and download them to your mp3 player, CDs, etc. so you can listen to them while on the go.<br /><br />The three minigames are games from Thatgamecompany's 24 hour game jams. They basically give their employees 24 hours to create a game from scratch. Because of the very short development time, the games are a bit rough around the edges, and aren't that deep. You will likely play through them a couple of times and then forget about them. They are nice little time wasters, but not incentives to buy this game.<br /><br />The game also comes with some nice avatars and themes. The themes are on the disc but the avatars are codes you have to use with the PSN. There is around 20 avatars from Journey and Flower, along with 3 themes, 2 from Journey and 1 from flower. There is also a code for 1 free month of PS+. I have used the service, and have found it to be a great deal with plenty of freebies and discounts, among other extras. Try it out and see if you like it or not.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love this story, I previously watched this on masterpiece theatre then had to purchase the series. It comes with 2 discs and received it in the mail faster than I thought it would come which is always a plus! This film has beautiful bright colors makes you want to travel to England.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|[[ASIN:1612183956 Pines]]<br />If you like reading books by Stephen King you will enjoy this page turner right from the first page to the last page. I found Blake Crouch to be a great writer.
B00797MB0O|1.0|This movie sucked. I wish I had not paid money to watch. There are much better black comedies out there to watch! It was a big waste of time.
B008GX2YQQ|3.0|This record is basicaly a better recorded version of strawberry jam. Ben H Allens production moves past the herky jerky sounds that i would credit aveytar for. Allens production is able to bring out some interesting pop moments in a CD we've basicly heard before. Animal collective last CD and EP were far more  forcused events. my suspsion is that panda bear was a big influence on these recordings. Not a bad record, but to find this sound perfected i mite suggest you check out disco inferno's the five EP's CD. This is the perfect combo of the avantguard and genius pop. Hats off to Ben H allen who provides some pop relief in this mountain of found sound and noise. I can hardly wait for the next panda bear cd.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This movie is one of those straight up, shoot'em, slash'em, kick'em, stab'em, punch'em blood baths, oh and some compassion as well. Not going to go into the story detail, but it definitely has some intense fighting scenes and I was impressed with the dubbing into English. If you are a fight fan, a gun battle fan, and especially a martial arts fight fan, this movie has it all.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Mr. King has always been my favorite author and the subject of Pres. Kennedy's death has intrigued me since my childhood (I was 3 when it happened). I have wondered if Oswald did actually act alone.  I do not consider myself a conspiracy theroist, but I believe that certain individuals in our government could and would do something like this, then and now.  Enough about that.  This book was terrific from begining to end.  The idea of being able to right the wrongs of the past would be appealing to anyone (with a conscience) and the Kennedy assassination would be one I would also attempt.  All of the characters Jake (George), Sadie, Al, etc.. were well developed and very believable.  I enjoyed this book immensely and wholeheartedly recommend it to all.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love this show! I can't wait for season 3 to start. It is very raw and gritty and as real as zombies can be.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Turns and twists kept me reading until the end.  Good character development and an engaging plot contribute to make this a page turner.  I thoroughly enjoyed the read.
B008MEM24S|4.0|It could be more challlenging but still a fun game. The levels are nicely progressive. The graphic are just like the game.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|lots of fun, challenging game. takes time to figure out best strategy and not to use all your ribbons right away
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best bible app I've ever encountered. To be able to carry The Word everywhere is awesome! What's  even better is to be able to listen to it when your eyes have to be focused on something else.  I love it love it love it!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The fact that this app has the option thst you can pick a winning hand to be dealt is a plus.  It is ni e to be able to choose to win!  The best part of this app is that it is free!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie.  Definitely did the book justice without taking too much content out from the book.  Very satisfied to see a movie adaptation that satisfied me almost as much as the text original.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|Redshirts made me laugh out loud.  There aren't many authors that have been able to accomplish that.  Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett are the only ones that come to mind.  That's pretty good company to be in and would merit a higher rating if not for the few problems that add up for this book.<br /><br />Redshirts is the story of those ubiquitous security people who so often meet unfortunate ends in Star Trek and similar works.  The universe in which this story takes place is very obviously an homage to the original Star Trek and has a number of secondary characters that act as stand-ins for the iconic characters from that show.  This story is in part a love letter to classic television sci-fi.  That's the part of the story that works.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a large part of the story that doesn't work.  To describe that, I will need to use spoilers, so please skip the following paragraph if you do not wish to see those.<br /><br />Spoilers follow<br /><br />Before the halfway mark of the story, the characters begin to realize that they are a part of a television program.  This would be an interesting place to take the story were it not for the fact that through some truly trekkian science, the characters transport themselves to out world and begin to interact with the people who play them on the television show.  This, to me, is one plot twist too many.  This is the point where the book becomes less novel and more commentary on everything from science television to the difficulty of dealing with writer's block.  This is the point where I stopped having fun.<br /><br />End spoilers<br /><br />I think I can still recommend this book for fans of the author.  I greatly enjoyed [[ASIN:0765348276 Old Man's War]] and was having a great time throughout the first half of this novel.
B008N1V11U|2.0|This games very very glitchy!!!! I would give it five stars but right now it definitely not worth the seven dollars I spent!!!!!!! I am extremely disappointed with you gameloft!!!! Shame on you &gt;:-(
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I liked this so much, I installed it on my new galaxy s 3, as well.  I specifically like how it opens up whenever a charger is plugged into either device.  I, highly, recommend this battery app. I will put it on all my devices.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great interpretation of the book and the extras are very interesting even though some are overlong. Casting was very well done. Catniss, Gale, Prim, Caesar Flickerman, Cinna and blanking on the irritating woman's name and the other tributes are especially good. Did not think I would like Woody Harrelson as Haymitch but he did an excellent job. Costumes were brilliant as were the sets.
B008393Q2O|5.0|It meets my needs perfectly on my Kindle Fire. I like that it has a note option and a checklist option.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The case looks, and feels awesome. Definitely the best one out there for the Kindle Fire!! If you want to have something that is sleek and looks professional... this is the case for you.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is a super game. i can't stop playing it. please make more. it seems easy but it is very challenging to play.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Arrived on time and packed superbly. This was a gift for a child so I really cannot tell you about the product except that she loved the gift and watches it often! Must be good entertainment for young children.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|got this as a free app and I love it. been playing it for about a month and still like it. we broke down on a road trip and this was the perfect way to pass the time waiting for the tow truck and the moving place to fix the broken truck.
B0000266T2|5.0|i recently purchased a new car and found that it didn't come with a cassette player... and i cannot be without one of my favorite musical selections - s&g in central park - so i found a cd version of this historic concert on amazon.com.  GREAT!!! it was delivered quickly and is now nestled safely in my car waiting for the next long trip i take so i can listen to the entire cd without intermissions.  thank you to amazon and the seller for this treat.
1401322786|4.0|I devoured this book in an evening. There is a pleasant mix of reality, fantasy,love/heartache, and even the slightest touch of history thrown in.<br /><br />Anyone who has loved someone, missed someone, regretted a decision they have made, or felt the occasional pangs of loneliness will be able to relate to these characters. Every character has a deep sadness that surrounds their closest relationships. This sadness is what makes the characters rich and relatable.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars was because I thought it had a little bit of cheesyness at a couple of moments near the end. I don't mind this, it does not detract from my personal enjoyment of the book; however, I acknowledge it as a weakness that could have been avoided.<br /><br />Would recommend. Depending on your mood, have a couple of tissues near by just in case.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|This is a one of a kind moving about one of the greatest athletes who ever lived and the support behind him.  Anyone will enjoy this film
B004AQR24W|1.0|[[ASIN:B004AQR24W The Expendables]]WOW! Never thought a collection of 80s action stars will work in a mindless orgy of CGIs. So much unrealized potential. This could be an EPIC action movie apart from the lack of a credible plot or believable action sequence.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|I was sceptical, but the app does work and although I dont have much to print, it has printed everything I wanted to very nicely.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! There are some issues with timing out and having to 'force close' the app, but it does not keep me from using it! That does not happen often. Love being able to repin on my Kindle instead of 'liking' something and repinning it later when I boot up my laptop.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|I have never thougt I would enjoy an silent film as much as this one.  Sheer brilliance.  If you are a film buff you will love this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'll make this short and to the point.  I wasn't sure if I would like it and I didn't...I LOVED it!  I could hardly put it down, but at the same time made myself take breaks from it because I didn't want it to end!  I am currently half way done with the second book and already purchased the third!
B004G25V9S|5.0|I was one of the foolish few who didn't give this album a chance and dissmissed it after 2-3 listens. Being a fan of all their albums, I underestimated them when I heard something vastly different in Heritage. Only now after just a few more listens do I hear all the brilliance and beauty of this album! Because I initially told a few of my friends that this album wasn't up to par with their previous stuff, I feel the need to redeem myself with a 5 star rating. It deserves 10!! Thank you Opeth for another magnificent album, and Im' sorry! I'M SORRRY!!!! *violently weeps*
B0052AC8C6|5.0|What a fun movie!  Rango should appeal to several generations.  The youngest, under 12, will probably not catch all the innuendos that are rife in this movie!  I'm 70+ and I plan to watch it again!  Barbie[[ASIN:B0052AC8C6 Rango]]
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Downloaded this in mp3's. Amazon has a great service and price here. Being able to sample before you buy is great. This album is filled with good music for me.
B008602KQI|5.0|Both I and my family enjoyed the Hunger Games and can't wait for the next movie. We all loved the books and the movie followed very well.
B008602KQI|5.0|Fresh story with gripping tale of teenagers and children caught up in politics of a cruel dictatorship.  Uplifting because they beat the system.  Great performances and something teens and adults can both enjoy.
B005FISBV2|5.0|I was a little hesitant to buy the sixth season of Dexter because of issues with past seasons that would not play on my Blu-ray player. I decided to get this season anyway and I was not disappointed. The discs played just fine and I received them in a timely manner. Very happy to have them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will probably only echo everyone else, but this is one of the best books I have read in years! More character driven then plot driven in the beginning...which would not usually work for me.... but I just could not put this story down.  Truly excellent, and you will not regret your purchase!
B000FC146C|5.0|A truly moving series of love stories:the matriarch Mary Carson's infatuation with the young,handsome and ambitious Father Ralph, the Clearys - Fee and Patty strained but tender devotion to each other. Luke and Meggie's calculating relationship. the loner.Luke and Meggie.s daughter, Justine's, fear of committment and ultimately the surrender of Father Ralph's struggle to resist Meggie'overwhelming love. I have enjoyed the story several times over. It's a long saga but worth the read.

B000001EAQ|1.0|In the song, \\"The Fly,\\" from their 1991 release \\"Achtung Baby,\\" U2's Bono sang, \\"Every artist is a cannibal/every poet is a thief./All kill their inspiration/and sing about the grief.\\"<br /><br />Thanks for the warning.<br /><br />U2 are fond of making grand statements that fall short of their expectations, but this is ridiculous.  \\"Pop,\\" is not only uninspired and lifeless, it is probably the most deplorable album of the 1990's.  What's worse is that it was deliberate.  These are not compositions.  These are jumbled, disassociated words set to the same maniacal hum.  How is it possible that these tracks ever got selected for the album?  It must have been torture deciding which song would do the least amount of damage to their career.<br /><br />Produced almost exclusively by Flood, \\"Pop\\" is packaged with a glitzy obsession that the material never justifies.  The goal, it would seem, was to mix this recording into a muddled confusion so that we never actually hear just how awful it is.  I suppose the half-baked theme of this mess is that pop music can no longer survive under the weight of its own expectations.  But, so it seems, neither can U2.  It is really not at all surprising that they would record an album like \\"Pop.\\"  What is surprising, however, is that no one had the presence of mind to erase the master tapes after they finished.  The only semi-acceptable track, \\"The Playboy Mansion,\\" derives its rhythm from a sampling of The Turtles' classic, \\"You Showed Me.\\"  Unfortunately for U2 this exercise only proves that the Clark/McGuinn tune has such staying power that even U2 can't screw it up.  \\"Staring At The Sun\\" is a pleasant little ballad, but basically it is just a re-working of \\"Like A Song\\" from the \\"War\\" album.<br /><br />Ironically, U2 sound disconnected from the music as if they themselves have grown tired of the nonsense.  They are saying nothing new here and the results are painfully obvious.  Bono is even more directionless than usual.  His vocal styling is so flat and insipid that it makes me want to get my hearing checked.  Somewhere through the years he has developed a slow toneless lackluster approach that makes every song sound identical to each other.  This monotone renders him incapable of making us excited.  But this band never was comprised of trained musicians.  The Edge (why the hell is he still going by that nickname?) and Adam Clayton stopped playing their guitars three albums ago.  Perhaps they have run out of ways to manipulate the same five chords.  Lately they spew a noise equal to that of someone jumping up and down on their instruments while smashing saltines against a microphone.  Larry Mullen (he dropped the Jr. after \\"Rattle and Hum\\") was the only member of the group that had any obvious talent, but even he has slipped into relying on tape loops and kits to supplement his floundering imagination.<br /><br />The main problem with U2 is that they don't know when to shut up.  Not since The Rolling Stones has there been a rock band without enough common sense to stop recording.  Gone are the raw edge and power of their earlier works, like \\"War\\" and \\"The Unforgettable Fire.\\"  These albums had vision, originality and thought-provoking lyrics.  Admittedly, \\"October\\" may have been rushed and unfocused, but it had guts.  Even the over-slick production of \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" the album that launched U2 into the spotlight, was capable of yielding enough angst to defend its reputation.<br /><br />Most amazing are the uninspired, yet, overabundant photo collages by the usually inventive Anton Corbijn weighing down the lyric booklet.  One look and it becomes apparent that these faces have forgotten how to smile.  Sporting shaved heads and the occasional goatee, they look more like a pompous sulking street gang than rock and roll's reigning kings of anxiety.  Indeed, this is a band that takes itself way too seriously.  The grunge-thing just doesn't work for them because we all know it's an act.  They don'tlook intelligent; they look arrogant.  Personally, think the world could use one less sourpuss on an album cover.<br /><br />U2 have become victims of their own over-publicized reputation.  They have waxed themselves into a creative corner from which they haven't the slightest idea how to escape.  Their attitude is that they have a social axe to grind, but they traded in that axe years ago for the dull security of conformity.  They no longer confront their sociopolitical ideals with fervor.  Instead, they have chosen cynicism as their method of communication.  Basically, they are no longer a fun band to listen to.  They are moody, defensive and pretty much a bore.<br /><br />By the time the final track, \\"Wake Up Dead Man,\\" rolls around the conclusion is definite:  By creating a wall of sound to hide in, U2 have devised a self-serving image into which they themselves have been devoured.  It may be their own unique wall of sound, but it's still a wall.  And walls separate.  Perhaps, a more appropriate name for the song would have been \\"Wake Up Dead Group.\\"<br /><br />But probably the worst thing about \\"Pop\\" is the overall hypocrisy of its argument.  By using tape loops to sample other artists U2 have failed to take their own advice which they extolled so honestly in \\"God Part II,\\" from 1988's \\"Rattle and Hum\\" album, in which Bono lectures, \\"I don't believe in the 60's/in the golden age of pop/You glorify the past/when the future dries up.\\"<br /><br />Amen, to that, brother.<br /><br />U2 is clearly a band that has outlived its usefulness.  They have lost their ambition, their imagination and their drive.  To paraphrase John Cage, a pioneer of the avant-garde, they have nothing interesting to say with this album and they are saying it.  The music industry would be far better off if they would just face reality, and break up.
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|This movie was probably one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. Although if you are emotional you might have a hard time getting through some of the sad scenes in this movie, but for me i LOVED it!

True R&B
B003K16P3M|5.0|I found this book to be a wonderful fantasy read, keeping me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. If you liked \\"The Princess Bride\\", you'll love this book. It wasn't quite as simplistic and may not end up quite as cut and dried as some would like. However, I loved Katsa and Prince Po, who are characters who fight for what's good and true. I was pleasantly surprised; I only wish \\"Bitterblue\\" had been half as good.

B008Y2IU12|3.0|Charlize Theron was awesome as the evil queen.  Gave me chills each time she was in a scene.  You could almost feel the evil oozing out of her.  Still, her character could have been better with 2 things.<br />Chris Hemsworth as the drunken, washed-up huntsman was also believable.  Still we could have had a bit more back-story to show us about losing his wife and why he turned drunken and washed-up.<br />Kristen Stewart...enough said about her already and I agree with all the negative reviews of her performance.<br />The 3 things needed to improve this film?<br />1. Get a better actress to play Snow White.  You know, someone who can actually act instead of someone who looks like a constipated person trying to have a bowel movement.  Someone who can deliver a rallying speech that is actually coherent and makes you feel motivated.  No, I'm not a Kristen Stewart hater.  In fact, I've seen her in a couple of movies where she was very good.  Of course, that was before she became a \\"star\\" and was when she was playing a supporting role.  She was a very good actress in those movies.<br />2. Get better writers.  Again, the rallying speech.  I had to back up and listen to it again.  Yep, it's still random words strung together that make little or no sense.  And the evil queen could have been so much better if she'd had REAL dialog to work with.  Heck, every character could have been epic with proper dialog and a less strung-out story.  The story scattered after Snow White escapes.  Who are the scarred women?  How did they manage to build their village and survive?  Who knows, because the writers obviously didn't think we would need to know mundane things like that.  And what was up with the troll scene?  Where exactly does this fit into the story?  Because it certainly didn't go anywhere or add to the movie in any way.<br />3. Get a better director.  And once again with the rallying speech.  Can someone honestly say the director saw that scene and said, \\"Yes, that's what I want!\\"  Because if he actually thought that was great acting, he needs to get a new job.  Maybe as a dog-walker.  I normally don't pay attention to directing.  Then again, I've never seen anything this badly directed before.  There was no consistency in this movie.  One scene would be delivered with breath-taking beauty and spell-binding acting and the next would come up like a club and smack you in the head with it's wooden-ness.  As I said, if the director looked at his finished product and felt proud, he really needs to get another job.<br />All in all, I don't feel I wasted my money buying the movie.  The few good points are so spectacular they make up for the glaringly bad points.t!\\"  Because if he actually thought that was great acting, he needs to get a new job.  Maybe as a dog-walker.

B0069UP2PI|3.0|An American woman returns from a business trip in Honk Kong feeling sick and within a few days she has a seizure and eventually dies at the hospital. In Honk Kong, London and other parts of the world other people are dying from the same unknown illness. The Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization begin studying the disease as more and more people become infected while others, like the original woman's husband, are immune. The disease is eventually discovered to have originated in Hong Kong and has characteristics of both a bat and a pig. Armed with this information doctors try to create a treatment while outside, society is breaking down. Food is scarce, crime is rampant and the flames of discontent are being fanned by a disingenuous internet blogger claiming there is a cure that the American government is keeping secret.<br /><br />Contagion is a well made movie with excellent performances by all involved. It does a credible job of showing how easily a disease like this can spread and how vulnerable we all are. It is also scary how quickly society can decay in the face of an emergency no one clearly understands. Lies and rumors spread almost faster than the disease. People will believe almost anything in order to keep hope alive. The characters were very realistic, with both noble and ignoble tendencies whether they were in power or part of the citizenry.<br /><br />My only quibble is whether this movie was necessary. Other movies about this same basic scenario have come before Contagion, so did we really need another one, no matter how well made?
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|What an awesome game !! At first, I wasn't thinking this game would keep my attention, but It got easier to control, and was/is, so fun!  The different goals keep you wanting to play.I was so addicted to this game, that I finished it in one day!  I'm looking forward to starting over again...I would love to see some new quests, in an update? This is a great game,I recommend it highly! IT EARNS THE FIVE STARS I'M GIVING!! ;-) works great on my Toshiba Thrive.Love it so much, I put it on my Samsung Prevail as well!!!
B005LAIGPA|3.0|The hand-held camera craze needs to stop, now.  I've yet to see anyone use it in a fashion that made sense and this movie is no exception.  As more than one character rightly observed, \\"it's weird,\\" and \\"it's creepy.\\"  They also could have added that it isn't natural, logical, or possible to run around with a camera welded to your face.  Even worse, once they've taken the time and the trouble to set up a single viewpoint, supposedly linked to one camera, they then introduce multiple cameras not linked to the one source.  It's as though they figured out too late that they needed many vantage points in order to tell their story.  This brings up the question, why even bother introducing a camera?  It certainly didn't require such an obvious gimmick, especially considering the banality of their so-called chronicle.  Take away the superpower aspect and what you have is a run of the mill After School Special about the evils of bullying.  It also didn't help that the dynamic between the three lead characters was rather an obvious clich&eacute;.  This gave them absolutely nowhere to go but towards the predictable outcome.  This was little more than a revenge fantasy taken to the extreme.<br /><br />I will say I didn't absolutely hate it, I wasn't bored or anything, just disappointed by the lack of ingenuity involved.  They could have done much more with the premise than rely on the usual formula for this type of movie.<br />It's nothing I'd ever watch again.

I love this device.
1416550550|5.0|Rather than write a summary of what the book is about - which has been done ad nauseum - I will make my review short and sweet.  I was gripped by the very first page and simply could not put this book down.  I love sagas - and this was a doozy - jumping back and forth from the past to the near past to the present.  I was able to relate to all the female protagonists and followed their individual stories with avid interest.<br /><br />Ms. Morton is a true storyteller who was able to wrap it all up in with a very nice bow on top!  My only tiny critique would be  unedited grammar in parts where punctuation was iffy -- but I didn't really care too much about that as I became completely involved in Nan's saga.<br /><br />I am now starting The Distant Hours and look forward to reading all of Ms. Morton's books.<br /><br />Valerie Byron, author of NO ORDINARY WOMAN

0374275637|1.0|There are 2 interwoven components to this book. The first component consists of a series of studies that are described. These studies demonstrate various logical inconsistencies in the way humans make judgements and experience happiness. I have no doubt that these studies were performed competently and that Kahneman reports their results accurately. The second component is a series of conclusions Kahneman draws about what the results of these studies mean for society and for public policy. I believe these conclusions are biased, subject, themselves, to the same fallacious thinking that Kahneman describes, and ultimately are dangerous for society.<br /><br />Kahneman repeatedly takes sides in the studies he reports on, asserting without proof that he can discern the 'correct' (unbiased?, morally superior?, happiness maximizing?) choice even when respondents cannot. He simply never doubts his ability to know the right side of any issue. The most chilling statement in the book (to me) occurs towards the end (I have been listening to the audio version and cannot give a page number). \\"The objective of Policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.\\" (U index is a measure of peoples experienced utility/happiness that Kahneman favors). To some extent given the context, he seems to not want to 'own' the statement, by making it appear that he is writing in quotes, pretending to give voice to one side of an issue, while maintaining neutrality. However, the statement is close enough to the spirit of the rest of the book (and certainly no libertarian side is mentioned) to be treated as an expression of his own beliefs. Given that, the fact is, there are a series of flaws with this thinking:<br /><br />1) Is happiness maximization what people really want in life?<br />2) Is statistical maximization of happiness in the population really a valid approach to the problems of human existence? -- after all, none of the studies that Kahneman reports showed 100% agreement among the sampled populations -- not everyone's thinking was flawed. And not everyone wanted the same things.<br />3) Is human happiness or utility really additive? Can a societal view be taken with its implications of sacrificing the one for the many?<br />4) Do these studies capture the evolving nature of human societies and consciousness? -- after all in the 19th century Freud wrote extensively about female 'hysteria' -- a condition that seems to have vanished 80 years ago. Once the general population has digested Kahneman's ideas, won't people's consciousness and ideas on living evolve to compensate for these biases?<br />5) Is it ethically permissible for a 'benevolent dictatorship', possessing the ability to manipulate people's lives, to do so in order to maximize statistical societal happiness? What about the rights of individuals to make their own, albeit flawed, choices? (Imagine a society that thoughtlessly applied the letter of Kahneman's law, perhaps murdering depressives in their sleep (painlessly and without warning mind you) to increase the average level of social happiness, or perhaps murdering all billionaires and redistributing their money under the notion that the increase in the recipient's happiness would offset the negative happiness generated by the murders).<br /><br />While the above examples may seem extreme the ethical messages they carry are not. The fact is, many times in the past false messiahs have approached society with ways to 'improve it' and to force people to be happier or otherwise lead better lives. History is replete with examples of the wars, suffering, and human misery that occur when human freedom is devalued and replaced with a system, however well intentioned, to make people's lives better according to some objective measure. The use of data mining/statistics in this historical progression does not change the fact that unintended consequences of government action invariably destroy the benefits and magnify the costs of such actions.<br /><br />I recommend that you read the book, but do not be taken in by it.

0345803485|1.0|After seeing this book and its sequels consistently on bestseller lists , I downloaded a sample just to make certain  that I was not missing some great form of contemporary literature. I need not have worried, and I have a new love of the \\"download sample\\" button in my nightly prayers. This book is less than nothing.   I cannot begin to comprehend the reading public's love of this banal crap. I worry for the future of literature if this is truly the  kind of codswallop that American readers crave.    On a brighter note, after finishing the sample provided me, I browsed the reviews posted about this book. I spent a half  hour reading them, during which I found myself convulsing with laughter. The book that I would like to read is a collection of  the one-star reviews devoted to this horrible tome. They are very very funny, and much more entertaining than the  book itself.    Were I to be stranded on a desert island, I would prefer a collection of Harlequin romances or even Danielle Steele novels to this  pile of steaming bear scat. E.L.James, PLEEEEEZE stop writing. You've made your millions; no need to be greedy.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all three books. At first I was not sure that it was my type of reading, but as the story unfolded I became hooked and finished the trilogy in record time.  Now that I  have finished the trilogy I know that it will be a while before I experience again such a good read.

1603427244|5.0|Five stars for the terrific thumbnail pictures and organization by 'behavior.' I love how this little book facilitates comparisons between cast-ons that serve similar functions (i.e. stretchy, colored, etc). As a relatively new knitter without the experience to have a feel for these characteristics, I find these groupings useful. The multi-strand cast-ons are particularly inspiring. I've yet to do much color work, but think everything is going to have at least a (possibly hidden, or possibly not) band of color where the work begins. So far, the instructions have been clear and correct. The pages are heavy coated stock and seem likely to keep their form even after many, many turns, and the big spiral binding allows the volume to lie flat.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"I Am Legend\\" starring Will Smith. I got it at Wal-Mart off the five-dollar rack. First of all, I was unaware of the movie or the book on which it was based. Second, my feelings for the movie are extremely mixed. First, my reaction to the discovery of a cancer cure which morphs into a rabies-like virus and wipes out the Manhattan population is skeptical, to say the least. Well, I know this is unadulterated fiction, so I'll try to give it some slack. But secondly, the depiction of Manhattan as a devastated city is exceptionally good and I'm left wondering how in the world did they ever do it? The streets are cluttered with cars as if everything was just abandoned after the sounding of an alarm. After three years, all the streets are overgrown with mature-sized weeds growing from cracks in the pavement wherever Smith might go, and he covers a lot of territory. The city looks completely abandoned and in bad decay. Well Done! Whoever put this together ought to get an award of some type. And, alas, from this as a start, I would expect a really good movie to follow.<br /><br />Well, this well-crafted scene just doesn't hold up. Smith has an office-laboratory where he labors to save the world and it is fully electrified. Full lighted. All the machines work. It even has a working TV. And the computer works, including the internet. And his car works fine as he motors about the city, never getting low on gas, although he's been there three years. And he sends a broadcast out over the airwaves of the city ever day trying to find out if anyone else might be there. Huh? How could this be? It just doesn't wash. All of a sudden I find myself involved in a story I couldn't possibly believe. At about this point, there's the appearance of human-like monsters and monster dogs which are infected with a rabies-like virus and are insanely violent and after his hide. I'm sorry folks, the story just lost me totally and I just couldn't bear the last half.<br /><br />The movie had promise. Too bad the last half wasn't up to the first half. As it is, I'd have to congratulate some of the special effects people (the NYC scene) and let the others know what an awful job they did (the monsters). What an incongruent mix! Who's responsible for this mess anyway?. Well, I'd have to say that Smith's acting was fairly good. My condolences to him for being stuck in such a preposterous script.<br /><br />Gary Peterson<br /><br />The movie had promise. Too bad the last half wasn't up to the first half.

B0082Z447U|5.0|From the beginning of this novel to the very end, Wilkie Collins takes his readers on a ride full of all kinds of twists and turns, that will leave desperately flipping through the pages to find out what happens next. I thought the telling of the story through different character narratives was brilliant and was able to keep the reader interested and guessing. I found the plot well though out and developed, and the the story as a whole was simply brilliant. I'm not usually one for mystery/investigative novels, but I was  captivated from the get go. Just an overall great read. I would recommend it to anyone.

The movie is also lovely to watch from a visual standpoint. The live footage of Bob Marley performing is captivating, giving the viewer a chance to experience the power and talent that Marley used to get his message of peace and love for all people to his audience. HIs passing was all to soon but this film carries the torch and is the only film about Bob Marley that is authorized by his estate.

B007UPNA6Y|1.0|I like the Jack Reacher series (and upset about the Tom Cruise decision) enjoying them as a quick action read. I've read them all.<br /><br />This one was slow and never really kicked off.  Normally there a few hand to hand combat scenes exquisitely detailed.  I was 70% though the book thinking when is the action going to start?<br /><br />It seems about every third book he gets a bit of lady action. The midnight train in the last book I thought meant we might get that a bit more regularly. Nothing to see in this one.<br /><br />In the end the story seemed laboured, action was thin and unsatisfying and he didn't even get the/a girl.<br /><br />The Jack Reacher book I've enjoyed the least. Very disappointed.

B00005N56Y|5.0|There are many great performnces of Mozart's piano concertos. My favourite ones are Serkin/Abbado (1991), Casadesus/Szell (1961, 1964), Bilson/Gardiner ((1986) and first of all Curzon/Britten and Kertesz (1967). Believe me, Curzon's playing is excellent! What a depth, what a feeling, what a expression! On the other hand, English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Britten gives him perfect partnership, full of passion and power. Performance - 5, sound- 4,5.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I needed a small and cheap amplifier to boost the audio coming off a portable dvd player being used with a set of computer speakers.  It just wasn't loud enough to hear dialogue (we watch movies at work occasionally with loud machinery in the background) and this was the perfect solution.  It bumps up the volume just as we needed.  It's very small and lightweight, battery powered, easy to operate, and has a two-position bass boost switch.  Can't go wrong on the price either.  Perfect.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|Left it on the roof of my car, 65 miles per hour (ok ok 70 mph), fell off on the highway (luckily it bounced off to the side the road on the median and was not rolled over by other cars).  Need to replace the case because it did crack, BUT my $650 IPhone is still intact and working perfectly!  Which means the Lifeproof case gets a \\"job well done\\" by me!

B000A1GXTQ|2.0|I bought the video after seeing the on-stage play.  The play was hilarious.  The movie less so.  This was not vintage Hitchcock, nor was it the satiric farce the play was.  Some of the himor was there, but after the play, I was a bit disappointed.
0525953728|5.0|There was a point in his writing. He wasn't special, and he wasn't unique. He was just willing to put pen to paper and tell his story as best he could. Mark put inflection and opinion where appropriate. It was an eye opener, as I have my own opinions on the events of this book, and I was interested to hear his as well. His ethos is something EVERYONE could learn. Everyone should fear failure. It should be a motivator that drives us all to do something bigger than ourselves.<br /><br />Awesome book. Very quick read and doesn't add any fluff.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|You completely lose yourself in this book! I found myself in somewhat of a fantasy state, wishing I was Anastasia Steele!!! :)
B002SAS26E|4.0|This game is simple to play, but for such a simple game it has a fair amount of strategy within it.  Sometimes your strategy gets beat by dumb luck or chance, which can be annoying, but because each game is so quick it can easily be overlooked.  Each game lasts maybe 10-20 minutes.  Just give it a good shuffle before each game ;)<br /><br />I would check it out if you are looking for a quick and light 2 player game.  It is one of the best games in this category.<br /><br />I would give this 4 1/2 stars if Amazon allowed half scores.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|As a years long fan I thought 'Worth dying for' was one of the best, maybe even The best Reacher novel. But, it is downhill from there. The affair was readable, but definitely not up to standard with the other books in the series. And now 'A wanted man' is really the worst in the series. The first one I struggled to finish. Not worth the money !

B007TMON8M|5.0|Very fun game, runs smoothly, no glitches, great graphics, nice humor.<br /><br />As is normal with physics games, occasionally the same design doesn't always act the same the next run, but it usually it fine the run after that.<br /><br />My only complaint, it popped up saying I'd achieved a high score, #25 for that level for that day. I know, not a big deal, but when I submitted it, and then checked the leader boards, I wasn't there. #25 was someone with a slightly worse score, and #24-11 all had my score, so it's not like I got pushed off before I checked it. Maybe it takes time, but it gives the impression that high scores don't work.<br /><br />Fun game, anyway, high scores don't mean much :D

B000FC12SM|4.0|This book has been around for almost 20 years and I just read the thing. Had I picked up a copy for it's 10th anniversary, I might have been able to save my marriage. Like most men, I felt that self help books were for weak minded losers when in fact the only one who 'loses' is the person not reading this book. I see where I made so many mistakes in my relationships because I didn't understand why my woman would say something the way she did and why she then didn't like my response to her statement. I would suggest that everyone read this book before, during or even after (as I did) a relationship. I believe it will help almost everyone.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|I used the free version of this product and decided to spring for the upgrade so that I can record radio content.  I regularly travel out of range for radio and was relying on books on tape and music for entertainment.  Now I simply record a few hours of BBC Radio 4 (interesting talk radio out of the UK) for free on to my Kindle Fire and I am good to go.  I love it so much I bought it for my android phone so that I can listen at work where I don't have a wireless network to link into.  I have a smart phone and can connect without wireless but I can eat up my plan allowances pretty quickly that way.  I love the record function.  I would peruse books an tape and be run off by the high prices.  Now I have access to plenty of free, great content.

044655667X|3.0|While I am a devoted and enthusiastic fan of Connelly's Harry Bosch series, I am merely a fan of the Mickey Haller Lincoln Lawyer series. On the whole, it just lacks the same brooding intensity of the Bosch series - that sense that the world is not right and Harry Bosch is on the case to sort out at least one little part of it.<br /><br />Hot shot defense lawyer Mickey Haller has fallen on rough times in this recession and he is forced to take foreclosure defense cases to keep his practice healthy. Fortunately for Haller, the Los Angeles area has plenty of foreclosures and not all of them were done \\"by the book\\" so there is a way for a talented lawyer to earn a living.<br /><br />When one of Haller's foreclosure clients is accused of killing the bank officer who has been in charge of foreclosing on her home. She loudly insists that she is innocent and as Haller starts to mount a defense the evidence shows that there may well be larger issues at work here...<br /><br />I was torn with this book. The book just did not have the oomph factor that the first Haller book did. It sort of cruised along, sometimes with a little jolt to perk things up. There are a couple of nice twists at the end were a surprise, but not enough to make it more than a 3 star out of 5 stars book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Much better than twilight. I felt stupid after reading it after reading hunger games I felt more intelligent  it is deep and not to gorey
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so I got this game then at first I did not know how to play it then I did then I loved it!
B008602KQI|5.0|I've watched the movie a few times now, and every time, it still brings the same feelings.  For me, that is what sets a good movie apart from a bad one, a good movie will make the viewer feel emotions about the movie.  All the gut-wrenching feelings that occurs within the viewer while the Hunger Games is absolutely intentional. it is a very dark movie, not the greatest for kids, but worth it.  This is one of those movies with a high replay value, as in every time you watch it, it is still just as good as the first.  I also like the fact that it explains what the book doesn't, while it doesn't rely on the book either.  A must see, and a good purchase.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|Great game for when you just want to pass a few minutes, but addictive enough to play for an hour if you have the time. Ok, one more run.
0061922315|2.0|I was so excited when I read about this book on the SF Bestsellers list. I immediately went to the Mill Valley public library and grabbed a copy. It started out interesting because 1) I love stories about adopted children and 2) it takes place in SF. I love a great novel that references real places, Unfortunately though I was thoroughly disappointed. Oh my God, the writing style was so flickin' boring I wanted to cry. Reading this book was like watching paint dry. I will give it two stars instead of one because I was at least interested in what happened at the end... but then when I got there, I was irritated i wasted time attempting to even get there in the first place.<br /><br />Don't know why all the hype!
B00002616T|5.0|Belonging was the first album Keith Jarrett recorded with what was (sort of) ECM's house band - Jan Garbarek, Palle Danielsson, and Jon Christensen.  The three Scandinavians already had experience playing together (check out the classic Witchi Tai To, with Bobo Stenson on piano), while Keith Jarrett had been leading a wonderful group with Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian.<br /><br />This album sits somewhere between those two sound universes.  It was made just two months after Jarrett and his American group went into the studio to record Treasure Island, and six months before they created the great albums Backhand and Death and the Flower.  The material on Belonging has a lot of affinity with those three albums.  \\"Solstice\\", the intense free jazz ballad that closes the album (and reminds us of Garbarek's Albert Ayler roots), has more in common with \\"Vapallia\\" or \\"Rose Petals\\" than with sweeter musings like \\"Country\\", \\"My Song\\", or \\"Innocence\\".  And the faster tunes sound similar to those Keith was doing with the Americans around the same time.  (Compare \\"The Windup\\" to \\"Inflight\\".)  The Europeans covered the same terrain, roughly, as the Americans.<br /><br />Still, there are differences.  On the American group albums, Haden and Motian were stubborn iconoclasts that, in any context, would do things THEIR WAY.  Christensen and Danielsson had their own personalities, but at least at this juncture were willing to be more cooperative/compliant with Keith's vision.  And of course Garbarek had a very different, lighter tone than Redman.<br /><br />If I have to make a (terrible?) analogy, the American group was like a really hearty steak or robust porter, while the European unit was an extremely fresh salad or crisp pilsner.  Both prepared by the same chef or brewer, of course.  And both are delicious and nutritious parts of a musical diet.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this Bible more than my hardcover Bibles for devotions, reading, and at church. It is so easy to change translations to match what my pastor is using. Although I use my hardcover Bible for actual studying, I often find myself using this one to change translations to clarify sections I find more difficult to understand. And although I really enjoy NIV and THE MESSAGE just for reading, there is nothing better than reading Psalms in KJV since they stuck closest to the poetry style David used to write them. I feel lost without my You Version Bible. I have it on my Kindle, laptop and cellphone so I'm never without it!

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Originally published in 2008, Suzanne Collins' novel \\"The Hunger Games\\" became wildly popular as did its two sequels.  Luckily for movie goers, the film adaptation was not treated as a potboiler quickie and we are treated with a fantastical and well-made adventure rather than a loud, dumb and forgettable blockbuster. For those unfamiliar with the books, the story follows a place called Panem, which is a hellish empire in the future of what is now the U.S.A. where the patrician oligarchs in the wealthy city of Capitol live in fancy and lavish lifestyles and the masses in the twelve districts live in squalor. This dictatorship features an annual ritual of sacrifice in which twenty four tributes (teenagers volun-told by a lottery system) compete in a sadistic competition called The Hunger Games; a gladiator styled battle royale which is treated like the Olympics by the media and Capitol residents, despite its brutal nature. One year, a woman named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in the Appalachian and poorest district, District 12, finds herself shipped off to the Capitol to prepare for competition in the Hunger Games along with fellow denizen Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). They meet the eccentrically dressed escort Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and sympathetic stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). This trio helps them and the other tributes prepare for the mandatory pageantry and talk shows they must participate in before the Hunger Games begin. Once the tributes arrive at the arena and the competition begins, a bloodbath takes place at the starting place and the survivors run off for cover. Can Katniss survive the Hunger Games?<br /><br />This film is not a crisp and perfect adaption of the novel but I think it is faithful to the core and spirit of the story. Readers hoping to see the novel verbatim will be disappointed as the film cuts out a lot in the beginning including Haymitch's hangover at the Reaping and Katniss' relationships with other people in District 12 (her connections with her family and Gale are shown a bit). Katniss' and Peeta's drama to lure in sponsors is here, although some of it is abbreviated. To be frank, the film would be close to ten hours if everything were adapted, so this abridging is understandable. The great thing about this film is that it could be enjoyed by someone who has not read the novel; it is sharp and self-contained. The third-person rather than first-person POV allows viewers to see more of Panem and characters such as the antagonist, President Snow. Donald Sutherland is perfect as the Blofeld-like Snow and the extra scenes of him provide a few insights into the ideology and feelings of the Panem rulers as the competition continues. Characters like Cato, a buff and towering tribute from a district where youngsters are fed and bred to be fighters ala ancient Sparta, are given new and improved spins as he has some sympathetic moments.<br /><br />People compare The Hunger Games to the novel and film Battle Royale and, while they have some similarities, they are both examples of a long standing sub-genre dating back decades such as \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" and centuries including mythological examples like tributes sent to fight the Minotaur and historical examples of forced mercenaries and glorified bloodshed such as the days of bread and circuses (or  panem et circenses). Nothing against the novel, the film, Koushun Takami or the late-great filmmaker Kinji Fukasaku, but this is not a ripoff or plagiarism.<br /><br />The film is well shot with great sets and costumes with the best examples being the contrasting fancy and colorful Capitol with decadence and showmanship in everyone and everything and the destitute districts who wear shabby clothes one might find a century ago in slums. The violence is brutal at times but it is often tastefully limited with reaction shots and off-screen terrors. The special effects for the fantastic science fiction of Panem such as the train ride in or the elaborate pageantry are magnificent but the muttations leave something to be desired. The acting makes the film as Jennifer Lawrence combines toughness and pure beauty in her role of a heroine stuck in a political game of theater, battle and death. Katniss is strong, pragmatic and stoic but there are subtle hints in Lawrence's performance that allow you to follow her experience despite the lack of narration or first-person viewpoint. Her character's country survivalist life harks back to her unforgettable performance in Winter's Bone. Harrelson's stumbling but frank Haymitch is a perfect incarnation of the novel's character, even if his screen time is cut short. Amandla Stenberg portrays Rue, the youngest and most adorable tribute, who bonds with Katniss and plays a special role in the competition. Stanley Tucci provides some humor as the over-the-top television presenter,  Ceaser Flickerman.<br /><br />The Hunger Games touches upon a lot of political and social themes as well as tropes and story telling arches we have seen before. While the book nor the film are [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]], the characters, their relationships and the work of filmmakers and actors to bring this science fiction to the silver screen make this a great addition to dystopic film. The Hunger Games has excitement, intelligence and a few surprises; all in all, a very enjoyable and entertaining film.ce fiction of Panem such as the train ride in or the elaborate pageantry are magnificent but the muttations leave something to be desired.

B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Firstly for those people who found the preview alluring let me warn you this \\"action packed movie\\" spends more time blankly focusing on Kristin Stewart making all the same ridiculous facial expressions she did in the twilight movies. The plot started off as a promising one , but quickly they get caught up in trying to create beautiful eye catching scenes rather than actually telling a story. The movie earned the one star but Charlize Theron and Liam Hemsworth both did a great job.

All the many names, places, issues were a bit confusing, but Dan did what he always does and grabs you and holds you to the very end. Another issue was that 3/4 in I knew who did it, I just had yet to learn how. Usually I am surprised in the end, this one not so much, but Dan Brown can really write, and I enjoyed the book.

B007T99ENE|3.0|'Sweet Tooth' is set mostly in London in the early 70s, in an era of strikes, bomb blasts, oil crises, and cold war escalation.<br /><br />Although London has changed a lot since the 60s and 70s, many will still remember the IRA bombings, killing innocent people in bars and buses. And the cold war, when paranoia was the order of the day. And also the naivet&eacute; of the time, when women were little more than back office workers and male dominated office politics was so backward compared to now.<br /><br />Serena Frome is a Bishops daughter, a brilliant mathematician and voracious reader of books, who after graduating from Cambridge is surreptitiously recruited into the MI5 intelligence agency at a time when women rarely became field agents and their place was to push paper, type and do filiing for the higher-ups.<br /><br />We learn how Serena transitions from an intuitive, calculating mathematician to a more politically, news-aware literary type. And perhaps this change has made her more susceptible to romantics, even at the risk of losing her job.<br /><br />Romantic and secretive weekends away with a Cambridge professor, ultimately leads to another entanglement with one of her 'targets,' an aspiring author the MI5 wants to use like other intelligentsia to sway the thinking of the populace. Frome recruits him under the guise of a little-known, secretly funded foundation, and is captivated by the author enough to compromise her station in life by taking weekend journeys outside of London to be with him.<br /><br />Becoming part of this low-level secretive mission called 'Sweet Tooth' was considered a promising promotion for Frome, but, as in most spy novels, things don't turn out as expected.<br /><br />What's intriguing about this book, is that it's told in the first person of a female character, by an author, Ian McEwan, who is obviously male. If you didn't know this fact, you'd probably enjoy it more, relating more deeply with the character. Still, whatever the sentiment, Serena is likeable and you do hope that nothing too badly happens to her.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the story lacks depth and substance. Rather, it meanders around the two central characters weekend trysts and the hiding of their respective secrets. There is intrigue, some suspense and twists and turns, but it's a long journey to the end when we finally learn the truth and outcome. It doesn't delve too deeply into the politics and harsh realities of that cold war era.<br /><br />Still, 'Sweet Tooth' is an interesting, leisurely read.iment, Serena is likeable and you do hope that nothing too badly happens to her.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the story lacks depth and substance.

B001QJUX24|1.0|With 264 Five Stars, I was expecting an incredible movie.<br />I seriously don't know what people see in this movie.<br />It was totally hokey and offensive, and the acting was horrible.<br /><br />It is beyond me why this movie is rated so highly.<br /><br />I guess I cannot trust the Amazon rating system.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|This book comes across as a terrible waste.  Mr. Scalzi is a wonderful writer with great ideas who just doesn't live up to his other books in this one.  There are very brief flashes of interesting writing in the body of the novel, but the codas are simply dreadful. Thank goodness I found this at the library before I paid money for it on Amazon.<br /><br />In his afterword, Mr. Scalzi says that fellow writers believe that serving as president of the SFWA means one loses a year of creative productivity.  He offers this novel as proof that this is not true.  I adamantly disagree.

B000V6AD46|5.0|Been listening to this for 40 years and I still have to jump up and get to singing and dancing when I play it. :D  Its country-blues-rock-and-roll at it's very best. Skynyrd's debut album contains the haunting melodies and lyrical beauty of \\"Simple Man\\" and \\"Tuesday's Gone\\", the down-home rhythms and Billy Powells's exceptional piano playing in \\"Things Going On\\" and \\"Mississippi Kid\\", and absolute rock classics like \\"Gimme Three Steps\\" and one the most frequently played anthems in rock and roll history... \\"Free Bird\\" with the amazing Allen Collins on lead guitar. A must-have classic addition to any and all music collections.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|would have given it 5 stars but buying acorns is way too expensive. i do not want to spend 100 $ for playing
097747609X|5.0|I got the book sooner than I though I would which was a pleasant surprise. The book arrived in perfect condition and looks exactly like it does in the pictures. I haven't read the full thing yet but I believe this is a fantastic translation. There are several grammar points that are clearly off, but I'm pleased that this translation left them in there in the spirit of the original writing. For anyone interested in the Nazis, Hitler, or just history in general this is a fantastic book written by one of the most controversial people in history.
B001OMJGD0|2.0|Weak points:<br /><br />* Everyone looks plastic<br />* The pace is constipated<br />* The writing is insipid<br /><br />Strong point:<br /><br />* Kevin Spacey?
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I didn't make to the theater to see this film and I wish I had, I'm not a highly emotional person but something about the scene of the young Navy Soldiers needing to draw on the knowledge and experience of the Veterens just twisted in my gut and shot the movie into 5 star rating. I would love to have seen that moment on the big screen.<br /><br />The extra's alone on this disc make it worth the purchase price. To actually see and hear images and stories about the Mighty Mo and the crew who worked/lived within its structure was so interesting. The behind the scenes were also some of the best I've watched on a disc in recent memory. Did I want perfection, an explanation for everything the aliens did plot-wise? No I wanted a good action flick with nod to the game itself and that's what I got.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In my ignorance I had always assumed that all Stephen King books were horror-themed.  Horror does not float my boat so I had never read any of his books. However, I had heard he was an astonishingly talented writer.  11/22/63 showed me that in every line of every page.  It is a brilliant idea, executed impeccably by a writer who I can only assume is 'at the height of his powers' (an overused but totally appropriate phrase).  From the arresting title...to the brilliant premise... to the expertly navigated minefield of time travel writing...to the characters and their relationships it is all utterly absorbing. I defy you not to be moved by the dance scenes and a certain re-imagined newspaper headline.  At the end of my copy, the author describes how he thought about writing this book 40 years ago.  He decided against it because of the huge amount of research involved and the fact that, 9 years after JFK's assassination, it was still too raw.  I also imagined a further reason (apologies for putting words in your mouth, Mr. King!) - a massive amount of confidence (in his writing and his premise)  and a full life of relationships and world events experience have elevated this book way beyond what it might have been 40 years ago.  I was intrigued, enthralled, moved, scared, addicted, educated, and just plain old entertained.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent writing style in this book.  The author makes you feel like part of each scene.  I highly recommend this book for any mature adult who truly enjoys reading.  I normally read non-fiction, but this book has me so captured that I have also purchased the trilogy (3-book set) for my library.
0525953728|5.0|Firstly, this story is about some extraordinary men and women doing what they were trained to do. Owens takes you through the hardship of training, to the day that changed his team's life forever as they watched 9/11 unfold and finally to the moment they survived an helicopter crash that nearly took their lives, but there was no time to reconcile. They had a job and they did it well.<br /><br />Secondly, I cannot believe the filth publicized by the media. All this hoopla about Owen's spilling out tactical information and revealing the ways the SEALs work is utter BS. There is nothing in this book that I didn't find on the NY Times and cable networks first. If you ever watched a movie about the war in the middle east you have more tactical knowhow than you can get from this book. I think the establishment and the liberal media cronies are pissed that americans have access to the truth.<br /><br />Lastly, Owen's is giving the biggest portion of the books profits to some named Veteran Organizations. I know that if Hollywood made a movie it would have never given a dime to any veteran. I'm sure the writers are going back and changing the script.

Utterly depressing.<br /><br />By the way: will someone please make a film about a \\"typist\\" of bestsellers and cast the brilliant Tracy Ullman (a deadringer for the typist who cranked out FSOG) in the lead?!<br /><br />I recall reading a few pages once of the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" at a yard sale years ago and laughing out loud at how poorly written it was. I feel the same way about this garbage except I can't even muster a laugh this time around.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a rare talent for taking what we believe we understand and making it truly understandable. He has the ability to get us to stop for a moment and really think. He has a way using examples which allow any thinking person to relate what he is saying to personal experiences in our own everyday lives. This should be required reading in all of our schools.

B008QE9VJI|4.0|First of all, it's amazing to me that Dark Shadows has been recreated for the big screen 40 years after the original soap opera left the airwaves. I consider myself as big a fan of the original Dark Shadows as anyone and eagerly anticipated the release of the new movie. I also kept a very open mind, knowing full well the \\"re-telling\\" would be \\"different\\". Now that I've seen the movie (twice), I can say I was overall very pleased with what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp accomplished. Specifically keeping true to the basic original storyline and main characters and at the same time presenting the story in a way that would appeal to a new audience as well as old fans. The visual elements of the movie impressed me the most, from start to finish. Highlights for me were: the 70's setting (done exceptionally well), Collinwood interior and exterior, Alice Cooper and of course the cameo's. My only real disapointment was the movie seemed to be rushed. I woud have prefered a longer movie with longer scenes so the awesome settings could be savored more fully. I do think that Dark Shadows 2012 will become a classic favorite of \\"Shadows\\" fans - new and old.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This was a very long book for the content inside it.  I tend to agree with several of the other reviewers that it was felt like a \\"Twilight\\" remake but with older characters, no werewolves (thank God!)and a less interesting story line.  I also have to ask, why did the author make Diana 33 years old and then have her act like a child.  She has a PhD and tenure at Oxford for God sake, give her a personality and some spine.  Those were not just \\"given\\" to her, she had to be smart and go after them.  I wanted to like Diana and Matthew but it was really, really hard.  There were too many secrets, unanswered questions and spurts of excitement for it to be a very good plot.  I almost didn't finish this book because the first half was just plain boring.  I did finish because the second half was more interesting.  I purchased the second book and have read a couple of chapters but I have a bad feeling it's going to be more of \\"Matthew in control...Diana not knowing what to do\\", just set in the Middle Ages rather than modern times.  I sincerely hope a good editor was involved with the second book but because it's as large as the first one, I doubt it. I won't finish it if it's what I think it's going to be.  Who knows about book three...
1449389627|5.0|I must admit that I am not an avid reader so for me to hold on to this book start to finish was indeed a big deal.<br />Being in the software industry (and a Carnegie Mellon alum) I could totally associate with how Berkun emphasizes on getting your hands dirty in building the nuts & bolts and workman-like approach such as problems, solutions, composing ideas from various combinations of things that are common knowledge today but were once \\"innovations\\" of their time.<br /><br />He thus sets us free to think with an exploratory mindset letting ideas flow banishing our commonly held misconceptions about innovation of the beyond the ordinary \\"legends\\" as brilliant minds having high-flying \\"ground-breaking/game-changing\\" Eureka moments.<br /><br />Worthy of every minute you spend on reading this book for anyone in a creative field be it software/engineering/art/science/business.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|By the time I got to book three, I was bored by all the detailed sex scenarios and skipped over them.  Two books would have been enough for their saga.  I only read the third book because I had already bought it.  I admit ready Book one wet my apetitie to read more of their story, so I went ahead and bought book 2 & 3 at the same time.  I should have saved the money on book 3.

That must be it. A+ for our TRUE American hero and his story.

The beginning was choppy and confusing, but the stories did work together, and the structure became easier to follow. Footage of the time is woven in as Wally studies momentos of the era. As she pulls her own life together, Wally wonders how Wallis felt about her life as Duchess of Windsor, after (David)Edward VIII's abdication to be with her.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|\\"The Pines\\" was an excellent book, not quite a \\"5\\" in my opinion, but certainly a \\"4+\\".  Novel concept, well defined characters, and a satisfying ending,  the section of a book that usually makes or breaks the reading experience for me.  Crouch has come up with a winner!
0307454568|4.0|As I am writing this book review there are almost 1,700 other reviews currently posted on Amazon for this book.  Of those, almost 1,100 have given Stieg Larsson five Stars for the final book in  his Millennium Trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\".  I too am tempted by the overwhelming appeal of this book by others to also rate it highly...but five stars means classic to me...not only a must read but something I would consider reading multiple times.  \\"The Great Gatsby\\", \\"Catch-22\\", \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\"...and just to show that I can be in genre, Thomas Harris's, \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\".  Don't get me wrong, this trillogy, and in particular the character Larsson creates in Lisbeth Salander, is fantastic.  Whereas Clarice Starling may have a rival in Lisbeth Salander, no character in this book rises to the level of a household name such as Hannibal Lecter.  Even after 1,200 some odd pages Salander is the only draw, and, given the length to this  expose and the title of each book, we still are just getting to know her.  Which is why most fans, including me, would have liked for Larsson to have stayed with us a lot longer.<br /><br />Hornet's Nest is a great  book and a must read for all fan's.  Simply put you must finish the series. Larsson end's what he starts...in fact looking back it is clear he set out to write a single novel in three parts.  It all fits together.  \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" only worked, and I speculate here, because everyone knew that it's was the first of the series and that there was more of Salander ready for us...already written, already printed.  Had it not been that way, had the series not continued, we would have been left with half a character and the hope that the author would write more.  It wasn't until \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", that we leanred, as we already suspected, that Salander wasn't a fluke, she was definitely someone we could cheer for, and hope for, and care for, as did Blomkvist.<br /><br />Yet this third book is strained.  It is too long.  It is too repetitive. And ultimately the character who is so compelling to us, as some of the her mystery fades, also loses some of her charm.  Many of her secrets are revealed, she does have a conscious and she does require help from others...in this case the old and feeble mystery conspirators who conveniently off the more interesting protagonist, Zalachenko, before Salander can finish what she had started with an ax to his face, after he buried her alive, by killing him with a pencil in the ICU.  A scene we must imagine for ourselves because the conspirators intervene early in the book to set the stage for the new mystery.  Basically I think Larsson simply ran out of intrigue for her and we are left with a boy meets girl, girl likes boy, girl hates boy, boy saves girl's life, girl still hates boy, girl likes boy in the end story.  And then they live happily ever after, but only after girl tries to kill all her family members, but actually doesn't holding her morality untarnished, yet they die nevertheless at the hands of others, as they deserved.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this trilogy...I'm glad I read  \\"Hornet's Nest\\"...I'm glad to be done.  Four stars for a very good series.  I will not be re-reading any of these books, however, but I will continue to watch the movies...but only the Swedish versions...since the Hollywood version adds nothing...except maybe the James Bond title sequence accompanied by Led Zepplin's \\"Immigrant Song\\".ist.<br /><br />Yet this third book is strained.

B007N31YH0|5.0|This movie is a perfect example of the top-notch entertainment Hollywood can turn out when they get it all right.<br /><br />It's apparent that from the very first concept to the last little bit of editing, everyone involved was working diligently to turn out a high quality film--and they did.<br /><br />It's fun, engrossing, entertaining and satisfying.
0345529057|2.0|I just finished these four books, and I won't be continuing on to the fifth, Dances with Dragons.  Why? Because this series has finally proven to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I hate high fantasy in written form.  The show based on the books is exceptional, probably for the same reason that the Lord of the Rings movies are better than the books: every detail of the world that takes pages and pages to describe in the books can be communicated in a single shot on film, and no one spends time on tedious formalities when every second costs thousands of dollars.<br /><br />Thus, the most I can say for these books is that if High Fantasy is your thing, then you've found the Holy Grail.  If not, STAY THE FRACK AWAY, and enjoy the show.  There's nothing here that you won't find done better and faster on film, and since Martin writes the screenplays, too, you can still credit him for it.

0545259096|5.0|This book is one of those that is so, wow, terrific, over-the-top wonderful. I don't feel like anything I can say will do it justice! It's one of those rare books that I'm not afraid of overhyping, because it's better than any description I can summon.<br /><br />Others have said it before, but it's true, so I'll join in the chorus, and say that this book was poetic, lyrical, magical and completely amazing.<br /><br />Obviously, readers should go back and read the first two of The Wolves of Mercy Falls books if they haven't yet. [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver]] and [[ASIN:0545123291 Linger]] establish memorable characters and magical, yet somehow believable scenarios for an active werewolf population in Minnesota. I loved that the werewolves are not controlled by the moon - rather, their shapechanging abilities hinge on the temperature. The finale of the trilogy hinges on the relationships between rock-steady Grace and Sam, and the more electric and unstable Isabel and Cole. Mad werewolf Shelby stirs up trouble by randomly attacking people and Isabel's blustering father forces the issue when he organizes a chopper hunt to shoot down the wolves outside Mercy Falls.<br /><br />Grace and Sam have a really strong connection, and even if I was a little surprised at how much Sam was ready and willing to marry Grace right away, I did appreciate that Grace finally confronts her parents for essentially abandoning her to raise herself. They forbid her to see Sam, and predictably, once she's eighteen, she pretty much moves out. The story wraps up most major plot points, but what I wouldn't give for another chapter or two to hash out a few of the finer details!<br /><br />Normally, I'd recommend a slew of other werewolf books (and there are plenty out there, believe me) but this time around, I'd say what makes this book really distinctive is the beautiful language, so I'll recommend some equally lyrical paranormal/fantasy/horror YA titles instead.<br /><br />Compare to:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0316077038 Beautiful Creatures - Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl]]<br />[[ASIN:0385736827 The Forest of Hands and Teeth - Carrie Ryan]]<br />[[ASIN:031613399X Daughter of Smoke & Bone - Laini Taylor]]ASIN:0316077038 Beautiful Creatures - Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl]]<br />[[ASIN:0385736827 The Forest of Hands and Teeth - Carrie Ryan]]<br />[[ASIN:031613399X Daughter of Smoke & Bone - Laini Taylor]]

0374214913|5.0|I had placed this book on my \\"want\\" list as soon as I read a blurb about it some months ago. The concept was one that I hoped would not let me down. It didn't. Not one bit.<br /><br />Number one, Mr. Sloan writes well. Number two, he can tell an enjoyable story. Number three, he understands that the past still has meaning in the present (and the future).<br /><br />The story is deeply simple: a semi-secret society is trying to translate a five-hundred year old encoded volume in order to learn the secret to immortality. The robe wearing members race to be the first to do the decoding. This society recruits new novices through a series of bookstores.<br /><br />Aside: the first minute I spent in Mr. Penumbra's was grand; just like the first moment I spent in a \\"real\\" antiquities type of bookstore over half a century ago. I still remember the smell of those books and it wafted through the room as I read this book (in a room with nearly two thousand books).<br /><br />Our protagonist, Clay Jannon, goes to work in Mr. Penumbra's bookstore and proceeds, as Mr. Penumbra, hoped/knew he would, to break the rules Mr. P. had laid down. Clay has friends of the type we all need to have when we need help or money or extra brains or a date. This is a reminder that, for most of us, there are many fictional elements to the story.<br /><br />Clay and his army somewhat secretly seek to bring the five-hundred year old book into synch with the present and put all the resources of google at work to decode it. All that follows is then devoted to that effort. I found myself turning the pages faster than I would have liked and the end came too soon.<br /><br />Comparisons are made on the back cover of the ARC to Haruki Murakami and Neal Stephenson. I truly enjoy reading both of them and have copies of everything they have published (though I haven't made it through all of Murakami's - yet). There are elements of both in \\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\", though this author's style is his own.<br /><br />If you like a book that is respectful of the world of the written word, old bookstores, new bookstores, ebookstores, reading, writing and thinking, then grab this one.<br /><br />I will gladly read the next book by Robin Sloan and have discovered more to read on his website whose address is easily figured out (it isn't even in code).wn.<br /><br />If you like a book that is respectful of the world of the written word, old bookstores, new bookstores, ebookstores, reading, writing and thinking, then grab this one.<br /><br />I will gladly read the next book by Robin Sloan and have discovered more to read on his website whose address is easily figured out (it isn't even in code).

B007MDB71O|5.0|I'm a geek.  I love sci-fi and fantasy.  This was right up my alley.  I'm no professional movie critic by any means, but it was certainly entertaining to me, so the poor reviews are over my head.  Don't watch this movie and certainly don't rate it, if you like chick-flicks or another genre; it's not that universal.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Where does one start with this trilogy? Lisbeth Salander is anything but a normal girl. Her deeply troubled past gives way to many interesting confrontations and plot twists. Couple this girl with a charming yet persistent journalist who somehow gets himself caught up in situations that are a lot bigger than he realizes, and you can only end up with this trilogy. In addition, it takes place in a corrupt Sweden that is shockingly close to many societies today.<br /><br />Larsson has a unique writing style. He is able to dedicate so much time to delving into the history of a place or character with both detail and flow in a way that you feel like you are really on the inside scoop of whatever he is talking about, like you are being told information other people don't know. Then, on the other end of the spectrum, he is able to form dialogue between characters that is real. Speaking of history, there is a lot of it in this series, particularly in the beginning of book one. If you have a hard time with history, just push yourself to finish the first few chapters in it. You will be really glad you did.<br /><br />One thing I love in these books is the author's aim to expose the abuse against women in Sweden (though far few people really understand the scope of female abuse across the globe). From page one all the way to the last chapter of the series this theme is very apparent. Some of the statistics he reveals are horrifying, and the graphically violent crimes dealt with in the book are sick and tragic. I can only shudder mentally as I hope some of the crimes carried out in the book are not mirrors of actual ones that have taken place.<br /><br />My favorite thing about these books is Larsson's scale of storytelling. The first book felt like a home. The second book felt like a city. The final book felt like an entire country! What I mean is that the author was able to weave all the events together from book one to book three in a way that you go from a simple, clever mystery story to literally an epic tale set in modern Sweden.<br /><br />This series really is something else. Other reviewers have mentioned moral ambiguity, and it is something you definitely will notice.  However, given the obvious trope of the horrors of female abuse, I think Larsson was trying to convey that 'lesser evils' are justified when they help combat the 'greater' evils. Do I agree? I don't think so. Nonetheless, he was able to weave all this into a wonderful story with lovable, characters with whole personalities -- even if they do have strange ideals about life, sex, or whatever.<br /><br />I'm not sure what type of books you're into, but this is a series that appeals to readers of all types. You're really missing out if you turn this one down.

The first time I ever used it I immediately got a white screen and it would not do anything so I had to shut down and restart my Kindle.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is a well-crafted, well-acted subtle little movie which makes some very interesting observations on society, contains an intriguing mystery and features a wonderful performance from one of my favorite actors, Paul Giamatti.<br /><br />Set in Vienna (but actually filmed in and around Prague) in 1900, the movie is about a couple of childhood friends from very different social classes- the son of a cabinet-maker and Sophie, a royal princess. Their friendship is forcibly ended by the princess's family, but 15 years later the boy, now a man, reappears as an illusionist. They meet again and realize that they are in love; but how to separate themselves from the inevitable backlash against such a misalliance?<br /><br />The movie is told from the perspective of Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), a policeman responsible for security in the royal household. He reports to Crown Prince Leopold (the splendidly menacing Rufus Sewell), heir to the throne and a jealous and violent man, who wishes to marry Princess Sophie (Jessica Biel). When Eisenheim the illusionist (Edward Norton) delivers a number of barely veiled insults to the Crown Prince, Uhl is ordered to get rid of him. There follows a battle of wits between Uhl and Eisenheim, in which Uhl holds all the cards but Eisenheim tries to manipulate how they are played.<br /><br />The movie succeeds on many levels. It's atmospheric and gives the feel of a period piece; it points out the class distinctions of the time when it was literally possible for the Crown Prince to get away with murder; it takes a subtle dig at those who are obsessed by the supernatural and believe they are seeing something paranormal even when assured it is an illusion; the illusions are realistic and actually could have been performed at the time; and it uses misdirection as cleverly as Eisenheim himself. Interestingly, some of the interior scenes were filmed at the home of Arch-Duke Ferdinand of Sarajevo, whose assassination was the flashpoint for the start of World War One.<br /><br />The mistake the movie could have made, but happily didn't, is to make Uhl an unworthy opponent for Eisenheim. Instead, the two men respect each other and Eisenheim knows that nothing less than his best will fool the inspector. Moreover, Uhl is not an unlikeable man and throughout the film he faces an internal battle between his responsibilities and his personal inclinations. The final scene, in which Inspector Uhl mentally reviews all the facts and clues, is a brilliant piece of acting by Giamatti and leaves us thoroughly uplifted.<br /><br />Although a number of reviews compare this movie to 'The Prestige', which came out at about the same time, the movies are quite unlike each other except superficially- they both involve stage illusionists and are set at the end of the 19th century. This is the smaller, more intimate film, but just as effective in its own way. Enjoy them both.of World War One.<br /><br />The mistake the movie could have made, but happily didn't, is to make Uhl an unworthy opponent for Eisenheim.

B007SGM084|5.0|Not as \\"bad\\" as led to believe. I was interested in seeing what all the late night talk show buzz was always referring to. The book is not condoning all the \\"hardcore\\" kinky stuff. The author developed the characters and made you want to read more to get to know them better. It was all written from the \\"heroines\\" point of view. You even heard her thoughts, her feelings and her fears.<br />I've also read much more descriptive sex scenes in the regular romance books on the grocery shelves. Most couples have enjoyed a few of these things even if it was just to spice it up a bit once in awhile...if you are honest, what couple hasn't tied each other up with a scarf at least once just to see what it was like..None of this book was \\"dirty\\" or hardcore (a little kinky maybe) and the main character did not condone what the older woman did to the man in his youth..and what happened to him, that \\"shaped\\" his sexual enjoyment, was hinted at rather than explained in any detail.<br />This author treated sex in more tender words, than using anything vulgar or graphically explicit. Everything was consensual between the two adults. Nothing was ever tried against any characters will.<br /><br />I would enjoy more books by this author and especially more about the other characters in this book. I want to know how her best friends relationship turns out... did the housekeeper and the bodyguard ever get married?...did the sister ever catch the brother of the best friend?...etc...etc....<br /><br />I think all the publicity the book got was not really what the book is about, but it did help it sell a LOT of books and made the author rich I'm sure.  \\"Thumbs up\\"
0618918248|3.0|One of the major problems I found with this book is that Dawkins tries to cover just about every issue in the atheism vs. theism debate that has ever been heard.  I would have appreciated it if he had whittled it down a bit or at least had a more central focus to his book, but this book seems to be a more general covering of every topic imaginable.  Also in this book there will be a lot of topics that the reader probably won't be familiar with, and will have to look up, if they've never read up on atheism or any of the debates concerning the existence of God.  For example the reader might not know what NOMA refers to, what false positives and false negatives mean, or anything about game theory or what the term group selection means.  Fortunately I had already read up on that stuff (except NOMA) but I still had to occasionally look up some topics on the Internet for further reference.  There were a few topics that I didn't agree with which is why I gave it three stars.  I don't agree with memetics, the anthropic principle, his idea that some parameters of the Universe can be &#34;tweaked&#34;.  He also said Jesus never existed, which is crazy.  What I was really hoping for were some original arguments against the existence of God, and some good reasons to be an atheist.  Needless to say it's hard to enjoy this book if you're already highly opinionated, but sometimes you can find little tidbits of information that can be informative.  Dawkin's understanding of evolution can be quite informative and gives good examples of animal behavior that can be compared to human behavior.  A lot of people also give him a bad rap because of his strong criticism of Old Testament morality but I found it to be quite accurate when compared to the kind of morals that most Christians espouse today.  Although a few of the topics covered are dated, overall this is good introduction to atheism and some contemporary arguments in the debate about the existence of God, which I'm keeping in mind when I give this three stars.  Be prepared to look things up but also don't be afraid to flip through a few other books on human behavior, natural selection, genetics, and the God debate.  I recommend this book and any other (modern) books on atheism if you want to stay up to speed.

B007JRU2UK|3.0|If you've been to Hawaii you could appreciate the scenery and the music.  The story line is heartfelt but very sad.  The acting could have been better but at times Clooney and company really shine.  It's a movie worth seeing but don't get your hopes up too high or you'll be disappointed.  Expect a B average movie and you'll be happy.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Holy Cowabunga!  I knew from all the reviews that this book would be wonderful and for some reason I kept putting if off.  If you were like me a few months ago and are still putting off reading this, stop! Read it right now!  I seriously read it in 5 hours one night.  I couldn't stop.<br /><br />\\"Slammed\\" is such a poetic book.  Colleen writes to where you feel the character's despair and then you get this glimpse of light, this small hope that the world might right itself again...then you get stabbed in the heart.  But throughout this whole tragic story, there is good, there is love, there is life and the main character Layken struggles to figure that out.<br /><br />This book is pact with important life lessons that are wrapped up in humor, poetry, tragic loss, and love.  I swooned at the connection between Layken and Will.  I shuttered at the misery that was presented.  And I ugly cried throughout the whole book (especially the end.)<br /><br />In my mind, \\"Slammed\\" is a must read book.  You will seriously fall in love with the characters: Lake, Lake's mom and brother, Will, Will's brother, and Eddie and Gavin.<br /><br />On a side note, I WANT Will and Lake's love.  The way love flowed so easily between them made me jealous and giddy all at the same time.<br />~BookWhisperer Reviewer MC~
B0076NKNLA|3.0|I wonder how many other weeks Marilyn had like this one.  I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie in the theater but I am happy that I was able to see it.
B0085A9HXS|4.0|This movie was actually pretty good..I really enjoyed watching the fight scenes and the music that was included the only bad thing I would say abt the movie was that the ending was a little lackluster and bit of a let down
0525953728|1.0|This work appears to have been written by a 7th grader and edited by a 5th grader.  Ninety percent is a boring rehash of the author's life adventures such as the day he was on snowmobile with his father, his feet were cold and his father told him to walk a bit and his feet would warm up.  It worked.  Wow, that chapter was a page turner.  How about taking four pages to tell us about the time he conforted a nervous soldier who was parachuting out of a plane for the first time.  Bet that never happened before.  Most, but not all, of the SEAL stories relate to missions which either failed or, if they were successful, it was a success to which our author contributed nothing.  Yet, he takes great credit for the mission's success.  Although he was in the area, our author had absolutely nothing to do with the success of the SEAL effort to kill the priates who captures Capt. Phillips off of the coast of Africa.  However, he tells us how good it felt to finally kill some of the bad guys.  They would be just as dead even if our \\"hero\\" had not been within a hundred miles.  Most of his missions were no different than the thousands of missions American soldiers fought in World War II, but never spoke, much less bragged, about.  Do not spend your money on the egotistical rant.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice and simple calculator app.  Nice for all the uncomplicated things you may need scratch paper for...so really I like it because I can be lazy.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|It was as expected.  Lightweight.  Fit nicely on Kindle Fire.<br />The only negative think was the color was not true to the picture.  A little disappointing since I wanted a bright pink and it was dull.  Giving it 4 star because of the color not being as shown.
1419703692|5.0|My 16 year-old son is a huge Christopher Nolan fan and wants to become a movie director. He's not much of a reader, but this book made the perfect gift for him. The pictures were so amazing that they captured his attention and he ended up reading more of the book than I thought he would. He even took the book on vacation! I would definitely recommend this book for fans of the trilogy and anyone interest in the creation process of making movies.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an excellent read and I liked the style of the author. I could not put this book down, its twist and turns making it a gripping story told from both sides of this strangely addictive relationship between the characters Nick and Amy. I was surprised about the ending, though I understand that there will be a further book to follow. I am already looking forward to the sequel.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Go get a real job,you are a disgrace.  Millions spent on training and this is the best you can do?  Didn't you know its all on video?
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is not a good book.  Two Psychopaths get married and inflict pain on each other for years.  Wish I could get my money back.  The ending was just awful.  So unsatisfying.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|For the first few pages it's good, but it goes downhill from there. A very boring and simple story, really not what I'm used too from Child. Time to write a great one once again, it's not that great anymore....
B007L96SI6|4.0|I liked her voice it is very different. On this CD she covered various types of music and sings better than a lot of todays top female recording artists.  She is great.
B005QYKD4I|2.0|I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan I'll watch almost anything once.  This is one of those one watch movies.  A huge disappointment and not enjoyable at all.  The first half of the movie is spent trying to make you lust after Huntington-Whiteley.  She is so one dimensional that she's impossible to like, let alone think she's appealing.  There was zero chemistry between Huntington-Whiteley and LaBeouf.  They wasted half the film trying to show how LaBeouf could be the worst bumbler of all time and how everyone knew it.  Somebody in the studio obviously doesn't understand the Sci-Fi audience.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam has one of the finest voices of todays male volcalists. From the time it became the Adam Lambert show not American Idol I was a fan.  He is widely praised in Europe and not given enough air time here in the States. Many #1 hits to be played from this CD. Let's hear more of Adam!
B003O86FMW|5.0|although I found this book to be a page turner. It is a good book with a good plot, a lot of unexpected turns and twist. There is no foul language to contend with and a good book to read. The whole trilogy has kept my attention from the first book. I must say that the basis of the story line is a little hard to wrap my head around and also find it hard to believe this is a book for teenagers simply because of the story line. I am middle aged and am in the middle of the second book of the trilogy and find it a good read. I believe this author has a lot of talent and has been able to write a trilogy that has just took off. I am reminded of the Author of the book Eragon, this is a young man that started this series as a teenager another page turner.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest...but it doesn't always load on my kindle. gives me an error and I can only fore close or wait. gets kinda old when it happens every time I go to use the app.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I like the ability to mute on the set itself, it works great.<br />My only gripe is, for me they seems to squeeze my ears a lil too tight, but the spot it rests on my head is very comfortable.<br />The sound from these embarasses my cheap desktop speakers, if i didnt have weinie ears these would be great to wear all the time.<br />I have gotten the comment that i sound like i should be a radio announcer from people i talk to with the headset on, not sure if it's me or the headset lol.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I thought they did really well. I was worried they couldn't keep it up, but they put in nice twists, and made Dexter seem more human.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|John Cleese is at his over the top best. Que? It is, of course, one improbable, hilarious situation after another in each program. So very, very, very, funny. A wonderful cast that plays equally well with Cleese's near insanity. Unfortunately, there are only 12 episodes (on 2 disks) and I would much prefer 100. I hated to see it end. There is a 3rd disk with interviews, history and trivia. At 30 dollars plus, it was somewhat expensive. But, it is in a league all it's own. John Cleese is definitely a master (and Manuel, the waiter from barseloma, is the \\"icing on the cake\\"). I laughed so much.
0062012339|5.0|\\"The Dirt\\" is the best rock n roll book I have ever read and I have read alot. The way it is written showing thoughts and ideas from each of the members is very entertaining. It's interesting how everybody has their interpretation of the same incident, let's just say there not all the same. The book shows tenderness and tragedy together to make up who these guys are and what a Motley Crue really looks like. Highly recommend it to anyone.
B008XCPO2Q|3.0|The moves were really good. The bodies were great. The music was good. The acting was good. The weak point of the movie was the storyline. It was a good story, but could have been told better. These actors are able do a really good job when they have a good script. I was glad I saw it at the discount theater.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Blood Song is top-notch fantasy. Here's why:<br />-The story is set in a believable world. In other words, it's full of conflict, pain, manipulation, polotics, and religions. The characters have depth, there are no \\"heroes\\" in the classic sense, sometimes good people die and bad people prosper, and \\"good\\" is relative to where you're standing.<br />-The writing is execellent. Events and action are described well. There is enough detail to flesh out the characters and the world without ever becoming verbose or boring. Similarly, the plot moves well and is focused, moving to a satisfying conclusion (for the fist book of a trilogy, anyway).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. Within a few pages of reading I knew I had found something to relish. It's still early, but I would rate this book along with other epic fantasy by likes of Donaldson, Jordan, and Martin. Let's hope he has a good editor and is able to keep his story focused (looking at you Martin). I am eargerly awaiting the next installment.
B005H9B44A|3.0|Great acting and special effects, but the script was terrible.  A good movie to see if you haven't.  Great acting by Hemsworth, Portman, and the rest of her crew.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This Film was obviously sponsored by the US Navy. And why not, since they came out of it as a great organization filled with the right \\"stuff\\". But I don´t care. It was great fun to see an Sf film with great special effects and not to mention a real Battleship (at least in some scenes). It was just 90 minutes of fun and even if you knew that it was all kind of silly it was worth every minute. Great stuff.<br /><br />Of course you could ask yourself why 15 people could man and fight a battleship normally crewed by 1800+ professionals. You could ask yourself why a museum have live 406 mm ammunition. You could ask yourself why aliens traveling through space have no close in defense. But why should you? It was great fun. Enjoy. I hope there is a sequel.<br /><br />The only question was why was this pop star Rihanna in the film? I know of product placement but pop star placement?
1476712042|2.0|Sooo.. I put this on my \\"will never read\\" list a while back, but when it showed up on the list of audio books available for review from S&S, I took the chance on it. Honestly, I don't regret it, and at the beginning I actually kind of liked it a lot. But there were SO many problems! Let's take a look, shall we?<br /><br />1. I could HEAR the grammatical errors in this novel. Seriously.. that's ridiculous. A misplaced comma is one thing. But knowing when to use \\"I\\" or \\"me\\" is really NOT that hard and definitely something an editor should catch. Come on, now.<br /><br />2. Travis. What to say about Travis?! He's a possessive, egotistical, selfish a-hole. Travis is NOT boyfriend material. He shouldn't have been regarded as highly as he was by all the random chicks, either. Does this stuff happen in real life? Are guys like this sought out like that? He's a total jerk, and the way he gets as the book progresses feels SO unrealistic and overdone. I don't think he'd change that much in that short of a time period. What a prick.<br /><br />3. Abby. Wowee wow wow. This chick has some issues, let alone the worst friend EVER (see America below). How is it that she can remind herself that a life with Travis is the same as a life with her father but then completely forget in the next breath?! She's pathetic. It's a little ridiculous. I got so tired of her changing her mind and being so sad and sappy. She did this to herself, really.<br /><br />4. America. This girl needs to learn what it means to be a friend! She pushes Abby into this \\"relationship\\" with Travis only to rip her apart for it later. Then she's back on board. Then she's wishy-washy again and breaking up with her own boyfriend a million times. Get it together already!<br /><br />UGH. So yeah. Like I said.. at the beginning this book kind of had me hooked. Then it took off and went all nutso on me. It's not a very good book, and the cover has little to do with the story because Abby is no butterfly trapped in the jar. No sir! She's not. I could hardly feel bad for her, and I really wish Trav would have gone all real-life on her. That's all I'm saying. Not a fan of this one.. No sir! She's not. I could hardly feel bad for her, and I really wish Trav would have gone all real-life on her. That's all I'm saying. Not a fan of this one.
0515142247|3.0|One of the best things about a Jack Reacher book is that when Lee Child introduces something that is, shall I say, esoteric he often takes a time-out to explain the esoteric object, organization, operation, etc.  One of the most annoying things about a Jack Reacher book is that when Lee Child introduces something esoteric, he may use hundreds of words explaining in graphic detail everything you might ever want to know about the topic.  For example, when a shot is fired by a certain high-powered rifle he tracks everything about the bullet, the gases, the flight, the instant it collides with a man's head, etc. until it comes to rest in a wall.  In truth, I actually liked this one because I have written projectile-tracking software and found it interesting.  I doubt, however, that the average reader really wants to know that much about the flight of a bullet.<br /><br />Another problem I had was that Jack and a young woman are kidnapped, (no spoiler there; that is how the book begins) and the first half of the book is devoted to a detailed description of their journey to wherever the kidnappers are taking them.<br /><br />With a few exceptions of violence along the way, it is only after they reach their destination that the action begins.  The good news is that the second half of the book almost makes up for the very talky first half.  Although the whole premise of the second half is something of a stretch, I am reluctant to say that anything that doesn't violate basic laws of physics could never happen (as I write this review things are happening that I was taught repeatedly in school could never happen in our nation of laws).  But, taking some liberties with laws of probability for the purposes of telling a good story doesn't bother me much at all.<br /><br />So, if you can wade through the first half you will be rewarded with a quite exciting story that I would recommend.
B008VBYN80|5.0|fun game I'm laid up in bed playing. whorth the time reminds me of age of empires again fun game.....
B007MJSQSK|4.0|I rented this movie through Amazon Video on Demand and I liked it. I thought it was a fun adventure movie for the whole family. The picture quality was good and clear. I have not seen the original TinTin cartoons, so I cannot compare the two, but I would definitely watch it again. It is full of crazy moments and funny moments that will make you laugh.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a great game. It is like minecraft, but it has different twists to it. A lot of different worlds and blocks. Worth the five dollars.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I was very excited to get this on Blu-ray once it became available. This show is so entertaining; I was sucked in ever since the first episode. Ever since I was a little girl, I have always had an interest in fairy tales. Once Upon a Time is a show about fairy tales with a bit of a twist. I like how the show takes place in the modern world, but there are flash backs of the fairy tale world and what happened before the curse. It seems like all magic comes with a price...a steep price in most if not all cases. I am finding that I enjoy watching the fairy tale stories, more than I am the stories in the current world on the show. I cannot wait for the second season to begin.
030788743X|5.0|I have just one word for this book:  geek-i-liscious.<br /><br />This book is a throw-back-to-the-80s-geek's dream.  Imagine a world where virtual reality game play is free for everyone in the Universe of Oasis.  More importantly, the real world of the 2040s is so ugly and harsh, that everyone wants to escape to the Oasis--in the same way that many kids and adults escape the troubles of their lives for hours (and days) at a time by being on-line.  In \\"Ready Player One,\\" people spend their entire lives in Oasis; it is where everyone goes to work, study or shop while the real world decays around them.<br /><br />The founder and architect of Oasis dies in 2038.  He has no heirs and decides to leave his vast fortune and invincible avatar to the person who finds the ultimate Easter egg hidden in the code of Oasis.  Thus begins a 6-year battle between the gunters and Sixers to see who will be the first one to solve all the puzzles, find all the keys, open all the gates and meet all the challenges designed by the ultimate computer-game geek.<br /><br />The trick:  to win you have to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the pop culture of the 1980s.  So, searching for the egg requires watching endless hours of Family Ties, knowing the words to Monty Python's Holy Grail by heart, being able to get top score on every classic computer and arcade game, and quoting chapter and verse for all those classic MTV videos.  The perfect teenage nerd's dream!<br /><br />There are battles, love stories, an evil villain, a David-and-Goliath story, impenetrable fortresses, robots, dungeons, and those ultimate computers, TRS-80s.<br /><br />I don't claim to remember much of the 80s.  I didn't have a TV (sinful!), I didn't listen to much music, and there was a marriage I would like to forget altogether.  Still, \\"Ready Player One\\" brought a lot of the pop culture back to me.  I caught the quotes from Highlander, I remember playing the bonus round with two ships in Galaga, and I can sing all of \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.\\" I found myself smiling at these kids from the future using the bad lines my friends used 3 decades ago (\\"and don't called me Shirley.\\")  I was excited that my favorite arcade game, the one my boyfriend and I played for hours at a time down at the 7-11, was featured in the final challenge of the egg hunt.  I won't say which to avoid spoiling it, but I'm still chuckling about the literary references.<br /><br />Have fun!
B0086700CM|1.0|well i cant even download on kindle fire and it says that i need to add credit even though its free
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is an amazing read. It keeps you entertained the whole time and keeps you guessing through out the plot twisting book. Worth every penny and much more. This author knows what he is doing and knows how to keep the reader interested. Definitely a book that I would recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect for basic math!  Very easy to use.  You don't get overwhelmed from all the instructions like other apps.  You can do this without instructions!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games. It's amazing! Her other books are good too. Suzanne Collins you're the best author ever!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is great for kids to play when bored. many others kids might love this game more than me I think!!
0307592731|5.0|I normally do not like Oprah's recommendations. They tend to all share one theme! \\"woman done wrong, society is mean to them, they rise above etc. etc\\" I find that whole topic boring. So I did not originally embrace this recommendation until the Wall Street endorsed it. I read this book in a 24 hour period. The writing is tight and excellent, and I loved her journey. I was actually sorry when I finished the book and really wanted to know \\"the rest of the story\\". I highly recommend this book. This is a strong woman's story.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was entertaining as well as thought provoking. I could not put it down. The writing engulfed me at the beginning and I could not stop reading. It is about a family's young son and how the parents cope when things go wrong.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|This is a great movie.  Loved every minute.  Nicholas Cage never disappoints.  Always enjoy any movie he is in. Always Keeps you watching.  Thanks to Nicholas Cage for making movies great.
1401322786|5.0|As usual, Mitch Albom has written another soul-searching, thought-provoking masterpiece. I love reading his books, they warm my heart and make me shed tears. My favorite quote from the book - \\"Time is not something you give back. The very next moment may be an answer to your prayer. To deny that is to deny the most important part of the future.\\"...\\"Hope.\\" May God bless you, Mr. Albom. You are such a talented, gifted writer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is poorly written.  Still trying to find out what the hype is all about.  Excessive press on this book probably due to \\"shock and awe\\" effect with S&M.  The acquience by a twenty-something virgin to agree to S&M is unrealistic.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|That you don't have a lot of games that make your K-Fire freeze all the time 'cause I had a bunch of games that I never played on. And I thought that it wouldn't matter, but they were the reason that my Fire was getting frozen all the time (that means the screens stuck) so when I deleted those it went back to normal. So just delete (un-install) all the apps that you don't play on and you should be good (and if that doesn't work report the problem (it's the lightbulb on the upper right hand corner) just say you don't like it very much on your rating.). *;-)
B00846REIS|1.0|This read like a copy of the \\"Fifty Shades\\" series and yet, was even more ackward and badly written.  Why waste your time?
B008D36INE|5.0|This movie was really good. I wasn't expecting it to be as great as it was. Very heartfelt and it had an amazing ending.
1439102430|2.0|I have liked all of the Kathy Reichs novels, until now. I am not easily offended or squeamish, but I could not deal with the dead baby storyline.<br />I made it to page 43. If you can stomach the graphic details of murdered, decomposing children, maybe this will be an okay book for you. Not for me.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|Fun game and good story, but you end up overpowering one weapon. It needs to distribute more cash so you can power up all the weapons, or at least most of them. This is also bad if you find the weapon you chose to upgrade is ineffective against the final boss of the level, requiring you to start all over. This game does save the progress you made in the level, however only let's you continue if you select the correct difficulty you played at the last time, otherwise you have to start all over again! This could be fixed with a simple continue on the main menu. Overall the game is OK, but probably not worth the 2 dollars until it fixes some things.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|One of my most favorite movies of all time... Gerard Butler is brilliant as the Phantom... and he sings all his own songs... AAAAAAA+++++++
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|At least that's my conclusion. Using this cable to connect Kindle to our newer 64-bit computer causes the computer to freeze up but it works fine on our old computer which is 32-bit.  Unfortunately, that presents a problem as the old computer is not connected to the internet so we download books to a folder on the new computer and transfer to a flashdrive (or download directly to the flashdrive), upload them to a folder on the old computer and then transfer them to the Kindle using this cable.  We plan to replace the older computer quite soon so I'm guessing this cable will then be useless as will the Kindle. Not too happy about that.
B008QDCZJ2|4.0|Die-hard fans will undoubetedly either love or dislike this 11th album released by one of music's greatest pop duos of all time - The Pet Shop Boys.    If you are hoping for a repeat of the catchy, uplifting and club ready tracks from their 2009 release \\"Yes\\", then listening to \\"Elysium\\" for the first time could leave you disappointed or perplexed as one reviewer noted. For those fans, however,  who loved \\"Behaviour\\" with its moody mid-tempo tracks that all seemed to blend into a coherent concept album, then you are in for a treat as this is very much the direction \\"Elysium\\" takes. It is a slow burn that requires repeated listens to understand both the underlying themes / lyrics sung as well as to appreciate the minimalist approach to the instrumentation that at times strongly reminds youself of Kanye West cd \\"808s and Heartbreak.\\" This is acredited to Neil and Chris having picked Kanye's producer Andrew Dawson for this project.    I was disappointed with the choice of \\"Winner\\" as the lead single (of couse the connection and timing to the Summer Olympics in London made sense) but it is one of the weaker tracks on this cd. \\"Leaving\\" which will be released in October as the second single is vintage Boys and deserves radio play and a Top 10 position. \\"Invisible,\\" \\"A Face Like That\\" and \\"Requiem in Denim and the Leopardskin\\" demonstrate that even after 26 years they still have the ability to re-invent themselves and create timeless classics.    How many of today's musical artists can boast 11 studio albums, 3 greatest hits packages and 2 alternate b-side and remix albums! For this they deserve our continued love and support!    UPDATE: The Pet Shop Boys performed an exclusive live concert in Germany last week to promote the album. Watch it on youtube and then decide if this album is worth it! [...] These songs do rank among the best they've ever made.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|The cd inculded all his great hits and even a dvd of his live concerts.  You really get a lot for you buck.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|Action Packed Movie Mostly on a Prison Space Station. Great Special Effects. Some time Funny. Good Story. The Hero is not a Hero but a just a mixed up guy. A lot of Spy Stuff.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|We loved the first Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are very good in both.  However, in the second film, the script is poor, there are too many jumping \\"thought\\" sequences by the director and it is short on the twists and surprises in most Sherlock Holmes films or books.  It was an ok movie but it was a drop off from the first film.  It also seemed more of an early 20th century version of the new James Bond vice the crime solving prowess of Sherlock Holmes.  It was average but not because of its main stars who were still very good.
B0055SWM08|5.0|challenging yet somehow calming- probably due to the music and graphics .this is one game I will be returning to often!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Lucky me, I got this FREE!  This is not ordinary, boring, matching-tiles mahjong; this is changing tile formation every time, with beautiful graphics, 'wild card' &amp; reshuffle options, all with an entertaining comic book back story.  I NEEDED the brief tutorial to allow me to get the max fun out of this great game (but I'm the sort that likes to read instructions first).  I've not been bothered by any ads other than the dev's offers for other games that appears only at the opening;  sadly, I can't  afford to buy, but I'll be watching the FAOTD in the hopes of maybe being this lucky again someday.
B006JDFLR4|5.0|Rhonda Byrne's The Power is in keeping with her other titles The Secret and The Magic. It is sensational reading and has inspired me to be grateful and to be thankful for my life and to expect more! A must read for everyone.<br /><br />Even if you haven't previously read The Secret, you can easily pick this up and run with it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A fun analytical maze-like games that takes logic and figure-ground skill.  It is the first Internet game that actually fits MY brain.  Time flies without my noticing.  Great distraction from my aches and pains.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was a little late to join the bandwagon...but myself, my husband and my 3 year old love playing this!  Beware it is addicting :)
B001S86J5S|5.0|Although this is an older sports film, it still holds plenty of anecdotes for the viewer.  Charlie Sheen's character, the \\"Wild Thing\\", is a rebel with a cause.

B004SIP9RO|5.0|I bought the DVD because some of my girlfriends really enjoyed the movie, but I don't really like it. Maybe it's because the story is a little ridiculous to me.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Okay so it might be hard for me to be objective and all when it comes to one of the biggest and most important and influential gods in the history of heavy metal music, but I find it odd that anybody in their right mind would ever give Ozzy Osbourne's newest album, 2010's \\"Scream,\\" anything less than a 4.5 star rating. Sure, Ozzy's longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde might be out of the picture now; and sure, it might initially seem like Osbourne is headed for a new sound on \\"Scream.\\" But only at first. After giving it repeat listens, it soon becomes readily apparent that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this album, and that it covers all of O.O.'s usual bases - hard hitting heavy rockers, punishing doom metal, and tender balladry. And newbie guitarist Gus G. (who is of Arch Enemy fame) is certainly a shredder that is more than capable of spitting-out plenty of great riffs and solos. But hey, what else would you expect from an axeman that was hand-picked and hired to play in the same band as John Michael Osbourne?!<br /><br />From the anthemic opener (\\"Let It Die\\") to the set-closing acoustic kiss off (\\"I Love You All\\"), \\"Scream\\" practically, uh, screams that it is a strong and very consistent Ozzy album. \\"Let Me Hear You Scream\\" is the album's pounding and booming lead single, filled with chunky guitar licks, blistering soloing, and irresistible choruses. But it is easy to confuse the subsequent song, \\"Soul Sucker,\\" to be a single (if it isn't one, then it sure as heck deserves to be!). After all, it is a thunderous and lurching number with catchy, fist-pumpable choruses and a wild, shredding guitar solo. And the tune's strong bass work and unexpectedly thrashy break are two bonus pieces of frosting on the cake. Next up, \\"Life Won't Wait,\\" one of the Ozzman's best and most poignant (and not to mention bass-driven, as it has a grumbling bass throb) ballads since \\"Hey Mama, I'm Coming Home.\\" Then comes \\"Diggin' Me Down\\" which, after a beautiful acoustic intro reminiscent of \\"Diary Of A Madman,\\" drops a huge, great, slamming, bone-crunching doom metal riff in your lap in addition to its warm, humming bass line and noteworthy lyrics (i.e. \\"Where are you, father?/Why don't you save us,\\" and \\"Come on Jesus/We're all here waiting for you\\"). The next standout track is \\"Time,\\" a very catchy, sing-songy power ballad with excellent, Zakk Wylde-styled soloing. Back on heavier ground, \\"I Want It More\\" is propelled by hooky, Black Sabbath-derived riff chunks, a grumbling groove, another terrifically ripping solo, and more infectious, stadium-sized choruses. But it is \\"Latimer's Mercy,\\" which boasts some of the Gus G's absolute biggest and heaviest guitar chops -- including amazing, massively pounding, purely doomy, drop-D riffage augmented some hooky, \\"wah-wah\\" licks, and another great, wailing, high-flying solo (as well as an ominous bass part, and deftly bouncing drum fill) -- that is the record's biggest highpoint.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this reviewer seriously struggles to see how any hard rock fan could complain about \\"Scream.\\" It might not find Ozzy knocking down many new walls, but it by no stretch of the imagination ever sounds generic. This is a extremely enjoyable and even-more-solid album from the king of metal. Check it out; you will not be disappointed!cent of \\"Diary Of A Madman,\\" drops a huge, great, slamming, bone-crunching doom metal riff in your lap in addition to its warm, humming bass line and noteworthy lyrics (i.e. \\"Where are you, father?/Why don't you save us,\\" and \\"Come on Jesus/We're all here waiting for you\\").

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Even though I am not a runner myself, I was intrigued by the premise of the book. Once I began reading, I found it hard to put down! Full of interesting scientific facts as well as a personal story to tie it all together, this book has something for everyone.
B0041B785Y|5.0|Meshuggah's seventh-full length opus is much like their last one, 2008's \\"Obzen,\\" in that it is a familiar-sounding album that focuses more on honing the band's sound than on any real stylistic change or artistic leaps forward. But there is one key difference present in the songwriting of 2012's \\"Koloss\\": Paired down arrangements. Now, it is important to note that this does not mean these Swedish mad professors of heavy metal aren't still amazing musicians. See, Meshuggah's world-renowned arsenal of devastating, downtuned riffage, trance-inducing rhythms, thundering bass lines, and phenomenal drumming (from skinsman extraordinaire Tomas Haake) has not gone anywhere on \\"Koloss.\\" It just means simply that all over-the-top technical wankery/shredding and excessive mathematical tendencies have been scrapped in favor of a less overwrought, and more bare-bones and straightforward metal approach. Thus, if the band's goal, here, was to strip down the songs in order to up the levels of intensity and viscerally-satisfying sonic heaviness and intensity, then they most definitely succeeded. But hey, it's not like they have ever been one known to make bad albums!<br /><br />\\"I Am Colossus,\\" which opens the album with thunderously staccato, pounding riffs, a fast tempo change (around two-minutes in), positively doomy breakdowns, and a searing guitar solo, is vintage Meshuggah. And so are \\"Do Not Look Down\\" and \\"Marrow,\\" as they both marry rhythmically bobbing, head-bangable guitar hooks with blistering, fluid, Atheist/Cynic-esque melodic solos that pierce the air. (And \\"Marrow\\" is also of note for boasting funky-sounding bass lines and stop-start drum blasts, too.) Tracks four and seven, \\"Behind The Sun\\" and the curiously-named \\"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion,\\" are two epic numbers, clocking in at 6:10 and almost seven minutes, respectively. Both begin with nice, melodic strumming, but only \\"Behind The Sun\\" can claim to be bass-driven. In addition to its usual abundance of huge, lumbering riffs, it features plenty of interesting, slapped bass fills, and a propulsive, viscerally grumbling bass groove. And the other of the two epics, \\"Break Those Bones...\\", is backed by crunching, staccato, churning rhythms that are very heavy and slammin' yet simultaneously textured, as they are threaded with nicely melodic, clean-sounding guitar leads.<br /><br />There is the occasional pleasantly surprising burst of speed, though. \\"The Demon's Name Is Surveillance\\" is an unexpectedly fast blast of relentless thrash picking, complex, polyrhythmic drumming -- including plenty of swift double bass pounding -- turgid, squiggly bass lines, and jazzy soloing. Similarly, despite a melodic guitar outro, \\"The Hurt That Finds You First\\" plays almost like straight-up thrash metal, and is full of brutal chainsaw riffing. Mr. Haake steals the show, here, though, as his drum performance in this song is really quite amazing. It is long on deft thrash beats and foundation-shaking, grind-influenced blast beats. Haake's talents come into the spotlight again for \\"Swarm,\\" which has turgid, belligerent, densely churning thrash grooves anchored by his impressive polyrhythms. But things again wind back down on a bit more of a restrained and melodic note. \\"Demiurge\\" features an atmospheric intro (yes, Meshuggah's usual massive, moving, seven-string riffage eventually comes smashing in -- but still!). And \\"Koloss\\" ends with positively progressive number: \\"The Last Vigil\\" is an entirely instrumental album closer with cool, tranquil strings that would not sound mismatched coming off of a Tool outing.<br /><br />\\"Koloss\\" cannot be deemed as Meshuggah's most experimental or groundbreaking effort. But it is a darn fine slab of extreme metal from one of the genre's masters, thus making it a more-than-worthy inclusion in your collection. And, as of this date, it is the front-running candidate for metal album of the year (2012).dance of huge, lumbering riffs, it features plenty of interesting, slapped bass fills, and a propulsive, viscerally grumbling bass groove.

1451627297|5.0|JFK or 11.22.63 is a book that smiled to me since I first saw it. I don't know why. Partially because it was huge and partially because it was Stephen King's latest work.<br /><br />I've read at least 6 of his books so I have some experience. I know that he writes books that are \\"a page turner\\". And the only book I never managed to finish was \\"Lisey's Game\\".<br /><br />So what can I say about this book in particular? It took me two days to finish. About 300 pages in each session. Why? Because it was AMAZING. Leaving aside the classic writing tricks to keep you hooked, the topic was something I actually found a great interest in.<br /><br />My only disapointment was that I was kind of expecting the ending. Why? Because it's written on the cover in the lines of \\"Saving JFK was a good idea?\\".<br /><br />So it doesn't take you a lot of brains to realize that there will be an unexpected result to our hero's entire journey. But except of that, I simply loved it.<br /><br />Carrie was hard to read but at least interesting.<br />Salem's lot made me not sleep at night for a long time.<br />Christine was not that impressive at least for me.<br />The Shinning was another book I've finished in 4 - 5 days.<br />Cell again, was read in two days - loved the topic.<br /><br />... And 11/22/63 is virtually the apogee of his writing style. I don't consider it as good as \\"The Shinning\\" or \\"Salem's lot\\" but after 840 pages, I was sorry that it was over.<br /><br />So buy it! And don't be afraid of the slow start - after the first 15 pages you will be pulled in and most importantly you will identify with the character almost 100%!

B008602KQI|5.0|I usually dislike adaptations from books as they very rarely do the originals justice. This was not the case with The Hunger Games.<br />The cast for this movie was stellar. Jennifer Lawrence epitomized Katniss Everdeen. Her performance was gritty, vulnerable, and strong. She was everything that made Katniss such a joy to read. It was just as good watching her come to life on screen.<br />Josh Hutcherson, while not necessarily what I pictured in my head while reading, became my favorite performance during the course of the movie. He turned what could have easily have been a cliched character into someone who displayed grace, strength, and a rare spirit that should have been crushed by his situation. He won me over and I couldn't picture anyone else as Peeta Mellark.<br /><br />Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson gave excellent performances as well.<br />I really enjoyed this film and now can't wait for the second installment.

B008YRVW0I|5.0|I own all of the Playrix games for the iPhone and the iPad.  They are some of my favorite games and when I saw this game I just had to get it on my Kindle Fire.  This is a match three game with some nice twists in the playing style.  The animation and graphics are excellent.  The faster you complete the level the more points you earn so watch the moving timer scale on the side of the game.  You earn money for completing the level and with the money you can build your own unique and beautiful aquarium.  You can buy fish, tank accessories and plants under the titles of Fish, Beauty and Comfort.<br /><br />The levels can contain colored tiles, they can also become single or double locked which means you have to match them two or three times to clear the colored tiles or blow them up.  You can also get a lighting ball and when you move it onto any tile almost all of the tiles with the same icon disappear or are unlocked to be moved.  Use it wisely!<br /><br />If you clear more than five tiles at a time you can get explosives with powers ranging from fire crackers to all out bombs to blow up large amounts of colored or locked tiles.  They can even clear tiles that are difficult to get to.  Work hard to get matches of 5, 6 or more titles to get the bigger bombs as they are very helpful in playing and winning the level.  I love to play and get a good sum of money and then start building the aquarium.  You can build multiple aquariums and they each have a different theme.  The graphics are outstanding and the sound track is nice also.<br /><br />As you go along the items you buy cost more and more so the game also allows you to win more.  You can build three Aquariums and get three trophies in each aquarium level.  While the aquariums are fun they can get repetitive and I actually like playing the game so much that I can play for hours.  It is a real time killer.  The aquariums are very beautiful.<br /><br />The game is massive in size as mine on the Kindle Fire is already 73.08 MB and it also stores your data like the aquariums you build so the memory requirement will grow.<br /><br />The game does use the following permissions:<br />Storage - modify/delete internal storage contents<br />Network communications - full internet access<br />Network state - view network state<br /><br />This is a great game and I have to tell you that all of the Playrix games are 5 stars.

His voice is great and he sings them like he feels them in his soul.  Thank you, Paul, love you! By the way I come from a line of McCartney's!

B007SGM084|4.0|My husband (who hasn't read any of the books) is baffled by the idea that this series is so wildly popular with women, and (maybe) specifically older women. Let me say this about that...Yes, the beginning has lots of kinky sex, which to a 55 year old woman is, interesting. It's not particularly well written but the story line does develop, eventually. In the meantime, I think this is popular among women (yes, and older women) in part because it reminds us of earlier days...when we were young, excited, slim, childless and sexually charged. Post child-bearing (and now blessed with the side effects of childbirth...hemorrhoids and wrinkled bellies), post menopausal ( and it's lovely side-effects), well...I guess all I can say is that it reminds us (or me) of a different time. That is why I found it to be so much fun to read! It's actually a bit refreshing! I might even try to spark things up a bit, having been somewhat enticed by what I've read. It just might spice things up a bit for a post-menopausal, yet still trim, but somewhat sexually bored woman. Read it, it's fun!
B00846TRHY|3.0|This movie was somewhat disturbing in it's realism.  Curse words were few, so it wasn't that.  It will make you think and challenge your beliefs.  It is challenging and hard to describe.  It is a true story and so is valuable for learning.  The man it is about is a very controversial figure.  Some people nearly worship him, and others can hardly stand him and try to discredit everything he does.  Check it out and broaden your understanding of the world and perhaps yourself.

B005MMZ63C|5.0|I'm almost ashamed to say, I did not see this movie until well into my adult life. I do love movies and always wondered why this is at the top of everyone's \\"best of\\" lists.  My son is also growing to love \\"old\\" black-and-white films (because we tell him they are \\"for grownups\\"), so we downloaded this from Amazon On Demand to watch together.  The HD print was awesome on our HDTV . . . this is a \\"big\\" movie but it was fine on our regular 42\\" flatscreen. The movie, while not \\"for kids\\" in the traditional sense, was actually pretty interesting to my grade-schooler -- it does feature Kane as a child, in no small part, and tellingly my son's own questions (\\"where did his mom go? Is that man his friend now?\\") managed to cut to the heart of the story itself! Not to mention the ending -- wow, did the two of us ever understand what \\"Rosebud\\" truly meant.<br /><br />Orson Welles, if you only know him as an old man, was an astoundingly handsome and snappy young actor. Kane is a \\"larger than life\\" man who grew up wealthy, \\"inside\\" the establishment, but instead of following along and being a \\"good fellow\\" he pursues tabloid journalism -- both to be a thorn in the side of the establishment and to feed his own, ever-growing ego.  Along the road, he gets bigger and bigger while -- well, you might think you know where this kind of story always goes, but you have to see it to really feel HOW it gets there.  Welles hits every note perfectly. The film takes place mostly in flashbacks, which of course these days is par for the course, but (again with through a grade-schooler's eyes) the technique creates its own story of reminiscences, confusion and detachment from the past (\\"When is that? Who is that? Is he young or old?\\"). The big moments from Kane's life -- and there are huge ones, literally operatic -- ebb and flow through the (sad) reality of what his life ultimately became.  This movie is so big and bold -- the span of the story is bold, Charles Foster Kane's ambitions are bold,the sets are bold (this is one of the first films to show ceilings of indoor sets! It was an extravagance at the time because sound stages usually had no ceilings!) And, one of my favorite things about old movies -- it is a historic record in itself, a living singing picture of the world in 1941 -- an era of suits, cars, phones and city streets that are so different from ours. But when it comes to politics, news, ego and love (or \\"love\\") Citizen Kane still rings true -- and we have not come so far, after all.

1401322786|5.0|Mitch Albom's creativity strikes again, this time in a quirky little fable about Father Time. Of course, any book about Father Time is going to require a suspension of disbelief. This is brief and elegant, like Jonathan Livingston Seagull, but with a cleverness and history-spanning aspect that evokes Tom Robbins' Jitterbug Perfume.<br /><br />In plot and characters, this is more like the black-and-white morality of A Christmas Carol than the many-textured pains of Its a Wonderful Life, but it is a homage to both: \\"Timekeeper\\" turns the simple \\"bad person gets a second chance\\" motif inside out. Who is the Angel and who is George Bailey? Despite its simplicity, this story carries a powerful emotional punch: More jaded readers might think they can predict it all from the first page, but Albom is a master of surprise! This is not just a book about \\"living in the present\\" or \\"obsessing over something is not the same as appreciating it.\\" Although those are important morals. At its heart, this is a book about the human capacity to love, and without spoiling it, it is indeed a power bigger than time itself. On a philosophical note -- I would query the metaphysical premise of the book: Is God really punishing Dor along the lines that \\"counting time\\" is a sin (like tasting from the tree of knowledge?) Does the human ability to \\"count time\\" make us selfish and misguided or can it serve to lead us to higher truth (through science, community or otherwise?) That is food for thought that the book doesn't answer.<br /><br />In a literary world of increasing complexity and bravado, Albom has the bravery to speak simple truths with confidence. It is the quality of time, not the quantity. This is a refreshing tidbit of literature in a crazy world!

Packaged well in a tight plastic bag, so it did not arrive with lint or fuzzies or cardboard scraps or other nasty things stuffed animals in transit pick up.  Stands up on his own like good little snail, so he is easy to pop onto a shelf.  Meoww.

0307352145|5.0|Cain's book is for anyone who thinks introversion is a trait to be overcome.  She helps us celebrate our natural selves and stops the voice of our inner critic who wishes we were more outgoing and comfortable in social settings. It was pure reading enjoyment to connect with someone who knew me so well without ever laying eyes on me.  It had the benefits of a group therapy session within the confines of the safety of my own home.  I will never look at myself or any other introvert without first celebrating the nature of their being. It also helped me understand the nature of the extroverts I come into contact with everyday and has given me new appreciation for traits I personally find frustrating; my son will be deeply grateful to Ms. Cain for this!  The book felt like a personal gift to me and I already have started passing it on to other introverts I love in conversation and in book form.  Thank you Susan for deeply enriching my life at a time when I needed it the most!  I am thrilled to be celebrated for my quiet, introspective, creative nature and I hope to begin to use this information in a way that informs me and reduces my tendency to judge myself and others for things that come quite naturally to us.

Some common distances of these races are 50k (31 miles), 50 miles, 100k (62 miles), 100 miles and even further. As if the distances alone weren't daunting enough, some of these races are held in extreme environmental conditions such as the Western States 100 that traverses the Gold Rush trails of the California Sierra Nevada or the Badwater which is 135 miles through Death Valley.<br /><br />  It's one thing to complete these grueling exercises in masochism, but it's another to actually win them, and yet another to do it on a 100% plant based diet. Scott Jurek, author of \\"Eat and Run\\", is a vegan ultramarathon winner and his book recounts his adventures running ultra races all over the world and how he did it on a vegan diet.<br /><br />  An ultramarathon is about transcendence and requires metaphysical strength as opposed to athletic talent and has been described as 99% mental and 1% physical. Of interest to me was what Jurek had to say about how the sport attracts many recovering alcoholics and addicts. Study after study has shown that the runner's high comes from increased levels of endorphins and endocannabinoids.<br /><br />  Jurek says, \\"I'm convinced that a lot of people run ultramarathons for the same reason they take mood altering drugs...the longer and farther I ran, the more I realized that what I was often chasing was a state of mind - a place where worries that seemed monumental melted away, where the beauty and timelessness of the universe, of the present moment, came into sharp focus.\\"<br /><br />  I also liked his four-step checklist to deal with a problem or disappointment: First, allow yourself to feel what you're feeling and acknowledge it. Second, take stock of the situation. Third, ask yourself what you can or cannot do to remedy the situation. Fourth, separate the negative thoughts from reality.<br /><br />  I'm deeply inspired by people like Scott Jurek. Not just because he's a winner, but because he lives his life by his own rules and he's made a living out of doing what he loves most. He shows us how to break out of our self-imposed limits and that growth only comes by transcending those limits.<br /><br />Review Written By David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"n.

B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Big Big Train's English Electric, Part 1 is an album that ticks all the boxes in my musical wish list: marvellous melodies (always top of my list), tight ensemble playing, lush orchestrations, sinuous basslines (just listen to \\"Judas Unrepentant, for example), virtuoso soloing, soaring vocal harmonies, light and shade, superb production values. And carefully crafted lyrics that tell a wide variety of very English tales about the countryside and the people, from art forgers to child miners, to uncle Jack's appreciation of the hedgerows. While there is a sense of Victorian nostalgia about the album, it is also very modern. There's not a wasted note anywhere - most of the songs are in the 7-9 minutes range, but only because that is what is required to tell each particular story. No needless noodling, which nearly killed progressive music forever - the immense talents of the musicians are tightly reigned in by songwriting of the highest calibre, but always given enough freedom to endow the songs with great emotional depth.<br /><br />The core of the band, Andy Poole and Greg Spawton, have been laying the foundations for this magnum opus for twenty years, and they have been carried to this creative peak by their recent recruitment of three additional outstanding musicians - guitarist Dave Gregory (ex-XTC), my favourite American drummer Nick D'Virgilio (ex-Spock's Beard) (Gavin Harrison just pips him as my favourite drummer), and multi-instrumentalist and vocalist extraordinaire David Longdon. They also make judicious use of strings and brass band, and some outstanding keyboard work from The Tangent's Andy Tillison.<br /><br />The songwriting credits are equally shared between Spawton and Longdon. Spawton admitted to Prog magazine that Longdon's songwriting has taken the band to a new level, and I must agree - BBT's albums before Longdon came aboard had some outstanding material, but the last 3 releases, [[ASIN:B002ZIABE0 Underfall Yard]] (2009), the [[ASIN:B004CZRDL8 FarSkies Deep Time]] ep (2010) and now English Electric P1 have seen their combined compositional skills rise into the stratosphere. May it not stop there: space, the final frontier, awaits...<br /><br />BBT currently share the podium with Porcupine Tree as my favourite band (I know they're very different - but it's the variety of sounds that I love about prog), and English Electric Part 1 has immediately grabbed me with its intensity and emotional power. Album of the year for me, for sure!
B000W03RHQ|5.0|I saw these guys briefly on VH1 and had to buy this. Tarja's voice is absoutly stunning. This is a fantastic ending to an unfortunate situation. If you're looking for a little something different and are any kind of fan of \\"metal\\" in general you gotta hear this! I think you'll be supprised.

B008602KQI|4.0|I must say I enjoyed the film version of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games. The story is reasonably faithful to the novel and Jennifer Lawrence is an fine choice for Katniss Everdeen. The rest of the casting was well-chosen, too. That said, having seen the movie is NOT having read the book. In her novels Ms. Collins examines her heroine's motivations and relationships in a way impossible in visual media. While this movie is an enjoyable and exciting appendage to the stories, it is also a pale reflection of what I think is a true modern classic.

We are permanent live aboard long distance cruisers and use Nobeltec Admiral Software in laptops; the reception is great inside the pilothouse and the same below decks in our office/den. Great prompt service from Amazon too!
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Fun. is an interesting new band. Their debut album, 2009's \\"Aim and Ignite\\" their second album 2012's \\"Some Nights\\" are significantly different in terms of tone and sound. \\"Some Nights\\" has much more production work put into the arrangements. It's arguable that a point of contention on \\"Some Nights\\" is the frequently use of the blasted AutoTune on Nate Ruess's vocals--which, in all honesty, can really get annoying, but at the same time is cleverly experimented with and used effectively at times.<br /><br />When I listen to \\"Aim and Ignite\\" the band remind me of Vampire Weekend. When I listen to \\"Some Nights\\" the band remind me of no one, and this is a good thing for them. They seem to be carving out their own unique niche this time around. They hit you hard with a 1-2-3 punch of \\"Some Nights\\", \\"We Are Young\\" and \\"Carry On\\", three of the best pop songs I've heard in a long while. Each carries a distinctive melody, catchy hooks, and lyrics that you can identify with.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things get crazy and shaky after those songs. And unfortunately, you could argue that the album is front loaded as a result.<br /><br />\\"It Gets Better\\" starts off with a jarring, really obnoxious AutoTuned vocal and irritating electronic beats before settling into a nice groove and hooky chorus--an uneven song at best. \\"Why Am I The One\\" brings things back around, but it's not quite as strong as the first three tracks.<br /><br />Then things really get odd with the almost dub-step sounding \\"All Alone\\" which, again, has this very catchy chorus, but the verses aren't that great. \\"All Alright\\" is an oddity with it's depressing lyrics with this exuberant production, and almost uplifting quality to it. \\"One Foot\\" is so irritating with it's repetitive beat and little variation in structure. I think it's my least favorite track and it should have been left off as a b-side.<br /><br />Finally, you arrive at the nearly seven minute \\"Stars\\" which restores the album back to it's original likability. That, followed by the bonus track \\"Out On The Town\\"--one of the best tracks here--in fact, I think you should try programming it right after \\"Carry On\\" and get a four-track punch.<br /><br />So why am I giving \\"Some Nights\\" four stars instead of three or two? Well, the fact remains that the album is pretty good in a bizarre, jagged, and uneven manner, but it somehow works in the end. What I am hoping for with the next release is a refined approach, with more focus spent on capturing the magic of a great pop song like \\"Some Nights\\", \\"We Are Young\\" and \\"Carry On\\". If they can bottle that magic and make a 10 track third album that builds upon \\"Some Nights\\" they could be the next great thing in terms of classic pop music makers with some longevity. They have great potential, let's just harness it next time. \\"Some Nights\\" is a great improvement over \\"Aim and Ignite\\", so give it your best shot gentlemen.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Some Nights\\" compares with \\"Aim and Ignite\\":<br /><br />2009 Aim and Ignite: Three Stars<br />2012 Some Nights: Four Starsikability.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|What can I say about Rush? They've always been my favorite band. I must admit that I've listened to their Music since I first heard Hemispheres in High School. After 1981 they changed their style up a bit and I did not particularly like where they went with it. Moving Pictures was the last album I bought that they put out. That said. Clockwork Angels reminds me very much of the Epic Story telling Rush used to do \\"back in the day.\\" Love this new album. Good to see that Lee, Lifeson and The Master of Percussion Mr. Neil Peart can still rock it.
B004KPLZKA|5.0|this is a really good album. I love Cher and Olly and Ed and 1D so this is my favorite type of music. British Pop. She s such a cutie and this album really reflects her, its amazing
B00000I41J|5.0|The CD came as new as can be after being described as used! The playing of all artists on this Cd is remarkable. Starting with the 1st track you are transported into their world by their consumate intelligent playing and skills. Having Miles Davis as a second rather than the leader allows him to soar.<br />It is a CD which you will play over and over and hear something different each time, such is the beauty of the playing.
B0057B8PT0|5.0|This album is completely amazing, I love it soooooooooo much. I am a huge Directioner and a fan of Olly , Cher Lloyd, and Ed Sheeran. I cannot stop istening to this album it is so good. Honestly, i cannot say enough good things about it.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Works great under Mountain Lion 10.8.1 and BackTrack 5 R3 OTB.  Very pleased, with a 9dbi Omni I pick up over 30 networks around my neighborhood.  Also works great under VMWare running BT5.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the series. I just felt the 2nd book held more of my attention. However, the ending is fablou.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is soo good. I think the characters are the stars of this book. They are all so developed and so different. the story line is so facinating. I litterally couldn't out the book down, I read it all in one sitting! This series is FANTASTIC. Probably my favorite series that I read all summer (and trust me I read a lot! -21 book series!!) I highly recommend this book, and if ur not loving it when u first start it, keep going. It starts off a little slow, but after that it's amazing. I reccommend that u read the WHOLE series not just the first, because the book just keep getting better! Hope this helps!<br /><br />PS- READ IT!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|love this app.  challenging but not impossible. requires some thought but not so much that it becomes frustrating.  hours of enjoyment.  truly enjoyable
B004EI2NM2|5.0|The director of this film was avant garde in his presentation of full nudity.  The film is not a sleazy<br />prono film, but a sexually stimulating and artful presentation of two females choosing to defy moral strictures<br />of propriety in order to delve into a forbidden relationship which provides them with joy and satisfaction.  This<br />is an artful film and not ludicrous or shoddy in any way.  Happily by extending the boundaries of society they<br />develop a sort of love relationship, which is all that could be wished from such an adventure.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|I think it's safe to say Paul Newman helped define the contemporary American male that emerged between WW2 and the androgynous 60's (most of which occurred on  a mass, mainstream level in the 70's).  A transformation that morphed the male ideal to one of feminine beauty.  But in between the laconic, rugged individualist (Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne) and the cute, physically non-threatening boy toy (David Cassidy, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger) was the charismatic outsider (Marlon Brando, James Dean, Paul Newman): beguiling yet dangerous, clean cut yet anti-authoritarian--refusing to give in to the societal polemic that demanded conformity.  And this post-modern male persona, established in many movies (ON THE WATERFRONT, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE to name only three) was perhaps best exemplified in the movie COOL HAND LUKE.<br /><br />  We fall in love with Luke during the opening scene, I think:  The utter stupidity of a grown man, drunk & alone, cutting off heads of parking meters is, well, damn satisfying to watch.  There's something Dostoevskian about it (from NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND: \\"What about the millions of facts that show that men, deliberately and in full knowledge of what their real interests were, spurned them and rushed in a different direction?  They did so at their own risk. . .refusing to follow the safe, well-trodden path and searching for another path, a difficult one, stubbornly working their way along it in the darkness).  And our love of Luke is sealed--after he opens the beer he'll never drink--at the beginning on that beautiful freeze-frame of him laughing at life: her struggles, her injustices, her seeming insistence that we conform, or else.<br /><br />  And that is also why we loved Paul Newman.  He deflected (or more accurately Fast Eddie, Luke, Butch, & Henry Gondorf did) the slings and arrows life through at him with a grin and a twinkle in his eye that couldn't help but win us over to his side.  We are so rooting for Luke to connect with his mother, to escape the chain gang, to achieve the miraculous feat of eating 50 eggs.  And speaking of miracles, you may or may not know that this movie is a retelling of the story of Jesus (complete with disciples, miracles, persecution, doubt, prayer, crucifixion, and resurrection).<br /><br />  The last image we see is of a photo in a magazine Luke had sent the chain gang showing him living the good life.  When they find out the picture is a phony and that Luke is not the man they thought he was, Dragline rips it up.  At the end of the movie, the photo has been resurrected: the repaired rips forming a Cross after faith in Luke has been restored.  But however you chose to interpret COOL HAND LUKE, it is Paul Newman whom we ultimately respond to.  With all the lives he impacted, he was--on & off the screen--one of the quintessential American males of his times.  I mean, think about it.  Is there anything more inconsequential or irrelevant than a movie star?  Has there ever been a movie star more relevant than Paul Newman?  He was a natural born world-shaker.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great story, cleverly written. However I feel as if the ending was rushed. Gillian was tired of writing the book so she gave it a crappy ending. Good read though.
B005MMY5RK|3.0|Good movie of its time. It is somewhat dated now. Connction to the famed publisher has receded into 'ancient' history.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|Purchased for a game on ESPN 3.  Didn't work.  Tried Netflix, YouTube, everything and nothing worked.  Tried hooking it other TVs, nothing worked.  Unfortunately, I didn't try it until after the 30 day return period.  I can not recommend this product.  I guess you get what you pay for...and then not even that.  Off to BestBuy I go to buy a genuine product.  Amazon should be ashamed to let some of these so called \\"retailers/resellers\\" operate under Amazon's good name.

B007KOYEOC|3.0|The 50 Shades Trilogy was a curiosity read for me as it is not normally something I would have bothered reading. I was curious about the hype! I am not into anything sexual or pornographic in literature normally but the writer has cleverly used a very young 22 year old female virgin as her protagonist and it is through her naivety and innocence that the readers learn about her  sycophantic and perverted male antagonist who I believe has serious psychological problems that manifest themselves through his sexual preferences and behaviours.<br /><br />The writer has not so much written a marvellous piece of literature with the style of the renowned modern day authors such as Patricia Cornwall or J K Rollings but she has chosen a subject that piques the curiosity of the average woman living in a stale and cumbersome relationship.<br /><br />Would I recommend it to most women readers? No. Would I recommend it to women who need some kind of stimulous sexually whether it is for their own gratification or for their partner's? Yes.<br /><br />I have decided that this trilogy is not a mind-blowing literal piece, but it hits a mark that will release a stifling mundane normality that exists in marriages in which nothing much has changed for many years in the bedroom, or for the bored younger housewife who may want to explore other possibilities in the bedroom, if they're game or a little 'insane'!
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I really enjoyed going back and forth between the past in the Wilds and the present in NYC.<br /><br />There were several things about the ending that really frustrated me, and I did not like at all, but hey, this is a trilogy. The second book is required to have major cliffhangers, and especially ones that make you unhappy -- there have to be those resolutions in the last book.<br /><br />Not a favorite, but I cannot wait for the last book to come out!
B001PSGF3C|3.0|The movie part was good, but the sound quality could have been better. I had to wear headphones in my ears so I could hear the movie, and I had the volume turned up as well.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I fell in love with this book the moment I started reading it. The first chapter really sets the stage for the tailspin about to take place in Abby Abernathy's life. I can't say too much without giving away key elements to the book so please just trust me and go read it! I just bought Walking Disaster (Travis' POV) on my kindle so I can fully grasp both sides of their epic love story. Can't wait to read it either!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I don't think that it is a master piece, of course. But if you want to read something simple and light. Read it. I cannot say anything else because there's no much to say about it.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl<br />What the reader may miss is that we are all rendered victims of a psychopath by the plot line of this book. Anyone who has ever been taken by a psychopath knows that in the end you are left having been manipulated by a heartless person who needed or wanted something from you and exploited your weaknesses to get it. Only you and the psychopath know the level of deceit they put you through. Likewise only you and the psychopath know that most people will never believe you when you try to explain how deceitful someone was and how gullible you have been. There is rarely a moment when dealing with a psychopath that everyone says, \\"it's a psychopath, let's get'em.\\"  Instead the psychopath either meanders out of your life or you give in and put up with them in your life. This is the plot line of Gone Girl. The entire book is the rising action never coming to a full blown movie-moment when the music swells and we all want to jump from our seats cheering for the protagonist who has decided to take a stand and defeat their foe. Instead, the climax in Gone Girl comes nearly at the end of the book when the protagonist finally makes their decision about what to do. It is an underwhelming moment that leaves the reader feeling let down by the book. Unlike most denouements where the loose ends of the story are tidily wrapped up, Gone Girl's lose ends are left unanswered, unfixed,  and so there is no denouement to the novel. This is a purposeful literary device by the author to make us all victims of her psychopath, mimicking the actual feeling one experiences when a psychopath walks though our lives and pulls one over on us which leaves us hanging in their mist. A mist full of unanswered questions and loose ends that we never get over.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Started quite slowly, then by midway, I was really enjoying the book....but I really didn't like the end.  I like endings to be one way or the other, this was not...
1936608898|5.0|I ran into the authors' website Whole9 Life after going paleo and found their articles and approach very well thought out so getting the book was a no brainer. It goes into the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" your body reacts to certain foods and is information dense so I found myself reading paragraphs several times just to make sure I got what it was saying, which was great for me because I really want to know all this stuff. You don't have to be \\"paleo/primal\\" to appreciate their message of more real food and less processed food equals good health. Just have an open mind to ignore everything you think you know about nutrition, the food pyramid, and a \\"balanced diet\\" and give the Whole30 a chance to change your life.

B00005KK4P|4.0|If you want to hear Schubert symphonies played in classical style, pointing up their inspiration from Beethoven's compositions, I would have no hesitation in recommending this 4 CD set. The orchestra is the Berlin Philharmonic, so they are playing music particularly close to their heart, and the recording by Deutsche Grammophon, although dating mostly from 1972/1973 is crystal clear. A couple of the symphonies were recorded even earlier than that: No.9, the Great C Major, was recorded in 1963 and No.5 in 1966. If therefore you want the very highest fidelity that only the latest recording techniques can provide, this set won't be for you. Personally, my only criticism would be that the performances lack a certain joie de vivre which we are told was part of Schubert's personality. This is especially evident in the `lighter' symphonies, like numbers 2 and 5. I miss something of the spirit of the Austrian landler which to me is essentially Schubert and which I find more evident in the performances by the Dresden Statatskapelle under the direction of Wolfgang Sawallisch. The B&ouml;hm set also contain the Overture and Ballet Music from Rosamunde.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|From all the deliriously enthusiastic reviews I've left here, it should be apparent that Michael Connelly is my favorite living author. I admire his style, because he dispenses with all the artifice and gimmicks of modern novelists and writes in the most plain and basic style possible. There is no detailed description of the landscape or of clothing. He doesn't open with the weather. There are no long interior monologues. The story doesn't jump back-and-forth in time. Best of all, there are &lt;&lt;no similes.>> The story is always stripped to the bone with no garnish. Connelly is so good, that he doesn't *need* any such devices.<br /><br />It so happens that I spent last winter reading old, out-of-print, classic pulp fiction, including the sadly-forgotten [[ASIN:1434464644 Gardner F. Fox.]]  I think that the classic pulp short story is what Connelly is trying for here. With minor changes allowing for period dress or slang, any of these stories could have been printed in [[ASIN:0307455432 The Black Mask]] in the 1920s, `30s or `40s, and they also read very similar to the stories in [[ASIN:B000N9KIIC Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine.]]  They're just basic crime stories.<br /><br />Hard-core votaries of The Black Mask may be upset by my opinion, but I think it's obvious that popular fiction has greatly improved over the years. The whodunits are now known by the lofty term \\"police procedurals,\\" and the best of them are expected to be perfectly realistic. In the days before television and computers, pop fiction was an important medium of home entertainment, and the publishers would print anything in order to have a product on newsstands each month, as long as the story contained some violence and at least one naughty woman. Writers were paid by the word, and some of the stories they churned out were patently awful.  (For those interested in the history of pulp fiction [[ASIN:B0006BR33A The Pulp Jungle]] by pulp author Frank Gruber is an instructive book.)<br /><br />So it is that readers expecting something as serious as [[ASIN:0446582778 Angels Flight]] or [[ASIN:1455518980 The Drop]], books in which social and political issues, personalities and psychological drama are as important as the action or the solution to the crime, may be disappointed by these pulp-grade stories. Connelly's best work rises above the action-thriller or mystery genres, and it's as much the literature of our time as the novels of Charles Dickens were of his. But these stories are not at that level. They're red meat for us pulp guys (and pulp is a guy thing, just as Harlequin Romances are for the distaff side), but this collection is unlikely to win the Man Booker Prize for literature.<br /><br />Another reason Michael Connelly is my favorite novelist is that, more than anyone else, he cares enough to get all the minor details precisely accurate. True, he hires researchers (Dennis Wojciechowski is one) to do the leg work (or mouse work), but there are no howlers (such as in the ghastly novels of Dan Brown) that ruin any sense of realism.<br /><br />Soooo . . . it made me wince to read at the beginning of the first story, Cahoots, that, \\"The game is five-card stud . . .\\" but later in the story, \\"Swain takes no cards . . . Harrington takes three, then Anderson does likewise.\\"  Huh. The last time I played stud poker, they wouldn't let you draw any cards. (Frank Gruber would never have made such a gaff.)<br /><br />It's just pulp fiction, but it only costs as much as a pulp magazine, so I have no complaints.<br /><br />As an added bonus, you also get a hefty portion of the upcoming Harry Bosch novel, [[ASIN:0316069434 The Black Box]]. That may not be a good thing. Connelly's novels have so much momentum that you can't stop reading. A third of a novel is as satisfying as getting a third of a beer, so I regret starting the preview.<br /><br />If you have not yet read them, the short stories of Connelly's [[ASIN:B005SDMDRW Suicide Run]] are in a more modern style, and they all feature Harry Bosch.yle, and they all feature Harry Bosch.

0061245097|5.0|I was already in love with this series and Bones after reading Halfway to the Grave. The second book in the Night Huntress line-up did not disappoint. In fact, I think it topped the first one in some ways. This novel has all of the same elements that made the first one awesome only this one is loaded with even more vampire goodness.<br /><br />Cat and Bones are back with a vengeance in this second installment. After four years apart they're reunited and quickly realize that their feelings for each other are stronger than ever. I was happy that the reunion occurred sooner rather than later. It would have saddened me if I'd had to read half of the book before Bones made an appearance. I would have stuck it out but am relieved that I didn't have to. There are so many terrific lines in this novel that I thought about compiling a list of my favorite quotes. Maybe I'll work on that if I read this book a second time. I don't typically re-read novels but I might make an exception for this series. It's that good!<br /><br />Miss Crawfield is now a full-blown special agent and she commands her own team. Meet Tate, Juan and Cooper. At first I was hoping that Cat would quit her job and team up with Bones again but later found that these men were a great addition to the story. They're pretty badass for humans but in the world of vampires they're chopped liver. Out of the three, Tate is my favorite. He hates the undead more than anything in the world and constantly has to bend his morals to do his job. He refuses to back down from a fight or a challenge and as a result finds himself walking a very thin line between the living and the dead. I think his sarcastic sense of humor is the only thing that gets him through the day at times.<br /><br />There are quite a few jaw dropping moments in this book where Bones demonstrates how truly powerful he really is.  Made me happy that he's on Cat's side otherwise she'd be in big trouble. Hopefully she doesn't get on his bad side as this series progresses. Despite all of her skills and training I don't think she'd stand a chance against her lover. Bones' sense of humour made me laugh out loud at times. Namely the panties revelation that he made to Cat. If she were a real person, the look on her face during this conversation would have been priceless!<br /><br />It would be near impossible to write an accurate review of this novel without dedicating at least a paragraph to talk about the sex. What I want to know is where can I get me my very own vampire orgasm machine!? When I finally arrived at Chapter 32 I had pretty high expectations. Regardless of what they were, this chapter blew them out of the water. Unfortunately for me, I read it before work one morning. What a long day that was! I'm now a believer in that it may very well be one of the hottest encounters ever written! Am I exaggerating? You'll have to read this book to find out! No cheating and skipping ahead like I considered doing. The story and the build-up made it all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />Last but not least, the ending of this book was jam packed with surprises. All of the pieces finally came together and the results left me in awe. Jeaniene Frost is a master storyteller! New tidbits are also introduced to leave the reader wanting more. I'm left wondering what Frost is going to throw at me in At Grave's End. I don't know if she can top this book but I'm definitely going to give her the chance to try.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. The first thing that attracted me to it was the movement of the bubbles in the battery pic, and the color.  The features that I think is most useful is that it tells you (according to your choosing)the amount of time left on your battery, as well as at what level the charge is at when you are charging it. I like when I am on my kindle and distracted by other things, a voice tells me \\"your battery is at 50%\\".  Also you can see at the beginning how much time you have if you are going use the Web,listen to music, view mails. In my opinion this is a good purchase.  No problem with it so far, love everything about it.

B004EPYZZ8|3.0|The film narrates the events prior to the shark attack, the shark attack, and Bethany's struggle to return to the surfing world. We also get to see Bethany visiting a poor Asian country where she discovered that she had more to give to the world, and that there was no reason to give her dream of being a top woman surfer. Stressing on Bethany's trials and seeing her family support her makes it a good inspirational movie for all ages. No doubt that kids of her age may see in it a movie with an optimistic and necessary message. One thing that I liked about it was that in spite of being inspirational, it didn't rely on sentimental tear-jerking scenes. We never feel sorry for her, even when she's struggling to get to the beach after the shark attacks her. On the contrary, we get to see in film the whole process of her pain, her family's pain, eventual emotional recovery, and finally, success.<br /><br />I confess, however, that I liked the book better because it gives you a lot of details about Bethany's parents and her relationship with her brothers, which have a great influence on her courageous nature. Bethany had a lot to say. But maybe I'm being ungenerous considering that films have greater limitations in time than the book form. In spite of it all, the film is Ok for content, message, and good actors who played her and her family.

B001E95ZHY|4.0|In the rocker rainn wilson is a washed up rocker holding on to a dream of being a star and also a person holding onto  a grudge. His enthusiasm is contagious and he is absolutely hilarious. The rest of the cast for the most part is great too. The execption being the whiney singer from the band he joins. And that brings me too my second grievance the music. Now i find this movie to be a much better movie overall than school of rock for instance but i must say that movie had a much better idea of what real rock music is. The music in the rocker is just whiney emo disguised as rock which it certainly is not. That being said i get a lot of enjoyment and laughs out of the rocker and it is a solid comedy well worth watching over and over again.

B0083H6AQA|3.0|I am a fan of quite a few of the actors in this piece, so after hearing about the project development and filming I was excited to finally be able to see the finished product.<br /><br />This was a case where the actors did a phenominal job in delivering believable characters that fit the story line. But unfortunately the final product was lacking due to the film techniques or lack there of and it seemed the cutting room floor should have had a few more pieces lying on it as parts of the film just seemed to drag.<br /><br />I am glad I waited for this on DVD. I will keep it because again I am a fan of Uma Thurman, Mr. Pattinson and Ms. Ricci as well.<br /><br />But when I hold Bel Ami side by side with my Sense & Sensibility, Becoming Jane, Pride & Prejudice... basically my historical film collection, it's sadly in last place.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0080CL0HM Bel Ami]]

B005LAIGF0|4.0|\\"Fargo\\" and \\"Margaret\\" both have plots, of course, but each seems to me to be primarily an extended, self-aware ethnic joke at the expense of its area's stereotypical character and behavior.<br /><br />So you think Margaret is too long, overblown, too loud, in your face, unreasonable, unsympathetic, uncharitable, greedy, screechy, talented, self-absorbed, etc., etc.?  \\"Yawh,\\" as they would say in Fargo.<br /><br />Anyway, Margaret is very well done -- the ensemble and individual acting is fun in an \\"I hate it\\" way.  And its story about teenage adjustment, the futility of trying to deal with guilt by avoidance, and basically about life containing hard knocks and senseless death, is as deep as we see in movies.
B004Z7AHZC|3.0|I found the picture to hit some of the high points of the novel but not enough. That said, it was innocent fun with some lightly amusing moments but nothing in regards to big time humor. Children will probably appreciate it more than adults, well, unless you like goofball and somewhat lame humor.<br /><br />This is basically the life of Greg Heffley who talks about his trials and tribulations and the various family members holding him back in his life. There's a lot of twists and turns and as I already said I think the humor is more for the kids than the adults.<br /><br />The budget for this film was $15M and it made over $75M at the Box Office. Based on a novel of a similar name by Jeff Kinney.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; HUMOR: C to C plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2012.<br /><br />SPOILERS: Anybody else notice that when our star got put in the basement by his brother that he escaped from it with the chubby redheaded kid? Where did his friend come from? Mars?

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|In all fairness, a movie can never encompass all the fine details of a book. This movie seemed to miss some important parts, which are the foundation for the whole story.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was surprised to find this book different from the first two.  It didn't seem to me like Christian was the same person.  He was meaner and I didn't really like it.  Plus this book jumped around so much (time-wise), while the other two did not.  It was unexpected and I suppose I was prepared for another book similar to the other two.

B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I had high expectations for this movie after reading the book. It took me multiple days to get through the 2 hr 23 min film and finally when finished was left disappointed.  I thought for all the hype the casting could have been better and I thought the filming itself left a lot to be desired - at times reminded me of the Blair Witch Project.  Also, the audio wasn't very good, i had to keep turning up my volume to the maximum. Honestly? I thought I wasted my money.

B00846TTDG|5.0|An exceptionally great film. Rivetingly intense; for it's depiction of modern warfare (by any standard). As exceptional as any thing I've ever seen as far as amazing choreography and top notch cinematography is concerned. Story's also quite engrossing; nothing about Act Of Valor smacks of indifference or lack of respect for the subject matter. So far as war movie's go; I'd even say monumental. \\"Nobility grows from contained emotion...\\" (G.Braque)  True to form, this is a soldiers story told, but withholding all (the usual) sappy overtone typically laced into most Hollywood character casts. The pathos of thespians is (almost) absent here and I'm not missing it. Actors who know nothing of the belief systems which propel barrel chested freedom fighters (such as these Navy S.E.A.L.'s) into harms way intent upon showing any enemy a sound defeat, men who train harder than most armies in the world will ever train, drill or fight.    As a tribute to America's S.E.A.L.teams this picture (in my opinion) has done these men (and their families) PROUD. In memorial to these fallen Warriors (and as a token of gratitude to those who still serve); I'd say Act Of Valor stands alone as a crowning achievement of cinematic excellence within the genre. Poignant, enduring, exquisite in it's meticulous detail, uncommonly authentic and accurate in many aspects while still constituting a recognizably fast paced piece of (fictional) entertainment ; although-clearly: 'just a movie' , I'd say Act Of Valor is still pretty much just about as close as your going to get to a front row seat ringside along a 'real life' S.E.A.L. Team (behind the scenes or in action) short of making it through BUDS (training) and shoving off for active duty far-off somewhere 'down range' where the bullets are real. This thing has a pulse of it's own and two boots firmly planted on hallowed ground (straight up and down) front right and center...Five Stars. This is 'the real deal Holyfield'.    One thing I can say withabsolute certainty; the film provoked a strong sense of personal pride in me ...'to be an American' and pride in the S.E.A.L.s themselves, it compelled me to think about the S.E.A.L.Teams (and their families), especially the ones that must live on now without a loved one present; and of the wounded Warriors who's fight to maintain (recover) in dignity is a challenge beyond all comprehension.  To the actors, the film makers, the producers and the writers I'd have to say: 'well done' ...indeed, this is beyond entertainment; 'compelling' is the only word. Spectacular, entertaining, authentic & compelling. Act Of Valor is just that... an act of valor.      [...]
B008QE9VJI|3.0|Like many of Tim Burton's movies, \\"Dark Shadows\\" contains a confused and, at times, inconsistent plot, whose structural integrity cannot withstand the scrutiny of some.  What keeps the movie from being a complete disaster is the director's uncanny sense of character complexity, and compelling, mind burning visuals.  This is not a film whose plotting begs for the type of analysis of Mann's \\"Heat\\" or Hegeland's \\"L.A. Confidential.\\"  It's the product of an acutely artistic mind devoted to fetish, obsession, and aberrant personalities at odds with other aberrant personalities.  Lucky for us, that mind has a bizarre and enthralling sense of humor too!  Disparaging word-of-mouth, combined with a terribly misguided trailer, may have dissuaded many from seeing this little gem, but don't let it stop you from having a good time.  The movie is rife with stunning, atmospheric visuals, and strange, delightful comedy.  \\"Dark Shadows\\" continues Burton's fascination with \\"misunderstood monsters,\\" and here time and a curse have turned Barnabas Collins into an anachronism.  Fine performances by all the pincipals and supporting cast also lend a hand in tethering the rambling story to some form of logic.  I will agree with those who were disappointed the movie didn't take greater pains to polish the script and impart those fine, finishing touches that could have elevated the material beyond its pulpy origins.  But the end result is still a compelling horror fairy tale with wonderful acting, engaging humor, brilliant visuals, and offbeat comedy.  If you view \\"Dark Shadows\\" more as an eccentric, yet beloved, family member, its imperfections and quirks begin to have a spellbinding charm of their own.

076115678X|5.0|I'm a convert! Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey has saved my \\"Hair Life!!\\"  I'm on day 5 of following the Curly Girl method and am so pleased, I gave away my hair dryer and beloved Chi flat iron in addition to tossing out my hairbrush and shampoo!  I have NEVER in my life had such tame, frizz-free, GORGEOUS hair and curls! In fact, this morning at work, an African-American woman asked me how I have achieved such beautiful hair. I told her all about Curly Girl (which is for ALL ethnicities) and the method which is so ridiculously simple.<br />I wish I had known about this years ago, but over the last 30 years, the only information out there for curly hair care was how to FIGHT the curl - how to straighten, relax, blow dry or get the Keratin treatments or Brazillian blow out.  FINALLY, there is someone to teach us all how to care for and love our curls and what NOT to put in our hair.

B0068FYZ84|5.0|I've been upgrading my movie collection to Blu-ray over the last year, and I'm finding some films look great on Blu-ray and others really don't. In the case of Babe, it's a home-run. The picture quality is great, and the film holds up under the magnifying glass, and the audio quality is great. The mouths on the animals and the scenes where puppets are used look fine, so it's quite enjoyable in HD. I even got two digital copy codes and was able to share them with friends. Highly recommended for kids of all ages.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|Am genuinely stunned. Went into this expecting the absolute worst. Cruise has disappointed more often than he's delivered. So when the closing credits rolled - I was speechless. This was absolutely fantastic! Seriously. Just a fun, non-stop, action-pack, well-orchestrated incredible ride. The visual version of a super roller coaster.<br /><br />Believe me, I'm no fan of the man. His antics and questionable mental state are more than just media fodder, but a genuine concern. This kind of aberrant manic mentality and you half expect to hear some version of a building filled with cots, plastic bags and barrels of special Kool-Aid. But the adage learned a long time ago still applies - you have to separate the artist from the art. If you can't, you'll forever cut yourself off from an expanded world; like intentionally blinding yourself for no other reason than selfish indifference and zealotry.<br /><br />Opens with a new team, once again recruited to perform missions that are, if not impossible, so close to it as to be defined as suicidal. We pick up the story from the end of the last film. Ethan Hunt is now in a Russian prison, the reason isn't well known and even his fellow agents have only heard rumors and hushed stories; the truth more complicated than they can imagine. But regardless of his crime, IMF needs their best field agent. Their instructions: Rescue Ethan and give him the single most important mission on the table - prevent Russian nuclear launch codes from reaching the hands of a lunatic who wants to employ them in the name of \\"peace\\".<br /><br />For this mission he's been assigned two others of complimentary skill sets - technical, linguistics, logistics, and communications. As lead agent, Ethan's job is to secure data from the heart of Russian Intelligence - that's the Kremlin. The equivalent mission would be them stealing into and from CIA Headquarters and The White House combined.<br /><br />Problem is that their IMF mission isn't the only operation being conducted. A simultaneous effort is being run. And their mission is to destroy the same Kremlin records - by destroying the Kremlin itself.<br /><br />Yikes.<br /><br />Guess which team succeeds and which one fails?<br /><br />Ethan and his group are branded international terrorists and mass murderers. Not only are they cut-off from official sanction and support - the entire dark operation, every single IMF agent regardless of status, is now disavowed. They don't exist, have never existed, and will never be acknowledged. Their only hope is to hide, now and forever.<br /><br />'Cept of course the movie would end pretty quickly if that's what IMF personnel did when confronted with hopelessness.<br /><br />Can the team uncover the genuine mission and the true reason why their world has been turned upside-down?<br /><br />Mucho props to his new mates - Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, and amazingly - fresh from his first stint as Jason Bourne's replacement and the newest Avenger: Jeremy Renner.<br /><br />It was kind of weird seeing two lead action actors in the same movie. And that's really one of the big reasons this worked so well - the unconventional balance achieved by Cruise by allowing another to share his spotlight. A genuine shocker, it spoke of craft professionalism and a grounded ego. The latter of which I would have never thought to ascribe to the actor. The fresh interplay between the two plays wonderfully and hilariously throughout the film as Ethan recognizes Agent Brandt as his equal.<br /><br />Finally, I was flabbergasted that this is Director Brad Bird's first major movie with live action. Proof - absolute and incontrovertible - that a good director is a good director regardless of medium. It makes no difference whether you're filming people or moving pieces of computer code around, talent will always be talent. And the multitude of excuses some fans make for \\"their\\" directors by defending screen failures will always fall on deaf ears to this cinephile.<br /><br />Movie Notes:<br /><br />- Utterly fantastic seeing Josh Holloway as an IMF agent! No doubt executive producer J.J. Abrams has fond memories of when they worked together on '[[ASIN:B0036EH3WU Lost]]'. Regardless of the connection, I thought Josh looked incredible on the silver screen. I'm hoping his brief, but outstanding performance leads to something better for the man. One of the most under-appreciated actors of his generation.br /><br />Movie Notes:<br /><br />- Utterly fantastic seeing Josh Holloway as an IMF agent! No doubt executive producer J.J.

B00136S0NE|5.0|Saw the Broadway play, then saw the movie.  I have both soundtracks now and I prefer this one.  But both are great for different reasons.
B005LAIHQS|2.0|Worse case scenario and the saddest: The day Will Smith ran out of gas.<br /><br />Didn't think it would happen. Frankly, didn't think it *could* happen. But it has.<br /><br />Hopefully, this is a bump in the road. A flat tire and not complete engine failure, because the man is just too talented to be washed up. On the other hand, I see from IMDb that the majority of his next few projects are all sequels to films he's done in the past. That's generally a bad sign - squeezing the last bit of toothpaste out of a squashed and beaten shell. i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />The story opens with a correct linear timeline: 14 years after MIB2, which in itself is rather telling. Anyway, a nasty alien creep has just escaped from the secret lunar prison. His goal - go back in time and prevent Agent K from deploying a global defense net around Earth. And in doing so, allowing his creepy race to ravage our planet in the future. Agent J's mission is to stop the alien, prevent Agent K's death and thereby saving the world. Yawntastic. Additionally, a touching sidestory and clich&eacute;d plot device, of J finally getting to meet his father; whom he always believed had abandoned him and his mother when he was still a young child.<br /><br />This film reminds me of the recent disaster known as 'Dark Shadows', where another displaced character finds himself immersed in a world he couldn't imagine. And just like that crock pile, there were lost opportunities; not taking full advantage of the fish-out-of-water theme.<br /><br />Boring, boring, boring. No gas, no go.<br /><br />If you've ever seen the recent [[ASIN:B005M2A4D4 Doctor Who]] programs (any of the new Doctors) - that - that's what this franchise so desperately needed. In all seriousness, the producers should have hired the entire Dr. Who creative team, paid them whatever they wanted, and told them to go to work.<br /><br />The only thing that made this movie endurable: Josh Brolin. His incredible spot-on impression of Tommy Lee Jones adding depth and energy into a character that I think has run its full and total course. Nothing left now to resurrect, in any form - ever.<br /><br />Had hoped that, like the fantastic [[ASIN:B004EPYZUS Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol]] and stunning rebooted [[ASIN:B002PMPTIO Star Trek (2009)]], this sequel would be a sparkling new wellspring of ideas and energy, showcasing the franchise in a fresh light.<br /><br />Didn't happen.<br /><br />And just like dour Agent K - Director Barry Sonnenfield has definitely run his course; the past decade has shown that repeatedly and regrettably. If nothing else, Emma Thompson's cringe-worthy 'alien eulogy' ought to prove that beyond any shadow of a doubt.<br /><br />My sincere hope is that Smith finds a new... something. He's done 'cop' to death, every variation, every scenario. Sure, he does the occasional run for an Oscar (which is looking more and more unlikely every year that passes) but the bread-n-butter material is desperately needed at this point. Some new vein of movie gold he can really dig into.Lee Jones adding depth and energy into a character that I think has run its full and total course.

B003VANOFY|4.0|Great gaming headset. I use headphones for both gaming and music, so I was concerned about sound quality. No issues there at all, sound is very solid from juicy bass all the way to the highs.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- great sound quality, especially for a wireless headset<br />- very decent mic, people say my voice is finally coming across loud and clear<br />- volume control and mic mute are well-designed and work great<br />- play/pause/next buttons are an excellent addition that allows to listen to music without even being in front of computer<br />- good battery life (they claim 10 hours - I didn't test for more than 5 hours straight but for me it's enough)<br />- seamless operation when plugged in (so if you're out of juice, that's no big deal)<br />- standard mini-USB jack<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- relatively heavy (unavoidable with batteries I guess)<br />- leatherette headband and earbands are rather rigid, people wearing glasses may have issues<br />- they don't auto-sleep, so if you forget to plug them in after a gaming session they will discharge<br /><br />All in all, great product, I love it. I do get a bit tired after a few hours of gaming, but I think that's just the way it is (until they invent some magical weightless batteries).
B008CP93S0|2.0|While there are some extremely funny scenes, there's a lot of content that's just so horribly put together. If you do choose to view this, fast-forward through the scene where George starts talking to himself in the bathroom mirror. It's a never-ending scene of him saying things like \\"I'm gonna f*** the s*** out of you\\", \\"I'm gonna f*** you\\" and ON AND ON in different STUPID voices. (It's not the language, it's the STUPID voices that I hated.)I think that was just the most painful scene of all,as it was just BEYOND horribly awful, and went on forever. Who writes crap like this?<br /><br />The movie is very disjointed- the \\"plot\\" doesn't have a good flow. Some parts were very entertaining, most of it was really weird (but who'd expect anything other than weird with a plot centered around a hippie like commune?)- and a LOT of the weird was REALLY LAME.<br /><br />I wish we'd have gone with a different movie.

B000XXI8G2|5.0|Definitely a boot worth buying! Although what some of the other reviews say is true about the boot running a little big i took the advice and ordered a half size smaller than my regular size and they fit perfectly! The boot is very well made, a beautiful dark brown color with some fading that just makes the boot look that much more stylish. A great boot for going out or hiking although if using them for hiking and such, I would recommend an insert for added comfort. All in all, I am VERY pleased with my purchase!
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Dystopian societies are big these days in literature and I have read my share of books on the subject. But nothing had prepared me for the horror waiting in the alternate 1970s England where Never Let Me Go takes place.<br /><br />The idea of raising (growing is a more likely description of the process) children with the only purpose of harvesting their organs is repulsive. And yet in this world, apparently, nobody questions the morality of doing so because these children are not thought to have a soul.<br /><br />Because we are introduced to the children singing and attending classes and playing in their bucolic British boarding school, behaving in every way as children do, before being told (early in the movie, so this is not a big spoiler) what their purpose is, the revelation is shocking. For us, that is.<br /><br />But the teachers, except one who is quickly fired, don't question this. Neither do the children. They believe what they are told, whether this be that if they run after a ball beyond the school boundaries their hands and feet will be cut off or that, when they are in their twenties, they are to give their organs to others as needed.<br /><br />The movie does not question whether this is acceptable, but follows Kathy, Tommy and Ruth first as children, then as teens. Kathy who tells the story is not bitter, or angry and doesn't, even once, rebels against her fate.<br /><br />I was stunned.<br /><br />What kind of society is this that sees children as parts and believe they don't have a soul?<br /><br />And yet...<br /><br />It wasn't so long ago that Freud and his pals argued that women did not have souls. Not so long ago that Hitler sent Jews to extermination camps, that slavery was allowed and people of color sold and treated like animals.<br /><br />So maybe this story is not so farfetched. Which makes it even more horrifying.<br /><br />Are we humans really this cluelessly cruel?<br /><br />Never Let Me Go is a breathtakingly beautiful movie and, despite or maybe because its harrowing subject, life affirming.<br /><br />P.S. Never Let Me Go is based in the book of the same title by Kazuo Ishiguro

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I am not going to repeat what so many reviewers have previously said. What moved me was the music and the arrangments. Paul is surrounded by a cast of stellar musicians. If you know anything about jazz the names Diana Krall and John Pitzerelli are not new to you. Both musicians play tastefully, do not try to over power the vocals and lend needed support. Other guests such as Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton and Joe Walsh do the same. The music is easy to listen to, has beautiful melodies and Paul's voice suits the music perfectly. If you want to hear a great interpretation of old standards buy the album. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This movie was fantastic- it's Victorian era intrigue, action, and espionage for the common man. It's a fun, humorous romp that manages to stay entertaining and engaging for its two hour run time, something many modern films struggle to pull off.<br /><br />Although some people will be dismayed by the slick style of film editing, featuring plenty of slow motion and \\"edgy\\" cuts (a signature of director Guy Ritchie), I thought it worked very well with the rich cinematography (and it looked great on Blu-ray). I'm no expert on the period of the story, but to my eye, the movie portrayed a very convincing setting. The wardrobes, brick buildings, cobblestone streets, and perpetual soot transported me to a different time and place.<br /><br />The chemistry between all the actors is outstanding- particularly Downey (Holmes) and Law (Watson), who were both brilliantly cast for this iconic duo (just as they were in the previous movie). It's great to see their strange friendship on the screen, as they exchange quips and wry observations, putting their quirky personalities on full display. Also of note is the marvelous performance by Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty. His interactions with Holmes are superbly played by both actors, perfectly conveying the competition between their genius intellects and conflicting world views. The climax of their intellectual battle is one of the most enjoyable finishes I've seen in any movie of recent memory. It's complex, riveting, multi-layered, and extremely satisfying.<br /><br />I give this movie five stars, with particular appreciation for the efforts of Downey, Law, and Harris. A good way to spend a Friday night, laughing with friends!
B007MAETA8|5.0|Simply put, this is a great album. Mayer moved to Bozeman, Montana (ahem, where I happen to live), and the environment has made his already superb musicality even better, like aging a wonderful highland single malt scotch another ten years. He's reached back in time for influences from the best of the early days of rock/folk/blues and reinterpreted it forward. He's always been a musical chameleon, bouncing perfectly from rock to pop to well worn blues, his tour de force into this reach of music should be no surprise -- except for how long it took him to do so.<br /><br />This album is warm, personal, and evocative. A warm hug when you need it, a quiet chat with a good friend you don't see enough, or that honesty that comes with a long deep love that you suddenly realize will weather anything.<br /><br />So many reviews of Mayer's music talk about what it means in relation to his life. Who cares. We listen to music for how it reflects on the life of the listener. The music does this no less well than his great lyrics.<br /><br />I love his earlier albums from all over the musical spectrum. This may be his best yet. I hope Montana continues to give him what he evidently seems to have needed.

Sorry to give it such a bad review, but it simply is 100% useless for me without that separate component that IT needs.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Imagine that you are in your late seventies, and - although you had a rich career as an English teacher - you have only a superficial concept of what the Newbery Medal is, probably because most of your teaching experience has involved senior high school students.<br /><br />Your son, himself a teacher of sixth graders, is discussing THE GIVER with you, sharing the enthusiasm of both him and his students for the novel.  In order to introduce you to his world of children's literature, he orders a copy for you.  Your daughter reinforces his sentiments, going so far as to lay claim that she and her family (all discriminating readers) thoroughly enjoyed the novel.<br /><br />Amazon downloads your Kindle copy.  You are intrigued by the countless memories of a lifetime carved in the face of the old bearded man on the cover.  You begin to read.<br /><br />Having recently joined an audio book club, you realize instantly that this is a book better appreciated through a visual absorption.  Some common words are capitalized, for example, and this distinction would be lost in a narrator's presentation.  Also, as language itself is extremely important in the book's community - the children always being corrected if they do not use the most accurate words possible - the typography (ellipses and italics come to mind) is crucial, and a case can be made for the value of visual as opposed to aural.<br /><br />It's a slow start.  The unidentified aircraft seems out of place in the December sky, and it quickly loses significance as part of the necessary exposition.  As the characters, and environmental, sociological, cultural, and governmental functions are revealed, you wonder when the action begins.  Too many bicycles neatly placed in their designated ports, too much repetition, so many meals eaten at precise times with no mention of what is being eaten, endless references to routine and sameness, and always community, community, community.  A disturbing sense of ennui skitters acrossyour mind.  Why all the accolades for THE GIVER?<br /><br />Continue imagining that you are committed to completing the book for the sake of respecting your children, although it does occur to you that father, children, and grandchildren are not on the same page ... or even in the same book.  On and on it trudges.  No chapter titles - just a red 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ...<br /><br />Seven, or the end of seven to be more word explicit, is where the action begins. The author suddenly jolts you into the so-called \\"rising action.\\"  Finally it has begun, and - in spite of your age - you are pulled into the world of children's literature and a darned good story about an age of dystopia.<br /><br />You run a literary marathon and finish the rest of the book without stopping.  Your son said it would be like this, and it's nice that you continue to respect his intelligence, but you're not too certain of the reliability of your own.  You really didn't give Lois Lowry or her book or her talent a chance.  To be fair, you should have reread the first few chapters before continuing.<br /><br />But something's not right.  You liked the book, and were caught up in the terrible truths of the community, and were right there with Jonas and little Gabe through the final chapters.  Yet a certain satisfaction is missing.  You almost feel like saying, \\"So?  It was good, but I've read better books.\\"<br /><br />Imagine then the memory of a bruised ego.  You're a retired teacher, for crying out loud ... sort of a Giver yourself.  To save what you can of self-respect and stave off complete humiliation (your son said, \\"Can't wait to talk about it!\\"), you do a computer search, checking out Wikipedia and a few good book review sites.  And you make sure that your paucity of the Newbery Award is rectified.  You even reread the opening chapters, which, of course, at this point changes your entire perception of the novel.<br /><br />THE GIVER deserves the Newbery, and probably more, if for no other reason than the claim that its underlying theme - the giving and receiving of love- is the key to finding true happiness in this life.  Even though the book burners have managed to establish this book as inappropriate for young readers (according to the American Library Association's list of the most \\"challenged\\" books of the 1990s), THE GIVER continues to remain on countless other lists - those of middle school suggested reading titles. The book is taught even in higher level grades.<br /><br />Maybe it's good to stay in your own community and be happy in your own ignorance... sometimes.<br /><br />But just imagine if ...
B002BU0DPE|2.0|As many others have stated the plastic swivel piece is highly fragile and has broken. While I am not cautious and careful with my headset to the tune of having OCD about them I do like to think I take good care of them and have a spot for them when they are not in use that is out of harms way and I have yet to drop them. I believe they have just broken due to normal wear and tear and sadly for a product of this price I do expect them to last a little longer than just over four months. If there was an improvement to the swivel say some aluminium or a more durable plastic I would certainly get a replacement but as it stands I'm looking for a refund. Noticed giant fractures in the swivel piece when for the past few days I just couldn't seem to get the Headset to fit the way I liked and it used to fit.  EDIT: After getting them warrantied they have broken in exactly the same place as the last pair.  My advice is to just buy something that looks more durable in the swivel joint area.  They tend to cut out some and give feedback as well on occasion.  I babied this pair even more than the last almost to the point of ridiculousness and they developed stress fractures and the left cuff has all but fallen off, I decided to just let the one year warranty run out and suck it up and purchase a more durable pair.  Only saving grace was that the return process went fairly smooth and they are very comfortable and sound good until they start to break between 3-6 months.
1469984202|4.0|If you're nostalgic for Cold War-era science fiction, Wool feels like a throwback to some of the themes common to that time, but with 2011 sensibilities. The story takes places generations after some forgotten apocalypse has made the Earth's surface uninhabitable. The only population of human beings left dwells in an immense underground bunker/biosphere complex known as \\"The Silo\\". The first episode in the omnibus sets up the world with the story of a man sentenced to death for making a certain forbidden statement and banished to the surface. As his last act of public penance, he is expected to clean the lenses of the cameras that look out over the wasted landscape. Why, he wonders, have all the previously condemned voluntarily complied with this request? Of course, there are things he hasn't been told...<br /><br />The remaining \\"episodes\\" work more as a single novel, developing other character POVs and revealing the workings, history, and politics of the Silo in more depth. The writing is a little amateurish, but I quite enjoyed the story, which could easily work as a short TV series. Howey sets up some interesting mysteries and relatable (if not very sophisticated) characters. The setting reminded me a little of the TV show Battlestar Galactica, with much of the action taking place in tight, spaceship-like confines, and with an adversarial character that's arrogant and devious, but not without his own concern for the greater good. If certain aspects of the Silo require a little suspension of disbelief, most of it is well thought-out.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last chapters of the story feel rushed and lapse into predictability, but, other than that misstep, it's a successful example of self-publishing's potential to give voice to fresh ideas (or, in this case, an old idea done freshly). For those hooked, Howey leaves plenty of questions for future entries to explore.<br /><br />On the audiobook production, I wonder if Minnie Goode was auditioned in a hurry, because her narration is simply a bad fit. She overdoes makes some of the character voices and inserts sighs and chuckles in an irritating way. And, dear audiobook narrators, for the love of God, stop trying to do \\"adorable\\" children's voices -- it's like an icepick in my ears. Still, the worst offenses are infrequent enough that they didn't ruin my overall experience. I wouldn't necessarily let negative reviews of the narration discourage you from a listen, though some readers will undoubtedly prefer a written copy.<br /><br />(Another thanks to Luke at the Sci-Fi Book Review Podcast for the recommendation)

B008QDCZJ2|2.0|Exceptionally clean, crisp and clear. Elegant, meticulous, and polished above and beyond the hilt. But, as any fan who's spent the last 30 years dancing along side the Boys can tell you, absolutely not the norm.<br /><br />I suspected it as soon as i heard Invisible. I was certain of it the moment I heard Winner. And now the cat's out of the bag, the follow-up to Pandemonium is Pet Shop Boys: The Lounge Act, and it seems we've evolved from bonus tracks and elaborate mixes to instrumental versions.<br /><br />C'mon Boys! Grab me, pull me back onto the dance floor and keep me going 'til dawn. Don't leave me feeling as though I've just endured an exhausting elevator ride. You're not that old. I'm not that old. Yet.<br /><br />I may revisit this album someday... but not today.

The only thing I don't like is that the ads could be more appropriate for an alarm. Do you really think I want to watch a video about a political campaign at 4 AM? You could maybe suggest a dunkin coffee or even an excedrine some days. Advertisers, consider this a missed opportunity.

0385342063|4.0|Okay, Sophie Kinsella's books aren't challenging reads. But they are optimistic indulgences. And no matter how dark the world looks from climate change to the world's economy, books like I've Got Your Number help our weary loads.<br /><br />This novel is no exception. Kinsella creates a plot, and yes she sets up anticipation as to how the conflicts will be resolved, but I still enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />In this book, her main character Poppy does what so many young women do: she ignores her fianc&eacute;'s faults in order to walk down the aisle in a glorious gown to become someone's wife -- even though her gut warns her that all may not be right.<br /><br />I enjoyed the mishaps with mobile phones, Sam's business battles, the lost emerald ring, and the contemporary themes that run through this novel. As in: is the pretty girl you work with after your fianc&eacute;? Are your future in-laws going to make your life hell? Is your intended worth all the trouble? And, is there someone out there who might be better for you? In this case, there is and his name is Sam. In this fast-paced romp, Sam seems so in charge and manly next to Magnus that we're rooting for Poppy to see he's her best bet in the long run.<br /><br />If you like a fast, enjoyable read, indulge in this one.
0374275637|5.0|Thinking Fast and Slow is an extended statement of Kahneman's (and others') research on the psychology of decision making. There is little new here - many social scientists will already be familiar with most of the content - but it is an excellent summary of his life's work and an enjoyable read. Kahneman describes many of the experiments that produced the findings he discusses, and some of the more critical reviews on here either criticize the book for being tedious as a result or criticize Kahneman's arguments for being based on mere anecdotes. I disagree on both points. Kahneman's discussion of past experiments, and his personal anecdotes, make the book a fun read that will appeal to a wide audience. There are many excellent and detailed reviews already posted, so I will just cut to the chase: this is a fascinating, accessible, and rewarding book that is well worth the effort.

But it is typical in the sense that once you start it, you will not want to put it down. A great glimpse back into the 60's, especially for those of us that remember that infamous day. Highly recommend it.

I haven't completed all the levels yet, but so far so good. If you took Statics in college, you know what this is about, but without all the math!
0894803123|5.0|Its Ben and Jerry's story filled with Ben and Jerry's ice cream recipes.  That pretty much sums it up!  I have made the French vanilla ice cream so many times that I have it memorized.  I also strongly recommend the banana ice cream!  Serve the banana ice cream with roasted, salted chopped almonds and caramel sauce!  The caramel sauce recipe is included in the book and it is delicious!  I dream about homemade ice cream now!

This book shows the weakness of sinful flesh, the love of family, and the grace and mercy of God, that tears down the strongholds of the enemy.If you read one book this year, read this one, you will not be disappointed. I had a hard time holding back the tears !!
1878424319|3.0|Just bought this and read a few pages through the domestication section and I'm just annoyed. I didnt feel that way at all growing up or now. My dad was a deacon and I was forced into ccd classes and I never believed in any of it and constantly challenged the idea of the beliefs all through as young as grade school ages. Also I don't like how there the author just goes on and on about how things are without any scientific / concrete ties. Eh idk if I want to finish. Kind of want my money back. \\"the book taboos on knowing yourself\\" was much much better. (\\"oo\\" in \\"book\\" are actually infinity symbol). Did anyone else think anything like this?
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple platform, good graphics, runs smoothly. The music is very relaxing. A therapeutic game to play to say the least, as well as entertaining.
0375842209|5.0|This book is beautiful.  Beautifully written.  I have always been fascinated by WWII and the holocaust, and this is a different sort of read about that time period.  This one is written about Germans who care, and I loved it.  Thank you, Markus Zusak!
0062206281|4.0|There are many very articulate reviews on this book here so I'll leave them to the details of the novel. Just two comments I'd like to make. First, although this is billed as a stand alone novel, it isn't. It ties together his prior two novels (both excellent)& you'll miss a lot if you haven't read them.... start with the best one, \\"Shadow of the wind\\". And second, this book is far too short... it's almost a novela.There is a lot of meat in the book that could have been developed further. And it ends with an obvious setup for the next novel. I'd preferred perhaps a combining of this & the yet-to-come sequel into a proper 400-500 page novel.  Overall, an excellent read if you're into this series.
B008602KQI|5.0|It's hard to make a movie from an excellent book. This movie included enough important pieces from the books and was still great in itself. I hope it inspires anybody to read the books in this trilogy.
B006S3GKEI|5.0|I currently have three versions of The Moonstone and this is the one I prefer. Though it has a modern cover, the scan of the original bound book is included. The text is formatted for reading on the original Kindle Fire and the original illustrations are in position appropriate to the text. My only complaint is that the illustrations were not scanned at higher resolution and cannot be enlarged for better viewing.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is pretty much identical to the apple game nobody could ask for more from a free game. still one of the most fun games I have
B0018J8CEI|5.0|One of the most enjoyable shows I've ever seen. Running in the \\"Hitchcock\\" vain, this series brings all of the classical philosophical and psychological insights on the subjects of death, fear, sex, and personal relationships into a sharp, postmodern entertainment, focus.
0393072231|5.0|If you are even moderately interested in business or finance or the economy or the crash or anything you should really be reading this book.  Its fantastic.
B00004U45G|5.0|This cd was a bust on the internet only site due to not a lot of people were hip to the net as they are now. Then it got picked up by a actual label... a tour was set in motion..they were set for an appearance on the Tonight show to kick off the tour, and then Jimmy Page hurt his back and the tour was scrapped and the label did nothing to promote it. The Rock and Roll Gods gave us this amazing gift..play it LOUD ( of course) and enjoy.
B0025T1NAA|5.0|The way the show is able to transition season to season, keeping the core yet still having new material, is mind boggling. You watch an episode, you might think, \\"meh\\", but give it a chance and it sticks with you.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|I love the direction this film takes in telling a much darker version of the Snow White tale.  The production values are top notch and it looks fantastic.  Charlize Theron is outstanding as the wicked stepmother.  The back story she's given to justify her actions made her three dimensional and far more than a stock fairytale character.  The story also takes some terrific new directions and twists while still staying loyal to the original story, particulary in regard to how the dwarves come into play, how Snow is ultimately presented with the poisoned apple and the magical kiss she receives near the end.  These were terrific new twists and I loved where the story was going...but it just didn't seem to go far enough.<br /><br />There's a huge problem with pacing.  An enormous section lags in the middle when Snow and the Huntsman are wandering through the woods.  This seems to go on FOREVER, while the most interesting character, the queen is off-screen for FAR too long.  While Hemsworth is terrific and perfectly cast in his role, he's given virtually nothing to do but be Snow's chaperone through the whole story.  He's a great actor, and his character is given a solid backstory but it's never fully implemented into the plot.  Likewise, we're led to believe the Huntsman and Snow have developed a certain depth to their relationship by the end but there is absolutely NO evidence to support this change of heart.  Nothing.  The prince of the kindgom, overthrown by the wicked queen, is also trying to find Snow in the woods.  He loved her in his childhood and is desperately trying to locate her.  There was a TERRIFIC opportunity here to create a love triangle between the prince, huntsman and Snow that was completely ignored.<br /><br />Lastly, the biggest drawback of the film is Stewart.  Everything this girl does is delivered in a deadpan, disaffected tone with eyes hanging at half-staff.  She is so flat on screen and exudes ZERO energy that the times she's on screen (85% ofthe time), the move's momentum grinds to a hault.  It's VERY difficult to watch her and stay engaged because it seems, she's not either.<br /><br />Having said that, I'd still recommend it for the clever twists, Theron and Hemsworth's performances and some of the most gorgeous productions values I've seen in quite a while.  I loved where this film was headed but it seemed that the screenplay needed a couple of more drafts, a tightening of the story and more character development.  It's like they went ahead and filmed a first draft script.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Its a great search engine, downloader, and converter for videos and music! I love the choices that are given on how to view your search as either view or download a video, download it as MP3, or even watch in HD!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Don't listen to the critics.  I've my own ideas as to why they trashed this movie but ignore their hating, or you'll miss a pretty great movie.  Yes, the movie is a little over-long but the plot is straight forward and the effects are excellent.  Disney is notorious for being cheap in the effects department but I was constantly surprised for two hours how high-end the production values were.  I don't think I've ever seen a Disney film that was this grand and on such large a scale.  It's definitely a sweeping epic.<br /><br />The best part about this film is it's deeper message.  It's not just about a guy who ends up on Mars and falls in love with a princess.  Not by a LONG shot.  In fact, the message is almost spoken word-for-word by the villian of the story.  This movie is really a wakeup call for everyone on earth today.  It's symbolic of what's happening on our own planet right NOW.  Clandestine persons or parties instigate wars to further their own agenda.  They don't actually fight the wars.  They just \\"manage\\" them, as was said in the film.  This cycle of war and causing divisions among groups within a civilization makes them easier to manipulate and facilitates the takeover of their lives and planet.  THAT's what this movie is really about and what we all need to pay attention to at this moment in time.  It's amazing that the book was written 100 years ago.  Burroghs must have been able to foresee the future.<br /><br />My only complaint would be Taylor Kitsch.  He's very pretty to look at, but I wish he had more range as an actor rather than \\"hot looking brute\\".  Highly recommended for all of the above but especially for the message.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be at this concert with friends in Mexico City. It was simply brilliant! The quality of the music and of the musicians superb. I don't think I had ever seen so much talent assembled together on a stage before. It was almost surreal. Now I am fortunate enough to have it recorded for posterity.<br /><br />10/7/2012 - As much as I love Amazon.com I had to order the european version that comes with the double CD, the DVD, the Blu-ray, and a booklet with pictures of the concert. For some reason it is not available in the US. I'm sure all versions are fine; the concert was recorded exactly as I remember it; with the added advantage of the multiple angles captured by the direction and editing of Lasse Hoile. I remember seeing only a camera or two during the concert so I was impressed by the quality of the picture and the array of different takes from the stage and from the audience. I could see myself and my friends on a few takes and I wasn't even aware we were being filmed from the stage. The sound is magnificent; especially if you have a good 5.1 dts system. The mix by Steven is superb... as usual.<br /><br />Yes, I was very fortunate to be there and to have \\"get all you deserve\\" to re-live over and over again.
B004XONU8I|5.0|I love how this show keeps you coming back for more. This episode is the first time Peter try's to enter the machine.
B008602KQI|5.0|It followed the book closely and was an excellent movie with lots of action and interesting characters.  Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as the lead
B0014NDXGA|5.0|The Tour V2 has fully lived up to my expectations and other reviews. It is easy to use (even for older, shakier hands), very fast and seems very accurate. It gives great confidence in selecting the correct club; if only my swing were as reliable. Only glitch was that Amazon did not include a receipt with the shipped product.
0345529057|5.0|I enjoyed the first two seasons of the mini-series on HBO.  A friend said the books were better so I read the books too.  The TV series cut much of the story.  Especially battle scenes and more fantastical details.  The battle scenes are very large and complicated in the book.  It would have taken a Titanic sized budget to put them on film.  Main themes in the books are fantastical with characters having more beyond human powers.  Hints are in the TV series but it really helps to have read the books to know what is going on.  Some parts of Dany, Arrya and Theon's stories are radically different on TV.  The Stark children have much stronger characters in print.  Even some of Tyrion's best scenes were left out of the TV story.  A few good characters were left out of the film version.  The book is much more explicit than the film; even for a TV-MA rating.  These are not books for young children.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Like one and two much better. This one was just short of lukewarm. Just did not have the zip of the other two.
0375507256|2.0|This was the best book I read in 2004.  I still think of it.<br /><br />While some parts are clearly better than others, and it is quite \\"experimental\\" in its layout, I loved it.  The best parts were the dystopian future Korean world of Somni 451 and the post-apocalyptic world of Hawaii.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I love Bones and I needed to catch up from this past season so that I was ready for the season 8 that's starting soon. Amazon's Instant video area was very easy to use and understand.
B005CAAU76|5.0|I won't dwell too much on the content, except to say that this has always been one of my favorite Queen albums.  Many fans will disagree, but consider this in the arc of their career.  At this point, they had nothing to prove, but there was still much to be mined in the veins they had explored before.  Does anyone really think the world would be better off without \\"Fat Bottomed Girls,\\" \\"Bicycle Race,\\" or \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\"?<br /><br />The sound!!!!! I have owned this album in various incarnations, most recently as part of the Crown Jewels box set.  There is simply no comparison.  This is by far the best this album has ever sounded.  The timbre of the various tom toms, the sheen of the cymbals, the instrument placement in the mix, all with Freddie Mercury's voice soaring over it all.  And then there are the harmonies.  Oh, and the volume and punch are indeed kicked up a notch without going into clipping.  Right now, I'm listening to this album over a Grado RS-2i/RA-1 headphone setup -- which is of more than sufficiently high resolution to reveal mediocre recordings -- and it's literally like having the band in my head.  Highly recommended.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Sharp Objects was so sick and twisted and I could not put it down!I love the way Gillian Flynn writes...she is brilliant so I went on to read her other novels as well with the same enthusiasm.  She is amazing and this is such a great escape read!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very fun and simple time waster. Perfect for wasting a couple of hours or clearing your mind. Takes a little time to master but it's worth it
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wonderful book, although there are some words that are outdated, and therefore difficult to understand.  Hugo also gives lengthy descriptions, including character analysis, the times, etc. Besides having a great plot and sub-plots, I learned a bit of history.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have always loved Pinterest. It's an amazing site. But when I switched over to using my kindle more, I found that I hated pinterest's mobile website. Their app however, is 100% better. I absolutely love it! If you are a pinner (or debating), get this app!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|[[ASIN:0345803507 Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /><br />After reading book one, I too, was skeptical...was this just sex? And more sex? Or was there a story lurking underneath all the physical drama...and forward on to books two and three to dsicover a sweet story.<br />The story bears hearing...and the physicial interludes while detailed became repetitive by book three.<br />I did however enjoy seeing the characters unfold and become real.<br />Thank you Book Three for fulfilling my quest for the 'story'.
B00170MYIS|4.0|The battery arrived in very convincing packaging with a little Sony hologram.  The battery says it is a info lithium.  However, when I insert it into my HDR-GW77V (a very new sony camera), I am not seeing a numbered percentage.  Instead, I see three bars indicating the charge.<br /><br />This may or may not be a true FG1.  At worst, it appears to be a BG1 disguised as an FG1.  Either way, it is working at the moment and was cheaper than Sony's prices for a BG! or FG1.<br /><br />I say go ahead, unless you MUST have a FG1.  If that is the case, go direct to sony for your 100% confidence (at a higher cost, of course)
1936608898|5.0|Best book I have ever read. Definitely changed my life and my relationship with food. I have broken through barriers I couldn't get through and feel so much better. I loaned the book out a few times and have several friends starting the journey as well. I will never go back to my 'old way ' of eating... I wish everyone would read this book!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|the game is alot of fun and I absolutely love it. u should get the game u wont regret it. u get to complete missions, buy gadgets with coins u earn in the game, ride in vehicles, collect coins,  and dodge laser beams and missels. get the game its all free
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|could have used a little more action, but it probably scores big with the middle to high school group. I didn't read the books so I am sure I missed a lot of filler that would have been helpful to the movie.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|Re-Animator is one of my favorite horror classics. I have owned this on several home video formats since Laserdisc back in the day from Elite. So I have witnessed MANY video transformations of this film. And the blu ray does the film (with all its reds) justice. We must remember this is a low budget film and not produced by a major studio so its not going to be \\"crystal clear\\" like we expect from blu ray. I prefer these movies looking like movies and NOT video. Yeah the image isn't razor sharp like Avatar, but look at the film stock and the time this was filmed. I just wished Image would have at least cleaned up the specks and dirt on this print they used. But it does give the film its low budget quality. This film will always be difficult to transfer to video because of the original film stock (like MANY films from the '80s). As far as the sound, Image does not include the original mono mix but used the re-mixed 5.1 sound in the DTS-HD domain. This is pretty much a three channel mix to my ears (and speakers). All the special features look to be re-treads from past DVD releases. It is nice to have all of them and the film on one disc.<br />It's your call if you want to \\"upgrade\\" your DVD version of Re-Animator to blu ray (how big a fan are you?). Because this blu ray isn't a night and day comparison between the formats. What's on this blu ray is probably the way the film is intended to be seen, which isn't razor sharp while still looking pretty darn good.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I'm going to buck a trend here. I think the writing and editing of this book are appalling. A non-professional writer trusts an editor to fix small inconsistencies and errors that are natural in speech, but glaring to careful readers.  The text is rife with punctuation errors, lapses in logic and factual sloppiness. A tiny example from chapter one: Owen wears sixty pounds of armour, and \\"every gram\\" counts. Don't we use ounces?  It's an easy slip to make, but the editor's job is to catch small inconsistencies that detract from the text.<br /><br />I sincerely respect the sacrifice of soldiers who put their lives on the line for their ideals. Sadly, I do not think the assurances in the introduction that national security was not compromised are justified. Moreover, the criticisms of the commander-in-chief, no matter how valid, are not appropriate in a work of non-fiction without better support, and are unbefitting a soldier in a time of war.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this in a bookstore. No Easy Day was written in haste, edited by an amateur and published with minimal scrutiny. I'm shocked by Penguin.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|What can I say I love Stevie Nicks for lots of reason. One she has a beautiful voice and see seems to be such a carefree women. Two for my sister Elizabeth that is gone now, was one of her favorite artist. Stevie can bring happiness to my face or tears to my eyes.
B000VZYXPC|5.0|Sam's town is one of those rare albums that I can play start to finish. Read My Mind still hits me like it did the first time I heard it. Kudos Killers, one day I'll catch you on tour!
B008KOMMTA|5.0|This is not a chick flick.  I know the stigma of this movie.  People believe that this movie is just a simple love story of two who happened to be on the wrong boat.  It has so much more character than that, it has great narration with a good story arch and some of the best performances by wonderful actors with a fantastic cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio seperates himself as a great lonesome kid ready to start fresh going back to his roots while Kate Winslet is terrific as a girl placed in a world she longs to depart.  Though they have great chemistry, they are not the best performances as Kathy Bates and Billy Zane are two side characters with spit fire personality and strong presence on screen. Overall the only negative I could imagine is that if you don't enjoy long films, overly romantic themes, or a predictable ending *spoiler* (the boat hits and ice berg and sinks) you should the movie either mildly enjoyable or extremely worth every minute of your time.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the game its simple with really pretty photos. I've only had the game for a few days so I'm still learning the ins and outs.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|Very well done series with a good story and a better premise, the only thing to hold it back from absolute perfection is the times when scenes feel a little dragged and the last few episodes are a little random.  Everyone who is casted feels like the character created, from the comic or not, was written for their part.  I won't bore you with the details of every single character, but I will say you will have some opinion or feeling for everyone.  No one is just a bump on the log, just joining the ride.  Overall I recommend the season just so you can learn the grooves of the show so you can get into season 2. That is where everything is perfected but here is a good example of something good that builds the steps to something unbelievable.
B008602KQI|5.0|the movie might not have gotten all the scenes perfectly right, it might not have made all the parts you hoped you'd get to see but it caught the feeling of the books which goes beyond every other disappointment. its one of my favorite book adaptations.
034580404X|5.0|I also loved this series and was sad it ended. I couldn't put it down.  I loved Ana's inner goddess who gave her the courage to pursue Christian and find out who he really was.  I think Ana acted exactly like a 22 year old virgin would and don't understand others who say she was juvenile.  I also would love to read this story from Christian's side!! Now trying to find other books that live up to this love story!
B005K17RU0|2.0|okay 1st of all I really don't like it. u have to agree to the terms of use and I don't know about u but I don't trust those things. 2nd to K Foosh or something like that u can uninstall it. I did. so if u want it that's find but don't say I didn't warn u.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLY AWESOME! I abso-effin-lutley love this book! Right now, I am wishing I had a better relationship with words so I could describe how amazingly awesome this book is! Alas, my eloquence is unreliable so I'll just have to make due with what I got... To start, I am now a major fan of Thea Harrison! She has been placed in my Top 5 Favorite Author category. (Which I will be adding to my shelf list as soon as I'm done with this review.) :)<br /><br />This is one of those books that has everything. The plot is very well written and, importantly, original. I love the alternate universe. I like how its described along the way and not all at once and with the bombardment of unnecessary details. The book itself was a little on the longer side, compared to others I've read lately anyway, but really there's nothing that could be taken out. I actually wish there had been more. I was really not ready for it to end and I caught myself slowing down at the end to prolong the ride. And oh what a ride it was! Since my venture into all the different types romance books, I have found that I love a good 'bad boy' and even the domineering alpha type too. Dragos was all that rolled into one hot as sin, fire breathing dragon straight from my wildest dreams. He was so in charge and at time freakin hilarious I fell in love with yet another fictional character. Pia is the most awesome chick evvah! She has definitely ranked in the top of my fave female leads. All her internal banter had me in stitches, which was great since a lot of times the internal dialogue in books can get boring and monotonous real quick. The relationship between Dragos and Pia was just awesome. They were funny, they were hot as hell in bed and the fact that they had only known each other for like a week before their feelings were announced didn't bother me like some 'in love in two days' stories can.<br /><br />O.k so there's an awesome plot that you can't get enough of; characters very well written that make you lol on numerous occasion (loved it); drama to keep you guessing; sex that makes you need a shower when its done *wags brows*; is there anything else?...<br /><br />One of my absolute number one favorite things about this book was how we were kept wondering what the hell Pia was! I don't know if I was so absorbed that I should have guessed sooner and missed it due to my natural blondness or if it was just that well written. I'm gonna go with the latter... just sayin! I like all the different types of beings. It's nice to read a paranormal that has more than just the typical vampire and werewolf beings in it.<br /><br />So to sum it all up, in case it wasn't too obvious, I love this book and I think everyone who likes hunky bossy men or strong female leads or paranormals... ok the list goes on. EVERYONE should read this book! :D
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't decide if I like THE HUNGER GAMES better than CATCHING FIRE or vice versa. For the movie industry, it's rare when a sequel lives up to the hype of the original. But fortunately for readers, this is a lot more common in the book industry. Even still, it's a rare phenomenon to have two different stories and two excellent books. Sure, the same characters are back, and sure, this is all part of the trilogy that Suzanne Collins had envisioned. But to tell two different stories takes a rare talent with a firm grasp on her genre and a firm direction for the story.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES certainly has more action inside the arena, and we only catch nuggets of information about the history of the games, along with the history of Panem. CATCHING FIRE fills in some of those missing details, and it has more action outside of the arena. A nice contrast, and if you enjoyed the first one, you certainly need to pick up the second one. Once again, Katniss Everdeen shines in all of her independent glory, but she's a year older and a year wiser, and she manages to show the reader fine glimpses of her compassion as well. While we may not know everything about the secondary characters, since we're only seeing Panem through her eyes, we don't have to. And once again the suspense builds to a rip-roaring crescendo.<br /><br />If you like dystopian fiction, and you enjoyed the characters and the storyline of the first read, then you'd better race to the bookstore to pick up Book Two.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B005OT2YVA|3.0|that's all it is. but long & drawn out. no fun. main redeeming part was some good actors happened to be in it, which in no way gives value to this movie. so if you just want to watch robots fight, this is your movie.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|awesome game.  well worth the money.  Now I have to go buy the original.  great puzzle game that will keep you working
B00881VLCE|1.0|This was very disappointing.  I could not turn any of the puzzle pieces and was not able to do any of the puzzles.  I deleted it. I would not recommend it. I really wouldn't rate it 1 star.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I saw the ring at the local Cineplex and liked it much better than I thought I might.  Modern adaptations have gone over the top in trying to make the Ring a story it isn't.  It would be nice to see a modern production that follows Wagner's stage directions completely.  BUT this production with all its effects and machines somehow comes closer than most modern productions -- certainly including Bayreuth.  So I've ordered mine and am looking forward to seeing it on my own big screen in my own media room where the popcorn is not rancid and my feet don't stick to the floor.<br /><br />But what I find interesting is that we can have this BluRay HD TV version for about $112 but it still costs about $150 to DOWNLOAD the Karajan version which is audio only and over 45 years old.  That makes this set an incredible deal with better sound, a wonderful orchestra, and HD Video to boot !!<br /><br />Finally, I'm so glad the Met and Universal got together to release this material.  The Met has one of the best standing HD setups in all theater (in the world) and it was a shame that all the lesser theaters were releasing their stuff on Blu Ray (for some time) and we had NOTHING from the Met.  I have great hope for this new alliance.  May it produce wonderful HD productions for years to come.  (Now I only wish the Met would come up with a Netcast arrangement similar to the Berlin Philharmonic's \\"Digital Concert Hall.\\"  For those of us living west of the Hudson, that would be a real boon.  The Cineplex was great but home is better.)

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have been reading all of the best sellers all summer long and have been enjoying them all but this book took me by surprise! I wasn't sure I cud relate to college-aged characters but I was wrong! This book was so well-written & it captured me at every turn. Never a dull moment and not predictable. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the ending!! I KNOW this book will become a movie...or at least it shud! It had something for everyone...I'm predicting a blockbuster!
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|Well, where to begin.<br />We all understand this is the classic story of the young girl imprisoned by her evil stepmother and blah blah blah.  That, in and of itself, might be a reason to give this movie a miss, even though Charlize Theron is quite good as the evil queen.  It is nonetheless a tale which has been told countless times in one form or another and there is nothing new or remarkable about this telling.<br /><br />The biggest problem here is Kristen Stewart who, for the most part, makes her way through the movie looking as though she has a bad case of hemorrhoids.  Her acting is wooden, unengaging and she brings nothing to the character that I could connect with.  She spends the entire film with a pouty look on her face which changes only slightly as she segues from one near-disaster to another.  There is no breadth or depth to her character.  In fairness to Stewart, her acting might be the result of poor direction, but whatever the reason she is just not very good.<br /><br />The film is beautifully filmed and has the usual dose of special effects, especially for the villains.  Unfortunately, the special effects seemed a bit out of place with some of the villains looking like they had been borrowed from the set of a science fiction film.  I think special effects are over-rated but in this film they seemed somewhat out of place.<br /><br />Save your money.  Rent it if you must, but it is not worthy of a place on anyone's shelf.

B003Z0D4SM|4.0|I found I had to push myself to get into this book, everyone telling me \\"oh just keep going, you'll see\\" and to my delight , they where right...Loved it,and certainly not what I had expected!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I've played the game for several hours now and I find that its challenging enough to hold my interest, but not so difficult that I get frustrated.
B008602KQI|4.0|Kinda slow to start with, but it get better when they get the games started. I would recommend this movie to anybody!
B008QZ1ZYQ|1.0|It's a simple game with mediocre graphics and animation. I played the first two levels and called it quits after boredom set in. Worth more like 25 cents rather than 99.
034580404X|5.0|Just read 50 Shades of Grey and \\"OH MY!!!\\"  Here is my journey.........I kept thinking to Ana \\"run, stay, run, stay.\\" Again and again and again....  To Christian.............hell if I know.  When I finished reading, didn't take long, didn't hardly put it down.  I felt desolate, empty, and sad, maybe even a little hopeful that it will work out.  I need to and will get the other's in the set because I feel compelled to whether I want to or not. Do I recomend it to others?  Hell Yes!!!!!
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade is one of my favorite singers, this CD/DVD is the greatest. Sade's live on DVD,it's like<br />being there watching her sing.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Really enjoy this app. It's nice that you can customize your own sounds.  Would be better if it could be used while running other programs though (books, games, etc. (Kindle Fire)).
1567184855|5.0|Recommended to me by a masters student of clinical psychology that had found it to be a fascinating book and \\"hard to put down\\". Have often felt that precognition was very possible and very possibly reinforced by theories surrounding DNA relative to memory and instinct. I believe that there are stores of memory from ancestors in a person's DNA; that there are many dimensions to what one refers to as \\"instinct\\", and have noticed predispositions for language and linguistics that seem to appear out of nowhere. I also wonder how many of us have experienced that D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu that accompanies a sense of \\"having been there before\\" or having \\"seen that before\\". And then, there is the simple spiritual belief that life has a path that is out of time.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is little different from the original Quell and that is a good thing. It's a game for a quiet moment, not to get your blood flowing.
034580404X|5.0|I love all three books. I have read each book five times already. I just cannot stop reading them. I need to visit  a Dr.Flynn.<br />P.S. I hope they cast Matt Bomer to play Christian Grey. He is sooo hot.Laters.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|i enjoyed war horse thought it to be choppy,and even a smart horse isnt going to step up to help his\\"budding\\"the way war horse did 3 times. this was supposed to be real life.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Me and my wife love Longmier, both the books and the TV series.  Bring them on!  We love Wyoming and the Indian interactions.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This box set, is the winner! The remastering is absolutely top noch! Every Beatles fan must own this priceless box set of their complete recorded output. Like another reviewer noted, the sound will give you goosebumps as it sounds like this was all recorded yesterday. It's that brilliant! I am 28 and love the Beatles. I have been blind all my life and I have been a Beatles fan since 6 years old. You can't go wrong with this superb set! Everything is included! Highly, highly recommended!<br />hemantha.maheen@gmail.com
B005D9MUWY|5.0|They seem to have gotten everything right. AND right where it needs to be. I love the number pad. It makes it much easier to enter numbers that way. And who's not used to a number pad arranged like a keyboard? Having quick access to the smileys even when not in text messages was an awesome add. The hold and drag for ? and ! keys is also intuitive and well-placed. Spacing, punctuation, and timing of its prediction of such things is better than anything else I've seen. I type with the phone vertical more so than in landscape because it's just that easy. And the options suit a lot of different tastes. Please don't screw this awesomeness up, SwiftKey guys! :-)
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I love Abbey Road! A friend of mine bought the tape of this album when I was living in the UK back in 1996. Highly recommended! My favorite is Oh! Darling, where Paul really puts his heart and soul on this one. The Beatles rule! Too bad they never continued making albums like this, but of course they broke up in 1970 after their Let It Be LP.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Finally a remote desktop app that is easy to use and actually works! I can even answer Skype calls received on my computer - how crazy is that!? Well done!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app. I was so excited when it came out and haven't been disappointed.  use it on my kindle fire and android phone.
031236198X|5.0|All was AOK,. It arrived on time and in good order. I will surely use this service once again.  Keep up the good work.
B008602KQI|5.0|I awaited the release of Hunger Games and the wait paid off -- it was fantastic -- acting, plot, animation, ending and all.  Would highly recommend it for those into fiction -- who knows, this could be where we as a society are heading -- Great Movie!!
B001490ZME|5.0|I've already watched the whole series up to date and have decided to enjoy it again to catch more of the outstanding script and nuances I may have missed.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Excellent puzzle game. Great graphics, soundtrack &amp; gameplay. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a challenging yet soothing brain teaser of a game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just finished the book (I love being able to order for the Kindle!) and I have to say that I enjoyed it.  Are there startling revelations?  No.  But it is interesting to see what went on in the actual raid instead of what we get fed by all the \\"experts\\" who weren't there.  I've been surprised to see people comment that the book is anti-Obama when there are really very few references to him at all.  By the way, it does not bother me in the least that a megalomaniac like Bin Laden wasn't shooting at the SEAL team when he assumed room temperature.  Nobody in the World Trade Center was shooting at anybody when Bin Laden's minions killed them.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is the chill pill. it totally calms me down. I listen to it before bed and I have never gone to sleep faster. it also is a good to if u r really stressed. put ur earphones in and it works like a charm every time. bam! the real life chill pill :)

B004XGN8W4|5.0|Take your addiction anywhere I love this item and couldnt be happier. And no it doesn't need to be battery powered..that's a bad idea..use ur heads ppl. The screen is bright and is perfect for Call Of Duty online. It's a must have..oh and good for putting in a DVD for the kids so I can watch my tv shows.
0525953728|5.0|This book provided a rare behind the scenes look at our special ops hero's.  This book made me feel proud and great to be an American. I wondered what these hero's are like and this book provides that.
B005HGKW6E|5.0|To me, this was an excellent historical courtroom drama, but I have been an attorney in Washington, DC, for 35 years.  If you are hooked on action flicks, forget this film.  It is for the \\"cerebral\\" viewer.
B006RUJST6|3.0|This a nice easy read dealing with a delicat subject<br />The subject of rape is still very much pushed under the carpet and stopped and dealt with as soon as it commes to some one attention these girls and boys all need help to get on with there lives
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fast paced page turner, could not put it down !!!!!! Can't write any more about this as it is a great read, as is the series.....
0345803485|1.0|Even though I teach English literature, I'm not a literary snob. I enjoy a spicy romance as much as the next person. I bought this because it's a bestseller, and I foolishly thought that meant something.  Apparently, the only thing it means is that millions of Americans have horrific taste in books. As one previous reviewer mentioned, it almost seems like some kind of national hoax perpetrated by the media. This can't be for real.<br /><br />If you have even a semblance of a brain in your head, do NOT bother with this drivel. It is not funny, it is not hot, it's not even romantic. It is mind-numbingly stupid. Other reviewers have described in eloquent detail its many, many faults. Believe them, because they are telling the truth. I barely finished the book, mostly because I spent money on it, and I kept thinking that it HAD to get better (since it is a bestseller). I was wrong. It was a waste of money, a waste of time, and I think it actually lowered my IQ.<br /><br />My biggest regret is that I can't UNREAD it.
B003PBB4ME|2.0|There's a ton here already so I'll just say they used too little of the wrong kind of plastic for the handle: it will only hold the lightest of cameras, and not very sturdily at that. Works fine for my GoPro, not AT ALL for my 7D. It sags enough I'm afraid it'd break with a sudden move.<br /><br />The other problem is that the cold shoe on top of the handle is sloped downward by a few degrees, thus problematic as a mic mount.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app gives you a lot of information about how much time is left for various activities, such as browsing, listening to music, etc.  You need to swipe left to see more information, otherwise you'll be wondering where all the statistics are.
B002ONV5E6|4.0|I have enjoyed the Bourne Series both in book form and on film. I purchased the film because the new sequel \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is coming out soon and I wanted to \\"refresh\\" my memory.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The ES File Explorer has solved some of my more vexing problems with my Kindle Fire.  For instance, let's say you download a pdf manual from a manufacturer.  Kindle Fire handles that by keeping the item in the downloads folder of your browser.<br /><br />Well, let's say you actually want that document, in your documents folder.  ES File Explorer solves that.<br /><br />Very intuitive, but be careful as you will now have the freedom to delete some very important files.<br /><br />Access and control of your content is what ES File Explorer serves up, and it does it with a nice looking interface and customizable themes.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|The Whippoorwill is the best yet from Blackberry Smoke, the best band out there today. This album has it all - from rock to country to jam and most everything in between - and every tune could be a number one hit on its own, all things being equal. Pick it up; you can't go wrong with this record.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I got the lite then when I couldn't save my world I bought it. then I talked about it to my friends. and now like 18 of my friends have it and I have to tell them tips constantly. I play it all day everyday. and will continue to do so until I get tired of it
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games series is one of the best I have read in a long time. The imbedded sociatal warnings about over reaching government control and resultant oppression, which happens when people are divided into groups and made to distrust one another, should strike a chord with people everywhere. Well written and fast paced - great plot builder for the \\"Mockingjay\\" and far more violent than I could have imagined. Anyone who picks up this series expecting a sappy \\"young people coming of age\\" senario is in for a shocker.[[ASIN:B004JTASAK Wise Company 60 Serving Entr&eacute;e Only Grab and Go Food Kit (13x9x10-Inch, 13-Pounds)]]
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this book from beginning to end! The love story between Will & Lake, the heart break, the poetry.... *sigh*<br />MUST read!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I bought this book to gain a better understanding on the basics of exposure. This book didn't disappoint. Whats better is how its written in simple English skipping over the jargon and theory moving into application. I prefer learning application THEN theory, maybe.
B0090EIILU|5.0|I laughed so hard that I cried twice. Ridiculous and hilarious. :) Perfect on a night when you just want to relax, kick back, and giggle while you eat good food and read your favorite magazine. Also, no one washes windows quite like the Dictator. LOL!
B0095R64AO|1.0|Maybe not the majority view, but...i hated this.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!<br /><br />Basically, two hours headed exactly where you'd expect. Up until the end, it's 'people behaving dumb'. Really; the venison dinner? the muttonchops? the chase of the professor? the food slapping scene? Losing a toe???<br /><br />Emily Blunt has to give up her career dream to be happy. A woman giving up her goals to enjoy true love. THERE'S a new idea! HE runs a taco truck (instead of running a major restaurant). Ok, but...they're happy. We could have saved them five years, and just shown them the last 5 pages of the script early on.<br /><br />Do something new! Tell this tired story in a different way, throw in a twist or two in. Or at least, make it funnier... Give people like Mindy Kaling or Molly Shannon something more to do; why waste talent? Give Brian Posehn a break at the end (instead of just leaving him pathetic; oh wait! That's funny..). And the leads...they deserve better.<br /><br />A dumb movie, with some genuinely funny moments. Just not enough to have made it worth watching...
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I liked this movie.  I bought it after I read the novels.  I ordered the disc because it was SO much less expensive then in stores.  Plus, a nice bonus, it came with an electronic copy that showed up on my amazon account that is linked to my bluray player.  So, I could watch the movie before my disc even showed up.  Awesome. I think amazon is smart for doing this... The disc, when it arrived, was brand new with no problems.
B007A4Y1Q8|5.0|BJM is still a Fantastic movie; resting so comfortably in my top 25 films of all time! I call this review a wolf among sheep films because many films came out that year but this one stood out! The comedic timing is perfection and with some art house style. I love the concept and the execution. Despite all of the ways to watch movies either on premium cable networks, streaming etc. I will gladly pay to own the Blu-Ray copy as a demonstration of my love and support of this film!
B0083D9MXM|5.0|A very nice mid priced collection of Stokowski's stereo era Columbia releases recorded from 1960 to 1977 that goes well with the recent RCA, Decca and EMI Stereo Stokowski collections.<br /><br />The collection comes in a nice laminated foldout box with 500 minutes of music over 10 CDs that come in LP replica sleeves and with vinyl replica labels and a slim trilingual booklet with liner notes including full recording info down to the matrix # of the original lps. The box is set up in the order the original albums were released.<br /><br />The end of analog era sound is wonderful, but a lack of info on any remastering and a note in the back of the booklet leave the impression this is just a collection of the previous AAD releases of this material and not recently remastered like the other Stokowski stereo era collections.<br /><br />Contents by recording date.<br />DISC 1-  [52:54] 1960<br />Falla - El Amor Brujo<br />Wagner - Tristan und Isolde Love Music<br /><br />DISC 2-  [38:27] 1960<br />Bach - BWV1050 Brandenburg Concerto 5<br />Bach - BWV0639<br />Bach - BWV0599<br />Bach - BWV0680<br /><br />DISC 3-  [42:36] 1966<br />Beethoven - Piano Concerto  5 Op 73 Emperor<br /><br />DISC 4-  [69:55]  The only disk with bonus material<br />Ives - Symphony 4 1965<br />Ives - Robert Browning Overture 1966<br />Ives - Majority or the Mases 1967<br />Ives - They Are There 1967<br />Ives - An Election 1967<br />Ives - Lincoln the Great Commoner 1967<br /><br />DISC 8-  [42:56] May 1976<br />Tchaikovsky - Auroras Wedding<br /><br />DISC 6- Leopold Stokowski Transcriptons  [39:37]  July 1976<br />Rimsky Korsakov- Flight of the Bumblebee<br />Debussy - Claire de Lune<br />Chopin - Mazurka in B-Flat Minor<br />Debussy - La Soiree dans Grenade<br />Novacek - Perpetuum Mobile<br />Tchaikovsky - Humoresque<br />Albeniz - Fete Dieu a Seville<br />Shostakovich - Prelude in E-Flat Minor<br />Rimsky Korsakov - Ivan the Terrible<br />Chopin - Prelude in d Minor<br /><br />DISC 5-  [55:57] August 1976<br />Bizet - Carmen Suites<br />Bizet - L Arlesienne Suites<br /><br />DISC 7-  [45:44]  November 1976<br />Sibelius - Symphony 1 in E Minor Op 39<br />Sibelius - The Swan of Tuonela<br /><br />DISC 10-  [55:50]  April 1977<br />Brahms - Symphony 2 in D Major Op 73<br />Brahms - Tragic Ouverture Op 81<br /><br />DISC 9-  [56:30]  June 1977<br />Mendelssohn - Symphony 4<br />Bizet - Symphony in C<br /><br />While the skimpy liner notes and LP replica sleeves make this a 5 star collection, the music is not up to the discount RCA or EMI box sets.<br /><br />This \\"limited edition\\" box set is a deal compared to the MP3 version and will go out of print on CDs leaving the download versions the only ones left in print.
B007TMON8M|1.0|fake reviews = garbage. Do they think we're idiots? Don't bother with this app, it will only encourage them to make more.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This is a movie about a future, post a civil war in the United States.  As a punishment for rebellion, the factions must submit a boy and a girl aged 12 through 18 by lottery to play the Hunger Games.  The object of the game is to kill the other contestants.  This is all great entertainment and quite a spectacle for the wealthy ruling faction.  I have read the books, and it followed the book well.  I am appalled, however, that this is marketed towards kids. It is way too brutal and scary for children. Please don't let your kids watch this!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had heard about this book and figured I would give it a shot...all I can say is OMG! The book was written very well and it was so good I could barely put it down...finished it in less than 48 hours. The whole book has you guessing what really happened to Amy from page 1 and the ending will literally leave you speechless. Some people felt the book took a while to get good, I felt it was a 10 from the beginning. Definitely a must read for the suspense lover!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game instantly stopped me from being able to exit forcing me to shut down the kindle to get out of the game.  But first it forced me to purchase things indicating that I was using points to buy them only to later discover that I would actually be charged money for them.  Meanwhile we never even played the game only did some \\"set up\\" that we were forced into before playing.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it really works it shows how much battry left and<br />u can put a alarm of how much battery u want left u don't have to take my opinion just try it its free so give it a try
0525953728|5.0|A page-turner of a book and recommended for every lying politician including the Big Phony President Obama.  This country has wasted 10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan when our goal was taken care of in less than an hour by heroes like this author.  Bush and Obama can never get the blood off their hands and will go down in history as two of our nation's worst presidents.  They can both roast in hell along with Osama Bin Laden.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great time waster. Very fun little logic game. The first one is good, but this one add a little more variety to the puzzles.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Okay. So let's pretend you take some of the highest acknowledged actors and actresses out there and cast them as the elite team of superheroes, that include the most beloved ones, and some very underrated ones. Then have them all act under one of the best guys for the job, superior in writing and directing. Add a plotline that ties many of the other storylines together, and teaches one very big lesson. Put aside your differences to work together all for the best of the country.<br />And that is precisely what The Avengers is.<br />One of the great things about this movie is that it reaches so many different people. It reaches the older generations who grew up with the comics and cheesy movies, and it reaches the little kids who still want to grow up to be Iron Man (without the orphan parts). And, of course, it reaches everyone in between..<br />Honestly, one shouldn't even need to read the reviews to decide to get this movie, because every second of it is worth it.
0743298039|5.0|I know I've loved a book when my mind keeps going back to the characters and setting long after I've read the last page.  This is one of those books.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Google Play says 3.6 is not compatible with my tablet, and it won't download from the Amazon app store (neither will a couple of other updates).  My current ver. 3.5 locks into &quot;Download Queued&quot; and won't connect. No 3.x version has ever worked reliably for me. Android's biggest strength is also its biggest flaw - every vendor modifies it to suite themselves. You can never know if an app is going to work. Kindle no longer does on my ViewSonic 7e.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Works fine on my phone, but won't save or share images on nexus 7. Needs to be updated, lags play store version by a mile.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so glad they have made an android app. It works great! It makes it easier to browse than using the browser.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Enjoyed every word of this book, I couldn't put it down, I stayed up late and<br />rose early to find out what happened, a perfect book to escape!
1449314287|5.0|I am extremely pleased with my purchase of High Performance MySQL, 3rd edition. I own the 2nd edition and my company recently upgraded to 5.5 so getting the 3rd edition was a no brainer. The book is extremely well organized and more information has been added to every single chapter. The new chapter on MySQL in the cloud is a timely welcome addition. The section on solid stage storage is also an example of how the contents have been updated to reflect the latest technology and trends. The book is full of real world scenarios and solutions the folks at Percona have encountered over the years. They do a great job of noting where features and functionality differs between 5.5 and 5.1 and also make reference to known features coming in 5.6. The level of detail contained within is much deeper than you will find in the online documentation and the authors do a great job of making clear the circumstances where features, configurations, engines and hardware may help or hurt with your specific application.<br /><br />If you are brand new to MySQL this is probably not the right choice for you. The information is presented in a very accessible way though and if you are coming from another RDBMS or have a decent technical background and are committed to learning more MySQL, I recommend it highly. The book is definitely biased towards Linux which the authors admit in the foreward.  But even if you are running a WAMP stack you will still find tons of useful information inside. I'm constantly pulling this book off my shelf to look up something real quick; either to confirm a thought or see if the experts have anything else to add on the subject. I can't wait for the 4th edition covering 5.6!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|So much hype based around this book.Much better Erotica has been written.I hear women say.How can this be made into a movie.That isn't XXX rated. Are we serious.Have you not seen the movies  Story of O ,Blue Orchid, 9 1/2 weeks ? Come on !<br /><br />It is possible,and leaving things to the imagination? 50 Shades has been over sensationalized  in my perspective and mind.Chpt 21 and almost bored<br /><br />Save your $10.oo for other Erotica writers on Amazon
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This Quell version is even better than the first. I Have really enjoyed the challenge. Each level brings about a new twist.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG!!!!. . . the Hunger Games is sooooooo incredibly good. I bought the movie and as soon as I finished the book, I watched the movie.  The book is a MUST read prior to watching the movie. If I could give this 20 stars, I would.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first 2 books of the series were great! Couldn't put them down. However, the third installment was so anti-climactic, predictable and lame
B008JH5CVS|4.0|It was a fun escape on a raining afternoon.  If you don't like space prison movies, graphic violence and foul language, this movie is probably not for you.  But the acting was good and the special effects believable.
B003Y74KCK|3.0|I like the price but the sleeve is a little loose. I wish it was snugger and tighter on the phone. It's a functional item but not fashionable.
B008602KQI|3.0|Hunger Games was a good movie, but just doesn't come close to being as good as the book.<br />It's not a total loss.  Hoping they do the next 2 books and try a little harder to make them more appealing.<br />If I saw the movie first, I wouldn't have bothered to read the book.
B005AKFXZW|2.0|I'm staring at the question above the box of the review I'm about to write: \\"What did you think?\\" it says...<br /><br />I'm really angry at this book. It started off as a 4-stars review, then it got down to 3 and now to a 2-stars. It can probably go lower, but it won't happen only because I won't be finishing it. I quit. And it's a book in a genre I write and read and with such a special idea for a plot. So much promise in it... I felt it went to waste.<br /><br />It's a book that will have its readership torn in half. I'm on the side of the utterly disappointed ones. Some of you might like the excessive and flowery descriptions, I like my magical realism neat please. Also, the hint of a plot would be nice.<br /><br />Recommended to people who will read the opening chapters for free and decide for themselves. You'll know if you like it. As an author I am in between various facial expressions since the moment I learned how much the author of The Night Circus was paid for this.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read the book almost non-stop because it was very interesting. I could feel the tension from the author, as if I was there with the team. More \\"sensitive\\" information was released from the politicians than the author did in this book. Please pray for all the military and their families.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG, this is the BEST series of books I have EVER read in my life.  For being the first Novels E.L. James has ever written she did a wonderful job. Now that I am through with the series I really miss the lives of Christain and Anastasia. It was like you were in their lives with them. I have found nothing to pick up to read since then that even compares. I actually started rereading the series last night. Can't wait for more reading to come from the author.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this book. Started off sort of slow, advanced to 'can't put down, ended with 'WHAT?' Would recommend this book to everyone.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|what a great app. well worth the price. great calming music and wonderful graphics. the game makes you think. very pleased.
B002LB6EJM|5.0|If you like the Cool sounds of Miles Davis' work of the 50's this is a great companion disc to own.<br />Adderley's hard-bop approach somehow works very well with Davis on this disc as the blues lines<br />are played by the combo. This is one of a few of Davis' appearances as a sideman.<br /><br />How can you go wrong with a line-up like this:<br />Art Blakey, drums<br />Sam Jones, bass<br />Hank Jones, piano<br />Cannonball Adderley, alto sax<br />Miles Davis, trumpet<br /><br />The cream of the jazz world all sitting in one studio workin' it like no other combo. This group swings.<br />The recording is by the famous Rudy Van Gelder who's name you will see on many great jazz works<br />and he also remastered this release as well.<br /><br />The songs were arranged by Adderley; and Davis, who was fresh from rehab and hungry for work,<br />leaves his indelible mark on the music. People thought this was a Miles Davis album when it was first<br />released. It is not.<br /><br />My favorite piece is 'One For Daddy-o' but they are all great tunes exceptionally rendered by the<br />quintet. All in all you get 43 minutes of pure blues bliss which you will return to again and again.<br /><br />I consider this a desert island disc. It was included in 'The Penquin Guide to Jazz' as a Core Selection;<br />and yes it will play in any CD player; it is a Hybrid SACD disc. That means there are two sets on the<br />disc, one is normal and the other is remastered for SACD/DSD surround sound.<br /><br />Whether you opt for the SACD hybrid or the standard CD you will fall in love with this music. I own a<br />moderate high end Denon/Polk Audio 7.1 stereo system and find the music on the SACD has more<br />presence in the room over the standard CD presentation; even when listening in 2 speaker stereo.
0525953728|4.0|I purchased this as an eBook from Amazon and started reading it the day it was released.  I had no preconceived feelings about the book except that I wondered why it would cause such a stir at the White House and wanted to find out.<br />The book is an easy read and if someone didn't know that it was a true account, might think it a well written novel.  It is full of information about what these brave men go through from the time they volunteer for the Seals, through the training and selection.  I have an idea of what it is like to want to be in an elite group (Submarines)and also know what it is like to not be accepted in the Seals.  I wasn't accepted.  I commend those like Mark Owen who made the cut.<br />Mr. Owen made a decision to get out of the seals and get on with his life.  I'm glad he decided to write this book but I think he may look back and think that maybe his time in the Seals was easier than what he may have to face as a result of this book.  I looked closely but could find nothing that I would consider a breach of any contract he may have signed but I did see that he made comments about what he and other Seals thought of the people who are actually running the war.  The (New) Rules of Engagement put these men right in the line of fire from the terrorist they are fighting and bringing this out surly hurt some feelings in the Pentagon.  Comments about the Obama administration didn't help and this President will go after Mr. Owen with a vengeance.  Stand by, Mr. Owen.<br />This book is a must read for anyone who ever wondered what life in the Seals is like.  There have been other books about the Seals but this one gives good insight into what it must really be like.  I now know that I could never have made it.<br />The Old Chief
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Edit..  All of my concerns have been addressed and this game has been updated regularly and the compatability issues are no longer a problem.      Do not uninstall, you won't be able to reinstall. I had this game installed and running on my device (Samsung GALAXY Nexus) I needed to do a factory reset and now the Amazon app store will not allow me to reinstall it, even tho it still shows as purchased in my account. I will amend my review when/if this is corrected. As it stands I'm told this app is \\"not compatible with my device\\". I know that not to be true as it was installed and running previous to the uninstall. My advice would be to backup the apk before you uninstall.
B00005JM02|5.0|Had to wait a little while to get it as it traveled a bit, but I expected this so not a problem. Packaging absolutely fine and discs are perfect. Of course \\"Nemo\\" was so worth the wait (love the movie). Not just for kids, if you want a \\"feel good\\" movie this is it. Happy customer!
014312093X|4.0|It's a bit of a tough read, and a long one. That doesn't put me off. I like to work for my entertainment. No, really, I do. I like to be made to think and puzzle out things. But I can usually read a novel in a few days to a week, depending on how long it is. This took me nearly three. I loved it, though. I did. I loved every minute of it. And it's not, as some have said before, a Clancy-esque, fly by the seat of your pants, techno thriller. It is so, and brooding, and thoughtful. It's a knot that is slowly untied. And to me it's written in that classic British style, with subtlety and complex plotting and a story arch that is broad and sweeping. I loved it. I've read leCarre before and loved him and this was one of his more famous novels, but I turned to it because of the new movie, which I wanted to see. I meant to read this first, but got impatient. I watched the new movie, loved it for the casting and acting, but couldn't follow the story at all. so read the book. Now I'm going to watch the mini-series with Alec Guinness. I expect to love it. I really did enjoy the book, but I can see how it may not be for everyone, and especially for today's impatient readers.
B00136JS12|5.0|After all these years, still the best music to play loud while driving home from a stressful day!! Foreplay/Long Time is the best hard-hitting 1 2 punch.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|I watched this movie simply for the cast and setting. I love a good spy thriller, and John leCarre is a wonderful writer. But the book is simply too HUGE to be condensed into a two hour movie. It was superbly acted, superbly cast. Collin Firth is simply perfect as Bill Haydon, but man alive, I couldn't follow the plot to save my life. I next went and read the book. What an amazing book! But it's as if the movie starts half way through and then makes half hearted attempts to go back and fill in. So many things made no sense to me until I'd read the book. I've now bought the mini-series and shall indulge in that next. What a waste of casting this was, though. And plot. It's a bit like the Kiera Knighly version of Pride and Prejudice. You simply can't condense it like that and hope to do justice to the story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Upon very strong recommendation from a friend - completely ignoring my disinclination towards young adult fiction - I purchased The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I expected juvenile writing, mixed with an easily digestible - boring - plot. But this book went against any of my stereotypes.<br /><br />Written as a collection of diary entries to an unknown reader, Charlie sucked me into his high school life. I wrenched with him, for him, and wished better. The book immediately opens up with a friend's suicide. That death and Charlie's reaction foreshadow an incredible story of growth, love, and heartbreak.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of dialogue (i.e., \\"Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve.\\").<br /><br />Charlie is a brilliant listener and troubled young man. His pain and story touched me. I cannot recommend this book enough.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|i found this book very interesting from the first page to the last. I certainly hope Phillipa keeps the books on this era coming.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Starts off choppy but cinematography improves.  Not too different from book which is good. If you haven't read the book it's probably two or three stars, if you have it's 4.  Thoroughly enjoyed watching. Character development isn't fantastic, but it's juvy lit.  Acting was good enough to elicite  the  suspention of disbelief. Looking forward to the sequel.
B0095R64AO|4.0|I'm surprised at how enjoyable this movie was to watch.  It kept me entertained the whole way through. The actors had great chemistry and their dialogue was witty and funny. I had several laugh outloud moments. I liked how the physical comedy wasn't over the top. This movie touched on real life relationship issues in a light hearted way. If you're in the mood for a good romantic comedy (and foul language doesn't bother you, it is rated R) then watch it, it's worth it.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|At close to 950 pages, I can't say Shantaram was an easy read, but it was an entertaining and interesting one. You have to commit to reading it. I read it on my kindle, and at one point checked to see where I was percentage-wise and was shocked to see I was only a third of the way through.<br /><br />This book is purported to be semi-autobiographical. The question is how much of it is true, but ultimately it doesn't matter. The story is a good one and totally unique. The characters jump off the page, and you often feel as if you're in India.<br /><br />Yes, the author is a bit full of himself, and tends to get \\"preachy.\\" Roberts often says in 100 words what he could have said in 10, but nonetheless, I found if I skimmed, I had to backtrack to catch the part of the plot I missed.<br /><br />I really wanted to give this book 5 stars. Unfortunately, I had to take off a star for the \\"purple\\" love scenes. The descriptions of his romantic moments were ridiculous and way over the top.<br /><br />I do believe the book would have been better at 200 pages shorter. Or maybe even 300 fewer pages. Where was his editor in all this? Would I recommend it? Yes, very much so. Different--in a good way--than any book I've ever read. And that alone should be enough to peak your interest.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Awesome!  Until it became the the FREE APP OF THE DAY, I kept passing it up.  When I decided to give it a try, I found that the only bad thing about it was that I didn't get it soo<br /><br />ner....even if I would have had to pay for it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Forget Fifty, Sylvia Day does it right! The sex scenes are fantastic, the characters are well developed, AND they deal with their relationship like actual adults instead of teenagers! Go figure.
B008CP93S0|2.0|The movie was very strange but did get better at the very end. The comedy must've not been my style but I usually can do just any type of comedy.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I like these kind of games I'm having trouble putting this game down and I have not played the other games that I have downloaded on my kindledire and I normally play them three to four times aday
B008RTE066|5.0|On the preorder page for one of the new 2012 editions of the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" movie, Amazon is showing old, negative reviews for a now-obsolete(and unauthorized) DVD release. These reports correctly inform the consumer of the poor audio & video quality of that unauthorized DVD, but when the new, high quality DVD & Bluray editions are released in October 2012, consumers who visit the pages for these new editions will see negative reviews of the unauthorized DVD, and possibly think that those reviews refer to the 2012 editions. Amazon needs to correct this situation, so that space is left open so that reviews of the new editions appear on the product pages for those new editions.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|draw something free is perfect even tho it had adds its still really fun to play I recommends. this for everyone
B006OOHYIC|5.0|well put togther, progressively harder. Strategy before moving is required. ability to leave off and come back would be nice. nice faotd!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is not only great fun for the kids, but I really enjoy playing it too.  The only thing is I have 2 problems with it. #1:  I seldom get a chance to play with out prying my device from one of my child's hands.  #2:  I not yet good enough compete on the same level of play as my four year old son.  Fun!  Good times!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it love it love. lots of ideas for home&hellip;self and family. must have for anyone. got lots of ideas for building our own home.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is an awesome memoir. This book tells you about a kidnapped girl. She really wants to spread the message.  It was: Don't let your life slip away, try to make it worth it.

B008NNNF7G|5.0|I'll keep this review short and to the point. If you've never heard of Black Berry Smoke, you're in for a wonderful surprise. Their latest CD, The Whippoorwill, will quickly become one of your favorites. They're very much like a more country-influenced Lynryd Skynyrd. There's plenty of rock'n and rollin' and even some pedal and slide guitar for good measure. Every song on the album deserves radio play. Just buy it already. I highly recommend it.
B007TMON8M|4.0|This is a great physics and strategy game. Fun and time consuming. If you like this you will Like Rage of bahamut, another strategy game. Use my refferal code: JVG78663 and get a free starter bonus.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|I just watched this movie and found it horrendously boring....  much too long....<br />I finished the movie but lost interest not long before it started....watch at your own risk...  you might fall asleep.  I gave it three stars for the special effects...
B000IDEORY|5.0|We enjoyed the Dirty Dancing movie.  The movie was in excellent shape when I received it in the mail.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the movie.  Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze make a good looking<br />couple.  The movie on the TV was excellent.
0793518326|5.0|It was more than I exspected. All the words and all the music for different instruments just blew me away. All my friends that have looked at this are amazed what it contains. I fact one of my friends that borrowed it has had it over two weeks now. I have the feeling that I may not see my book ever again. ( I am just kidding, I am sure that any day I will have it back in my hands again ) But when ??????
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I have had two of these headsets. They are just not not worth it. I mainly got it as it was advertised to work with my PS3, Xbox and my pc. Which would have been great. The sad part is that it is made like garbage. Half the cord is thick and good quality the other half is prone to twisting and curling up. Why they didn't make the entire cord of the heavier material I don't know.  I take very good care of my electronics but this didn't stop both of these headsets from developing shorts with in one month of purchase. If you want to save yourself a headache, do yourself a favor and avoid this.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I read Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire around a year ago when it was first self-published and loved it.  I received a copy of the new Atria published version about a month ago for a re-read, and I fell in love again.  Travis is a tattooed bad boy with a cocky attitude, but he has such a sweetness about him when it comes to Abby, the one girl who can defeat the undefeated bad boy with just a look.<br /><br />The title of this book is a testament to the relationship between Abby (Pigeon) and Travis....even though the title is really Abby's view of Travis in general.<br /><br />Travis is...well, he just beautiful.  He's a lethal fighter in a college underground circuit (which is how he pays for school) who can't be defeated.  He has brains behind all that beauty, making straight A's in school.  He has women swooning at his feet...but ofcourse, he has issues.  Travis is a hot-tempered, jealous, partying, womanizing mess with an undefeated record in the circle and an undefeated record in the bed on the couch.  He has a famous couch full of cooties and notches from the multiples of women who jump at his beck and call...but Abby is the one conquest he has to really fight for...the one worth fighting for...she's the one fight he just might not win.  He IS a deliciously beautiful disaster.<br /><br />Abby has moved far away from home in an attempt to escape a regretful past with a gambling and alcoholic father in an attempt to build a new life at a new school with her best friend, America.  She only wants to meet a clean-cut college boy with goals for the future.  Enter Travis...when Abby first meets Travis, she knows who he is and what he does to women, so she is determined not to fall under his seductive spell....she didn't account for Travis falling under HER seductive spell.  She is everything Travis has never had, but wants.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book.  There is a definite emotional connection with this book and its characters that is unavoidable.  The intimacy you will feel is overwhelming because it just seems so real!  One of my favorite scenes in this book is when Travis buys a new couch...this is so symbolic of his feelings for Abby.  It can sometimes be easy to put \\"I love you\\" in a dialogue, but this scene was so much more.  It was such an awww moment for me, and it was Travis's special way of showing, not telling, Abby his feelings for her. This story is sweet with just enough angst to keep me glued to the pages.  The characters are lovable and funny...especially America and Shep.  Travis's family, their history, and the relationship they share with each other is touching. They may be a group of rough and ready fighters, but they definitely have each others' backs.  I'd love to see more of them in future books.  The romance and the plot is very satisfying, yet leaves me wanting more of these high-quality characters.  Is there healing to be found in the midst of brokenness?  Yes.  Is there a HEA in the ending?  Well, you need to read to find out.  What you should expect: a love story that is a roller coaster full of fun, frenzy, tears, and smiles.  What you get is all that in an unconventional gritty tale of two not so different people who discover themselves in each other.  I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to those who have attempted to resist the beautiful disaster that love can sometimes be.The intimacy you will feel is overwhelming because it just seems so real!

B001BKTEZA|5.0|Originally read the book in 10th grade.  Liked it then, but now at 69 I realized just how powerful a book this is.  Our book club had rave reviews and felt we gained a lot more reading this with the benefit of our life experiences.<br /><br />Grapes of Wrath
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I loved this book. I wish all men in India and other `boys preferred` countries could read it. I wish Asha could read it.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have used their desktop product for years and welcomed a mobile version.  Scans all new downloads and even scans SMS.  Have had no problems on my Note since installing.  Highly recommended!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A relief that Mr. Gray could live a somewhat normal life with a family after his molestation and trust had been shattered and tainted by those who he should have been able to trust.  The steamy sex was detailed.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I was really pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of this headset. Plus it is very light. For this price you can't go wrong.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like the game but can you make more updates then I<br />will love samuri vs zombies defence or you can make<br />samurai vs zombies offence.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|the game is not bad, the problem is on the saving of the game. it is not stable and we cannot save the progress externally  it will reset the game pretty often
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|This is not my favorite Vai release but it is still very good.  John The Revelator I'm having a hard time wrapping my ears around that.  Seems out of place to me, other than that it will still get played a lot in my future.  He is one of my favorite artists.
B0025YKDJC|4.0|A very funy movie that takes one away from anything serious. Bizzar, out of the box weirdness that is hard to stop watching :-)
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I found this last book to be the happy ending I was looking for.  The  loving intimacy will appeal more to women but there is intrigue and mystery that enters their lives that would any reader couldn't put down easily.
B006S009IY|4.0|Superb flick. We decided that we should own it & now we do. Interesting exam of the author of Peter Pan. We recommend it highly
B008XG1X18|5.0|Super excited to have finally gotten this app on my kindle. I'm so addicted!! Haven't. had any problems with since I downloaded it on my kindle or my phone.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|In animation, in plot, and in rhyme and song, 'The Lorax,' movie has somewhat elaborated from the Dr. Seuss' book.  Sometimes it's a pay off, but at other times it is a letdown.  In pace, they are snappy enough, but in song and in dialogue, they don't add much quality to the overall movie experience.  There are some pretty dull lines and some lame lyrics when you listen carefully to both the words and songs.  Still, the characterization (including voices from the likes of Zac Efron and Betty White) are endearing, and the vibrant, flowing visuals make this 'Lorax' good enough for at least viewing once.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I am so excited to share this with my two-year-old great-grandson.  Snow White is such a timeless story, the production wonderful;<br />the characters, the music and dancing, the colors; a great addition to our Disney collection.  Thanks!
B000FC10WU|4.0|Miss Marple was on track in this one, I loved the visiting to the hotel and Miss Marple interaction with the cast of characters.  I was not expecting the switch of bodies and felt that was an added mystery.

B000002G0P|2.0|After hearing \\"Rest in Peace\\" and \\"Am I Ever gonna Change,\\" I was expecting this album to be better. The album is too lite, and has too many songs with pianos, and some also have orchestras. This albums isn't as rocking as \\"Pornografiti,\\" and is a decline in quality. The only songs I like are, \\"Tragic Comic,\\" \\"Rest in Peace,\\" and \\"Am I Ever gonna Change?\\"
B006LSZECO|5.0|Suspenseful, quick, and easy read! It keeps you wondering what is the truth and what is going to happen next! Loved it!
B000003TAW|3.0|This is the third best Weezer album after \\"Pinkerton\\" and \\"Maladroit.\\" I don't think every song is great, such as \\"Only in Dreams\\" or \\"Surf Wax America.\\" It's worth buying.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Excellent product it feels absolutely amazing while playing, battery life its excellent, shock it's also well, but when I unpacked just came the control and warranty, it doesn't include any cable for charging or else.
B00013F38K|5.0|I was in my twenties when I watched the original series and now still love it for what it is. Not great on martial arts but more a study on a culture , morals and how everyone should act especially to their elders. I snatched up the only VHS tape on ebay of the pilot episode which runs 1 hr and 15min. I also have the dvd first season which I bought on amazon.  There are some complaints of hats and feet being cut off in the dvd version. This movie was made for tv and was meant to be watched in the full screen mode. On my tv I have different modes natural[full screen] and 3 modes of wide screen. The wide screen tends to show the actors to be a slight squat mode but not unwatchable. But I just watch the dvd in full screen mode. I never seem to get tired of pilot episode. Have not watched the rest of the first season but will when I have time.
B005IQXUQW|5.0|Over the past 10 years, Café Zimmerman has recorded Bach's \\"concertos for multiple instruments\\" on the Alpha label. These works include the harpsichord concertos, the Brandenburg concertos, the orchestral suites (overtures), as well as the many concertos for violin, oboe, flute or other instruments. Last year, they released this in a 6-CD set: Concerts avec plusieurs instruments.<br /><br />I hadn't bought any of the individual volumes of this set previously, but when the box came out, I listened to some samples on line and bought it immediately. The 24 works included - four per disc - are all performed with a wonderful lightness and joy, making these some of the most attractive recordings I know of these works.<br /><br />Each disc is organized as a concert: rather than grouping, say, all of the Brandenburg concertos on two discs, there is one on each of the six CDs. No disc has two of the same type of work; there are not two orchestral suites or harpsichord concertos on any of the discs. This makes each of the CDs a 60- to 70-minute concert that provides a variety of instrumentations.<br /><br />The sound is excellent, the performances full of vigor, and, while the tempi are on the fast side, nothing sounds hurried. This is a wonderful set of Bach's \\"orchestral\\" music. If you like Bach, you should check this out.
