B007N85POS|1.0|I didn't see the Kindle part so it didn't work on my tablet - at least it was free. Hopefully there is another free version.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Love it! Very funny, and entertaining. Everyone in the cast is superb and the storyline is unique. We enjoyed it!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Grand kids too young for this app, need something they can do on their own perhaps I'll check it out later.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This was excellent. I wouldn't typically reach for a war novel and was a bit timid about tackling a non-sequential timeline, but I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I loved it. Definitely recommend.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The most riviting and slow show ever.... yet its great and i cant stop watching.  Poor Baites-ey.  And man Thomas sucks.
B00632HWOG|3.0|For me this is harder to navigate than the Yahoo mail on my laptop.  I guess I need to train the old dog to do so new tricks.

B00DGN51O8|4.0|Very entertaining family film. It was better than we expected and my nine year old child loved it. Would watch again.
B00DQVST76|1.0|I haven't been excited for a DVD of a concert in quite a long time.  The show was absolutely amazing, probably close to Madonna's best in my opinion.  I wasn't able to watch this in its entirety because it feels like you're staring into a strobe light.<br />The editing is ridiculous.  You barely see Madonna close up and within 5 seconds you'll see 10 different camera angles.<br />The sound is pretty bad to, didn't sound like anything I heard in Pittsburgh or Cleveland.<br />For me, fan made YouTube videos surpass this in quality.  I wanted to see the concert...not whatever this artistic BS is supposed to be.
B00BX50UEC|5.0|I really like the different music types and sounds. It great to here music from other countries and hear what is some of their up and coming talent.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|I really liked this game to start. I don't know what ads others are talking about. The only problem I had is that the game freezes on the last level so I don't know how the game ends. :(
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Loved the film but wanted to go back to the beginning and meet the man. Lots of action as you would expect. Great read.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game! I am totally addicted! I haven't been able to put my kindle down to do anything else! All i need is more Crystals and armor!
B000VK99Z6|4.0|Another winner from Pegg and the gang, they do a good job of switching up their character types while still using the same bizarre formula.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|The usual Die Hard -- if you've seen more than one, you could probably write a script in your sleep.  The only draw is Willis' humor, but even that is starting to get &#34;same old same old.&#34;  Probably time to retire the series.
B0018OFN4U|4.0|Good humor, movie changes from the typical romantic comedy to a goofy, gore fest. Well worth the watch, that's for sure.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Really, this is NOT deathless cinematic art -- if that's what you're looking for, just move along, nothing to see here.  But, like some of those awful SyFy movies, it's fun.
B002GHHHH4|5.0|in my whole life, I all way love Sylvester Stallone acting and his DVD Movies.  in this movies tell us he is the truck driver and try to find his son.  He tries his best to get control of his son over his grandfather.  Not a lot of action but the story line is very good and I really liked and enjoyed the movie.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|All time classic Halloween movie. Would defiantly recommend for anyone wanting a great movie to have. I have watched it a million time and now I am happy to own it.

0316069434|4.0|This is Harry Bosch's 18th foray into murder. This case occurred in 1992, during the LA riots following the \\"not guilty\\" verdict given to the LAPD officers who beat a motorist, Rodney King. The beating was televised, incensing the population.<br /><br />Within hours of the verdict, South LA erupted into flames. There were so many deaths that detectives were barely able to get to one crime scene before they were called to another.<br /><br />This case had some unique features. The victim, Anneke Jespersen, was a Danish photo-journalist who was shot execution-style in a dark alley. Why was a white woman in South LA while things were so dangerous? What happened to her film and camera equipment?<br /><br />Because of the short shrift given to this case, Harry promised the woman that he would look for her murderer in the future. Near the 20th anniversary of Anneke's death, Harry is working in the Open-Unsolved Unit. Suddenly, he gets a break; the gun used in her murder has also been used in other murders. Harry goes on the hunt!<br /><br />The title comes from Harry's partner, David Chu. He once made a comment that every case had a `black box.' It was the one clue that could help a police detective pry open the case.<br /><br />At times, during the early part of the story, the pacing seemed to drag a bit. When I thought about it, I realized that it is hard to create a sense of momentum in a case that has been cold for 20 years. In the second part of the book, Michael Connelly hits his stride and things move to a remarkable conclusion.

B00F91SCXC|1.0|brad pitt - zombies? Really?<br />I expected at least a decent attempt.<br />The special effects were not even worth it.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|As a long time LEGO and Back to the Future fan, this is pretty cool. You can change the time machine into all three versions from each movie which is pretty cool. Only thing that I would change would be to allow both Doc and Marty to be able to sit in the DeLorean at the same time. Other than that, its is awesome. Comes with a great booklet with lots of cool facts.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This album runs the gamut of sounds and styles. The whole album is fantastic, from the powerhouse \\"Radioactive\\" to a more catchy \\"On Top of the World\\" to the heartfelt \\"Demons\\". My personal favorite has to be \\"Tiptoe\\". Give the samples a listen, maybe even a few full tracks on Youtube, and then buy this album.

B0089LOG02|5.0|One of the best stories I have ever read. I cannot begin to imagine living in such hardships. Just surviving a life like these poor children did is absolutely amazing to me. I cannot tell you how many times my eyes filled with tears just picturing their suffering as I read this book.
B007CI81IQ|5.0|This was a terrific piece that looks into the how and why poor people operate the way they do. Using empirical data over a fairly impressive country set, the authors are able to convincingly present an alternative understanding to the currently entrenched beliefs and opinions circulating in the development world. There are no one stop shops, one size fits all, but exposing yourself to the ideas in this book create an excellent and potentially powerful lens through which to look at the case of the poor in our current day and age.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B006LSZECO|4.0|First time reading this author. Not sure if I liked the style of &#34;diary entries&#34; button will rank it high for originality. Weirdly intriguing characters. Stays with you long after finishing it.
0553801473|5.0|As a young adult, getting into college life and working full-time, I had given up on ready for enjoyment. This series, after viewing the show, saved my literary hobby. I used to read a ton, and enjoyed LOTR many times through, and now I feel I have discovered something I can use to restore my hope in the idea that I can read for fun.
0307719774|5.0|I keep it at my office and so I give myself 3 minutes everyday to write in it. On Monday I write in whatever question was for Saturday and Sunday. I've only been using it a couple of months, I think the cool thing would be to keep using it and after 3-4 years compare responses. I plan to have kids in the next 2-3 years so that will be a big lifestye change that will create very different responses in the near future so I'm excited about how the answers will change from year to year. It's a great way to keep a small journal, without the guilt of not writing a lot every single day.

For example the listening to calm music in the morning when you wake up to start your day right. Plus, all the monk practices have a practical use that's described in the book for you, so that's cool.

B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Peter, Enchantment and Stardust by William O'Brian definitely takes your brain for a twist or two. These unique poems of fantasy alive mingled with powerful thoughts and feelings really is impressive if you can open you mind to &#34;different.&#34;<br />The author is free in thinking and I thank him for opening my mind further still and letting me into his own thoughts if just for a minute- :)

0345525558|5.0|My daughter and I both loved this book.  I believe it was one of the recommended books of the month from Ladies Home Journal.  Good choice and I agree it is worth recommending.  My adopted daughter, was also an adolescent living in a group home at one time.... so this book really hits close to home.  Thank you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|stingy with my stars and this isn't the best sci fi I've ever read but it was so engrossing and interesting  and this silo world was so mesmerizing that I rewarded it with 5 stars.  This series will certainly appeal to the Hunger Games fans and there are parallels that go with this territory.  I am not sure I want to go back down there for the second volume.  I might just go to Dust, the third one, but haven't decided.
0545265355|5.0|Now, I enjoyed watching the movie too, so don't get me wrong. But there's a certain magic about the book; you get a deeper understanding of what isn't stated in speech or in scene, but more emotion.<br /><br />These were very well-written, even considering the target audience. I read them over a month, taking my time to enjoy each fully. I don't think I ever lost interest either.<br /><br />The packaging was nice as well, and makes for an attractive display on my bookshelf!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Okay, if you are NOT an Arnold fan, this won't change your mind. But if you enjoy his flicks, this one is pretty good. The plot is a little far-fetched, but that's okay, as it IS just a MOVIE.<br /><br />Good action, and reasonable acting throughout. Definitely worth the couple of bucks for some action-entertainment!
1885167776|4.0|Finally a book that explains why multi tasking doesn't work and how to accomplish your goals in life you must concentrate on one thing at a time.  I wish I had read this book 10 years ago, a it would have cleared up some of the misconceptions I've had.

1444737112|5.0|This book truly brought tears to my eyes!  It is written by a young man who was in the process of getting clean from a street and drug life.

What an inspiring story and proof that we can do anything we aspire to do using our will!<br /><br />Thanks James for a wonderful read from a huge cat lover!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I found it started off slow and then picked up speed and didn't stop. The plot was great and although I had some of the angles figured, it kept me going right to the end. I felt the ending, while it did bring closure, could have been handled better. Even with that minor complaint I still believe it rates a five.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|So much fun, amazing details, great story (besides the &quot;desperate woman would do anything to get married!&quot; at the end!). One of the  best of it's kind!

B004LWZW24|5.0|I tell you, this movie scared the poop out of me and I'm a horror movie fan! I'm very picky about horror movies, but this one was just a true work of art. In the first few minuets of the movie, I thought it was going to be just one of those regular `ghosts in the attic' movies, but no, this movie completely surprised me. I'm not entirely familiar with the cast, but they did fairly well. However, the characters that stood out the most were not the little boy and his family, but the psychic and her hilarious ghost hunting team. With all the scary that's going on and the little boy frolicking away in his dreams; they shed a little light on the matter at hand and ultimately break the tension within the household with their funny antics. The boy is very creepy sometimes, but I can't tell if that's the regular nature of the character, or the fact that he's being haunted. The icing on the cake for me was the creepy music that mixed well with all the scenes. Every time that creepy tune came on, my whole entire body had tensed up knowing that something was going to happen.<br /><br />The ghosts and demons that are in this movie are absolutely fantastic and will surely send chills down your spine once you see little glimpses of them and in some cases you will see a full fledged demon! Oh yeah, this isn't the Mothman. You will see some pretty awesome effects and a lot of darkness. The CGI is just amazing for this movie. There's a lot of strenuous tension in the film, especially with the boy's father who is constantly trying to retrieve his son from his nightmares. They realize that the boy, himself, is an astral projector which is rather interesting and I can relate. I thought I had several experiences with astral projection as well. Anyway, where was I going with this movie? Oh right, if you want to scare yourself, by all means watch it alone - with the lights off and doors and windows shut, but it's a lot of fun when you're with a bunch of people and they start screaming andjumping in every scene. It's not so scary if you do it like that and it's a lot of fun. I haven't been truly terrified since \\"The Exorcist\\", but this one is coming very close to that that \\"ohmergawd, wtf was that!?\\" feeling.

0679721037|4.0|This book describes what happened to six people who survived the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima as told to a reporter who visited with them and interviewed them in the months right after the war. This is a slim volume of 116 small pages. The stories were originally published in New Yorker magazine and later compiled into book form. As it turns out, the six people all had connections with each or knew of each other even before the bomb dropped, but this book does not discuss much of that. Instead, it starts out by detailing what each of the people was doing in the time before it dropped, then covers what happened to them over the next few days, and finally, discusses what happened to them over the intervening months as radiation sickness infected them.<br /><br />The descriptions are vivid and the people's recollections appear sincere and heartfelt. The stories are told by the participants and even though they are told in the third person, it is clear from reading this book that the stories were told to the author directly by the people involved. One thing that strikes the reader is the incredible amount of detail that each participant contributed to the story and the incredible memories that they had of just what they did as the bomb struck, and what they thought and felt in the immediate aftermath. The book does show its journalistic roots and timeframe as each participant is constantly referred to as Mr. so-and-so or Mrs. Such-and-such.<br /><br />Their stories, of how they dealt with their own injuries; how they started to look around them and comprehend the magnitude of the destruction; and how they found the humanity to help others are very well put together and well worth reading.<br /><br />This is one of those books that documented what happened to the people who were subject to one of only two such attacks in the history of mankind. Ultimately, their stories are not about the nuclear bomb that attacked them, but are stories of incredible survival and even heroism in very difficult circumstances. It is definitely a worthwhile read to understand the human spirit and its ability to handle adversity, but this is not the kind of book that I would recommend when you want a light or fun read. Due to the nature of this book and its subject, I must give it a four star rating.<br /><br />I understand that the author released an updated edition of this book in the 1980's after he revisited the six people he covers in this book and updated their stories. This review refers to the 1972 edition which I happened to find in a used book store.heroism in very difficult circumstances.

B004FGMDOQ|2.0|If you are contemplating purchasing this book, make sure you get a version that allows you to view the pictures. While I found them a bit eerie, they are important to the concept. As far as the story goes, it started with great promise then went nowhere. I think the author had grand ideas that did not quite connect to the pages. I felt a bit like I wasted my time with this one.

B00DGO8CN4|5.0|Pure and simple. I've listened to Oldfield since 1973 and this release is worth every penny. Just the live video footage of the band performing Crises live at Wembley in 1983 is worth the purchase. An amazing moment captured in time. Wow!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I'm not sure what it is about this series, but I liked them all.  They writing was ok, and for some reason the story piqued my interest and kept me reading.  If you like a fairy tale with a little kink, then this is the book series for you. In my opinion, the second book \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" is the best of the three.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Starts fast and gets faster. Better if you've read some earlier books. I guess I need eight more words for this review

B0019I6WDG|5.0|I hadn't seen Juno since it was released and I'm so glad to have revisited it. Ellen Page is such a puffy little charmer that you can't help but feel smitten. Wonderful message about family and unconditional love.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|It amazes me that this book doesn't have a bigger impact, even among the people who read it. Some people complain that they don't like the prose, or that Dweck can be too repetitive? So what? The idea is so profound and life changing that I really don't care about such minor stylistic issues like that. She can be as repetitive as she likes, so long as the ideas are so strong and positive.<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't discover this book when I was younger. It really taught me a lot about myself, and not everything I learned was pleasant or flattering. I had to face some hard truths. I especially recommend this book to people with young children. Don't let your kids fall prey to the fixed mindset!
B001OR0AEY|3.0|Had to watch it for a class project. Turned out to be pretty interesting especially if you love music. Worth a view

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Beloved Heath Ledger aside, I have seen every Christopher Nolan film get strikingly better than the last one.  'Rises' is the first time that it is subtle, but i still think it's there.  It doesn't completely reinvent the wheel of film making like Nolan's prior two productions, but i think the balance and pacing, also the digest-ability all make for a great show.  Upcoming film makers who want a real exciting earth changing show often will use little tricks here, little gimmicks there which make the movies weak in the long run.  For Nolan films, this movie has the least of that I've seen.  It is grounded, straight forward, doesn't indulge any excess of computer graphics or little tricks to give you that 'jump'.  You can basically trust your eyes and your gut through the whole experience, which says a lot for a high budget filmmaker making a batman movie.  That is awesome confidence that comes a good amount of film experience.  I think he is up there in this particular school of mastery.  And for his collaboration as producer on Man of Steel, I think he doing what i have hoped for him.  He is working with more enlightened themes now (rising, transcending weakness, realizing potential, sacrifice...  I look forward to his next works.

B000I0XLYO|1.0|I honestly don't know why I even finished this movie.  The story line is terrible, Ben Stiller's character is unbelievably portrayed, and the gags and jokes are tired and boring.<br /><br />Skip it.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Read it on my holidays and it took me 2 days enjoyed it so much i cant wait<br />for the next book to come great reading
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|This is a YA book which has a lot of the recurring themes seen in many of the genre. Set at an indeterminate point in the future where society has changed greatly taking away individuality and choice. Naturally, someone is going to get a glimpse of how things used to be.<br />The ending is interesting and has sparked plenty of debate. This is a quick and enjoyable read.
1476727651|5.0|Being a fan of Stephen King you know what you're going to get more times than not, which means he rarely writes anything bad or not worth your time. The shining is one of his early works and also one of his best so when I read about Doctor Sleep I was very intrigued but also worried. I was worried it wouldn't live up to expectations or the hype that would surround it, even still I eagerly awaited it's release and like a true constant reader I pre-ordered it here on Amazon. I started it the day I received it and finished it 4 days later, needless to say I thought it was excellent. It's not a requirement to have read The Shining prior to reading it but it does explain quite a bit and also gives you much more insight into Danny's life and how he got to where he is. If you're a fan of The Shining then you're going to enjoy this one but even if you've not read it and just can't wait to read Doctor Sleep you're still in for a great novel from one of the best storytellers of our time.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I always love her books. This one is no exception! Cleverly plotted with beautifully drawn characters. I read this until the wee hours of the morning!
B00E1LQ7Q0|5.0|i choose this rating because i am a huge nsync fan so this is amazing. i like it sooo much that im supporting nsync all the way. solo projects and all. and i happen to enjoy everything that they do no matter what. and i would recomend this to anyone who enjoys this type of music.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Many other reviews correctly tell about the way the extras are split between different retailers.  This is a big deal if you are into the extras on a movie, also be aware that I too find it frustrating.  I decided to buy the movie on demand - none of the extras are included, just like all that are on demand.  The problem I have with the other reviews is that some of them have forgotten about the movie.<br /><br />This is the second release of the latest &#34;New&#34; (at this point that seems redundant) Star Trek series of movies.  The interaction and personality's are more established and work together more like they should and the story ties in new names and persons from the old (future) star trek shows.<br /><br />The show is full of special effects (like all si-fi movies), but they tend to be used to help the story as opposed to being an end to itself.  The story and the plot is good and the director duos not need to lean on effects as much.<br /><br />I don't rehash the story when I review.  I will say that this movie is enjoyable for those both old and new to star trek and that if you know some of the old shows there are some nice surprises in store.<br /><br />There you go - If you get hooked up on if this or that retailer has this or that extra, you may miss a good movie.  Just download it on demand and enjoy it and keep the extra bucks for pop-corn.
B000VZJMAI|5.0|I like to nap my chair, starting around 8 pm, then go to bed at 12:30 am and sleep till 3 am. Then I'm up and at them the rest of the day. I like the music, so Creatures Of The Night it is !

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I enjoy these new movies. The story is in a different place, and I find interesting. I look forward to #3!
1560100842|3.0|I bought this for my daughter. When I received the book, I was surprised to see that many of the drawings are of Barbie-shaped women in showgirl outfits. In several sections, the author shows you how to draw scantily-clad women strutting and dancing. None of these pictures were featured in the preview on Amazon or mentioned in the reviews. If I wanted this sort of \\"education\\" for my daughter, I would just let her watch Mad Men. If you are looking for a book that will inspire a young female animator, keep looking.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I've got to get a job doing that. Fixing robots and chasing girls. Till then I'll watch this movie. OK
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|It came to me without my knowledge. I refused shipment. I haven't seen it turn up on my doorstep again; however, I haven't received credit on my credit card, either. Not sure how this happened.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is an excellent book for those who have never seen combat, but would like to understand what troops go through while on the front lines. I first read this book as a course requirement in college, and have constantly been coming back to it to read. E.B. Sledge writes in such a way he makes you feel like you are a part of the action instead of reading a book about battles fought almost 70 years ago. My only regret is I took the course a few months after &#34;Sledgehammer&#34; passed away. It would have been an honor to have him sign my paper copy. I have even recommended this to a few of my buddies who have surrived our latest conflict in the hopes it will encourage them to never give up and even possibly write their stories down.
B000FP2OPY|2.0|While there is no doubt this is an excellent series, this DVD will not meet your needs if you are deaf or hearing impaired.  The best acting in the world needs either dialogue or captioning and this is not captioned in English.  It is however subtitled in several other languages, French, Spanish, Korean and whatever.  This DVD is not SDH in English.
B00F91G5BS|2.0|It was just ok. This movie was a time filler. Was wanting something entertaining but this movie was not the right choice.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This book was incredible! Action packed and full of energy, you'll quickly like Nate and his friends, and follow him on his journey into SO much more than you ever imagined.<br /><br />This was such a refreshing change from other paranormal/sci-fi reads. The concept is a new, original take on reincarnation. The book moved along at a nice pace, keeping the reader's interest held throughout.<br /><br />I can't wait to follow Nate and Dustin on the next part of their journey! 5-Stars and highly recommended for anyone looking for an awesome paranormal adventure!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent, excellent, EXCELLENT!<br />Anyone looking for additional reading on the subject of metaphysics; the law of attraction, teachings of Neville Goddard, Twenty Twenty and the like SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!
1476729719|5.0|This book was amazing. OMG.. it gave me a whole new prospective of school and what some kids go through. I now keep a double eye out for kids who don't really like to play with others and I make sure I step in when I see kids &#34;just playing&#34; as they say. Every parent and teacher needs to read this book. It is very important to make sure our children are okay emotionally and physically, and it's even more important to see what our kids are doing and playing with behind closed doors.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Perfection. Period.<br /><br />Thrilled with the picture and audio, haven't even explored the extras yet. But I'd buy it all over again just to have the movie itself.
0385349831|5.0|The kind of book where you read the chapters over and over again. The messages are ones you carry with you through life. Parents should purchase this book for their teenagers/young adults, it will enlighten them.
0399159347|5.0|this story is told from more than one woman's perspective. it involves several women all linked together by their pasts in a Sydney Australia neighborhood. things are set off by the most organized and successful of these women, Cecilia, finding in her attic a letter from husband instructing her to read it upon his death.  her husband is alive but on a business trip. the contents of this letter will show how interconnected all of these families' lives are including Tess, who moves back from Melbourne when she splits from her husband, and Rachel, whose daughter was murdered when Tess and Celia were just girls themselves. all of these women have families and those families are the most important parts of their lives. each of them will be facing what matters need to be spoken about and which are best left alone.  their consciences are all sorely tested. this book manages to make mundane things like a tupperware party and an easter hat parade be engaging parts of the book.  this author has three other novels, all of which i intend to read.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B002N5N5M0|5.0|I  have all seven season on DVD and this fits the high standards of Showtime in their original broadcast. I think the fourth season was the best.
6305428042|5.0|HOCUS POCUS is a great Halloween movie from Disney. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are wonderful as three witches resurrected on Halloween night in Salem Massachusetts. They also happen to be sisters and when their spell is broken they return to the town that sentenced them to their would be demise on this earth. It is an entertaining film, a funny film, but it has its dark moments. I like the set designs in this movie and John Debney's score. It really captures the ghoulish goings on Halloween night. I think it is a fun film.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I don't think Buddy can make a bad album. He hits all the marks with this awesome double disc! Crank it up
0670022705|5.0|Beautiful photographs with great storytelling.  Makes history and art fascinating.  I cherish this book.  Thank you, Mr. MacGregor, for<br />taking us on a tour of your lovely British Museum.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B00DB624GS|3.0|Going in a different direction a little of the early style but the start of a new style and feel of the music. Not as bluesy but still decent.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|The entire movie from start to finish was pure epic fun. Tony is more fleshed out in this one, bringing an element of humanity to his Iron Man facade.
B00DOQK2OG|3.0|Like the music. Classic Blackmore. Recording quality not the best. Not the best version of still I'm sad but acceptable.
1481130331|3.0|This is a straightforward account of the marriage of two Germans; a gentile boy to a Jewish girl, in the years just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, and its implications for the safety of their immediate and extended family and friends. They live in Bratislava, on the border between Slovakia and Austria, and the story opens in 1933 as Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany. Thus the characters, although on the face of it, are in a seemingly precarious position, they are actually on the periphery of the war and there is very little `action'. Having said that the reader learns much about what `ordinary' life must have been like for everyday citizens in the middle of Europe in those tumultuous times.<br /><br />However, the narrative is quite staid and, for this reader, there was very little tension inherent in their situation. Possibly, this is because the book is written in a very matter of fact style and, instead of letting the story tell itself, the author makes the mistake of explaining too much of the characters' motives for their actions almost as if there was a `Sparks' Notes' version interspersed within the narrative. All of this would be fine if it was a factual account rather than fiction which is supposed to excite, engage and entertain as well inform and possibly educate.<br /><br />Thus, a worthy rather than exciting read.
1407130366|3.0|This was a gift - I never heard if the person like it or not.  Heard it was very good.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Never mind if some says its a cover album. Maybe some of them could be heard before but all of them are excellent. The sound is perfect. Mike Portnnoy on the drums is killer like always. Get it!
B00BU2TEGS|5.0|One of the best albums to come from Depeche Mode. You can feel the direction and unity of the band in their songs.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Love it so much! Modern, excellent, great, heavy, loud, intensive, fresh. Great to hear Rachel Bolan ( Skid Row ) on bass.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book, with tons of twists and surprises! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes and can handle action, and violence
B00785P2QC|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the original Virtual City game and was excited to find this new one. Very nice.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have loved all the seasons of Downton Abbey.  It is so well written and acted out, and the story draws you in.  Although, I was so disappointed with the way the writers ended this season. But what do you do when actors want to leave the show.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Beautiful pictures. Lots of variation. The colors on the puzzles is very rich and vibrant.. give it . A try. I think you will also enjoy them.
0140143505|5.0|Enjoyed this book greatly, it was a quick read and it was enjoyable to read, i would recommend it to others.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Looks as awesome as expected. Definitely overpriced, but I, like most, am a huge Walking Dead fan so it felt worth it.
B00122MWBK|5.0|Iris is one of my favorites. I know there are a lot more. I also downloaded Stay With You[[ASIN:B00122IZXO Iris]] Very kool singalong songs.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I've covered the acting and production before--it continues on the previous excellent level.  The writing and plot lines are intelligent, thought-provoking and entertaining.  If only all television could be of this standard!
B002APS61I|5.0|Having just read the book, I thought I would be disappointed in the movie, which had to be abridged. To my surprise, it was only a bit compressed; all the essential plot was intact. And the scenery was lovely. The actors did a great job.
0316010669|5.0|These books not only have a trememdouse amount of common sense but they give the research to back it up.  The author is extremely fluid in his conclusions, and creative in his analysis.

B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Very crude and rough for no reason. I quite watching after about 45 minutes because it was that bad. The language and roughness did not add anything for the story, but took away.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it, particularly part 2. (Part 1 covers the period the Beatles - covered more fully on Anthology). Perfect clement for Concert for George.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I bought this for a very special great granddaughter and she has enjoyed it over and over and over again!
0884271536|4.0|The ideas about scheduling and critical path cersus critical chain are great. This book leaves you with real-world solutons to extremely technical problems. I can actually use the information in this book immediately.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|No shipping required arrived on kindle in a timely fashion and easily read and retrieved will enjoy it for years.
B004A7OQKY|5.0|This is a great DVD!  It's fast paced, not super corny.  It really feels like working out with your own trainer, but I don't have to drag my awkward belly to the gym or pay $90 an hour.  Once you have watched it once you will be prepared to move from chair to floor to wall, etc.  It is very easy to follow.  The pace gets your heart rate up while your muscles are being toned, which is my favorite way to work out.  I am not in to spending additional time doing just &#34;cardio&#34;.  This workout is efficient.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am enjoying learning french.  It is not overly easy as you have to write things in the language you are learning before you are comfortable with the words.  However, you are learning to speak, read and write at the same time which is a great advantage.
B009LGO88E|5.0|It really helps having the right circle pad for camera movement instead of using the plus pad. Also, I like the feel of the grip quite a bit compared to using the 3DS by itself.
B004HXIZVC|3.0|Purchased for kindle to try to match audio portion of language learning book to the book.  You are supposed to listen to the audio while following along in the book.  Great idea but can't seem to get the audio to connect to the book.  I'm sure there is a way and I will keep trying until I find it.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|I have all Pink Martini CD's, love them all.  They just make you feel good.  I was lucky to see them last summer in Bend, Or. a real highlight for me.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My 4 year old loved the first one, and he is so excited about this one coming out.  Great game.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I am not a country music fan, but really enjoy this CD, brings back some good memories of my youth.
B00CM4VC7M|4.0|I have loved Sailor Moon for many years ever since I was little and since the moment they announced this figure I knew I was going to get it no matter what. This is my first S.H Figuarts so I am a bit unfamiliar with the line despite seeing a few reviews of them.<br /><br />My figure made a timely arrival within a week after release. I have heard/read that many people have been recieving their packages with the box slightly or severaly damaged and lucky for me it was not the case. The box was intact and it is quite lovely showing off the figure in several of Sailor Moon's iconic poses. She comes with several interchangeable hands, 2 Moon sticks and a figurine of Luna. She also comes with 3 interchangeable faces, however the first edition/release of the figure comes with 2 more, a winking and crying face, making it a total of five. They are nicely detailed and easy to swap around but its a shame that those 2 extra faces only come with the first edition, especially the crying face, since it is very iconic to the character. So unless you got the first edition you won't get them until either Bandai decides to change their minds and either put them on sale or re-release this figure with them included.<br /><br />The figure itself is very lovely and is quite easy to pose/move around. Due to some extra bit of paint on her pigtails they wouldn't swivel and, perhaps because she was very new, it was a bit hard to remove the front hair piece to swap her faces but once I got them unstuck and messed around a bit it became very easy. The sorta rubbery feeling of some of the material makes me feel a bit more at ease as it can probably bend a bit or that something would rather pop out than break. Nothing scarier than breaking something on an expensive figure after all. Though she is very easy to pose, her small feet make it very hard for her to keep in place/standing. Luckily she comes with her own transparent stand in the shape of a heart with her name written in pink and in my case it is quite sturdy. The figure is also quite light so you can probably pose her in mid-air easily too.<br /><br />Sadly I agree that, while Luna is a very nice addition, she isn't the best. She can only swivel her head left and right and the positions of her feet make her very awkward and prone to falling if you don't place her on a completely flat surface.<br /><br />So despite a few very minor things here and there it is a very good figure of the character, especially for a first try when there hasn't been any such figures in all these years. She is a very nice addition for any fan and perhaps collectors in general and I look foward to getting the rest of the Sailor Scouts who have been announced and will be coming out within a couple of months [Mercury and Mars] till next year [Jupiter and Venus] and hopefully they make the rest too.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|My Blue-Ray player was one of the first on the market so it must get manual disc updates and I have not gotten the latest so the Iron Man blue-ray did not work.<br />Thankfully, the package included the regular DVD as well so I was able to watch this great movie.<br />Plot was kind of easy to see who the bad guy was from the beginning but still very enjoyable movie.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|My father gave me this book after reading it himself, a man who only recently took reading as a serious interest.  7000 miles away from my birthplace and trying to live in a new world, this book helped me learn to forgive myself and others every day.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|even if you are not a scifi fan, the characters and their stories are well developed and interesting.<br />the dialect is a little stilted and I am not sure why that was important<br />The movie, serenity, as a follow up is good, but not as well done as the season.<br />Fans are still discovering Firefly all these years later, wish it had not been ended after a single season

B008US4PBY|1.0|I bought this to so I could use my 360 controller on the PS3. After a month it worked fine but then there was an firmware update for the PS3 that disabled it. Now when I plug it in, I get a notication on the PS3 that the USB device is not recognized.<br /><br />I have tried getting in touch with the developer of the device, but he is either ignoring all messages or he simply just took the money and ran.

B00DU74U74|4.0|I didn't expect a sci-fi romance combo movie, but the writer and directors did a good job with this one.  I would probably give it a 3 1/2....at times the star of the movie seemed to act like she was possessed!  Worth seeing, though.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Since I can't get Candy Crush on my kindle, this is an excellent game to play.  I get caught up on trying to beat the clock that I play over and over. Until I can get Candy Crush, I will continue to play this and recommend this highly.

B00280LYIC|5.0|\\"If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself.\\" - Percy Jackson (From 'The Lightning Thief', by Rick Riordan)<br /><br />The Lightning Thief places of Greek mythology in a modern setting. It's a hilarious fantasy-adventure featuring 12-year old Percy Jackson, who discovers he is the son of a mortal woman and the Greek mythical figure Poseidon. Percy and his friends go on a quest to prevent a war between Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a twelve-year-old boy with dyslexia and ADHD. He's been expelled from every school he has ever attended, and can't figure out why. Oddly enough, he has an affinity for ancient languages like Latin (weird). He's been in-and-out of schools so he finds it hard to make friends. And his Dad mysteriously disappeared from his life when he was much younger, so he's dealing with issues there. In short - Percy Jackson is a likeable but complicated kid, living in an unenviable, complicated situation.  Percy does have one steadfast friend, and that's Grover Underwood. Grover walks with a limp, so he's not he most athletic. And he always needs a haircut. But he's a loyal friend, and Percy feels the need to look out for him. Little does Percy know - there is MUCH MORE to Grover than is immediately apparent!!<br /><br />I loved that Percy is the unwitting, then reluctant hero... one who is bestowed with abilities most people would love to have, and yet, he just wants to be a normal kid, with a normal family. I also enjoyed the fact that some of Percy's biggest shortcomings, ended up becoming his greatest assets! I won't give the plot away, but suffice to say Percy's academic struggles, and even apparent stubbornness, are what save him in the end! The plot was simple enough for tweens to follow, but did have a number of plot twists that I didn't see coming. Rest assured that if you think you know who the good guys and the bad guys are, you may be changing your mind before the end of the book (in more ways than one!) Rick Riordan also did an excellent job of writing this as the opening salvo to a series of adventures. There is LOTS of room for Percy's adventures to expand, and after getting through this one in a few short days, I can't wait to read the next installment!<br /><br />This is a great book for tweens and teens... but honestly as a grown up fantasy fiction fan, I couldn't put this down for two days!

B005DN5BE4|5.0|Probably the best movie I have ever seen.  Highly recommend to any and all who love justice--as well as US History.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Kudos again for Amazon's frustration free packaging!!  I was on the fence about keeping this when i first got it as it seems kinda flimsy. So i charged both this case and the headset then threw both into my handbag and now after a few months of using would not dream of giving it up... hence the 5 stars.<br /><br />Plantronics could have done a better job with the plastics - it's very lightweight and looks like it won't last long. However it has lasted in my handbag smushed with sunglass case, wallet, loose change, chapsticks and a plethora of items that somehow find their way in until I finally clean it out.<br /><br />It does keep the headset charged and it does do a good job of protecting it from the army that is the inside of my handbag.I try my best to put back into the case whenever it's not on my ear.  The only time i've had it run down is when i've forgotten to charge the case.<br /><br />The case itself is good to charge the headset two times over before you have to plug it in.  Bottomline is for me this is a function tool - as long as I remember to occasionally plug in the case I never have to remember to charge the headset and it's always in my handbag ready to go.<br /><br />Prior to getting this headset and case I used to plug in my cell phone and headset when i got home and &#34;sometimes&#34; would forgot to pick it up when rushing out the door the next morning.  Those of you reading this who have had the &#34;a ha&#34; moment when you're stuck in traffic and realize you have no phone will know what i mean.<br /><br />When I got this headset I also went on ebay to buy china made no name extra phone batteries and the matching plug in charger.  The ones on Amazon just seemed too expensive in comparison.  Now I always keep my phone and headset in my handbag and just spend a minute swapping out the cell battery and picking up the headset case every other morning.  If I forget while rushing out it's not a big deal as I can still charge up both cell phone and headset while driving as they are already in my handbag.

0385523394|4.0|What an experience! I can't imagine how or if I would have been able to handle a situation like this.  Piper Kerman drew me in to her harrowing ordeal.  I hated putting the book down.

B001BIMYXQ|5.0|I heard the Eurythmics version of &#34;Sweet Dreams&#34; on the radio one day and had to find out more about the band and their music. Although I generally don't like music from that era, I love Eurythmics! Their version of &#34;Sweet Dreams&#34; is so much better than Manson's. Other great songs are &#34;Here Comes the Rain Again&#34; &#34;Miracle of Love &#34; &#34;17 Again&#34; and much more. If you like their music, check out Annie Lennox's albums!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This was recommended and well worth the read...I had to buy all three books and have finished all three...is there a next?
B0084AZXKK|5.0|From the time I first read it until now as a old guy it still is a book to open the imagination of a inner child

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It is very rare that I have come across a book that tells such a perfect tale that it feeds every hungry synapses in my brain, \\"Doctor Sleep\\" did just that!<br />From beginning to end, this book amazed me.
B003O2RQKS|5.0|The DVD is just so great to sit with a wine and envelope yourself with magnificent music.a must to have.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|I was very impressed when I read this book. It is kind of a cross between The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Alice and Wonder Land for lack of a better comparison. The story was written extremely well. The author was very descriptive and has a fabulous imagination. I really likes this book. It could be read by an adult or an older child. Overall, A really great Read. Highly recommended.
076115678X|5.0|My daughter gave me the book for my birthday.  I turned 62 this year and can't believe I am still learning how to deal with my curly hair.  I have been using Deva Curl products for a year and really like them! After reading the book, I now have extra tips on how to have healthy looking curls without the frizz.  I finally like my curls and it is never too late to learn something new!

B00DWZHTOU|5.0|This came in a day a head of schedule.  It was a pleasant surprise to see it there!!! I cannot wait to watch it.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Excellent show, fantastic acting.  The various side plots keep it interesting.  On to the next season now.  Overall, engaging show.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's a great way to pass the time and it makes u think which is always a plus. The 15 by 15 grid is a lot harder and is quite a challenge. GREAT GAME!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Just discovered this game...it's very addictive!  Makes you think.  Good for all ages from grade school on up to senior citizens.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I guess there is something in me that recoils at the word 'steal.'<br /><br />I'm for saying, 'learn from your environment, be an eclectic learner from your mentors,' which I guess is what this writer means by steal. But for goodness sake, if you have to cut and paste and just alter and steal from many and mess it around so it's not recognisable as plagiarism, you are not an artist.<br /><br />Yes, it is a great little helpful book and I mean this review to be seen as positive.<br /><br />I just had to express my view, that an artist can learn form others while taking the inspiration for their own work form nature and life experience. There is never any need to use an other's work, in our own work, let alone a combination of other's works. I would have given this five stars if the emphasis was on learning from, rather than, stealing from others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son really likes this game.  I like the graphics and the hand eye coordination to play the game.  BUt did have to explain that getting into situations where running from the police becomes necessary was not a food idea.Stay out of trouble and respect the law essentially.  I also don't like free games that require real money to upgrade. But my son loves it so 5 out of 5
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is fantastic, challenging, stimulating, yet you don't have to be an Einstein to thoroughly enjoy it.  Truly hope this type of game play continues production.  EXCELLENT!!!
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|$75 for this is way too much.  $40 would be more fair.  I bought for DVD assuming it was live concert footage and it was not.  A bunch of photos shown over and over and over very fricken lame!  The music is good of course so 3 stars.  Deduct 2 for DVD dissapointment.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|While trying to figure out measurements for recovering a sofa & love seat, square footage of carpet & flooring this is an essential tool.  Large buttons, easy movement within the calculator.  Real life math has to be accurate to save me money.  Great product!
B00A285OOW|4.0|I have read all of her other books and enjoyed all of them.  I would recommend this one as well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP BECAUSE IT REALLY WORKS!!!! FIRST I USE THE CALCULATOR ,THEN I DO IT ON PAPER AND IT REALLY WORKS!!!!TRY IT AND YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Decent game to pass the time without the need to pay for progress. Worth the time to download to my device
B00009RDGA|5.0|I love this movie and did not think I would find it on DVD. Its worth the price and came in quicker than I had anticipated.
B008BWFP2W|2.0|I didn't like the film.  Julliette, as always, is extraordinary, but the way the story is conducted is very unclear.  Too bad.  The story is actually very interesting.  It could be done much better.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I am and will always be a magician. I watched Tom baker 25 years ago through static. Dr who was only available on state educational channel which had very poor signal. So glad for satellite and BBC America. It's much easier on my aging eyes! I will miss Matt Smith. Don't want Dr who to ever end.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|It was interesting to meet the members of his old team and begin to know a little more of the background that made him who he is. I enjoy the loyalty shown by the team members to each other. Nicely plotted and and little more character development than expected.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Title says it all...  absolutely love this game.  What i love more is that i no longer have to log in to facebook to play......
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game, just wish I could stop playing. I love that there are different difficulties to play and a variety of each level. Definitely worth the money spent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg this game is very fun and will keep you active all day and it never get boring and you can play against your friends on Facebook I love this app and you would to!!!
B004U7JYXS|5.0|Worked great. Everything I could have asked for in some great film. Cant go wrong with this instax instant film.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Great flick, really romantic. Gay men might adore it. I thought it was cute, had a happy ending for all.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have to be very careful playing this game, as I find myself losing track of time VERY quick. If you enjoy games that challenge you mentally, then this is definitely a good one.
B009AY04A8|4.0|It is a good story line and the games are doable. Disloyal is sometimes hard to keep up with. You can miss parts.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far the best keyboard software &#34; I'VE &#34; used. I like how customizable it is and the predictive text gets it right the more I use it. Can't imagine trying to type with any other keyboard app on my phone.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I'm buying it for a sound engineer friend --  very entertaining if you like music. Sound City is worth watching
0740797719|5.0|This was a gift for an artist.  I know nothing about painting but he was thrilled to receive this as a gift
B000RJO578|1.0|Why is this parade of silliness rated so highly by viewers? If you like camp, this is for you. If you like witty comedy, this is most definitely NOT for you. If you liked Porky's or one of it's jejune zombie clones, you'll love this. But if you are looking for anything above Dumb And Dumber (British version), you will be as disappointed as I was.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Had been looking for a good book for awhile.... was so excited to find one that completely pulled me in and wouldn't let go.  Written beautifully, great characters and what a tear jerker!  Devoured it... would highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Enjoy the characters don't know who is  brain child they are so get my fix playing this game<br />A little too long to continue loading up is slow otherwise precious.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Amazing information on how and why great people triumph in life, besides stamina and dedication.  Very convincig and extremely well documented.
B009FXIICK|3.0|This is your typical match 3, however with my 'old' eyes sometimes it was hard for me to see the possible matches right away.  I see this as a limitation on my part, not the game.
B00BZB1ME6|5.0|My 5 year old son loves this movie.  I must admit that I was nice to watch it again, as it is a very inspirational film, but about the 5th or 6th replay I had to call it quits.
B000UGZTQO|5.0|The product and delivery were exactly as expected. I got it very quickly and the RAM product performs perfectly. I've used RAM products on my motorcycles and liked them. This one is being used on the sailboat. Should be more than adequate. Need to watch for corrosion but that's true of everything we use on the boat that's not marine grade stainless.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton just keeps getting better!  This emotional season that take place during World War I is simply amazing.  Wow this show :-)
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Using this for mounting a smartphone at the helm of a sailboat. It clamps perfectly to 1&#34; rail. I wrap the rail with a little rigging tape but only to reduce the clamping force needed. It holds well and so far, a couple months, there is no sign of corrosion but the exposed threads probably need to be watched and coated with something to prevent the salt air from doing anything nasty to it.
B000IHSKUM|5.0|These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned; more so than even SAS or Birkenstock.  Very durable construction; they look like they will last for a long while.  I love these shoes.  I wear them disc golfing, hiking and occasionally at work.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because of the ideas presented. Feels kind of like a few concepts I've read before but mashed together in a way that feels very original to me. At times it felt like the bad news just kept coming to the point where I was starting to get depressed. Then things would turn around. All in all I liked the story and as a total package it rates high on my list of good reads.
057506885X|5.0|This is an adult's book [Sorry about the lack of sex]. A departure from Terry's normal writing, but still exceptional. And then there is the added bonus of the glorious colour illustrations. A keeper for many more perusals.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Sound track alone is worth watching the movie!  Acting and directing are superb!  Hate to admit I never read this Jane Austin book, but I am guessing the movie did the novel justice.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This novel captured every spare moment.  The plot twists held my imagination past the end!  Immediately bought the next 2 omnibus sequel editions.
1439190275|4.0|I am still reading, rather studying this book and am having a difficult time putting together a diet that suits me.  Ask me again in a few weeks and I might be able to give a more detailed review.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Was purchased as a gift for my son from a list of movies he wanted to add to his collection.  He enjoyed it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Better than the rest! Loved every second of this book. Don't care that it is a teen book so was harry potter
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a good story and story and easy read.  I am a Grisham fan and this did not dissapoint.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|I watch Bones every week and I love it! The storylines are very well written and interesting! I love the science that goes into the show and the relationship between Booth and Brennan always keeps it fresh. I love all of the characters on the show. Even though the subject material is dark, they always know how to make the show funny. I bought this from Amazon because it was the cheapest price I could find from a reliable, trusted seller.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I love this entire series. I adore it. Theyre one of the few series that I will actually enjoy watching more than once in a close time frame.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Nice to review when corresponding letters and such,  Also used when sending business emails.  Helps with the finess of my letters.<br />.
1401233376|5.0|This Graphic novel was a turning point in the DC universe (I'm just going to say spoiler alert now for those who haven't read it) it's the beginning of the new DC universe and the story was very good about how the new 52 Began.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been reading Mr. Kings work for 30 years, with the best stories I can tell you what was going on in my life and where I was at time I read them.  Let's just say I will never here forget where I was when I read this one.
B008602KQI|4.0|If the movie works and you like it, it is a good buy, if it doesn't work, or you don't like it, I guess it wouldn't be
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I'm a big fan of Jojo Moyes and this doesn't disappoint.  Don't be fooled by the subject matter.  It's a touching, untraditional love story that reminds us that people are more intricate then their appearance.  If you love a glimpse into lives you probably never thought about, this story will take you on a journey you will remember.  Sit back and enjoy.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I really enjoyed the film. It was funny fast paced and well balanced. The plot moved fairly well but I feel like the relationship dynamic suffered a little once things got rolling. Mostly it hit all the right notes and with this kind of cast, you can't go wrong. It has drama, action, romance and conspiracy.
B0081336FO|5.0|a modern interpretation of our favorite detective - they use the web and Watson is a blogger<br /><br />well acted bravo!
B007SGM084|5.0|the first book starts out kind of slow, but once you get to the first good part of the book; you can not put any of them down!!!<br /> best series i have read in years!!!!
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|You can't go wrong with Legos and being able to purchase them online beats going to the store - only to find out the set you're looking for isn't in stock. Very Happy to get the product I want and in a timely manner.  Very Happy Customer.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|this book series is a lot like fifty shades almost too many similarities in the books. but overall they are pretty good
1401938906|5.0|It is great book and i hope that I will accoplish a lot in my life . I am waiting for many positive amswers.
161655164X|5.0|This was a gift for someone and they loved it. The detailing on the characters was very enlightening. I'm thinking about getting my own copy.  Lol.
B0019IB0II|5.0|What a positive spin on a not fun event. The author knew what was going on when her left brain started shutting down. What was amazing to her was how nice it was living from her right brain. For those of us who are not brain researchers, she explains the parts of the brain and how they typically work first so that we will understand. A very good read.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|I love my CD. I also love the extra CD with Hollywood history. It was a great buy! I recommend for anyone who likes musicals.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The characters seem like real folk in this story.  It's has a warm side but it also has a dark side as it relates the horrifying experiences of a child in an orphanage. The story is very engaging and somewhat inspirational
B0052RDHTM|4.0|If someone was to give this book to anyone not interested in history (most US citizens born after 1970), I think they would have a much better perspective on WWI and the societal attitudes of the time.  Clearly, with the Tea Party and Christian fundamentalist ignorance in the USA at present, it is unlikely that they would have the attention span to wade through this 1000 page novel.  Perhaps if Mr. Follett had made this a video game or an iPhone app, more of the readers would have given it better reviews.<br /><br />I enjoyed the novel and found that I was better off from having read it.<br /><br />I'm certain the negative reviews are from the ADHD Downton Abbey crowd.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator app. Simple to use and the large size of the buttons helps to keep from hitting the wrong thing.
B0040UEI8G|4.0|I bought Andre Cluytens as my first Beethoven symphonies. I have regretted giving away my vinyls for many years. These are a reasonable substitute.
B005TQAI6G|3.0|Looking at this for just a \\"fun factor,\\" the Femme Fatale tour DVD is a good choice to buy. The sets are huge and almost omnipresent, Britney and her backup dancers have obviously rehearsed the dance steps, and songs from throughout her career are featured here, not just ones from a certain time.<br /><br />However, it is obvious that in post-production, Brit's live vocals were either mostly taken out, or they just put the song vocals over Brit's live ones. Why? That is just such an insult to her fans. At least some of her songs have some live vocals coming thru, and hey what do ya know, she sounds good.<br /><br />The actual live vocals can explain the somewhat-disappointing dance moves and the choreography that accompany them. Some songs have dances better than others (3, How I Roll stand out as being the most fun/classic numbers; Britney herself seems happiest performing How I Roll, too). But overall, Brit's big new songs, Hold It Against Me and Til The World Ends are great songs with crappy dances. Britney herself seemed out of it and stiff in the HIAM opener, and the moves themselves for TTWE just weren't my style.<br /><br />Most songs included featured either a remixed version or some new intros. Props, they came across well. I'm not sure if I cared for the backup dancers; they were talented and who knows how much time had to be put into the fitness training they underwent. But too often they're moves were more energetic/exaggerated than Britney's, which takes away from the purpose: that she is the star and the others are there to make her look better. But then again, Britney didn't exactly put on a dancing clinic, either.<br /><br />Still though, this is Britney which means it's more or less a blast to watch. There's just something about her stage presence that puts her in that upper echelon.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock works the best for me and while I don't like waking up in the morning, I love this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It's a mix of temple run and subway suffers. I love the fact that it programs the visual to your age.
B0000DJYPB|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 18 yr old daughter who is really into vinyl. She is all so into having music on her iphone.  Now she has both.  Great experience.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This books keep your attention the entire time. So well written and keeps you guessing. I'm looking forward to the movie in 2015- I hope they do it justice.
0345803507|5.0|daughter loved it she had wanted to continue the set so it was a surprise to her to receive it
0525952926|5.0|I'm impatiently waiting for the 3rd. in this awesome series by Ken.  He is a tremendously talented author and storyteller!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Really fun game.  I've been addicted to it since downloading.  I like how there are easy puzzles and get harder.  All levels are the same, just different grids (5x5 to 15x15).
B00B4804P8|4.0|I was able to buy the movie at a super cheap price and was able to still use the code for my iPhone and iPad.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Luckily it has Noah Wyle and great costume and set design. It is worth giving it some time to find its groove.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Being a huge Elvis fan since the late seventies, nothing he could do is going to mean as much or be as good as Get Happy, or Imperial Bedroom,yet this retains the mood and high quality all the way thru the 3 bonus tracks.When the weakest cut is the title track you know you have a heckuva an album.Wise Up Ghost has a modern and old sound that simultaneously fits like a glove to fit these dystopian times.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent read! I was prepared for boring or kitschy and was amazed by the depth and honesty within. This book should not be missed.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|It's fun but at the higher levels there doesn't seem to have any clues so that just leaves you blank.  After a while you just don't go back to figure it out because you're stuck.
0143122061|4.0|Excellent book. Must read and think about it conclusions and how it affects our day to day routine. . .
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|So this was the first Neil Gaiman book I have read after being pestered by a friend on how great he was but honestly this will prob be my last Neil Gaiman book I will read.  It was just blah.  No major character development which made none of the main characters interesting at all. Neil created this fantasy world that intertwined in the &#34;real&#34; world but did not give it any sort of vivid description which left it boring.  It was a short book that seemed to unnecessarily drag on.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's great. My son used it for his homework. Its nice and big easy to see. Like it better than my cell phone calculator.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|Great part 2 totally solid and will be played for a long time even better when matched with the first one. Way to go Justin
B00E0SX118|4.0|As family viewing, it's pleasant enough: primitive, yes, but in a digitally sophisticated way that's boisterous, funny and will no doubt sell a lot of toys.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|I luv this movie!  I had to get it and glad I found it for such a good price! You can't even tell it's used.
B005DCJ1J6|4.0|It's not a story so much as a reverie about possible stories.<br /><br />Thought-provoking movie for teens and up.<br /><br />A deliberately old-fashioned picture that succeeds in nearly everything it tries to do.
B00000J048|4.0|I love the gears and the ability to place the gears in several different places on each tile, but the tiles themselves are hollow and a little flimsier than I would have liked.  When assembling the base it tended to shift or fall apart easily.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This is the tale of those poor schmucks in red who always seem to die just to prove how serious things are for Captain Twerk and Mr. Smock.  Their situation is exactly as ridiculous and lethal as you would think.  These poor blokes beam down with the landing party, and the killer robots announce their presence by shoving a jagged spike through some poor bastard's red-shirted back.  Or maybe it's the subterranean sand sharks, or the exploding instrument panel.  Whatever the threat, stage-left of Captain Twerk is probably the most dangerous place in the universe.<br /><br />In short, it's a hellish life filled with random brutality, and there is no way to transfer off this ship unless you're fated to be killed in the exiting shuttle.  There's nothing they can do about it, and they can see the statistics on the wall just like anyone else - anyone except the dashing officers, of course.  But then, one day, the find out why this is happening to them.<br /><br />The why, of course, is the big reveal of the novel, and if you haven't already heard it, it's worth letting the book reveal it in its own way.  But that's not the end of it.  Nope.  The real tale is what these unlucky corpses-to-be decide to do about it, and I have to admit that even though I saw where it might be going, I was impressed by how they pulled it off.<br /><br />Now, this novel also has three \\"codas\\", and it gets a lot of grief over that.  These are basically three short stories that follow the natural consequences of what happens in the main novel.  They're not properly part of the same conflict and climax, but they are necessary collateral storylines that would have normally been left hanging.  Instead, Scalzi wraps them up and does a good job with them.  My only complaint was that he got a little too artsy in his choice of POV.  That the first and third stories were in first person and third person respectively was just fine.  But telling the second one in second person was a contrivance too far.  Igot what he was doing, but I felt it was unnecessarily awkward.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed it.  I don't think it's Scalzi's best work by far, but I won't begrudge it the Hugo award.
B005898CFI|4.0|John Wayne does a nice job in a different role.  I thought the scenes were very realistic and there were some really funny parts of the movie.  We all enjoyed watching this one
B00DQHZZ0O|4.0|There's nothing like a circular polarizer for making your pictures look better, but the Sony's RX-100 II does not let you attach filters without an adapter like this one.<br /><br />I bought this from the Sony store along with my camera, and it works great - it was simple to install and appears stable. I used my camera for three weeks, taking this adapter on and off (simpler than unscrewing filter) several times a day, and the mount still appears as attached as ever.<br /><br />One thing it lacks is a rear cover - when you take your adapter (and filter) off, it would be nice to just click this on to a rear cover and slap on a lens cover onto the filter so they don't get dirty in your pocket.
0783240287|5.0|Loved it!!  Music great and so was the action.  Very colorful.  A very &#34;fun&#34; production!!  Saw it in person so brings back many memories.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is really well written.  It is a great beach read or long plane or train ride.  The story was believable, the characters were well developed and it was an easy going read.  I really enjoyed this book.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Loved it!!  Singing was extraordinary. Saw it live and this brought back many memories.  Play it a lot just as background.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|The book serves up nice stories, nice anecdotes, and nice analysis of both current societal situation and life's of various folks (some famous and some not so famous).  In doing so, like self-help books, the book tells what sort of life changes will work now and possibly in the near future.<br /><br />While the book does get a bit repetitive after midway, readers will appreciate the overall message of the book \\"to focus on the here, the now, and on a healthy, good, and wholesome you.\\"
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Love this CD!  Very glad I purchased one of the older CD's they put out as it has quite a few very good songs.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|I purchased this lantern for emergency use when the power goes out here in Central Virginia. It seems to be bright enough and will the job when there is a need for it.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I really like the way this movie was put together.  Each character has a unique outlook and its fun to watch it from their angle.  I watch it over and over (and with commentary too).
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Lots of action.  It would have gotten 5 stars if it were a show I thought I would watch again
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read the book after seeing the movie. The book is great and a smooth read, it was hard to put down.
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie has everything going for it.  I especially LOVE the scene where they are by the fire playing the bagpipes near the beginning of the movie.  &#34;Sigh.....&#34;  :)  Excellent story as well....
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I would probably give more if I could find out how to get rid of the keyboard when not needed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever. If u like endless running games like I do then this game is definitely for u.
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|Poor quality and I was unable to view the cd kept jumping and I could not go from part one to part two.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was adventure packed and kept me on the edge of my seat! Loved it and can't wait for the next book!
B004132I4S|5.0|Sufjan Stevens took quite the departure from his acoustic based masterpieces (&#34;Seven Swans&#34;, &#34;Illinois&#34;) with the &#34;Age of Adz&#34;: gone are most of the flowing violins and banjos, and in their place are the bleeps and bloops of the electronic age. It paid off. &#34;I Want To Be Well,&#34; &#34;Vesuvius,&#34; and &#34;Get Real, Get Right,&#34; are songs all Sufjan fans should enjoy (even those banjo-strumming purists). For even though the sound is different, Steven's lyrical genius still underlies every song. Sufjan makes you look into yourself, while also giving your ears a much needed vacation.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book brought me to tears. In the three weeks that I have owned it on my Kindle, I have read it at least five times. It exceeds the hype. Everyone should read this book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Sincere, and so real and a page turner as well.  This is a must read!  You'll be so glad you did!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|If you're an avid Michael Jackson fan as I am, then this Bluray is definitely well worth it! I live in the U.S., and neither a DVD nor Bluray release of this film ever happened here, and this European region pressing of the film is cheaply priced, and features full 1080p picture quality along with awesome sound as well. This film showed Michael at what was arguably the height of his career, having both the Thriller and Bad albums under his belt at this time, being the highest-selling album of all time and one of the highest-selling albums respectively. A retrospective shows nearly all of Michael's greatest hits up to 1988, and such songs as &#34;Speed Demon&#34;, &#34;Leave Me Alone&#34;, &#34;Smooth Criminal&#34;, and &#34;Come Together&#34; are woven into the film as ways of advancing the story as well. By all means purchase this Bluray, it's a wonderful film and should be in any Michael Jackson fan's collection!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This is a wonderful, under the radar, coming of age story right up there with the best of that genre.  Don't know if it was adapted from a novel or an original screenplay. But, I think there is nothing better than a well-written story, even when you don't have a first-class cast.  But here the two are combined and it's feature film at it's best.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I probably won't watch it again, but it is interesting with fun characters. Now I have to write 7 more words.
1476734941|4.0|The weight comes off slowly. If you are a person who likes routine with a lot freedom this can work for you. Eat what you want and only 2 days to control yourself. Not a bad deal.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Bought this after reading reviews of other jumpers.  the product is all that it says it is.  Put our 5 month old in it and her face lit up.  She loves it.  Not hard to put to put together.  Sounds and lights keep her entertained.  No problems with the springs or any of the materials.  At first questioned the floppy bumblebee/butterfly thinking that it should be more rigid so that it sticks up.  However. this has proved to be one of her favorite things because she is able to grasped it and pull it to her.  so now I understand the theory behind that.  Great product
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|Very good movie!!! Very well done! I will recommend this movie to everyone. Great directing. Just a great colorful ride of a movie.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I was completely enmeshed in Cheryl's trek and was reading it at a time when I needed some additional support. What an inspiration.<br />Peggymimi
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books. It is a good fun story to read. And if you grew up in the eighties or are any form of nerd, geek or dork, you will love all of the great video game, music, and classic pen and paper rpg references.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|Saw him on a guitar special,(axs t.v),he's right up there,w/Stevie Ray Vaun,Joe Bonamassa,Hendrix is smiling !!!!,,He could headline,W/Captain Amerrica,&Billy man!,&#34;We're Headliners Baby&#34;!!!!:)
B00821PCJS|4.0|Evidently Season One was released in 2011 and I must have missed it then, but it was even better now with no commercials and being able to view all the episodes at my leisure.  The plot is good and the acting is good; I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good scifi series.  I viewed all Season One in 3 evenings because I kept wanting to see 'what happens next' as I bumped through the episodes; it did not disappoint.  The theme is: aliens invade the earth and enslave children, Why?
0312106122|5.0|Everything you ever wanted to know about ancient Egypt--love, war, geography, history, religion and politics.  Similar to Michener, but  covering a lifetime, rather than eons.  Smith's best of many excellent novels.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Better than expected.  Many applications leave one disappointed, this one doesn't.  I find myself just sitting creating problems to solve just to see how well it works.  It's fascinating because I remember paying thousands of dollars for a calculator that did much less.
1451695187|5.0|My friend told me about this book after losing my father recently. It sounded very interesting to me. I do like these type of books. I began reading it and can't put it down. I'm almost done reading it. I got the book very quickly. Great service, I would order from this person again. Thanks!
0684803356|4.0|Classic story well enjoyed. Wanted to reread Hemingway. Passed it on to a friend to enjoy also.  Recommend it highly
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo is a well written and acted film. It maintains its excitement level even with repeated viewings. I enjoyed this film's view of Hollywood and it is no wonder that the film did not get much recognition in the awards. The film's pace is very good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The interesting start to their relationship kept my attention- and the progression of their feelings was interesting-based on his prior relationships with women
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Updated the app and now it won't open. I am a little disappointed and wish I dint update in the first place
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book Two is great!  I liked it better than one and three-more excitement in the story, its a page turner
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great little puzzle game. Logic based gameplay, so you don't have to use the clues, but they're there if you need them. Game goes by fast, but was fun and satisfying.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is no doubt the best English &#34;country house weekend&#34; mystery ever made, with a stellar cast and production design - the settings are sumptuous.  But the best of all is the music soundtrack - you will enjoy this forever, long after the movie.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Surprising staging and surprising voices from the stars. Who knew Hugh Jackman or Russel Crowe could sing so well? But they do quite well. Not perhaps as live as if they were on stage but still on the small screen it is a very pleasant effort.  The musical does cut some of the bits of the story, (if you are familier witht he earlier movie versions) for time, but all in all nicely done. I recommend it.
0061992860|4.0|It is a good book, but it is written for another country so not everything is as easy to find as you will wish it to be.  But still glad I bought it!
0345803507|5.0|The end of a great story of the power of love...looking forward to seeing the movie....Had much trouble putting the<br />book down...Another dynasty story created with a twisted history of upbringing a child using abusive relations and<br />brainwashing.  Put the past away and leave the memories of pain behind and go on to build a new life with great<br />memories.<br /><br />.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found the book a little wordy and it did drag a bit.  Too much detail.  It did have times when the story moved right along.  The ending was not what I expected.
0345803493|5.0|Was a great thriller of life's difficulties!  How to deal with all the problems and jealousies of life...hard to put the book down...got a better perspective of the players in this publication. Lots of confusion with the personalities...but<br />needed to go on and read number III.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Great show. Awesome excitement and suspense. I would suggest this show to anyone that has enjoyed anything about Sherlock Holmes
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I didn't see the twist and that's too rare not to appreciate.  The effects are also really great.  The Eye is watching...
B009NY43NY|5.0|I know Ms. Harris has completed your Sookie Stackhouse series but I am do wish there were more Sookie books to look forward to.  Having already read them all, I enjoyed each and every one of them.
B00E9P959O|2.0|First of all I am a huge Rush fan and have been for more years than I care to reveal as it would certainly show my age.  When it was announced that the Vapor Trails remix was going to be released I couldn't wait.  Now I wish they would have just let sleeping dogs lie.  Very disappointed.  He cleaned it up for sure and I can appreciate the separation and space given to it but now it has no punch.  The mix is inconsistent and weak.  Most of the time the guitars are too far back.  The bass, while clearer, has no life.  I can't hear the drums, there is no power there.  Why he would eliminate the most powerful part of Ceiling Unlimited when Geddy and Alex are going off the deep end and put an out of place guitar solo over it I'll never understand.  I love the songs, always have.  At least the original mix, albeit overcooked in places, at least it slapped you in the face.  It had power and it was up front.  Vapor Trails is a very complex record.  This remix has left me broken hearted.  I find it hard to take that this is what Geddy and Alex wanted and signed off on.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A story of life. Trials and tribulations. Ups and downs, turmoil, hope and brokenness. Finding and losing and finding again. An understanding that not everything turns out as planned or wanted. But it turns out regardless. You make it what it supposed to be for you. A very deep read.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|We really liked this movie. Sean Penn, as always, is excellent. Great cast, great movie. We'll definately watch this movie again.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Wish they had done a different story other than Khan.  No one can top Recardo Montalban and the story has been told.  They need to do something new and fresh.  Get back to the 5 year mission.  Go out into the cosmos and find some aliens!
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|You know how sometimes you buy a movie with low expectations because  the 'numbers (Ironman 1,2,3, and so on) go on and on forever? You gotta have the set, right?<br /><br />But they had a winner script with this one. Cool action scenes and Stark's snark and trademark humor flowed.
B00EP0KYDO|4.0|I read the book first so it gives you a much better ability to follow it and understand why they are doing what they do in the movie @ technology, etc. Jaden Smith is beginning to grow in his acting ability and I thought it was ok overall. It was just an enjoyable movie given that it was just that: entertainment.<br />It would be nice to see some follow up movies to it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Wish there were more puzzles.  Other than that a fun game. Thanks for making it the free app of the day.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this book because Mary has met her cousin who is a Prince and she store up to him and no one has been able to do that ever. In this book Mary Lennox finds the key that belonged to a garden door that has been locked up for ten years and unlocks the garden. The garden belonged to  Mr. And Mrs. Craven but Mr. Craven locked up the den because he hated it because his wife, Mrs. Craven, had sat on one of the branches of the rose Bush trees and it broke with her on it and she died because of that and Mr.Craven and Mrs. Craven are colins parents
034580404X|5.0|Exciting, Good read, Puts you in fantasyland. The firsat book really kept my interest, but the other 2 kind of lost that loving feeling(not so exciting)..But still a good book.
1401938906|3.0|The essence of this book has merit. For it distills abundance down to the base line for everyday living.<br /><br />The big thinkers that Pam assembled and quoted in context were the best part of this book...For they demystified the notion that living a life of abundance has something to do with the stars and planets in alignment...But as was reaffirmed by all of them along with Pam Grout, has everything to do with you and the power within to chart and therefore attain life on your terms.<br /><br />But the experiments almost became a caricature of the of the integrity of the grace that a life of abundance delivers...Much in the same way that diet pills mask the reality of having to really do the work to produce the intended results.<br /><br />So here's my experiment for you...Believe it...own it...be grateful...then you shall see it!
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|This album was JT best yet..... If your are gonna get this album, get the target deluxe version. It has two extra songs and a hidden track called pair of wings. Anyway I love the album. Can't wait for the next one.
0321811984|5.0|This book is a game changer! Do yourself and your colleagues a favor and buy this book, put the concepts into practice, and pass on the knowledge so we can all benefit from fewer &#34;death by powerpoint&#34; meetings. :)
B0087WRGVY|5.0|With out a doubt this was the best AOR heavy rock album of 2012. Erik Martensson over the last few years has been one of the busier song writers in the industry providing countless  high quality AOR rock. Well when it comes to AOR hard rock, well it really does not get any better than this. Bleed and Screem proves why he is the best. This album provides hard hitting, riff driven, hook laden powerhouse of an album.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this product as it is easy to read and has good references. It has a wide range of choices for a variety of learners<br />.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It used to work perfectly now it doesnt even let me log in. its so annoying someone fix it asap
B00EYE0ECW|5.0|I use this app a lot to plan road trips to just about anywhere. I would say that the directions are right on about 98% of the time.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Highly enjoyable book. Looking forward to reading the rest of this series. Characters are well defined. The different sci fi characters abilities etc are sometimes hard to follow, but they explain things more then once for you.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have been using yahoo mail for many years and find it really easy to use. I'm able to sort and put my mail where it is easy for me to find. Use the folder option for a lot of different programs that I'm involved in.
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|We purchased this toy and have exchanged it twice already.  The heads fall off immediately and never really go back on the same.  We decided to keep them and not return a third time because our daughters LOVE Sophia the first but I will not recommend this product to anyone else.  There is another boxed playset by Disney that is a lot more durable.  The arms don't move but at least the heads don't fall off.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love it! So addictive. One of the best puzzle games I've played in a while! Definitely a good brain exerciser.
B007OWRBJK|2.0|Buy a house, set up a studio, buy a boat, find another girl friend, and repeat.  After a couple chapters you get the picture.  One change is the music gets worse.
0802473156|1.0|This book about caused me and my girlfriend to break up. If you think you guys need this book, try going to a shrink first.
B006M9NJFG|4.0|Very well thought out. The canteen seems durable and well made for the price. The canteen is larger than I expected, which is good to me as it holds more water. The canteen holster seems well made, I'll see how well it holds up over time.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Have had this game for a while, just deleted it, the ads that pop up are crazy!!!!!  Like I said had this game for a long time now but the ads are worse than ever. Cannot take it any more, the ads are longer and harder to bypass,REALLY, the game is is not worth the harassment.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It is better than the third one by far great story mode, sick weapons nice armour. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES ON THE kindle
0618001905|3.0|The book pages fell apart. Chunks of pages fell out of the book. Was still able to read, it was just annoying
B008KRJWEK|4.0|LIKE temple run but with cars and monsters.  Needs more cars to buy and upgrades through. But still cool and fun
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Absolutely great fast paced loved every minute of it. Never read this author before cannot wait to find another of her books.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I hated this show so much it made my barf watching it. The only thing i liked about it was master bates
B008602KQI|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait to see the other Hunger Games movies. Very entertaining movie.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|A fantastic movie with fast paced action with very good acting.This was a very long movie almost two hours long though
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Just love the guys, they are so much fun! The movie was so good and entertaining! So much worth buying!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I am fairly new to this type of game, this is only the fourth game of this type I have ever downloaded. I was pleasantly surprised.<br />This particular game makes working each puzzle much clearer to the eye. The option to chip away the empty boxes makes it much more visually friendly.<br />While I don't use the hint button, it makes for a mental &quot;rescue&quot; in my brain. One can get a hint when needed, or you can just have the peace of mind knowing help is available.<br />Also very nice twist the way each puzzle are part of a bigger picture.<br />Works smoothly, no glitches on my Kindle Fire HD
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the series but the dvd would stop for awhile and then start up again. This was frustrating. Cannot wait for season 4
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Was just what we wanted ,so glad we purchased,no problems!!!,will make future purchases if we want other shows or movies.
B004F77SHC|4.0|This is exactly what I was looking for. Hard to find, but once I did I jumped at the chance to buy it. Great buy!
B003VW8GT6|5.0|I have always liked Wayne's movies, even the early &#34;oaters&#34;.  He is my symbol of what is right, and more!
B008RZF2I0|5.0|A number of the songs on this album shot up to the top of my favorites list (Sacrimony, Torn, My Confession). The design of the booklet/album case is beautiful. And 4 weeks after purchase I saw Kamelot live of the Silverthorn tour. :3

B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife is a very well-crafted law drama with engaging, thought-provoking, and suspenseful episodes. This series also makes some law terms more familiar.

B00CHVJODE|3.0|In DreamWorks \\"The Croods\\" a prehistoric family embarks on the very first road trip ever!  After their cave is destroyed, they must go in search of a new home - with the help of a handsome stranger named Guy.<br /><br />Who are The Croods?  They are Dreamwork's rendition of a caveman family - the father, Grug, is always warning his family about the dangers outside.  He wants to keep his family safe - \\"in the dark.\\"<br /><br />Grug has a wife and a restless teenage daughter named Eep - there is also a not-too-bright overweight son, a strange growling baby, and a crusty grandma character.  Then along comes Guy - a handsome stranger (with a cute pet named Belt) who lives for adventure and \\"following the sun.\\"  Eep is in love.  Grug is none too thrilled.<br /><br />Guy leads the Crood family through a very colorful prehistoric CG landscape filled with all sorts of neon bright fanciful and furry critters that happen to have very large teeth.  Adventures ensues - despite the fact Grug is completely against them ensuing.  Will the family find a new home?  Or will they get eaten up by one of the many weird surrealistic creatures?  Will Grug and Guy ever get along?  After all, Guy is so different.  He uses his brain and comes up with brand new ideas.  Grug believes in just relying on his brawn.  Well, to find the answers to these questions, you'll just have to watch the movie and see.<br /><br />The visuals in this movie are fantastic.  Lots of interesting and colorful \\"eye candy\\" to keep little kids transfixed.  However.....and it's a BIG however...I feel the story leaves a bit to be desired - from an adult standpoint.  Like I said, little kids will no doubt love it.  But the plot is just so clich&eacute; and typical....the humor is so lazy and un-clever it makes you want to yawn (think:  Hotel Transylvania).  I think I chuckled twice during the whole film - and I thought it was going to be an outrageous comedy!!!  Not so.  The Croods is not clever and sophisticated like the Shrek movies.  It is even less sophisticated than the Ice Age movies, in my opinion.<br /><br />The characters are not very unique - you never really warm up to any of them, like you do with Shrek or Donkey or even Sid the Sloth.  Eep as the teenage daughter is so woefully predictable.  And what's with the weird hourglass figure and overly shapely legs?  Is that really necessary for a kid's movie?<br /><br />Certain comments Grug makes about \\"killing the grandma\\" struck me as disturbing.  I know it's just supposed to be comedy, but still...<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most about the movie, is that it literally hits you over the head with too much sappy family \\"I love you's\\"....it seemed forced.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the movie - as you can probably tell!  I recommend you see it once - just for the visuals...but maybe rent before buying.  Unless you have a child under 10 - then go ahead and purchase the movie.  They'll love it!k movies.

B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I love Jonathan and Charlotte singing together. They have fantastic sound. I hope they do well together.<br />This is their first album.
B005USZML4|5.0|As all the books in John Grisham Theodore Boone series, this novel is again fun to read and hard to put it away before finishing it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It is a fun game.  So far no issues.  I don't like how I have to post a review or like on Facebook to go further in the game.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|The John Grisham Theodore Boone series novels are very enjoyable, fun and easy to read. Adults and young people enjoy them the same way.
B00D82BNLC|5.0|You get pulled into this story right away, as the author uses first person narrative to pull off an authentic build. Then we are introduced to a cast of characters that feel as if they are people we've known for a while. COAST TO COAST PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION: THE JOURNEY UNDERNEATH by CAROLYN BENNETT takes off from there. It's a fast moving book and as soon as we get to the abandoned hospital it gets even faster. Bennett has a knack for writing scary scenes. This is not a book to read alone. What a great TV series this would make. In the meantime, she off to an exciting start of a cool paranormal series of books! Recommended - 5 spooky stars!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This latest John Grisham book is as good as all others. It is hard to put it away before finishing it. Like most o the Grisham's books.
0321543726|4.0|I think the title should be \\"C++ programming principles and practice\\" because most of the programming skills presented by this book is very C++ specific. Also this book convinces me that C++ should not be the first programming language for new beginners. There are lots of programming details involved with C++ in order to create robust codes for classes especially to avoid memory leaks. Anyway, this book is good for anyone who wants to learn C++ but with more or less programming background.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I am a John Grisham fan, I read all his books, including this Theodore Boone series written for young people. &#34;Kid Lawyer&#34; is equal good to all other books of this series.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Loved reading this.  It gives a great prospective of the everyday lives of people living in North Korea.  I was captivated by the stories of the ordinary people who were really quite extraordinary for even surviving.  Quick and interesting read.  I would definitely recommend.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|this will be a classic. my wife and I enjoyed it. the acting was great. I hope they make a sequel.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I purchased this product based on the hope that it could provide maximum output for my iPad while simultaneously charging an iPhone. I compared it to the [[ASIN:B0077PM3KG Scosche USBC202M  Dual 10 Watt (2.1A) USB Car Charger]] and the [[ASIN:B006NB9WTK USAMS Compact High Output Dual USB Car Charger - 3.1A]]. To test these chargers, I connected an iPad (3rd generation) with a depleted battery operating at maximum brightness with the GPS being actively used. I measured the amperage from each charger to the iPad using a [[ASIN:B00DF2485S PortaPow USB Power Monitor]].<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The USAMS dual charger (which advertises 3.1 Amps) couldn't charge at more than 0.925 Amps on either port.<br /><br />The Anker dual charger (which advertises 3.6 Amps max, and a 2.4 Amp port) maxed out at 1.8 Amps for the Apple port and 0.928 Amps on the Android port.<br /><br />The Scocshe dual charger (which advertises dual 2.1 Amp ports) maxed out at 1.92 Amps on either port.<br /><br />The Scocshe was the clear winner.  The Anker port marked \\"Apple\\" provided 0.1 Amps less than the Scocshe. The Android port was unable to provide more than 1 Amp, which is fine for an iPhone but not enough to charge an operating iPad without the battery continuing to decline. The USAMS charger is clearly mislabeled because neither port could provide more than 0.925 Amps.<br /><br />I understand that non-Apple devices may require different ports for purposes of drawing maximum power. My review only reveals the results of testing with an iPad.
B008220D5K|5.0|This movie is funny. It may be a bit crude and exaggerated, but it is still humorous. I don't get why people and critics have been so harsh. Underneath of it all, there are many truths to its \\"message.\\"<br /><br />So, lighten up folks and grab some popcorn and enjoy!<br /><br />.....and don't be so harsh on this and other comedies......good grief we have become a grumpy nation.<br /><br />Personally, I laughed my 50ish azz off.
B004132HZS|5.0|I am a Sherlock Holmes fan, and I have enjoyed the various interpretations from different actors, including Jeremy Brett to Johnny Lee Miller and now Benedict Cumberbatch (and yes, I even enjoyed Robert Downey Jr.) The adaptation of Johnny Lee Miller to the modern day Holmes in America and Benedict Cumberbatch to the modern day Holmes in London are inspired, and I enjoy both immensely. Jeremy Brett remains the standard that remained true to the original Doyle books, and even though I was skeptical about how the stories would appear in a modern setting, I am grateful that the writers and the actors have done such a great job keeping Sherlock Holmes alive and entertaining in the 21st century!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I liked the way the main character becomes unstuck in time to cope with a horrific situation. The men of WW 2 had a difficult time dealing with the aftermath of that war.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|I'm no expert or critic just a run of the mill dad that enjoys being taken out of this world for a time in a fun, though provoking book that challenges my imagination and takes it to new heights. Because of that I am a huge Sanderson fan! For a guy that can say he loves Tom Clancy and Timothy Zahn Starwar novels in the same sentence, Brandon has been able to meld the two together for me somehow that is just awesome. Fantasy....but somehow not too much fantasy. Not sure how he does it but he does it for me. That being said...Steelheart was a let down. The other comments in the 3 star section really sum up how I felt. Steeheart seemed to be lacking the intrigue that normally accompanies Brandon's books. Although the effort was there, it just didn't work for some reason. It was predictable and even the parts I didn't see coming seemed blah when twists were revealed. Probably most disappointing however was the ending. One commentator made the connection between Mistborn and Steelheart; what was missing from the connection were detailed fight scenes like in the end of Mistborn. Steelheart's ending left me wanting. It also felt a lot like reading the Ritmatist which I struggled with as well. Maybe Steeheart is intended for a younger audience and I just missed that in the advertising?<br /><br />All that being said the reason it gets a 3 start is because while reading I did find myself smiling and turning to my wife and saying...\\"that was awesome\\" So there were parts that I enjoyed and got my mind going and brought a smile to my face. I will probably read it again and would pick up the sequel....because a bad Sanderson book is still better than most. :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I fell in love with the game :D I like buying new characters and collecting powerups :P <3 Subway Suffers <3
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Only one word needed awesome! Absolutely love it, one of the best series ever made I have seen all of them.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun to do.  The only thing that I think would make it better would be to have different puzzles for the different size grids, instead of having to do the same ones again if you want to do all the size grids.
1401323820|5.0|This book was great. I love watching Castle on TV. The book was a nice addition to the TV show. It was a very easy read and kept my attention. Good plot twists. I ordered the following books.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun and challenging. New stuff to find in every level. Be sure to look closely at every picture. I love this game!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't understand why this book became so popular besides the fact that it is porn for housewives. It reminded me of Harlequin books. Story is predictable, and the writing is average at best. I lost interest half way through and could not finish it. Don't bother..
B00DC3DGSK|2.0|I must first start by saying I am a big fan of Buddy Guy. I own a good amount of his work and have seen him live many times. But how in the world can someone give this over produced and boring release five stars? One of the main problems is the albums producer, drummer, and main writer Tom Hambridge. He has made Buddy sound way to slick and lets him play the same solo over and over again. And the duet with Keith Urban, come on now, this is not the real blues by any stretch. And then there are the Aerosmith boys, who have not made a decent album since Rocks, so why would you let them destroy one of your songs? I admit there are a few good songs here, but this is a double CD with so much filler, it is sad. If you want to hear the real Buddy Guy, pick up Stone Crazy and hear for yourself how amazing Buddy truly is!
B001I5M9SC|5.0|Bravo, to watch and listen to Andrea & Sarah brings tears of joy to my eyes every time I play my blu ray disc. The entire cast of artists were magnificent.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun, fun, fun!  Don't usually play game. Keep them for grandkids. But tried this one and I am hooked.  Good for all ages (I am 70)  buy it, try it you will like it!!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I thought this game would be fun but when i played it with no other apps running it lagged like crazy, froze at times, even crashed sometimes. If you can get it to run im sure you'll enjoy it ;(
B004QOB8SY|5.0|'A scandal in Belgravia'  get me hook to the show. I'd already brought DVDs which a  quality was great but The Blu-ray was incredible!
B000006TZ8|5.0|I see that a lot of reviews attempt discuss which Jam album is the best. The short answer is all of them.<br /><br />In the City, All Mod Cons, Setting Sons, Sound Affects are all as good as each other. Even This is the Modern World (so often dogged) is a great album.<br /><br />They have different moods but each are filled with brilliant, lyrical, emotional songs and great tunes and great original musicianship. Buy all five and your favourite will be the one you are currently listening to -- until you play one of the others.<br /><br />Buy all five and listen to them (at high volume) in the order they were released and you won't be disappointed.

B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is such a clever program--great for all ages!  I just hope more episodes will be made.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Funny and sweet!
B00062PN6I|4.0|bought these for my granddaughter to use with her guitar amp so she won't drive her mom crazy. to late ?
B0065CCT6U|5.0|If you like Chris Cornell you'll really enjoy this.  If you're looking for the Soundgarden or Audioslave sound this is not it.  Listen to the samples and judge for yourself.  I like his voice and the lyrics he puts together.  I probably listen to this about twice a week while I'm at work.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I buy 90% of my movies through Amazon.com.  Its less expensive. The movie Flight was intense!  I was wondering why Denzel had played this pilot with all these character flaws.  I knew that redemption had a lot to do with it, and it did.
B005XLN97M|4.0|This was a gift for my niece.  It was easy to assemble and she loves it.  It will not take the abuse of an overly energetic child due to its somewhat flimsy parts.  Luckily my niece plays well with her toys and will probably enjoy this for years.
B002VWNIDG|2.0|The story was compromised by this film .  Nicholson showed no nuance in his performance . You could not imagine why he would ever have married Wendy, who is portrayed cartoonishly by a bug-eyed Shelly Duvall. The child who played Danny was simply wan.  Nicholson chewed so much scenery that he gave new meaning to the phrase dinner theatre. And where was the redemption ? The element KEY to the character of Jack Torrence !  Jack loved his wife and child . I found no evidence of that in Kubrick's film. He's over rated to my mind anyway.
0738711500|5.0|Haven't really gotten too far into the book yet, but scanning it I like the way it's outlined & am looking forward to delving in... the tarot cards are rich in color & detail, extremely pleased
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|In a word \\"believable\\" ! The lead actress plays several roles flawlessly. You don't for a minute not believe there are different characters on screen.<br />When she pretends to be another character in the scene, practicing to  act like the other character, awesome.<br />Looking forward to the new season.
0670026557|5.0|Give and take as a topic permeates our society in many ways.  Whether it is ACA/ Obamacare, our military intervention abroad, or 1% vs 99% etc,  I find Prof.Grant's thoughts on the topic shed light on the relevance for giving in this world and how there is value and success in giving.  I loved the book for giving us data around the give/take framework we have been using in our national conversations!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a non intents game with the purpose of helping to rebuild the forest kingdom yet makes one think to get the next bricks to move on. It does tend to take up you time.
B008HJGPVO|1.0|Im the kind of person who only leaves reviews to help others out; well, here's the deal--this stylus did not work well on my iPad mini. I have an older, much cheaper stylus that i wanted to replace with a thinner tip for sketching and such. This barely picked up on my writing and sliding did not work. I also use my ipad predominantly for reading for grad school, so I do a lot of hightlighting on pdfs, so if the pen doesn't slide, that makes it pretty hard to highlight. It is functional in that if you push really hard it will pick up, but it's not very accurate in that it lags behind.<br /><br />I hate 1 star reviews on products that have overall good reviews, and I generally assume those are outliers; however, this stylus just simply did not function as expected, and far worse than my $2 stylus. I might chalk this up to using it on an iPad, so I would just beware if this is why you/re purchasing it.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Quartet gave an amazing view of the elderly population, about life after retirement and continuing to live life to the fullest.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I could not put this book down, one of the best I have ever read.  You felt like you really new the characters as though you were part of them.  I know it is a good book when I am still thinking about it weeks later.
0553801473|5.0|If you like the first four books in this series you'll like this one too!<br />Just a heads up, if your new to this series, it jumps from character to character and the books are extremely long.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's  so awesome with the work tour how they go to different countries and have hunts. But I wish they always kept the hopper.
0788859544|5.0|I couldn't be more happy with this purchase!  My daughter is almost 3 years old and hasn't ever seen this movie, it's one of my favs since I was a child so I was super excited to watch it with her.  The DVD came brand new and before the scheduled delivery date.  What I liked most about the purchase was a hand written thank you letter from the seller!!  I have ordered many, many things from Amazon and haven't ever received a note like that!  I would definitely recommend purchasing and I personally look forward towards my next purchase from this buyer!!  Oh and I will just add...my daughter LOVES the move...we've watched it at least 30 times now since it arrived! :-)
B001E6X4W0|5.0|not a classical movie for vampires but a much mature take on them . big actors in this movie, deliver beautiful performances.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love this game!!!! I'm not that good but it's very fun to race. I love how different it is from other racing games I have had in the past.<br /><br />But, I downloaded it when it was free, now it I'd $0.99 and it keeps asking me if I want to update. Now I do not know how to just play it!  That is the only thing I am disappointed about in this game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game but too difficult for young children who cannot read<br />Horse looks very realistic.  Great for older kids to play.
B002VHI8T0|5.0|Well written, very emotive. Gave me a lot of clarity into what addicts are going through, and how very hard this addiction thing is.
B000267JQK|5.0|Seether has to be one of the most underrated bands around. Awesome CD.<br />Did not disappoint. Loved the bonus DVD as well.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|This movie really isn't \\"World War Z\\".  The producers paid Max Brooks for the name, and then threw his book in the trash can.  I can't really blame them for not filming the book, because the book couldn't possibly be translated into a good film, but the writers didn't even attempt to adapt the source material.  What is on the screen is really a rehash of \\"28 Days Later\\", with a contrived plot twist so that Brad Pitt could \\"solve\\" the mystery of how to defeat the zombies.<br /><br />The main problem is that the movie isn't particularly scary or engaging, and it has plot holes you could drive a truck through.  The first few minutes of the film are somewhat intriguing as society begins to break down, but after 30 minutes of seeing CGI zombies swarm like army ants, you just go numb.  Then you have Brad Pitt somehow miraculously surviving one attack after another, and stumbling from one clue to the next with one improbable turn of events after another.  And the ultimate \\"solution\\" - that a virus that almost instantly KILLS its host would for some bizarre reason choose not to infect sick people because they're about to die (???) - ranks right up there with \\"let's give the Independence Day invaders a computer virus\\" for stupid plot gimmicks.  Why not hand nursing home residents a bunch of weapons and have them wade into the zombie hordes and destroy them?  After all, they're about to die - they should be immune, right?  No, it doesn't make any sense - not one bit.<br /><br />Two stars for reasonable production quality.  It's not a terrible movie ... it's just not that good.  And while the writers left room for a sequel, I expect that it will be direct-to-video if it's ever made.
B009R54MGW|5.0|This book was one I found hard to put down the whole story fills in why HenryVIII was the way he was.  Philippa catches the period so realistically and u can feel the emotions flowing through the story. I would rec this book to anyone who wants to know the beginning of the Tudor Period.
0688091717|5.0|I read this to my preschoolers for 5 days in a row at our group meeting time.  By the end of the week they could tell it back to me.  They loved it!  They love to talk about what it means when a rain cloud &#34;bursts&#34; open and what &#34;patchwork&#34; means.  They loved figuring out which elephant was Elmer when they were all &#34;elephant colored.&#34;  We talked about how the illustrator/author gave you a clue (&#34;his eyes are open and the other ones are closed!&#34;) as to which one was him.  And discussed why Elmer felt sad and lonely. They're ready for their own parade now. =)

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google's Chromecast took the MiniPC/TVBox market by storm with good reason: It's the lowest cost and simplest way to stream online videos to an HDTV's HDMI input.<br /><br />There are only a few content suppliers with Chromecast compliant apps: Netflix and Google originally, Hulu Plus as of 10/2/2013.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a very good calculator. It is so easy to use.  I haven't found anything else that is this easy and self-explanatory.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Awesome game. A great way to learn the rules of Magic: The Gathering if you've never played the paper game.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Very intense. Music, acting, singing all very well done.  Brought me to tears a number of times. Not for children.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't want to read any book about BDSM, but one way or the other I picked up this book and read. I actually like it, scratch that, love it. Anastasia did not give Christian carte blanch about his sex quark. She actually told him he was crazy. I like their relationship so far. If it will go down south after this, I'll wait to see.<br /><br />The h, has a backbone, which is a plus in this plot. Can't wait to read book 2.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Can't believe how good of a price this mouse has, I especially love that all the buttons are reprogrammable. Normally when you buy a fancy mouse some of the buttons have fixed functions that you can't change (DPI switchter) - that's not the case with this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I choose this book because it mentioned the husband's secret, not the wife's. The story is a bit slow starting, but once it gets started you can't put it down. I truly enjoyed it
B000FCKPHG|5.0|I wish I had had the insight from this book when I was in high school. I was an archetypal fixed mindset, and this caused me lots of anxiety, sadness, and stress in high school and, especially, in college. The benefits of the growth mindset are so much more desirable and satisfying. While the book presents a simplistic view of these characteristics, there is an overwhelming amount of beneficial information, especially for educators. I would like to see more research into the transitional stages between fixed and growth mindsets. Sequel? Thank you for a great read!
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Jeff Nichols is proving to be a very talented director. I found myself able to commiserate with a man whose mental illness I had no way of possibly relating to. If you enjoy Take Shelter, check out Mud. His films are like cinematic revelations. AMAZING!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|this movie took me back to a simpler time.  muppet fans wont be dissapointed.  Jason segel outdid himself.  cant go wrong
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Very different from the first version but just as much fun!  I recommend it to Star Wars fans.  Get yours today.
0670026557|5.0|I just never really thought about it before, but I really am a GIVER, and it is okay. The key is to give within reason and smartly...
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I am using this to run a second display from my thunderbolt MacBook Air to my iMac which is too old to support thunderbolt and not large enough to support target display mode. Pushing 1920x1080 over the wireless was pretty laggy, but running the display over this is just fine. Not fast enough without some lag, but it is much less than over the wireless, and is much more useable. File transfers between the two computers is also speedy. Given that it will be some time before the iMac gets replaced with a newer model, this works just fine. All but one of my apps work fine with a wired + wireless setup, so I'm pleased.<br /><br />Works as advertised, just like you'd expect from Apple.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|This software lets me do what I need and I could do it no other way it works very well it does work a little better on Apple to Microsoft or Microsoft to Microsoft it's still a little clumsy on android but worth every cent

B008133MDK|5.0|I've watched Sherlock seasons1 & 2 and found them both to be well written and intellectually stimulating.  The acting by Cumberbatch and Freeman is top notch and both have transformed their characters (created more than 100 years ago) into modern day crime solvers.  Rent this series, you will not be disappointed.
B00321GTJU|5.0|The cinematography was out of this world!  My children love these types of programs and I love letting them watch it.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Much more intriguing then the 2nd book in the series! I really like the twists and turns of this adventure.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Before the guy got to WHO I didn't know why he was inspired by someone bypassed by zombies...the theory setting is real good. As promised zombies are faster and more furious(when attracted by noise), arousing more adrenalin during watch. I liked the part that a sea of zombies invaded Israel, it was epic. However, I still think there should be more scene on fighting zombies (like the scenes at the near end of the movie), instead of fleeing from them all through the plot. Overall it's a groundbreaking zombie movie, and it's really worth a second watch.
0525478817|5.0|What can I say about a book that already has thousands of reviews. Another review would just be repetitive and pointless in a grand scheme of things. So, I'm just gonna drop in a few of my personal thoughts.<br /><br />The Fault in our Stars is a heart-breaking reality of what goes though the mind of teenagers with cancer. It felt to real to me. I was so building myself up for the reality of one thing happening, that when the other happened I was angry, sad, wanted to throw things, and to quote Hazel, \\"This is such bull----!\\"<br /><br />Yet, through it all. All the pain and the sadness--I maintain that this book should be required reading in High Schools. The demand to updated required reading in schools has been a long time coming. It is time to give teens a book that is absolutely something they can relate to.<br /><br />To be honest, when I had to read To Kill a Mockingbird in high school I didn't appreciate it. I read it again two years ago and then it all clicked. Teens don't care about stories like that. They care about stories like The Fault in Our Stars. Give them a book they will actually WANT to read when it comes that time!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|It's techy, humorous, touching and lots of things blow up. Also, don't try to watch this until you've seen Avengers (which of course you have right??)
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game. .. it's like wario ware but crazy. It a lot of fun and runs great on my galaxy s3. ( even the plane mission(.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|Excellent drama, exciting and fun to watch for teens upward.  A little scary for those under 10 yrs.<br />This is a film, like Phone Home, that I would watch several times.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|this game is awesome and it helped me learn english, I like it because you can pass levels and you have lives.
B005P4P966|5.0|Still one of the funniest on the tube. Lenard is my favorite straight man.<br />Wardrobes could change a little, maybe some play with that would be fun.<br />All in all, a great comedy show.
1934030198|3.0|But this book is more geared to the intermediate or advanced triathlete. I am only starting out, so it is a little beyond where I am now. I would have liked something simpler.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was able to beam content from my web browser on my PC as well as Netflix from my phone.  The only problem was Wi-Fi reception isn't the greatest, but I just set up an extended network router closer to the TV and I haven't had a problem since.
B00D6QU6RW|3.0|It's boring and weak CD. I was expecting more with Kevin return<br />I just bought because I have ALL Backstreet boys CD's.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|too bad the movie was so disappointing for this series. Now they've cancelled the remaining films.<br /><br />Think the writing and characters are worthy of a series of films
B009UZBLSG|2.0|When it worked it was great. I was perfectly mirroring my Nexus 4 screen to my HDTV. Now it is dead and not working anymore, tried with several Android devices and no luck. I paid 3 times more compared to similar products from other hoping for high quality and i am disappointed. Do know if i can claim any warranty? will try.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A bit different from other romance novels. Not quite what I was expecting, but I certainly wasn't disappointed. Kept my attention and couldn't put it down. I highly recommend reading it.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I really wanted the leather hard cover but kids were getting for me for Christmas.  So I decided to get this one as a stand in until I got &#34;the good one&#34;.  Well, in my opinion, this beats the heck out of the other.  With the flexibility there are more options & positions for standing as well as viewing movies.  Easy to clean, elastic band vs magnetic closure, no big deal!  Nice color selection & excellent price @ time I purchased.  I love it!
B00004X10B|5.0|I needed something for two digital SLRs and all my lenses and accessories.  It all fit nicely into this bag...but now it is too heavy to carry anywhere without my hubby being long to carry it for me! HA!  I guess I will hang on to my smaller camera bag for when it's just me!
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|Thought it would of been better.<br />I was not happy with this movie at all.<br />Cloud atlas.........hmmm cloudy mind lol
B004LROUNG|4.0|Great character development and flow. Lightweight, but keeps you reading.<br />A small, uncluttered stage of few characters, but lots of heart.
B0091THRCU|5.0|The case is high quality and performs exactly as advertised. I would recommend this case for anyone who doesn't want to use any ther type cover on their phone.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|A good game<br /><br />A great way to spend some time. I would like to try some of their other games.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to say that Mr. Howey has driven me nuts this week.  I couldn't put this book down.  My kitchen is a wreck, my kids are out of control, and I had a few choice words for 'said author' more than once when he would reveal an unexpected twist just as I was about to stop reading and get to my to-do list.  I can't wait to finish the series, and thanks to Amazon and the Kindle world, I can continue to ignore my responsibilities and begin Shift now.  This is seriously top notch writing.  You won't be disappointed!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This product us a lot better than other weather apps.  If you have the weather channel app try this one!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I'm not the most tech savvy, but this seems to be a cool app for my needs. I have used it a couple times and it works great.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|God must be evil!  Our darling girl (who happens to have lots of tattoos) can't go on solving fantastic mysteries through her hacking skills and just being herself.  Actually, the second book (involving fire) and the third (involving hornets) are really one book split in half but okay, I can deal with that.  My only hope is that there is someone out there who has the permission and skill to continue the series.  It has been done before and really want to see more of my darling girl even if it is not quite up to the author's skill.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I loved the show and it's been so long since I watched it I thought I'd start with the books. It's much darker than the show but still very good
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|This movie was well-crafted and very thoughtful.  We have always enjoyed Matthew McConaughey and, though he played a pivotal role, the movie was stolen by younger actors.  It  was thoroughly enjoyable.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|The Great Gatsby was everything that was promised and more. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was outstanding while Carey Mulligan played Daisy Buchanan flawlessly. The visuals were wonderful. I would recommend this movie to my friends.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|One of the great sci fi series!  So sad to see it go away; it was good, clean fun, even tho it had a bit of violence.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|Have had these sandals for years, my main use for them is the beach, and most of the time I actually do not take them off, I do swim with them especially if the beach is rocky. They are quite durable I would say, and the velcro staps hold very well, no issue with them at all, and their stiching is very good. The sandal base is soft from inside, and hard on the bottom side and holds confidently on wet rocks. They are comfortable and can be used for long walks I would say, although I do not use them other than for the beach because I prefer leather sandals for a more comfortable fit. And they clean nicely when washing.
B008Y212PI|5.0|The game is fun to play. It makes you think.  My six year old daughter loves playing it. It is helping her in math.
0446699616|2.0|I am a fan of Demille and eagarly anticipated receiving this book. It was not worth the wait. The book is boring,the ending obvious, and the book has the feel of a  lack of effort. The whole theme of the book-- don't trust the CIA -- has been done before by Demille.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Never understood what hurts so good meant till I finished this book. Changed my whole life inspired me to love.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Kind of buggy at times needs a lot of work. Sometimes I have to start over to get to the set goals over and over again.
B009NNMBCA|5.0|I am also a mother of 2 teenage daughters. I mostly love One Direction because they brought my 2 girls together in friendship that they were lacking before (they couldn't stand one another b4 1D). Because of them, I became a huge fan of their music (even though I'm n my 50's).  The movie was great, especially the fan cut.  It showed the boys as who they are, just 5 regular guys who found themselves in extraordinary circumstances. They are quite engaging in how normal they are.  The movie gives a good insight into how hard these boys do work every day, that this isn't just given to them, but earned by them.  I hope they continue to grow n their music and evolve so they will b able to b a group that celebrates 50 years together like the Rolling Stones.[[ASIN:B009NNMBCA One Direction: This is Us (Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy)]]
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|It gets a little dense sometimes but the reasoning behind it is absolutely flawless.  It is sad that most people don´t want to open their eyes and keep believing in fairytales and fables.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I loved this app. it kept challenging my thinking even after I put the game down. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00011CZRE|5.0|Great movie.. one of a kind concept... Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play off each other really well in their roles
B004ZH66XO|3.0|I got bored with it quickly.  Nothing really wrong with the game, just not my type of game. I think younger kids might really like it, ages around 18 and younger.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|We used to hear story of mutant & heroes.<br />Well this book is one of a kind.<br /><br />The war of epics.. Cool<br />Loved it!
0679420266|5.0|I am as fascinated by the 'reviews' of this book as I have been by the book itself, my first Camus read -- and I was an English Literature major many years ago. I've heard his name all my adult life, and it's a shame it took this long, but I saw an audiobook of The Stranger at my local public library, so I checked it out. Free -- not the absurd $4,689 price I see for the audiobook here. Maybe that's Mr. C reading it in the original French, which I wouldn't understand, though I liked another reviewer's note about how melodic his French was.<br /><br />As I've been listening to it, I keep thinking this must be that Existentialism I've read peripherally about for my last fifty years. I, too, have been accused of being a Nihilist, but our eponymous stranger probably is, though even I can see that Camus' and his anti-hero's feelings -- like  of many of us who've lived through the Twentieth Century -- may tend to be a little distant sometimes.<br /><br />Camus knows his way around language, and I've many times appreciated his delicious, spare use of it. If I hadn't picked up this audiobook, I would never have known how objectively simple this book is. I expected deep and pedantic philosophy, but it's anything but. The author tells a simple story, while his unencumbered notions speak fathoms.<br /><br />The audio, three-CD version I've been paying such rapt attention is in my car, and I've long since given up reading anything intelligent on those covers, so I can't say who translated it or reads it, etc., but it's been a joyous -- and dare I say -- delightful, little education, and I can only wonder about all those folks who review the physical aspects of this stirring little book, while blithely overlooking the author's words.<br /><br />Camus' text is exquisite. Not for nothing it's so long been considered a masterpiece.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|I liked it best when I first installed it because it had large buttons and no scientific stuff on it.  But the next time I used it it had all those things that I have no idea what they are used for. Someone who needs that stuff would benefit from them but I just want to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is a really good book for those with imaginations.  A very feel good and make you day dreamy kind of book.
B001NLL93W|5.0|love the whole series, can't wait for the next one!!!! Book was exciting, the story line continues to amaze me!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a good game for those that like mystery.  We play it as much as we can play it.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|One of the two best American movies ever to be denied the Best Picture Oscar, for decades Citizen Kane has occupied the all-time Top-10 lists of just about every film critics' organization on Earth. It is a genuine classic, an over-the-top, bravura debut by Orson Welles so full of innovations it has influenced the career of just about every moviemaker who's seen it. Beginning with a brief but now-famous prologue - in which the word \\"Rosebud\\" is uttered in a whisper by a pair of lips in ultra-close-up - it documents the rise and fall of fictional newspaper publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles), whose character is based loosely on real-life tycoon William Randolph Hearst. For that reason, the movie almost didn't get made - because Hearst made so many threats, legal and otherwise, against RKO, the studio of record. Welles, only 25 years old at the time, moves the story along effortlessly. Even this many years after its release, Citizen Kane remains full of surprises for first-time viewers, with a razor-sharp, Oscar-winning script by Herman Mankiewicz and Greg Toland's ground-breaking cinematography. As Welles once said - and demonstrated here - a movie studio is \\"the best toy train set a boy ever had.\\" [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
B000FBJFSC|3.0|While reading this book, I felt really bad for the kids in it.  I know the author won a Pulitzer for writing it, but it seemed so unfeeling, matter of fact, and out of touch about some very sensitive things.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|&#34;The Good Wife&#34; is simply the reason I even watch television.  Shows like this are few and far between, so enjoy it while it lasts!
B006O3MU96|4.0|My daughter likes this game.  She plays it all the time, glad she downloaded for those time when she needs to be preoccupied for a bit.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It makes it so easy to get in touch with your friends and I like when it says if they are texting at the top :-)
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I will watch them all over and over again.....and share with my friends as it is such a great story!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Futuristic, action-packed, and ever so slightly full of cliches. Dredd is entertaining, though there isn't a whole lot of depth.
0739352989|5.0|I do love listening to these CD's......sometimes it is a little difficult to concentrate on my driving while listening though!!!!  :)
1936891026|1.0|I read the whole book. i just can't buy into his idea that an unseen spiteful, hateful force is out to get me 24/7 and keep me from doing the ONE thing I am meant to do in life.<br /><br />First, I don't think there is just ONE thing people are meant to do. Just because a woman is meant to write children's books and inspire kids to read doesn't mean she can't also be just as passionate about singing in a choir and uplifting people of all ages with beautiful music. But according to this book, you have ONE thing you must do 24/7 and if you aren't doing that one thing, you aren't living an authentic life God wants.<br /><br />That's crap. I think God wants to share in the joy we feel as we do the one OR MORE things that bring joy to ourselves and others, not in the act of writing a book. I think God is just as happy when I share a moment in peace and joy as I pet my cat (whose drooling and purring shows she's pretty happy, too). But according to this book, I am allowing this hateful force (called resistance) to prevent me from writing my book, so I am not doing what I should be doing. Seriously?<br /><br />He seems to feel the same way about spending time with family, friends, etc. They are keeping you from being authentic because they are a part of this hateful force.<br /><br />And by the way, his solution to breaking through this hateful \\"resistance\\" force -- just do it. If you're a writer, write. If you're a singer, sing. Do it all the time to the exclusion of anything else.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />I just can't buy into this crap. I'd rather have a balance of friends, family, joy, sorrow, and all the wonders of the world -- and I'll write sometimes, too.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|I wasn't expecting anything more that a big fun action flick and that's exactly what I got. I love 3D.
B00C7607BC|1.0|Disney should be ashamed for releasing this version. The colors are terrible, very dull & different in every scene. Ariel's hair should be red. In some scenes it is brown & even black. The Kings skin is dark brown & even grey in one scene.  i feel like sending my copy back to the Disney Co.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie was really good. I'm a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and he played a wonderful villain. Big, fun and action packed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|love this show!  great acting.  great story. I  can't wait for the next season to start!  a a a a
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I already have the regular version. I have a 3D TV and so I got the 3D version of The Hobbit. I really enjoyed the 3D version. The landscapes look beautiful in 3D.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|I have been unable to get the eprint to work.  The printer works fine.  The instructions do not work for me.  I did record my printers email address.  I am trying to get this to eprint with my android, Samsung 4 phone.  I think I will have to hire someone to figure out why the eprint function is not working.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I got this book for my son. He is doing the play at his school and want the book to read. He said it was really good.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Dialogue horrible<br />Acting terrible<br />Each cameo appearance more laughably absurd than the previous one.<br /><br />First time in a long time I could not finish a movie. Thank goodness I did not pay to see at the theater, or rent.
B005LAII08|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I had a lot of friends that said they loved it and after watching it I would have to agree with them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham  writes what he knows! Practicing the rules of law thru the pages &#34;thriller&#34; manuscripts! Read and enjoy the experience.
B000244FDW|2.0|I have this version, the mini series with Colin Firth as well as the movie with Keira Knightly.  Although I loved the costumes in this version I found the actor who played Mr. Darcy to be wooden.  He's a very handsome man but his acting left me disappointed.  I thought the other actors were well played though.  I even watched it twice to make sure I gave it a fair rating.  I prefer the Colin Firth mini series and even though I find Keira Knightly a little annoying (she talks way too fast), for me, they were better then this version.  It's good but I feel the others are better.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I'm using this hub with a [[ASIN:B0043T7FXE Logitech M570  Wireless Trackball]] and my [[ASIN:B00C7JIBN0 ARCTIC P253BT Bluetooth Stereo Headphones, Built-in Mic]] without any issues. My OS is Win7 x64 if that's helpful. If you have trouble with the headphones connecting via bluetooth make sure the \\"Enable speech recognition for (XXXX) headset\\" is checked. I'm not sure why, but being able to connect my headphones was spotty until I'd done that.
0060872675|5.0|This is much funnier if you're familiar with Discworld. I read it to a friend who had never read Terry Pratchett, and she looked at me funny, but still enjoyed it.<br /><br />Very fun to read aloud. And it's spawned a game my kids and I play of &#34;Where's my daddy? Is that my daddy?&#34; And we run through various things each member of the family says.<br /><br />So: LOVE this book. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. You must buy it and you must read it aloud to your favorite people and then enjoy the giggles.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Easy game for the entire family.  Great download for my kids to play on their tablets.  This is very addictive. I can't seem to put it down.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I read this book based upon a review in the Weekly Standard. The reviewer had many good things to say about Ms Olson's work.<br />The reviewer got it right . This book is an easy read and full of information that I never knew about. However, I think the most<br />important thing is the comparison you can make between what Ms. Olson wrote about and our current political situation.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|That pretty much sums it up. This game is an addictive and entertaining tower defense game. The problem is that Amazon has seemingly decided tonot provide the updateto ttheir version of this game. I had to buy the Google version to get the full game and then start over.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Not much to say. It's just a joystick for the 3DS. Works like a charm with Monster Hunter. Unfortunately, it takes batteries to run.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Brandt Legg and I will be back for more after reading \\"Outview\\"! Fast paced, page turning action kept me up until 3am and I really, really didn't want to put it down. I was hooked into the characters right away and into the storyline itself. Even though this is written a YA book, don't be fooled, adults will borrow it for some great lunchtime or commute reading and it will be passed from friend to friend as we wait impatiently for the next book!
0142410705|4.0|This is not as good as The Fault in Our Stars but I still really enjoyed it. The book is relatively short so it is a quick read.
B00867HDTA|5.0|This is a fun game to play. It is good to provide a challenging distraction for a few minutes. There are several different ways of playing to keep it fresh. Is this like real soccer? Hello you are playing on a device. If you want real soccer then go get a ball and get off your device and go outside. This game is a keeper.
B00AH69MS8|5.0|A must have album for any metal head! This is one of Metallica's best albums! This is my second time owning this album.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I have already watched this movie like three times and I just love it. I had previously seen it at MJR theatre but rented for my grandson to watch
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|There are several songs on the album that are on the radio right now ... but I found that I really enjoy all the songs on the album.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|The game was fine until I got to level 4 and when you click on the pillow there is suppose to be a coin under it. There is no coin so the game ends and you cannot advance to the next level. I purchased the first game defective so I tried the free one hoping that it might not have the same problem, but it does.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|A nice closing to what should have been a very high quality and long lasting series on TV,  But that is another story.<br /><br />Blu Ray quality  Thank you.
B00DGQF0K0|5.0|The game is challenging and fun. You really have to think about what you are doing. I purchased several other games after this one. but this is the best.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|If a movie star was born in Ace Ventura, he is christened in The Mask. Quite simply, this is the best and freest crazy comedy to come along since Beetlejuice.
B00BDSRKHO|4.0|Delivery was fast and price was right.  I liked OMD when they first came out in the 80s.  The first four albums were fantastic and very different from what other artist were composing.  Their fourth album Junk Culture was very pop/dance oriented but it was extremely catchy.  Architecture and Morality was my favorite.  The band eventually stagnated trying too hard to be pop/dance oriented to sell lots of albums so I quickly lost interest.  When I read the reviews, the majority focused on OMD's return to form, if you liked early OMD you will like this.  I decided to give it a shot and was glad I did.  The compositions are a nice blend between the early and mid period of OMD career and seems to have figured out how to bring out the best of both worlds, experimental and dance / pop.  This CD should appeal to all OMD fans although in my opinion this whole style of electronic music is dated but still fun and this CD makes it seem fresh again.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|If nothing else, \\"Oblivion\\" will go down in film history as the movie where Tom Cruise pilots a white, sperm-shaped craft into a giant space uterus.
B000083E79|5.0|The cd came in about a week. It was in great condition and played well. Cd case was also in good condition. This is a cd that well has the BEST of cher. It has all the hits and 2 remixes. Very good cd for the casual cher fan
B00E89VXQY|5.0|For all intents and purposes, this is a live album. This is Metallica sounding their best since the early days. The sound quality is absolutely superb. I was blown away by the clarity and balance in the mix. Instrumentally, it may be the best Metallica has ever sounded to my ears. This is obviously partially because of the better technology relative to the 80's/early 90's. The biggest surprise for me was how great Lars sounds. He doesn't miss a beat! He catches flack nowadays for being sloppy and whatnot, but not on this recording! Lars was on fire. Every double bass kick hits you like a ton of bricks, and he never misses a beat. It's the best drum work he's done since the early days, hands-down.<br /><br />Vocally, this is the best James has sounded since losing his vintage vocal style. Nothing can top his Justice-era vocals. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how incredible he sounds vocally on this mix. He puts a lot of aggression into his vocals this time around, too. You can tell he's trying to mix in a bit of his 'old days' vocal style into his newer style.<br /><br />The band is firing on all cylinders during this recording. Buy it. I promise you won't regret it.<br /><br />Also, $9.99 is worth it to hear the live (with no audience) version of Orion. It may be the greatest version of it ever captured on audio (simply because of the technology. It would obviously be better with Cliff).
B008FRJ1IW|2.0|Very surprised at the size, limited number of legos and the cost for the item.  Disappointed as I could have bought a similar item at Walmart for much less.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|It appears that Diana Krall is experimenting with other styles.  I have brought all of her recordings in the past because I like the big band era and smooth jazz.  I don't think she has the voice for country or blues.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app had some really nice features to it, and it was a lot more expanded than other apps like instagram. However, after applying all the filters and tweaking the picture to how I wanted it pressing the save button or share button would notify you that your picture was saved, but it would not show up in my gallery or online. If this gets fixed the app would get 4 stars but since it can't save my pictures im done with it.
B00CUKTG2Q|4.0|I'm a bit amused by other reviews for this album, particular those who place 'Right Words' as FF's retreat to safety after the \\"stretch\\" of 'Tonight.' First off, I found 'Tonight' an absolutely brilliant \\"stretch,\\" a polished and accomplished techno-ish outing for the quartet, not so much a stretch as a natural evolution.<br /><br />Indeed, 'Right Words' isn't a retreat so much as a paean to their influences (or, well, somebody's influences, anyway). Those who hear clear references to FF's first two albums here seem, to me, to be listening to something else entirely. The swaggering innuendo and playful wordplay are still present, but the melodies in 'Right Words' harken back not to FF's signature post-grunge punk/disco fusion, but to a time before their inception, before punk was even punk. This isn't just a Franz Ferdinand album, it's a K-Tel Franz Ferdinand album!<br /><br />\\"Right Action\\" is probably the closest to \\"traditional\\" FF, coming out of the gate with a fuzzy guitar/Moog combo that seems as if a pre-'Machine Head' Deep Purple went deeper down the rabbit hole rather than trying to out-Zeppelin Zeppelin. 'Evil Eye' is the song that Danny Elfan forgot to record for 'Dead Man's Party', and \\"Love Illumination\\" fuses, of all things, Sweet with the Bay City Rollers. Continuing with the 70's swing, 'Fresh Strawberries' could easily be a Donnie and Marie hit (No, I'm not kidding. Listen to the chorus and try not to imagine FF singing it on American Bandstand, decked out in fringy leather and dodging disco ball sparkle). And do I detect a bit of B-52s in 'Treaons! Animals?'<br /><br />OK, so I realize I'm not making this sound too digestible. 'Right Words' does sound a bit like FF is trying to shake themselves of their indie cred and intentionally hit the adult contemporary charts, but at least they're doing the FF way. (The alternative would be Maroon 5. Eeuugghh!). The irony of the closing 'Goodbye Lovers and Friends' notwithstanding, this is a solid pop album,far different and more distinct from FF's first two than was 'Tonight.' FF always sold itself as a dance band, and 'Right Words' is really the closest it's come to actually achieving that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think the author did a good job of getting the reader hooked in to finding out why Christian Grey was the way he was.  I, like Ana, wanted to know why he was fifty shades of *&()( up.  I also was left wanting more so I had to read the other books as well.  Great, easy, read.
B008IGAJJK|2.0|I only know MASH from the re-runs played in UK without the awful laugh track. When I came out to the US I tried to get into it again but the laugh track is assaultive and off putting. Someone suggested I tried the movie.  It was ok but, by today's standards, not a coherent story,  more like a series of episodes.
0091947561|5.0|excellent content and great style of writing. The examples by Ajaz & Stefan are easy to understand and the thought process comes out clearly making it an engaging read,
B006PZBR8S|5.0|A typical American plot, but executed brilliantly.  Absent father, broken hearts, hoping for victory, etc., but the graphics are superb, and very believable.  A story of hope, love, and determination. I really like Hugh Jackman, and all around, this was a great stand up and shout 'we did it' kind of movie.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|You ever see a movie where the hero/superhero has been beat up by the villain and is pretty much impotent the entire movie? Well, welcome to Iron Man 3. Notice some of the other reviews that say......really picked up at the end? Last 20 minutes good? stuff like that?<br /><br />Even worse, when Tony Stark is Iron Man, Iron Man is broke and not working half of the time.<br /><br />This is not a superhero movie, this is a action/adventure/comedy movie starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark with an occasional appearance as Iron Man. Downey is witty and funny as usual, which is what holds this movie together.<br /><br />These movies, with the fallen superheroes, are all basically the same. The superhero finally comes back at the end to save the day. So no different here, at the very end, you get to see some Iron Man action.<br /><br />Even with little Iron Man action, the movie is still pretty decent and worth a rental. Robert Downey Jr. gets 4 stars. As a superhero movie, a 2 star movie at best.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a Goodreads recommendation and I was immediately intrigued with the characters and how the author brought them all together.  There are 4 different stories in this book and you will have a really hard time trying to choose a favorite.  This is one I will read again and again.  Already looking for other books by this author.  Try this one - you won't be disappointed!!
B003EI2EH2|3.0|This was an interesting read but there are very few actual takeaways from reading it. I might try a couple of things but by the end of the book I was thinking about what I was going to read next.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Yes, I would highly recommend Downton Abbey.  I enjoy the show very much.  I can not stop watching to see what is going to happen next.  I am hooked.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|As a person that tries to follow a Paleo lifestyle I wanted to read a book that focused on the deliterious effects of carbs and gluten on the human body, and specifically the brain. Delivers a powerful punch!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great, addictive game that kinda reminds me of sudoku where you have to make some comparisons against the vertical and horizontal numbers. Relaxing.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I like the action and the actors.  It has comedy and seems fresh in ideas.  I want to watch all of the episodes
B008Y212PI|4.0|Nice game, 5x5 too easy, but 10x10 are interesting, 15x15 can be chalenging. If you played picross on nds then you willlike it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game was fun for me and my sister loved it and everyone should buy it. so stay off other games and just focus on despicable me game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the book better than I did the movie read it in couple hours. Im getting ready to download book two and three
0689835604|5.0|Bought for a young child.  Captions are informative and the illustrations are sure to make an impression in a small child mind.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great entertainment, loved watching this can't wait to go to Season 2. It's one of the best TV programs shows
0671449028|5.0|Purchased for a gift to a little one.  Leafed thru, it is well illustrated and cute story. Love this child book
B00867HDTA|4.0|I like this game Simple and easy to play but the challenges are limited. I would have given it 5 stars if there were more challenges.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter . She has read it before and she loves it. The follow up books by this author as great as well.
1452126607|5.0|Grumpy Cat for the wall. I love it. Now I can display him at work and point. Perfect! Work will never be the same!
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Sure, it is another monsters attack Earth and we all pull together to fight them movie, but this one has a lot more substance in every department than do most. TV actors are usually better at delivering up close personal emotion than those who star mostly on the big screen. This film is packed with TV stars who are well-known for high-quality acting. The story is somewhat predictable, but not totally. Guillermo Del Toro has done an incredible job of blending real in camera shots with CGI and green screen. In most every sense it is an epic movie. I bought it at $14.95 (with Bonus material) and do not regret it.
1452126577|5.0|I am a Grumpy Cat fan and this will let my voice my opinion and show my love. People come in see it, open it up and laugh.
1885167776|5.0|This book is great for anyone.  Most of us live complicated lives and this book helps to narrow your focus to your ONE thing.  Good for business and good for life!  My 21 year old son read it too.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|Interesting pre OZ story line, but without all the nice music.Some elements lines not in the first OZ but they lend some heart to the wizard.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A great read.  Characters were well developed and their relationship to one another was believable. Read straight through to the end, barely coming up for air!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Funny, sad, and gripping.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Clever story-telling and characters that you can actually feel, as if they are sitting with you as you turn the pages.
B005JZBPHS|4.0|Great show. Wish it had more bonus features like actor interviews, bloopers, etc.  it comes in a convenient book like a photo album.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I purchased a streamed HD rental of this 2nd installment of the reboot/prequel of the original Star Trek franchise.  From Amazon to my 60\\" plasma.  It's not bad plot-wise if (like most sci-fi movies) you are willing to ignore a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies.  Chris Pine's acting has improved somewhat.  SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ FURTHER IF HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW:  The tension of the scene where he is confronted by Peter Weller (ship to ship) is probably the best acted scene in the movie.  It's well written as Pine/Kirk parries the Admirals authority and steps cagily and confidently while holding his ground when the chips are down.  Scotty, McCoy and Uhuru seem more comfortable and developed in their roles.  My complaint is that the writers had to go back and mine the Khan from the old franchise.  Cumberbatch is a good villain smart, intense, edgy.  I'm just worried what the franchise will do for the next installment if they get into a habit of not writing new stuff.  Also, how did Khan (Cumberbatch) survive 72 torpedoes going off on that ship?  For that matter, how did the ship itself survive intact with all those explosions?  72 torpedoes onboard?  Oh yeah, that's right I'm not supposed to think about that.  The Carol Marcus backstory gets fitted into this episode. Supposedly some critics have complained about CGI on this film.  I don't have any problem with the quality of it's CGI rendering on this film.  It looks no more or less convincing  than a zillion other high budget sci-fi movies.  In closing, decent entertainment for a couple hours.  It was worth the 4.99 HD streaming rental.  I feel no need to purchase the Blu-Ray though.  4 stars.
0380730405|5.0|I read this novel every few years.  I am always transported to the scene and find myself walking with the characters and often residing in their minds as well.  Always a pleasure!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A page turner....kept you intrigued.  It's about the randomness of life Definitely chick lit, but well written chick lit.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
0156027321|5.0|The Life Of PI is a great read. This book is about a boy named PI and a Royal Bengal tiger living in a bout for months. The reason why they are in the boat is yours to find out! The bengal tiger is a full grown and weighs about 450 pounds. PI and the tiger have many adventures in the book. They find an island and food, and they find magical things there. So all in all this is a great read and I hope you choose to read it soon!
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|When I started to see this I was set back a little.I thought this is going to be bad, there all of it started to come together and boy was it a good movie.Glad I bought it.Have seen it 2 times in 3 mth's and get more out of it every time I see It.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I simply couldn't finish it because I felt there were no breaks wherein a joyful  of good news moment lasted more than half a paragraph.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pretty good headset, Only issue I have is once I downloaded the software for it, I started to get a slight static/white noise sound in the background. which you also need for the surround sound. Regardless. It's nothing to horrible as of yet.<br /><br />Besides that I am happy with my purchase.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought this game in high hopes of playing it. Little did I know, IT WILL COMPLETELY CRASH YOUR KINDLE! It almost did mine. DON'T GET!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The charger works wonderfully. Need to order one for my kindle hd. The stem is larger and doesn't wiggle around getting a much better charge.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|I saw a Youtube demonstration of the product on Facebook and it was one of those things \\"you just have to have\\"  It is everything it says it is and more.  Awesome!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I can't say enough about how well done this collection is.  Easily in my top 5 favorite war films ever, probably top 2 or 3 actually.  Simply phenomenal.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book definitely gave me a bigger inout on what it means to be alive. It changed my way of how I treat people in my daily life now, and I am blessed to have read this book!
0385486804|5.0|I had just returned from Alaska and had passed through the area around Denali. This made the book more interesting. Tragic but  interesting.
B00E8AVNBI|2.0|\\"I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna take over this town and you can go to hell.\\" When a gang lead by Guerrero (Trejo) enters a small mining town for a night of drinking he is surprised when the gang revolts and kills him in order to stay and control the town they now call Tombstone. When he wakes up in Hell he makes a deal with the Devil in order to live again. Now has an instrument of Satan all he has to do is kill the gang that killed him or face eternal damnation. Once again this is a Danny Trejo movie which means this will be a short review. His fans will watch this either way so what I will say is that this is pretty cheesy with a ridiculous plot. On the other hand this does have Trejo in it for more then 5 minutes and Mickey Rourke is also in this for added fun. This is a true western in the way that there are no zombies or other gimmick to make people watch. Other then that this is another movie for Trejo fans. Overall, not terrible but nothing to rush and see either. I give it a C+.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app all the time.  Use it for shopping lists, recipes etc.  Cannot live without it.  It is Awesome.
B00CK6MUSW|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark has delivered yet another believable and interesting read - she never disappoints. I find it hard to put her books down once I have started them.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|...but I was wrong. Karl Urban really surprised me as Dredd. And at first when I heard about it, I thought that him being trapped in a building was laughable and going to be Die Hard with more guns, though I was wrong. Despite some slow points, this movie had a lot of really good effects and didn't get hammy like the Sly Stallone version, which I still watch too.
B000B589JI|4.0|Very useful product give you one refill without running and looking for your fluid.Very handy when you run out on the fly.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really good for kids!  i really love the football  guy because he is fast and fun to play with
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I'm usually not a gamer, more into words and puzzle games. I love this game tho. Wish it didn't have to go through the internet but great game.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Great show!  If you haven't watched it yet, start now!  Highly recommend Season 2 (and Season 1).  Catch up with Amazon and watch Season 3 this Fall!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I think I'm in love.  I've been listening to [[ASIN:B00004SY4H Sennheiser  HD 600 Open Dynamic Hi-Fi Professional Stereo Headphones (Black)]] for years, most often from an [[ASIN:B000W7PNZI Creative SB1040 Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Audio PCI-E Sound Card]] which was then routed through a small Mackie mixer as a \\"headphone amp.\\"  This setup sounds OK if your source is reasonably clean, and the Mackie has enough oomph to drive these 300 ohm cans.  BUT...<br /><br />Recently I built a new computer.  I went mATX to build a power-house-house-yet-compact workstation.  One of the things that got left behind in the move to the smaller form-factor, was the Creative X-Fi card.  (Creative's drivers are a total joke anyway, so I wasn't that sorry to see it go.)  Still, the degradation in sound quality from moving to integrated sound wasn't just noticeable, it was unbearable.  I could actually hear every single thing the computer did, from accessing the SSD to simply moving the mouse around the screen.  Gross.<br /><br />I knew that the Fiio E17 would stand-in as a new sound card via the USB connection, and for simply listening to music that would have been totally fine by me.  I like my music as un-processed as possible for a natural listening experience.  However, I'm also a gamer.  For gaming, I actually WANT my sound-card to step in and process the audio for sound occlusion, etc.<br /><br />Enter the Fiio E17.  I ordered this along with [[ASIN:B00016W6Y6 StarTech.com THINTOSMIN6 6 feet Toslink to Mini Digital Optical SPDIF Audio Cable]], connected the cable between the optical Toslink output on my [[ASIN:B006L6ZIU4 ASUS Rampage IV Gene LGA 2011 Intel X79 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard]] and the optical SPDIF input on the Fiio E17.  What came out?  Magical, sparkling unicorns, that's what.  While the E17 makes everything sound oh-so-lovely, I can tell that even more oomph would benefit my headphones, so I now have the [[ASIN:B008J26ZL4 FiiO E09K High Output Desktop Headphone Amplifier and Dock for E07K or E17]] in my wishlist.<br /><br />I had to go into Windows's playback devices settings and change the default output device to \\"Digital Audio (S/PDIF),\\" and now the E17 makes my headphones sing so sweetly whether I'm set to 44.1, 48, 96, or 192 kHz output.  (Yes, you'll need good source material at the appropriate quality to make the higher settings matter.)<br /><br />The E17 is plugged into the same computer via USB just for charging.  I see that Windows offers to route sound directly over the USB cable, but for reasons mentioned above I'm sticking with the fiber optic cable.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the E17 will not process DTS or Dolby Digital signals, so attempting to feed these to it through the optical cable will blow your ears off with a raw, digital squeal.  Hold the headphones well away from your ears if you're feeling like a masochist and want to see what happens.  (I only tested this using Win 8's own built-in tester, not DVDs or Blue Rays.)<br /><br />After testing the configuration out on some Bjork, Vivaldi, and the Cedric Gervais remix of Lana Del Ray's \\"Summertime Sadness,\\" I fired up a game and was happily blasting away.  No, games don't use super high quality source material, but even still it sounded significantly better than it ever had before.sktop Headphone Amplifier and Dock for E07K or E17]] in my wishlist.<br /><br />I had to go into Windows's playback devices settings and change the default output device to \\"Digital Audio (S/PDIF),\\" and now the E17 makes my headphones sing so sweetly whether I'm set to 44.1, 48, 96, or 192 kHz output.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a book club selection for our club.  It provoked a very lively, thought-provoking discussion about children and psychology.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Dr. Who continues to be the number one  program in my queue. The story lines are creative, the characters are multidimensional and the series is number one in my book.  I watch very little television but this program is a cannot miss!
B009IJJB8G|4.0|I am a true Sherlock Holmes fanatic and have my doubts about every new reboot.Although the most recent Cumberbatch version got the most press Jonny Lee Miller is surprisingly good as Holmes. You get the sense of genius at work without him coming across as a complete self-absorbed jerk. Also, the whole twist with addiction and a female Watson is refreshing.I also love the sprinkling of little nods to the original books. Some stories are obviously better than the others but the series is fun to watch overall and answers the question&#34;What would Sherlock Holmes be like in our time?&#34;
B00BWLKTOS|4.0|This is another excellent album from the Piano Guys. Their playing is at the same superb level as their first album, but I don't feel that the arrangements were quite as good. These arrangements don't have the same kind of mash-ups that made the first album so very good. But I still liked it a lot.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Great show!!  If you get worked up before bed from watching suspenseful shows then don't watch at night.  My wife and I had to start watching it right after work so we would be calmed down before bed time.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Excellent!  Another must see series from BBC. David Tennant was superb.  The  suspense masterful. Just wished there was another season.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I like watching Suits because it is mentally stimulating and the characters seem to be a good mix of compassionate and legally tough.  Good show...
B00CATSONE|4.0|I've read alot about Tesla and this particular book is informative without being too fanboy-ish as many Tesla books/sites tend to be.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I tried to download the new update.  It just keeps going to open.  It will not download.  Nice!  Now I cannot play the game!!!
1404956573|4.0|When I inspected the disc I found smudges on them. I did get them off and the the first movie played fine. I haven't had a chance to see the second one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I play several times per day but now I am being blocked. I have to download but unable to. PLEASE HELP!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works consistently and is intuitive. Includes the typical functions you need. Having the calculation history is like the &quot;old days&quot; when we had adding machines with tape to check your work.  Can't beat free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wonderful love story! Keeps you wanting more! Never wanted the book to end! Definitely a must read for everyone... Love love loved it
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I really do not know how the movie was. The streaming was at 1 bar for the first 30 min of the movie. I just stopped watching. I do not have trouble streaming from other sites.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Smooth gameplay and takes full advantage of the graphic capabilities of the kindle. Fun for all ages and incorporates elements from the most popular swipe run games.
B00EHMG358|5.0|This is a great read. Anxious to finish the story. As always, great characters and interesting plot and plot twists.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Will be a classic I/d never have  expected a story line with so many twist and entertaining as well. Exeptionally done.

B00E9P959O|5.0|This remix sounds spectacular in comparison to the original; it's like comparing daylight to a gloomy half-light.<br /><br />'Vapor Trails' is now fully revealed to be one of Rush's best recordings - it has been elevated to CLASSIC status. It's a brilliant work of art to be appreciated and enjoyed with every listen - \\"a prize every time\\", alongside Rush's other classics 2112, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, and Clockwork Angels.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, this has leap-frogged almost every other Rush release..! In over 11 years, I've listened to the original release all the way through perhaps about three times - for this remix I'm already at six complete listens after only 2 days. It's that good!<br /><br />I nominate David Bottrill for the inevitable \\"Clockwork Angels\\" remix, even if it's ten years (or more) from now...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I definitely recommend reading this book, it kept my attention the entire time and made me feel what the characters felt!!
B00F52YOPA|3.0|I bought the game unfortunately there was no free to try first,if so I probably wouldn't have bought it. It was kinda fun because it was different but very short I couldn't believe when it said it was over. I was having fun until it ended so fast than I was bummed out. I would of gave 5 stars if they made it longer but then again it was only 1.99 so I shouldn't be to surprised.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This game is really fun, but NOT good on Kindle Fire. Its obviously not been optimized for the tablet. The images are stretched and certain games are impossible (airplane crash for example) because of no microphone on Kindle. On the iPad and other Apple products, this is a great game, but on the Kindle, it has  a lot of drawbacks, so 3/5 stars.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I thought it wasn't a cool game until I played it I really think people should get this game awesomeness
B001RONJYC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I am a Beyonce fan but it is safe to say all the actors in this movie gave a grand performance
1423101464|5.0|The Labyrinth has been growing for thousands of years and now its time for another quest. What's interesting about this part is Anna Beth is leading the quest.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|The story was compelling, and tragic and well acted.  I'd recommend it to anyone who has loved Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights.  Also, fans of Jane Austen and Henry James will probably enjoy it.
1423140605|5.0|There's a big cliff hanger at the end but still loved it. Can't wait for the next book (House of Hades)

Great job Amazon, keep those good movies I loved from the late 70s/80s coming on Prime!!  Amazon can now work on getting ALL the brat pack movies of the 80s on Prime PLEASE???  Thank you!!!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Amazing game. I love how each character has a special ability. Also you can use the telepods to transport a new character.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|The camera works well and I'm enjoying taking pictures of my three kitty kate.  They are the best in the world.
B00004RYXY|5.0|Hands down, my favorite production, at least those that I've seen.  Have had this one on VHS for well over a decade.  Long overdue to update to DVD!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|My Grandson enjoyed putting this together and has been playing with it ever since.  He has let it join the Star Track and Harry Potter Lego sets.  They seem to play together very well.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I really like riddles so this was perfect for me. the clues are pritty pricey though. overall I give it a 4.@
B008ALA6DW|5.0|This is a necessity when you have the new Macbook Pros! My daughter uses this in her dorm room when the WiFi gets bogged down by all the gamers! Apple products made for Apple products! Recommended!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I'm quite sure that people knew how this was going to play out but in the end it was still enjoyable.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Yes, it's corny but I thought it was fun. That is all that it was suppose to be for me.
B0064W667Y|5.0|I already have this in print however I enjoy it so much I decided to buy it for my Kindle as well.

B000B8QF00|1.0|I ordered this cd to add to my collection, this is the first cd I have had problems with in quality, first and foremost I never order used cd's, through Amazon. When ripping the cd had issues with the ripping process. Gave the CD a good look over and discovered multiple scratches on the recorded surface,following removal from packaging. The CD appeared to be used. The audio was very poor, garbled , skipping and so on. This will be the first cd I will return after a year and a half of ordering CD's through Amazon. I fully expect a replacement from the sending party.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so engrossing. To imagine living in the time with big houses and servants that lived there and took care of everything as part of their life.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|There was a lot of violence in this film, which I think was easier to take in my home setting than if I had viewed it in a theater.  The acting was very convincing and the characters were fully developed. The film seemed a little bit too long.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|There is nothing I can write here to describe how really awesome this collection is!  All I can say is, if you can afford it, and you have the opportunity, YOU SHOULD BUY IT!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love it!  I purchased this for my daughter's Kindle Fire and she loves it too!  Her favorite color is pink and that is indeed a plus.
B005F96URI|5.0|and it has an awesome mixture of cast members. Josh Hartnett stars in it and he is one handsome guy along with the handsome and multi-talented musician, singer/song writer, and actor Gackt which I am a fan of. The disc itself plays well making this a great buy.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|my little one love it it shows what friendship meands and how much pony or people and real act. difent buy for the pony girls.
0446699616|5.0|Most of Nelson DeMille books are great, but I like the ones with John Corey in them.  I recommend his books to anyone who wants to read a good book.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Thank you Tracy Grandstaff!  May God bless you! :-)<br />I love Daria's attitude about life, she is soo funny, Awesome!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Really a good game for those who like a slight challenge but also good for mind numbing moments<br />I personally love it
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It is a really fun game but the demo needs more time it is just like minecraft but cheaper I suggest you buy the full version of the game though it deserves a 100 star review. 15 minutes is the Tim  limited on the demo
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app is really nice. It's easy and very efficient. I'm always forgetting something, so I preprogram what I need to do or remember, and it takes care of the rest. I do wish that I could use my own music with it, but it's not because you can't, I just haven't figured it out yet. Get this app! If you are a busy person, it's ideal to have.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I'm upset because it didn't let me download it from the amazonappstore. Why doesn't it work? ? I paid money for it and it doesn't even want to install
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thank you Mr. King for reminding me of reading your scary and thrilling books like Carrie and the Shining.  Doc reads like you took a year off between books, I love Dan, we all journey through life
B00FKSJ3YG|1.0|How would you feel about renting Jurassic park but getting an episode of Barney instead?  Nothing dark or interesting here.  Aside from a bit of wit this show is obviously for pre-teens who aren't allowed to read comics.  In a word.... \\"cheesy\\".  I bought first two episodes.  Want my money back.  Want my 90 minutes back.
B0098QBEXO|1.0|Brilliant acting, beautiful cinematography, sophomoric philosophy with a nihilistic perspective.  Just very sad that people are really this lost. The writers tried to salvage the deeply depressing plot with a tip of the hat to friendship.  But is that really the best they can do?  This is where agnosticism leads.  This is all that atheism has to offer.  So very sad.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|After watching the Netflix series of the same title, I wanted to read the book to know more about Piper's life in Danbury Prison.  Thoroughly interesting and entertaining.  Woud've  loved more about the women she spent time with, though!
B0019IB0II|5.0|My  brother had a major stroke that left his left side paralyzed. This book really helped me to understand what happened in his brain and gave me some hope that one day he will be able to walk again. Ms. Taylor is a brain researcher who had a major stroke leaving her in an infantile state.  Her memory of what she went through as the left side of her brain shut down and her slow recovery is explained in laymen's terms so that those of us who are not doctors can understand. This book was hard for me to put down--it was that interesting. Also, in spite of the topic, she does insert some humor into what she went through.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of my most favorite Stephen King books ever.  I am not into time travel but this book was so well written that it didn't even bother me!  I was thoroughly immersed in this book and could not put it down!  I highly recommend!
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|This movie was super cute and great for kids and adults.<br />It was pretty funny as well and loved it
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Acting not bad either.  These characters are genuinely likable even though the premise of the show is horribly violent and illegal to boot.
0446560073|5.0|I have not opened the book since it is a present for my daughter, but it came as promised with no surprises.
B005OOL1IC|4.0|Thought I would like this movie,  but it was not my cup of tea.  Being a non drinker, non smoker,  I guess that this type of humor just doesn't appeal to me anymore.  It is a good comedy,  and I am sure many people will enjoy it. I purchased part one and two,  based on tv adds that showed interesting parts of the film.  I guess part 3 is out now,  or at the theaters, I don't know which. So, if drunken comedy is your game, go for it.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|After reading Fall of Giants, I really looked forward to reading the second of the trilogy. I found it a little slow initially but then got hooked and I'm so glad l persevered.  I believe I learnt more about the second World War in this book than I ever did from a history book. So interesting to be able to see the perspective of all the nation's involved and not just a one sided view. I love all the characters in the story. Hurry up Mr. Follett and bring us the finale, I cannot wait.

B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The movie was done well and the acting was great.  It was a the story line of the Matrix, with a little Star Wars and Tron added in for style.  However, the ending was really lacking in a big surprise or some great climax.  If I could go back and make the choice all over again to see it or not, I would choose not.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Have enjoyed this game. Nice and relaxing - easy to find yourself wasting a lot of time doing it! As other reviewers have said, it's a shame the puzzle pictures don't look much like the object they're supposed to be.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is very addictive after awhile. u dont need to use any real money if u dont wish to. To receive more gems simply max out all ur food each 2 lvls give at least 2 gem. however if u must spend WAIT FOR THE SALE its waaaay cheaper.i know bcause i dont like to touch my money, all i do is max out my food and my place is so cool. get this app its free, its suitable for everyone. if u dont believe me, add me and c my place for urself in both restaurant &amp; bakery story my id is okami99.

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. It was exciting,, the special effects were great. The only thing that throws me a off a bit about this movie is that it doesn't follow the original story lines. I am  a true &#34;Trekie&#34;, have been since I started watching the tv series as a child with my dad. If you are a true &#34; Trekie&#34;, you will understand my meaning when you watch the movie. Having said that,I did like the movie, and it will be added to my  movie collection.

I have one on DVD, but like the idea of saving it on my Kindle Fire.  there are other great movies out there, the Man Called Horse, Return of the Man Called Horse,  and there is a third.  Thes are hard to find perhaps Amazon can manage to find them for us.

B00F57VFXO|5.0|Grabbing you by the throat as he did with \\"The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada,\\" Stevenson weaves another tale of intrigue, drama and suspense with \\"Operation Parsifal.\\"  The settings are as diverse as the tight quarters of a submarine and the vast desert landscape.  The characters are just as rich.  Meticulously researched and thoughtfully plotted, \\"Parsifal\\" is a page-turner from beginning to end. Knowing that Fleming was actually a spy at this time, the context of the story really comes to life.  If you are new to Stevenson's work, I highly recommend you read his other books as well.  He's an expert storyteller who clearly has a passion for history, filmmaking and entertainment.

B009LDD22U|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is still the best comedy on television!  It hasn't lost its edge while building it's characters.
B005LAIIGW|4.0|While space adventures like Star Wars and Star Trek are and always will be the epic space dramas that dreams are made of, filmmakers really haven't spent enough time on \\"down-to-earth\\" pictures that depict humanity's current explorations in space.  Humanity's story began with small-scale satellite-building stories on the outskirts of the Earth and minor, yet important trips to the moon.  However, rarely do space adventures hit the big screen without an asteroid plummeting towards Earth, aliens launching invasions, or at least someone having a close encounter - most likely of the third kind.  Realistic films about space exploration have been few and far between, the most memorable of which came in 1995's Academy Award nominated drama, Apollo 13.  Since then, space has basically been treated like a hostile villain, portrayed as the setting of chaos and conflict - much as it is in the already highly praised space drama, Gravity.<br /><br />Directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Great Expectations), Gravity stars Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone, an engineer on her first outer space mission.  Her commander, Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), is overseeing his last mission as his team orbits the Earth when Mission Control suddenly aborts the mission as satellite debris is quickly confirmed to be on a collision course with the team's location.  Unfortunately, the team is unable to defend themselves and the debris massively damages their shuttle and equipment, also thrusting the pair into space.  Running low on air and with only limited opinions, Stone and Kowalski are forced to use what means they have left to attempt to make their way to a distant orbiting space station in hopes of using an escape pod to return to Earth.  The voices of Ed Harris, Paul Sharma, and Basher Savage also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />For all of this film's achievements (and we'll get to them), Gravity is still far from the perfect film that many make it out to be.  At the end of the day, the film's story is the only substantial hang-up.  You can sit and marvel at how this film looks, praise the acting, and even embrace the idea of coughing up extra money to see the film in IMAX 3D - but, the end result and the overall impact of the film simply doesn't get the job done.  Maybe it's just me (and that's very possible), but this film leaves a gaping void of borderline irrelevance and eventual unimportance.  The story doesn't provide a knockout punch that an Academy Award winner should deliver.  Gravity goes through a motion of floating from one dire straight to the next, easily making it understandable as to why this film only goes on for only a brief 90 minutes.  There are only so many different places you can float to in outer space before the question of whether or not these characters live or die needs to be answered.  The climax of this flick is foreseeable, and easily forgettable.<br /><br />We can now move on to the film's outstanding achievements - and there are many.  By now, you might have heard that Sandra Bullock wasn't the first choice to play Dr. Ryan Stone.  Actually, she wasn't even the second, third, or fourth choice.  However, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n should be thanking his lucky stars (no pun intended) that he landed this A-list actress.  Most actors/actresses will tell you that acting on screen alone, without anyone else in the conversation is a complex, often taxing endeavor.  Fortunately for everyone (viewers included), Bullock does a phenomenally job working through her character's various, heart-wrenching emotional states.  Her character is full of fear from even the very beginning, but manages to face down each dire scenario, refusing to be fully engulfed by the constant fear of potential doom.<br /><br />While Bullock is the domineering presence in this film, Clooney spends his limited presence portraying a character that's completely opposite in nearly every possible way.  He's cool, calm, and collected - even after a debris storm reduces the duo's likelihood of surviving to nearly nothing.  Clooney brings to the table everything we've all grown to love about the charismatic gentlemen, full of whit and poise.  Combined, the efforts of Bullock and Clooney make for an unstoppable force of chemistry, and by the time the film concludes, it will be incredibly difficult to imagine any other actors or actresses in these two well-written roles.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Gravity is a beautifully visual film, providing a mesmerizing view of Earth from our planet's orbit.  In fact, it's so beautiful that it might be hard to get past the fact that it's actually CGI.  Sure, the film might be a bit CGI heavy at times, which will be abundantly evident in some portions of the film more than others, but for the most part it provides for an absolutely flawless experience - sparing no expense, I'm sure.  The eye-catching realism is quite breathtaking, often so convincing that you'll nearly forget you're watching a movie.  During the thrilling action sequences, don't be surprised when you find yourself lost in the moment, easily becoming engulfed in the array of panic that would likely leave most of us screaming in pure horror.  In other words, you'll be happy to be in a theater watching the events of this film, rather than in outer space dealing with the unimaginable living-changing experiences capture over the course of this film.<br /><br />Overall, Gravity is going to be all the rage at the box office and understandably so - yet at the end of the day, it's not as epic as the spectacular space drama, Apollo 13.  The hype has been built so high for Gravity that not even the Earth's atmosphere could hold it down - but after the film levels off a bit, hopefully viewers will come to terms with the fact that Gravity is simply a forgettable piece of filmmaking.  That doesn't mean you should discount the experience of this film (which everyone should witness at least once), but this film is limited by a simple story and visual effects (in all their glory) that some filmmaker will no doubt elapse in the near future.  Sandra Bullock (and likely the film's visual achievements) will garner quite a bit of attention during award season, but ultimately there's very little that sets her performance ahead of an unmemorable role that parallels Tom Hanks in Cast Away.  In the end, Gravity provides outstanding, yet brief cinematic enjoyment, although I fear this film will eventually crash land in the \\"good, but forgettable\\" category of film.<br /><br />GRADE: B<br />FNDNreview.com, calm, and collected - even after a debris storm reduces the duo's likelihood of surviving to nearly nothing.

B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have always enjoyed DeMille books but not this one. It starts off slow keeps that way. Way too much emphasis on Corey and his ego and his penchant of being snarky. If you removed the parts about Corey and his ego this probably would have been an e-book for kindle. It's more like this was written by a ghost writer than by DeMIlle.  If you are expecting a SeVille quality book then skip this one.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a great adaptation of the PC version, and runs surprisingly smooth! I like that included both creative and survival, and I hope that they add hardcore in the future. Even though there isn't nearly as much stuff as the XBox 360 and PC version, there's still enough to keep me coming back again and again. 9/10.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|4 year old loves it. he enjoys the mix of dinosaur and real animals. the graphics are great and he enjoys chasing down the animals

0312330863|4.0|I read this wonderful James Herriot novel many years ago.  My son borrowed several of his books, and this one was never returned.  I want my James Herriot library complete.  James Herriot is a wonderful, satisfying story teller.  I appreciate that many of the stories are based on his real-life experiences.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves animals and the people who own them!  James Herriot gets to the heart of the matter.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I have played a demo of this and enjoyed it. I was very happy to see this as app store app of the day and grabbed it. The violence is mute and nothing is overdone, so in case you are planning to get this for your kid, do not hesitate. They will love playing this one!
B00AEBB8BA|4.0|I like Mark Wahlberg as an actor and so does my husband.  We saw this movie on television, and we were enthralled throughout the whole movie.  It was good writing and directing. I would recommend it to any my friends or relatives that like a good action-packed, suspenseful film.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|The product is great. I just wish it had gapless playback. For example, in the transition from the song \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" to \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\", there should be no pause. The same could be said for any medley-style music where the components of the medley are separate tracks. Isn't there any way to pre-load the first few seconds of the next song into memory while the current one is playing?

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I downloaded this game to my android tablet, and I really enjoyed it until it updated and would no longer work on my tablet.<br /><br />I went to the Gameloft forum to ask for help, but got no response.  I tried to contact Gameloft, but their customer service site did not work.<br /><br />So I gave up on getting any support, and decided to try downloading it to my android phone.  Everything was great.  I got up to level 67 and then it reset me back to zero.<br /><br />Then it reset me again at level 25.  Then again at level 35.<br /><br />This would be a great game if it worked for more than a few days at a time.  As it is I've deleted the app.
B005D63ICI|3.0|Watch the show online for free dont waste your time buying episodes.  Otherwise Dexter is awesome. The show gets intense.
B000KJU182|5.0|Excellent adaptation of one of Melville's most powerful works. In addition, the film allows some truly great actors (Terence Stamp, Robert Ryan and Peter Ustinov) to illustrate why they are so revered.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Spectacular sequel! A perfect resolution for Dan Torrance! I was one of those that swore 'The Shining' was the scariest! Mrs. Massey belongs in her lockbox! Thank you, Mr King for sharing your abilities with us rubes!
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|I think this documentary starts really strong talking about the history and a few of the great albums recorded at Sound City. I also enjoyed seeing Dave save the console and move it and reassemble the thing. Then it gets a little self indulgent for awhile which, hey, it's Dave's movie so he can do what he want, but pretty much until Paul shows up the ending bored me a bit. I still recommend musicians check this movie out as seeing and hearing some of the stories about the studio and how recording sessions went is a good time.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Easy to learn and much fun to play.  I would recommend it to everyone especially if you like angry birds.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Fun, colourful game. I really enjoyed playing until I got to level 29 and was locked out. Seems Kindle can't handle it. So disappointed.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I thought this game was pretty cool for such a cheap price. It's challenging as the speed increases but not unreasonably.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was such a good book.  I just happen to come across it while surfing the web!  I hope Hugh continues with this saga.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|Good story with lots of action. Great acting and scenes; it did drag in a couple areas but caught up quick and kept me intrigued until the end.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My granddaughter likes this app. The thing that I don't like about it is, when she is not around I always get these little msg that says the minons are waiting to play. I dont like that at all.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Overall a good read; there were a couple areas that were a bit confusing and the end could have been better, but I liked the story.
014312336X|5.0|I heard about this book and the story from the author on Public Radio and it was better than I expected.  the author is excellent in setting the background of China of that era with pictures descriptions of everyday life for the average Chinese and who were the foreigners living there and how they lived from the richest to the refugee from a anywhere in the world.  These vignettes help to understand why it became a Cold Case and why the author may have been taken to reopen the case. I highly recommend this to any Eric Ambler enthusiasts as it is in the same tradition only this one is real.

087033039X|3.0|The diagrams are ok, but very difficult to follow.  It's a good reference to see what braids you like from the pics/diagrams and then go look up how to do them on the Internet...<br /><br />If you're serious about leather braiding, you should probably have it in your library as some people online will refer to pages in the book when explaining something.

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This is the new Pretty Hate Machine. I was Ansan Valley Rock festival when NIN rock the stage. Copy of A was the first song and I waited this album since then. This is worth 2 months.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is by far the best book that l have ever read. It has all the perfect elements if a good book and has all the words to make you cry an  laugh. I recommend this book to anyone that just wants a good book to read.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|After watching all the political machinations, massive ego's, innocent scapegoats and unnecessarily, I couldn't help but wonder whether that much has changed!<br />Fascinating.
0394721780|3.0|I have learned how to cook certain things like sauces, but some of the recipes are not usable. I am never going to cook brains, or kidneys. No croissant recipe.  Lots of butter, and very little about how to combine spices. Maybe someone should write Mastering the art of Indian Cooking.
B00BSBUZPK|3.0|The sound is terrible.and was very disappointed in the short version of the 1977 concert.<br />Also Glen Fry seems so soulless and Don Henley a little better but not a lot.<br />However their music is great!!!!!
B008MEM24S|4.0|The 480 different level are very nice.... one or two puzzels I have<br />not yet figured out.... nice... I like that kind of frustration....
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Very good book and even better being in kindle for my phone. really enjoy reading it. Need more books like this in kindle
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|It's very fun. Little hard to control at first but you get used to it once you get the hang of it.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Not only is this a great movie but the disk is packed with extras. I did not read the book so that's probably an advantage if you're a purist.
B000VZV7HY|4.0|My intro to Whitesnake came in 1987 (as it was for a lot of people. I loved that record and the one that followed.Being the way I am I wanted more. So when I discovered that they had a slew of albums out I was excited. Saints and Sinners was my 1st purchase because I wanted to hear the original Here I go again and Crying in the rain. It was so different. I liked it. I found myself reaching for S & S instead of 1987 or slip of the tongue. Those albums are fantastic but I need the rawness of S & S. Ive found that as great as the aforementioned records are, Whitesnake for me is mainly from Slide it in down. Love this album and would recommend it without hesitancy!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Having a lot of fun and helps the time pass by which is important for someone like me with disabilities.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This is an outstanding collection of the entire Next Generation episodes.  Some episodes contain deep mystical lessons which I find very insightful.
B002UZ5JJU|4.0|Loved it! I read it on holidays within a couple of days Seriously just a good book to get away. Fun, exciting and romantic. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a break but doesn't have any annual leave left. I actually couldn't put it down. I read the books that follow this one too, and I loved them just as much. I related to the heroine and I just wanted to see how her story ended.
B0090SI460|5.0|It's a great movie and having the option to be able to watch it on the road (DVD) or in 3D with my PS3 makes this a no brainer now that I have a baby to entertain.
0385523394|5.0|Good condition and an interesting book to read I'm glad I purchased it. I would recommend it to anyone because how in depth the details of how the writer describe her life story of how she got in prison.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|Awesome cd. It touches my heart. Im not one to leave reviews but this album  rocks. Thank you, Doors. Thank you.
B0007LGCA4|4.0|Keen sandals are very well made and comfortable.  They are made heavier than other sandals such as TEVA but I expect they are more durable, especially in the sole.  There is also more support than most sandals offer.  I like the fit system with neoprene in the upper which makes it so the lacing does not have to be as tight.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An amazing story that even the greatest skeptics can believe.  It has opened my eyes to what lies ahead after losing my son two month ago and the beauty and peace he may be experiencing on the other side.  I no longer fear death.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling, where do I begin?  I hadn't heard of her till this year.  And her powerful debut has made me into a fan.  I love her magic that she weaves with her skills as a violinist.  And pairing it with danceable grooves is amazing.  I've never heard music so lovely as the compositions that she's breathed life into.  There are so many standout selections on this album.  My favorite is &#34;Stars Align&#34;.  Lindsey's versatility shines through and through this album.  That I could listen to her all day.  Check out her collaborations and videos on Youtube,  She's truly an sight to behold.  And pick up this album ASAP to show your support.  Her music transforms and comes alive, and I'm glad that she's bold enough to create, energetic, pulsing melodies with the violin.  This album can be enjoyed by everyone.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I found it interesting and liked the interesting story line and glad I watched it. Not a WOW movie...but worth a watch.
1416550534|5.0|All of Kate Morton's novels are wonderful ! Long held family secrets and mysteries involving many generations of the same families, often told through the memories of one of the characcters, deftly moving through different decades........transporting !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Every time I read it, I discover a new twist or the incredible genius that Suzanne Collins  created with her complex character development and subplots. I haven't found anything else that even comes close to the caliber of this trilogy!
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The characters are fully developed and interesting. Plenty of action. Unfortunate that all there is no one to root for ( ie. they will win) as all are flawed.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|No way near as good as the first dredd movie. This is just awefull. Blood violance bad plot. Acting is ok
B00004WNYR|4.0|very good, sound perfect but there was a little default on the surface and the needle jumped ...<br />Otherwise, nice service, quick but pretty expansive.<br />Thanks for all.<br />Regards<br />J Ramona
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I started reading and it took a couple of chapters to get into the storyline but once I did boy was I hooked.  The heroine Elsbeth lives by her rules and takes charge of her future.  The stories at times is a little hard to piece all at once but keeps you in suspense and is a puzzle at the same time.  I am on the third book in this series and just am enthralled at the Elsbeth and her gutsiness.  Its a challenging read but well worth the effort and will remember this series for a long time.
B0026772N8|5.0|This book makes you think. Awesome! Honestly, zen has changed how I view the world and it is a must read.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Got this as the FAOTD so can't complain too much, but I think some bugs still need to be worked out.<br /><br />I like that the tiles are readily visible and the graphics are cute and easy to pick out, but the response time to tapping on the tiles needs some definite work. So if you're trying to beat the clock, it can be very frustrating. We're using this on a Nexus 7.<br /><br />Other than that, we'd definitely download this one again.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love this product and love fast free shipping with Amazon Prime.  It's so worth it to be a member.  I'll never go without it!
B006M4F67A|3.0|It's hard to distinguish the various tiles from one another - there's not enough color variation between the tiles to make them stand out. The tile designs are really nice but not much good if you have to stare at them to figure out what's going on.<br /><br />Got this as a FAOTD so no complaints there, but I would not pay for it.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I rarely give movies 5 stars as I'm rather critical.<br /><br />This is a really good movie, I honestly enjoy watching it with my children not suffer through it. The characters have depth, the movie has a well written and developed plot and it's just darn entertaining.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Done watching 24.  Waiting for new season next year.  Once you start watching you can stop until you see the last episode.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|Who wrote this move? Predictable from beginning to end.<br /><br />There was not an original idea in this movie. The dialogue was pathetic and unmoving. I felt nothing for the characters because none of the characters seemed very convincing.<br /><br />The acting wasn't the worst, but the lines the actors were given were cliche from beginning to end. I can't believe this movie has such a high star rating. I really feel it was waste of money and time. I couldn't even finish watching the movie.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We love RED. The cast is amazing and is so funny. We laughed the whole time.<br />It's a great movie to watch with friends.
B00DW5IKJI|4.0|I didn't know this was a hits album. But it's good to hear the older music again. Waiting for a new album......
1419702238|5.0|I have all the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and every single one has given me such a good time. It makes me laugh my *** off and this book is no exception.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|What a read, what a journey!  Anita Moorjani shares her innermost feelings during the journey of her life which covers her culture as well as her illness, lifestyle and relationships.  This writing from the heart has inspired me and affirmed my beliefs even though I have never had Anita's experiences.  Blessings upon you Anita and thank you.
1419705849|5.0|Funny as always! I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid!!!!<br />Every kid growing up should really read this. It is a must have.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really, really, really hope there is a sequel.  I Just loved this book.  It kept getting more and more interesting and exciting as I read.  I was a little disappointed in the ending but I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
B0036EDVS0|5.0|I simply love this movie, phenomenal & eery landscaping with great direction and a more whole approach to the sleepy hallow legend!
B002BY62A0|5.0|Dr. Campbell is a doctor I feel I can trust my life with. I have not eaten the same since I finished reading his book.  I also purchased his wife's cookbook to help me become healthy. Dr. Campbell is speaking loud and clear.  His courage is unbelievable.  His compassion is old school, one of which we experience less and less of.  Wake up America...before the meat and dairy industry puts us all six feet under!!!  It's time to raise a little hell, people!!!
B000TEPL92|4.0|I love most of the tracks on this album. I had attempted to buy just one or two tracks prior. Well worth the special price I paid for it!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My son recommended this to me. It is addictive and a great quick game to play to easy stress. Awesome!!!!1
B0052CK5PQ|4.0|Candid book that made me laugh out loud. Easy to read but written well.<br /><br />I'll be reading more of Moran's work.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|This movie had alot of action and suspense. During some points, the movie was slow, but then picked up. Good life's lesson at the end. Not for children!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Granny Smith isn't going to knock your socks of in the originality department for game play ... after all it is essentially a jump at the right time game, but it does have nice graphics, a smooth flow to it, and a couple of little tricks.<br /><br />You'll start out with two tools: Granny's cane to reach up for coins and apples (and later to hang onto things), and the ability to jump. For an old lady, Granny can jump pretty high! The trick is that for high jumps she also somersaults. The main skill you'll need to develop is knowing when to release the jump button so that she lands on her feet. She's racing the Apple Thief after all, and if she falls down he gains ground.<br /><br />You earn coins based on how well you perform in a level, and you have to spend the coins to advance to the next level. So for example you may have to play level one a few times to earn the 200 coins it takes to buy advancement to the next level.<br /><br />Granny doesn't take a lot App Permissions, so no fears there.<br /><br />I played this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and encountered no problems with the game.<br /><br />If you like arcade style timing and coordination challenges, then you'll enjoy Granny Smith. But you'll need to earn far more than one apple a day to succeed in this game. ;-)
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I'm a bit torn. I loved the concept, those with super powers are the bad guys and the regular guys are the ones who want to stop them. This is crazy, because when I was 14 I wanted to write a story with that plot but have not the skill, imagination, or ability to carry it out. This is like... my idea realized. It's kind of awesome. But to be super honest, in the prologue there was one part where an infant is killed and it totally tainted this book for me. It was so sad and disturbing. It's always been my problem with his books, the over the top, graphic violence, and again it just took the joy out of it. Brandon's books are the type that I compulsively read, but never go back to again (as oppose to Patrick Rothfuss which I enjoy every time I read, Harry Potter, and classic fares such as Lord of the Rings, Wizard of Earthsea, Chronicals of Narnia, etc) After the prologue, there wasn't as much graphic violence (as in detailed descriptions of someone dying in a horrible way) but still plenty of explosions and mayhem. Also then there was more humor in this offering, which lightened things a bit. I really liked David, how much he blushed, how nerdy and sweet he was. That was good. How he was good at everything... what is he, Wesley Crusher?? Not so much. Prof was a much more interesting character. Considering what he's been through, you'd think David would be a bit tougher, a bit darker.<br /><br />And unlike most of his other books, I saw the ending of this one a long way off. Except for Steelheart's weakness, I had guessed the other surprises. Which is surprising. I'm usually surprised by him. Now I feel like a giraffe in a birthday cake, or something (it's a joke, like, you'll get it if you read the book). Anyway, this was a fun read, and I recommend it, but I just hope the sequel, Firefight, won't have any descriptions like the ones in the beginning of this book. There's so much awful stuff in the news about kids in particular, I'm just not entertained, but rather appalled, by it.palled, by it.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game.. wish I didn't have to be online with it on my kindle.. but I do like this game alot.. thanks
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series, hated the ending!!  Can't wit to see the new season in January  hope there's some happy outcomes this season
B00DCRE83S|4.0|this is a great heavy metal album to have and I`m glad that I own it, with my others that I own
B005HJU7HA|5.0|The author is great the stories are terrific and I could not put the book down. Lost a lot of sleep could not stop reading it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game .I play every day. It is such great entertainment. I would recommend this game to everyone who loves bingo!!!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Had a little trouble getting into the book at first but after the first chapter it had me.  If you like reading about WWII you should like this book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This thing works wonders. I have used it to sharpen about three knives and it's still going strong. The diamond sharpener for serrated edges is great. Now I'm not gonna write some long six paragraph review but anyone on the fence about purchasing this should get it. It has done the job it was made to do and is small enough to transport anywhere you're going. It even has a hole for a lanyard so you'll never be without it. Perfect for campers and/or hikers.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|This movie was an interesting version of how he came to be, a prequel to the other movies. Saw it in theaters in 3D, I prefer it in 2D. but very intense and bloody.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|same as alot of games on amazon this app will not work will not even load. would like a fix or a refund
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you wondered what happened to &#34;doc&#34; after leaving the nightmare at Overlook, read this book. If you don't have a clue what I'm talking about, read this book. If you like supernatural thrillers, read this book.  If you can read, read this book.
B00AEFXXMI|3.0|Though I am the same age as Matthew Broderick, it took me twenty-five years to see this movie (I had a phobia for John Hughes back in the '80s).  When I finally rolled around to it, taking a \\"Bueller\\" myself just to see it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I thought it got bogged down in the third act, but it had a slam-bang finish and I gave it glowing reviews everywhere as a \\"feel good\\" movie.<br /><br />On a second viewing, about a year later, I was less impressed.  Parts of it are still \\"feel good\\" -- \\"Twist and Shout\\" for instance.  Yet, the second examination proved \\"Bueller\\" was less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The most vital part, of course, is Matthew Broderick.  I understand other names were mooted at the time, but Broderick's casting was essential.  Ferris is a total jerk.  He uses everyone, including his parents, friends, siblings, and even his girlfriend (risking getting her into trouble by kissing her inappropriately for certain circumstances).  The way he tricks people into doing his bidding may bode well for Ferris' future in the real world, but it makes him an unattractive character.  Matthew Broderick, on the other hand, can project, on film, an instant likability.  Few actors could have done what Broderick does.  In his better days, Michael J. Fox might have pulled it off.  John Cusack would have been too creepy, and Tom Cruise (another \\"teen\\" star of the time) might have been too phoney, like a used-car salesman's kid.  The lead role was extraordinarily well cast, and Broderick carries us through the movie, letting us see his side of things.<br /><br />But just remember:  Ferris is a suave liar able to charm everyone into doing his bidding.  So take what he says to you, the viewer, with a grain of salt.<br /><br />And he's so mollycoddled by his parents, how did Ferris get so adept at doing everything he does, rigging up dummies, etc?<br /><br />For the rest of the cast, Mia Sara is nearly as charming as Ferris, and is a little more believeable as a high schooler (Broderick is sometimes too wrinkled of forehead).  Ferris' friend, Cameron, on the other hand, is utterly annoying.  I had a Cameron of my own at one time, who seemed intent on not enjoying anything. I don't know why I hung around with him, and I can only imagine Ferris hangs around Cameron because he's easily deluded and comes from money.<br /><br />Ferris slickered me in the first viewing as he did everyone else, and I kept wishing I had been like him in high school.  On the second viewing, however, I kept thinking how awful his is to everyone, and I was glad I did not have a friend like him as well as one like Cameron.<br /><br />Jeffrey Jones, an excellent actor in projects as diverse as \\"Amadeus\\" and \\"The Hunt for Red October,\\" is a worthy opponent for Matthew Broderick's Ferris.  He is able to keep from being a hateful ogre, though we never feel sorry for when he loses, especially when he steps over the line and invades the Bueller household's privacy.<br /><br />As a movie, \\"Ferris Bueller\\" has great moments, and can raise a laugh at the sign on the water tower and the two guys who borrow the Ferrari.  And there are nice touches at the art museum, the Cubs game . . . the movie is full of brilliant moments.  Perhaps the best part is the constant threat that Ferris will be caught playing hookey, where he has so many near-misses with his father and Rooney it transcends the silliness of mere coincidence (culminating in the fact that his father actually sees Ferris running down the street and doesn't recognize him -- or blinds himself to it).<br /><br />I would still rank \\"Ferris\\" with the best of the \\"80s\\" teen comedies (alongside \\"Better Off Dead\\" and \\"Heathers\\").  But while Matthew Broderick's movie-charm shines through in every frame, Ferris' \\"charm\\" wore off quickly the second time around.  Someone ought to take Ferris down behind the gym and work him over, as many a better person has been (including me).
B00BT1XCOU|3.0|This season is like the office season 8 it was good but there were points that reallsucked i disliked the fact that ted didnt meet the mother yet n barney n robin didnt get married yet. 75 percent of the 8th season was good
B006H11P2I|5.0|I had been recommended to read this as a book by a friend, then, I was given the DVD by my daughter...<br /><br />From the opening scenes until the end I loved it. For me, it had everything, a great storyline, humour, romance, believability and marvellous actors who bought the myriad characters to life.<br /><br />The best film I've watched in a long time, it was fantastic!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This novel is terrible. The writing alone is probably the worst I've ever read. Her characters are vapid and contrary. The story wouldn't be that bad were it not for the atrocious narrative of the main character. At one point she refers to her female organs as 'her sex'. It's like all of the love scenes, if you can call them that, were written by a preadolescent child who has never experienced anything emotional on an adult level and substitutes what could be sexy into little more than a fourteen year old boy wondering what boobies feel like. How this sold even one copy is sad proof of the state of publishing and discerning readers everywhere. Basically, if your a forty year old who is immature and never read anything in your life for comparison, you'll love it.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I would give it a 4.9. It has a characters I can really relate to and the plot does not treat me like an idiot. The pace allows for character development but keeps moving forward.<br />The 1% who really know their genetics can feel smarty pants, the rest of us learn something.<br />It achieves a rare crossover between 'feel good' and self discovery.<br />Excellent
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great interface, wish there were larger puzzles with multiple colors.  However, there were a few puzzles with no logical progression besides long strings of guessing until I hit a block, but I guess that's what hints and errors are for.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|1. It supports casting from only 2 apps (youtube & netflix) from my iphone<br />2. Tried to cast from my laptop from chrome browser, the chromecast keeps resetting.<br />3. I wonder how google released it in its current state.
1848549245|5.0|This book is fantastic on helping you focus on the one important thing to achieve your goal. In other words multitasking is not always efficient. Gary Keller explains how being very busy does not mean you are being productive. It is very easy to read. I highly recommend it. Focus.....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King does it again!  Just when you think he cannot make you believe something is possible, he does. I loved the new characters, they were well written and true to form. Rose the Hat was a believable villain. I imagined the True Knot as gypsies or carnies. Yes, they should have been more intelligent in their machinations, considering their age and talents, but then again they had \\"measles\\" and were dealing with that simultaneously.  Who woulda thunk it? Something so simple destroying something so terrifying. It was reminiscent of the common cold in 'War of the Worlds'. The mere mention of Charlie Manx in the manuscript sent chills down my spine. I enjoyed the flashbacks to The Shining a great deal as well.  Basically I don't have one bad thing to say about this book, only that I was sad it ended.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Rented this movie not knowing anything about it. Really liked it. The filming was different than other movies, but it worked well in this one. I'd watch it again.
0670024856|5.0|Truly a masterpiece of modern literature, this is one book where five stars seems wholly insufficient. Set in a time when science was burgeoning with new ideas, Alma is not only an unlikely heroine due to the rarity of her gender's involvement in scientific endeavours, she also faces the additional challenges of how her ideas are accepted in a changing society - and the personal reconciliation of how they alter her own world view. The journey we are led on overflows with lively characters, a descriptive narrative the likes of which might bring Shakespeare himself to tears, and a beautiful, hopeful story in the midst of it all. Alma's interest in science is intertwined in the very heart of the tale, that generous attention scientific detail being the most enjoyable aspect for me.<br /><br />While I had my reservations before going into this, though the subject matter was so skillfully and tastefully handled, my misapprehensions were soon allayed, as this proved a pleasure to read. It was as beautifully illustrated as it was told. Very highly recommended!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|We watched it twice even. Great movie! Would rent it again, for sure. Would highly recommend this movie to people.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Catchy songs good voice took country by storm, like lady gaga but different sound and music,good looking women as well
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is excellent.  I expect it will raise the hairs on the backs of many people because it will challenge their beliefs about Jesus Christ.  This book really isn't about Jesus Christ but about society before, during and long after Jesus of Nazareth lived.<br /><br />It is an excellent accounting about Palestine and the culture during the time and place where Jesus comes from.  It delves deeply into the Jewish experience dating back to David and provides a thorough look at what was occurring then and, remarkably, even to this day.<br /><br />From a historical standpoint, to know a culture is to understand a people.  This book provides the backdrop for those who truly want to know Jesus, who he was and why he lived.<br /><br />Knowing this Jesus will strengthen one's faith, not diminish it because when we see how average he was for his times, we cannot help but be amazed at what his name has accomplished.<br /><br />Whether those achievements have been beneficial or detrimental to the human species is still debatable.
B00000IMTE|5.0|Great first effort with new band at the time LOng live the rainbow and richie Blackborne and Deep Purple hope we have not seen the last of them

B005HSL626|5.0|I would highly recommend this game. It's addictive, challenging and fun. The best part is that it's FREE. Plus, the graphics is amazing. 5 star!!!
B000005RU2|5.0|one of the best live albums ever enough said set the standard thats hard to equal, every mega group from Kiss on has to look at the purple first
0425252868|5.0|Great story. Even under the terrible conditions that the bomber pilots and crew flew in world war 2, there is still good in people who who are the enemy. The story ended well when the pilots of the planes on both sides got together years later. It left me with a good feeling about the good that are in many people.
B00884GR0W|4.0|I have had this game for a while and just updated it and I have loved it, until I got the update the game was great and I loved the new touches but my game will just randomly close for no reason like I hit the HOME button on my tablet, I don't know what is happening but it just keeps closing out randomly after I try to play the game, I hope this helps the developers to further perfect this already amazing game and I am looking forward to the next update!
0812992792|5.0|There is the real world, and then there is the world created by the Dear Leader.  If you are a fan of George Orwell, you will recognize parts of [[ASIN:0451524934 1984 (Signet Classics)]] and [[ASIN:0451526341 Animal Farm]].  Jun Do is classified as an orphan, even though his father is Master of the Long Tomorrows orphanage for boys.  Sometimes orphans were \\"adopted\\" if someone needed them, and sometimes they were just sent out on work details, provided they did not starve or freeze to death.  When he reaches a sufficient age, he is taken into the Army and becomes a tunnel rat, working on tunnels under the DMZ where he develops abilities to work in complete darkness.  He is chosen for greater things, is taught to endure pain by the application of hot candles and,- having proven his loyalty, is given a variety of assignments.  He becomes a master of creating stories to keep himself and others out of trouble.  He also learns that you might be disposed of if you know too much.  People disappear into the bowels of prison mines.  Ah, but one can reinvent himself, and even be a hero if the Dear Leader wants a hero, but even a hero might disappear.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at a society run by a mercurial leader who gets what he wants, most of the time, even if he has to send people to steal it from another country.  Anyone can be denounced and disappear, first to the mercies of the secret police, then sometimes into a public execution in the soccer stadium, more often into a prison farm or mine, and sometimes to be \\"salvaged\\" - there is a market for blood and body parts.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Math is not my thing but I found this fun and entertaining. GOT frustrated a few times but I still went back for more. Overall good game if you want something challenging.
B00EHDXYJ0|5.0|If it were anywhere else and any other work, you might think that the production here was just a little bit over the top, but this is the floating lake stage in Bregenz and it's Mozart's The Magic Flute, so anything goes really. Set right in the waters of Lake Constance, the opera is performed on the domed back of a giant turtle that is surrounded by three huge dragons, but the stage itself is only half the spectacle. The overture, for example, shows the capture of Pamina, the Queen of the Night looking on horrified as Sarastro, Monostatos and his slaves transport her away on a boat that takes a circuit of the stage. The stage then erupts into life in the battle that ensues, fireworks flying, a serpent winding down the stage to inflate to enormous proportions as the dragon that attacks Prince Tamino. Elsewhere the domed stage revolves, one half sprouting giant inflatable blades of grass or spikes that create a forest and change colour according to the scene, the other half used mainly to create a podium or dais for the grandstanding of The Queen of the Night and for Sarastro.<br /><br />Another significant feature of the David Pountney's production is the use of larger-than-life puppets for the three ladies (each operated by three puppeteers, reflecting the significance of this number in the work) and for the three boys, while the actual roles are sung off-stage (and all by female singers moreover). There are probably logistical reasons for this, although the stage is accommodating enough for all sorts of activity and numbers of extras and acrobats. If it allows the singers to concentrate on the singing however, well then that's also a benefit, but primarily such decisions appear to be taken for the sake of magic, spectacle and sheer scale. The dancing animals, for example, charmed by Tamino's magic flute, are recreated here through giant glowing eyes in a forest and it works wonderfully. Everything comes together exceptionally well in this way, the principal singers interacting with all the marvellous creations, the whole thing meticulously timed and choreographed.<br /><br />Just because there is huge importance placed on spectacle and entertainment at Bregenz doesn't mean however that the musical performance or the singing is in any way neglected or relegated to secondary importance. Conducted by Patrick Summers, the small ensemble of the Vienna Symphonic orchestra give a lovely, sensitive reading that captures the translucent beauty of the score and the brightness of its melodies with a lively performance. There are quite a few trims applied in this production and not just to the spoken dialogues (no March of the Priests at the start of Act II, Sarastro's 'In diesen heil'gen Hallen' reduced to second verse only, Sarastro, Pamina and Tamino's trio skipped), seemingly with the intention of allowing the work to be played straight through without an interval. This is perhaps for practical reasons, but there's nothing that seems to compromise the integrity of the work.<br /><br />There are times also when you think that a high level of fitness, intrepidness, acrobatic agility and a head for heights are more important considerations than singing ability when it comes to casting for Bregenz. For this production, where several performers reportedly ended up in the lake on one or two occasions, you might even add swimming as an important requirement this time, but the singing is marvellous too.  Pamina and Tamino in this production are both warmly engaging, demonstrating the lightness and clarity of tone required for these roles.  The same is true of Daniel Schmutzhard's Papageno and Dénise Beck's Papagena. The more challenging tessitura of Königen der Nacht and Sarastro are both very capably handled by Ana Durlovski and Alfred Reiter. Martin Koch as Monostatos (wearing a very nearly obscene codpiece), is also good.<br /><br />As productions of Die Zauberflöte go however, the Bregenz production then not only looks and sounds great, it's played perfectly in the spirit of the work. It's rare that you get all those elements coming together in a way that captures the pure vitality, the meaning and the entertainment of the work as well as this, although unquestionably the emphasis here leans more on the entertainment side of the work than the esoteric. The ability to scale the work up for the Bregenz stage works in its favour in this regard, but that also undoubtedly brings other considerable challenges. It's quite an achievement by Summers and Pountney then that this comes across quite as brilliantly as it does.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of fun. Puzzles change up each time so it's a new challenge each time. Very addicting. My kids love it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Besterest game in the world. Definately better than temple run or minoin rush. It can be really stupid sometimes but its awesome if you get the jackpot
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I loved the video, and now I can enjoy the game on my kindle fire! It's really funny and enjoyable to play! Definitely a must-play!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Found the game challenging but for someone as impatient as I am not sure I will be interested as new levels come out.
0345803485|5.0|I have read this book 3 times now. Glad I purchased it, easy to read. Wish I could get more books from this E L James.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I watched all 3 movies and couldn't wait till it was a collection. when I got it in blu-ray wow!
B0087YYHZU|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  I felt like I was at the theater when I watched this in Blu-ray.  Exceptional!  Any Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor fan will enjoy watching these amazing dancers in high def!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This Granny Smith game was made available on Google Play by the developers years ago. I had purchased this earlier from Google app store on my Samsung Tablet and loved it. Now with Amazon App store offering this as Free App of the day so that I can run this on my Kindle Tablets makes me very happy.<br /><br />Granny Smith may be a old lady looking character, But trust me she has lots of moves :-) She has tons of destructive capabilities and she can easily defy physics! She loves her Apple and it is your task to run after and collect those apples for her.<br /><br />Over all a fantastic game. Thanks for making everyone in the family happy. Five Stars!
B005LAII3U|5.0|Colin Farrell did an exceptional job in this remake.  We much preferred this release over the Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Colin Ferrell is a more believable person for this role... Sorry Arnold!
B004VM7M22|1.0|I am a big Ken Follett fan, but was disappointed by this offering.  I felt it could have been written by Ross Perot.  It was too sycophantic for my liking.  However, only one disappointment from the many great books Ken has given us is not bad at all.
B00E6890RG|5.0|i really didn't know that much about this Band until the release of this Album. i have heard their previous stuff and i just kind of shrugged it off.<br /><br />Haken's The Mountain is definitely an album for the ages. And the band is making a strong statement here saying that we have arrived, And we are here to stay.<br /><br />The Music surrounding this Album is nothing short of Brilliant. The Concept is Fantastic, The Songwriting is Superb, And the Musicianship is amazing.<br /><br />The Path leads off the album with a very quiet soft Interlude that sets the mood for the album.<br /><br />Atlas Stone is a beautiful piece of work that is absolutely Breathtaking. i love the Melody in this one.<br /><br />Cockroach King has a bit of humor in it. And it is very Progressive as well. This is definitely one of my favorites on the Album.<br /><br />The highlight for me on this album is Falling Back To Earth. This is by far one of the greatest song's that you will ever hear. This is very well Concocted and very Meticulously well written. Definitely a standout track.<br /><br />Haken's The Mountain is an Awesome Album. And if this doesn't win Album of the year, Then there is something seriously wrong with the Music Industry.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go and pick this one up today. This is a Fantastic release, And you won't be disapointed.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|If all homework is done, you've done all you need to do on Facebook, this is a good time filler for boredom
B000MDJH9A|5.0|Reminds me of where I come from, life outside of the tourist resorts in Jamaica is rough. Although the island is beautiful, their is a lot of poverty their. It shows how strong a hungry man's drive can be with the wrong motivation, but I guess it's the same motivation that makes them such successful music artist.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great acting, lovely location, fun time period... Thus series takes you back in time to Victorian England and to the trials of hamlet life and changing times. The charming characters become your friends and their causes becomes yours.<br /><br />I recommend this for a relaxing escape from today's hectic technology-driven days.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|the start of this game. didn't explain anything about how to start. after a lil while it did get better. om understanding the process. I'm sure it will be an interesting game.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have been playing this game over two years now, maybe a bit less. The game itself before it was bought by a larger company was awesome and I became addicted to it. Now though still loving the basis for the game I am searching for a comparable bingo game  withtrading to change to, because I do not like the new trading limitations they have put on the game.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|From the beginning I was sucked into the story and I didn't want to put the book down. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even that much more irrestable.  I had no idea that the French were involved in the Holocost.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I chose this rating because several weeks after reading it I am still thinking about this story.  Hard to understand and imagine how disposable life was at this point in our history.  Excellent read; couldn't put it down.  I live in VA and have been to Williamsburg many times so that made it even more interesting.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Just when you think you've figured things out , Kate Morton puts another twist in the plot.  Her characters are well drawn and engaging.  It was interesting to delve into WWII during the London bombings. Great read.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|Quality is not what I expected the image is weird and there is something wrong with the sound as well
B005XN31LY|5.0|Love the characters, fantasy and twists on each story. Great job on the costumes! When you think you know a story, be prepare for a surprise.
0440246318|4.0|As the book begins, Jack Reacher has been hitching rides and is somewhere along the interstate in Nebraska on a cold winter night.  He's got a busted nose but we never learn how he got it or where he's coming from.  He's also heading to Virginia to meet a woman he's never met but only because she sounded interesting on the phone.<br /> After waiting in the cold for exactly ninety-three minutes, he gets a ride from three people heading for Chicago.  The two men and a woman who pick him up are wearing identical outfits, prompting Reacher to think they are members of a team on a business trip.  But they are anything but that and Reacher soon discovers that he's got himself involved in a massive conspiracy.<br /> Jack Reacher is a former major in the U. S. Army and has served as a military police officer in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He's won many combat decorations but tells someone . . . \\"we all won medals so you shouldn't read too much into it.\\"<br /> Once I started reading this book I found it extremely difficult to put it down.  Lee Childs paces the action well with steadily building tension and many surprises popping up along the way.  I finished the 500+ pages in three days and now I'm looking forward to reading the most recent Jack Reacher novel.<br /> The dramatic climax involves Reacher performing an almost superhuman task, engaging in guerilla tactics against numerous bad guys, a situation that would more realistically take a platoon of troops to resolve.  It's an action packed ending but it strained credibility to such an extent that I rated it four stars instead of five.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|So funny!!! Keeps you thinking too...I'd watch it over and over. Plus I really enjoy any movie with Robert Downey jr!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I gave it a rating this is stupid that I have to write text to submit.  If you want people to rate books allow them to do so quickly without having to write a paragraph.
B000YHG72E|4.0|I highly recommend this movie any time of the year. It is a good family movie. I have watched this movie maybe a half a dozen times and it keeps me laughing hysterically.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|DREDD stays true to the comic that inspired it. Excellent work by Karl Urban for capturing this character perfectly. Thank you for making this film. Please make sequels.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The google chromecast has a lot of potential, it is a really cool and unique product that offers what some of the larger media players offer but in a much smaller compact size. Installation is a breeze, simply connect it to your TV , connect your device such as an iPhone to to wi if signal sent off by the chromecast to enter your information, connect back to your home wifi network, and your ready to start using it. What's neat about e chromecast in a way is the fact that you aren't really &#34;streaming&#34; the content to your tv, what's really happening is say your watching a YouTube video, instead if streaming it to your tv, the chromecast receives the information such as the website name/URL etc and it quickly finds it online and starts to play the selected content. It works really quickly and I have no complaints on it. It would be really great though if you had the ability to share photos or videos stored in your device. Maybe in the future in some automatic updates google can incorporate this into the chromecast. Right now it doesn't really offer much, but for the relatively low price point you can't really complain, you can only enjoy what is possible at the moment.<br /><br />I rate this product 4 stars out of 5 stars!<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you out!
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Reads like a documentary, thoroughly enjoyed the backgound of the author as a SEAL and also his account of the mission.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|I am a martial artist and love this genre of movies. The action scenes were phenomenal and nonstop...reminiscent so the older films....
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I loved this movie when it came on tv. It is shown in spurts,so I decided to buy it. Know what is cool? You can watch it with your family and grandchildren. NOT one thing to fast forward thru or run to the kitchen so you don't have to watch that part again. It is a cute fun lovely movie ,and no one could do a better job then Drew Barrymore. She is splendid. Everyone in this movie is fabulous and believable. I love it. Worth buying.
1451648537|5.0|I found it very interesting.  I really enjoyed reading it.  it is sad that he is no longer with us.  He was such a visionary.  I will miss his new products.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|How nice to have a calculator ready at hand and can be actually seen and worked with.  No squinting of eyes needed to see.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|It is like a sweet Freaks and Geeks with a little more sex involved, and includes some more surreal elements.
B00555X8OA|4.0|Not an easy read but packed with valuable data and insights. I've found myself over and over again checking my level of thinking.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|A very fun game with cool graphics. I love to play this game anytime of the day.  Great game to relax with.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read it with the narration and absolutely love it! I secretly wish there was a sequel so I could continue. My next book will be wurthering heights.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Like his Kite Runner this book is also very good. I like the way he combines different situations in one single storyline. Good, Captivating and touching story.
1475143389|1.0|Never buy a book that starts with \\"What if I told you\\".  It will be lies.  I purchased on accident.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game to play. Waiting for more rooms. It only had 10 rooms to start, not sure why it wouldn't have had more to start with?
B001NYVY8O|4.0|Definitely an evolution in the music of Limp Bizkit. From jazzy drum beats to metal riffs on the guitar, Limp Bizkit knocks your socks off again!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|can't get into game...won't let me download a &quot;supposed&quot; update.  PLEASE FIX THIS!  I also have not been able to see any of my neighbors villages!
1933492953|5.0|Have never picked up a book like this before. This goes waaay beyond your typical how to, but I would still recommend it to amateurs and professionals alike anyway. It taught me so much and my perspective of comics have only been improved.<br />Fantastic art, fantastic points, fantastic teacher.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Some funny one-liners.  But, while I adore Ellen and her TV show, she isn't really a great writer.  It all seemed very elementary and full of puns.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Who doesn't love this album?  It was at a &#34;Can't say no&#34; price so i did the digital order. I've been able to play DSOTM for my boys and expose them to some Pink Floyd now.  It's never too late to get kids exposed to good music.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed out loud through the entire book!  Her stories of awkwardness are a complete win!  I will read this again!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun bingo game that becomes addicting. Game freezes at times but for the most part works great. You play against other players to try to get bingo the fastest.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very well written.  I enjoyed seeing the development of Charlie's character change and grow up, and then ultimately crash.  This is a very honest look at high school relationships.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Best show ever. I hope there are more episodes. We watched these non stop. Be prepared to be glued to your tv.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three of the 50 shades books back to back. It took three weeks absolutely the best page Turner 's I've ever read. Hope to read more by this author soon.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was ok but I like it but I thought It was fine werid right a girl liking a dictionary nah I didn't I like books book not dictionary
B009NQZVKG|5.0|A  wonderfully written and researched book. Can't wait until the next one comes out.. I have read all James Rollin's books and haven't read one that I haven't loved.
B005N9EZ90|5.0|Diamond Head has got the groovyness of Led Zeppelin and the speed of Judas Priest. I would definitely tell anyone that loves music to buy this album
B007SGM084|5.0|This was purchased for a friend, have not read it. That being said you have to love buying books from Amazon (instant gratification]<br />with Prime.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I love this movie and it was in great condition. I will be watching this movie for years to come.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Once again Nicholas Sparks had moved me to tears and made me laugh all with the same novel. Really made me think about the past, too.
0312944926|1.0|Not up to the usual Dan Brown thriller. I am sorry I bought this book and would not recommend it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Wow. This was a very satisfying ending to the wheel of time series. I really enjoyed seeing how all the threads got tied together and how prophecies & viewings from early in the series were fulfilled. Bravo.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|&#34;thrilling&#34; is not how I would put it.  it is a good, basic, film of it's genre.  Entertaining with noise, excitement, but no real depth of either acting or story.  No Oscar here, but good mindless fun.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|It was a decent read, but I did not really like the main character in the story, and it really did not compare to Gone Girl in my opinion.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|One of the better books of the  year. A concise summation of the actual historical years surrounding the writing of the bible and the ministry of the Jews of the New Testament. I heard Fox news bad mouth this book but I found it to be very enlightening historically. A religious fundamentalist might not approve of the FACTS but any one with an open mind will find it easily readable and enjoyable . For instance he relates how the census regarding the necessity of Mary and Joseph to travel to Bethlehem was untrue and fabricated to fit with the old testament hypothesis that the messiah would come from the house of david ( bethlehem ). Jesus was always referred to in the Bible as coming from Nazareth and not Bethlehem. The census did not cover Joseph's home town and if it did it would have required  to have you counted in the locality where you worked and not where someone was born. These points are gleaned from the only source of history of the times written by Josephus, an author quoted by everyone as he was living at the time of the events
B003SI7OQ4|4.0|very cute , my 3 year old enjoyed it. It was simple enough for him to under stand . Great movie
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|Pretty nice because it includes traffic cams and collige cams,but  i do not see why<br />Its $4_00.And you cannot control the traffic cams at all.But still good.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I play this game on my phone through Google play and it updated. But the Amazon didn't please update so that I can fish on my kindle too. Also its not allowing me to send friends gift on my kindle. Please fix. I will give a higher rate once it is.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Beautiful and durable but slim, I had a Ringke slim and this provides much more protection.  Was afraid after reading other reviews about non apple cables fitting, but no problem with generic headphone cable and amazon basics black lighting cable. The latter has a much larger end than the apple version but fit without a problem ( just snug).
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|It is great for its price but it does have some lag problems. overall it is a great game and you should get it.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|If you saw the first movie, then you will catch on to this movie, other wise it's just another cop shoot them up type movie.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game rocks! I cannot stop playing it! I first got the free version, and I was like &quot;this sucks!&quot; But the deluxe version is totally worth the 99 cents! I can play more restaurants. It is more of a challenge and I just have more fun. The only downside for me is that there are three or four restaurants that I have to pay $3.99 for. That sucks, but other than that I really love this game!!! You gotta buy it!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i checked google play and the update is posted on there. amazon is just slow to post it. i'm sure they will eventually so we've all just have to be patient. fair warning, heard some pretty bad things about the update already. check out the reviews from the googleplay site. for the ones who already uninstalled their games, you might as well just download it from googleplay since you've already lost all your game history. lets hope amazon gets their butts moving soon or my daily bonus is going to reset to 0....
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Lots of side stories not focused on any one person but a team effort powerful stuff when ppl come together to over come trials
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Ma fave adaptation so far/ Johnny lee miller could not be more adorable or a more perfectly unique Holmes/ this show switches up the genders and has some kick-ass women- including lucy liu- not only a female Watson but a woc that kicks more ass than any dr Watson I've seen so far!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Google Works very good for us. Has helped me get information needed here at the hospital. I also use at home often.
B00A50PDDY|4.0|This band is amazing. I saw them live in San Francisco with Fall Out Boy and was blown away by their talent. Definitely worth a try if you want to listen to something new and kinda funky.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Almost as bad as twilight, it lacked substance and an actual plot. The characters were flat and utterly predictable, I should have known it was going to be as baseless as it was, but I expected it to be better than it turned out.
B00E193TM2|3.0|Not their best, but still pretty solid. If you are a fan of their previous works you will probably find something to love about this album.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book was very informative. I had no idea what went on in a minimum security federal prison.  It seems our government wastes a lot of money and energy on low level criminals. Surley, there is another way.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Good read. Just like the Mistborn series, it is hard to put down. ....shame we have to wait a year for the next absinthe series.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Kept me interested. It is amazing how our minds can get the best of us. It seemed very unlikely  the husband would have committed such a horrible crime considering what a great person be seemed to be.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Kids of all ages will enjoy this game. Great app if you are waiting in line or at an appt.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am a little concerned about the heat the unit puts off. Will it shorten the life of the components? I really hope programmers are writing more apps for this. More is needed to make it a great player.
B00A287PG2|4.0|While I have not yet finished reading the book, I feel McKinsey trained its personnel to feel they were the best, whether they were the best or not.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This movie was the worst I have seen in years. I hope you can save yourself the time and aviod the waist of time and money. I understand some may just love this type of movie. I should have known if Brad Pitt was in it, it would be a bomb.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I found this to be a very entertaining show.  I particularly liked the interactions between the very likeable characters.  They drew me in and I watched all of the episodes through a few sittings.
B000TERI3O|5.0|it's a merle treasure box. this is a great buy for the price. you get an album you can put on and just get into a merle mood. he takes you down heartbreak road, then back again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This works amazingly well for my needs and my tutoring students love it. It gets the job done.<br />Love this calculator.
B004H1EAJA|5.0|A defining album of the century! They weren't just a band they were a lifestyle. ARTrock  not alternative.the album brings everything from love to the darkness of the unknown.......
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I tried this game as a freebie first and then decided to buy it,I am enjoying playing it and it makes a change from hogs.It seems to be quite an interesting story but some objects are quite hard to find,overall it is a good game.
B000007ODY|5.0|Sunday mornings are my quiet time, that's when I like to listen to classical music.  The artist met all my expectaions  for Brahms music.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Someone finally has digital copies figured out. With this Blu-Ray, you get to choose your digital copy format: iTumes, Vuudu, Amazon Instant Video, Etc.  I hate being locked into iOS only formats or the utter cluster that the ultra-violet thing is.  Just let me choose how i want the digital version...and that is exactly what they did with this version.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Loved Chromecast, comes very well packed and all necessary cables and accessories for any installation.<br />The only problem is that I live in south america and I can not download the app for my iPad & iPhone. When is it available?
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Another excellent point and click adventure from Fire Maple (FM). The hint feature was useful in a bind, but most of the puzzles I could solve without much trouble. I enjoyed the previous two games from this group and this latest is probably my favorite from FM yet. Hoping another is planned as I like this type of casual game for the tablet touchscreen.<br /><br />The first release was crashing on Kindle Fire HD 8.9, but the developers replied quickly to my error report and a fix was available within a few days. After uninstall and reinstall the game worked great.
B00E6895M6|5.0|Not a single dull track on this album, and Lauren Mayberry has an amazing voice. The price of this CD is pretty cheap considering how great every track is. One thing that isn't mentioned however, is that its in a foldable paper case, not the standard plastic type.
1440503257|3.0|Though not what I was looking for the site was able to help me find many other things my friends and family were lookin for
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Exactly what I wanted. Special edition was amazing and fairly priced. I love this artist and the album came just in time.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Oh this music was so good and I listen to it all the time and also, share it with my friends.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Uninstalled til ads are gone. For real, I thought that was the main reason for paid apps. Support the devs so we don't get the annoying ads. Shame
B009KS4XRO|5.0|LOTS OF FUN!  Great diversity and options throughout the app. :) I recommend this game anyone that loves to play Bingo!
B00B52F278|5.0|The whole series is one of my favorites.  I highly recommend getting all four DVDs.  What I find  interesting, is that the show is based on real people in history.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Really enjoyed this installment!  It made me want to keep reading the series. Cassandra Clare does a great job writing.
B00CJ4OMO0|5.0|I bought it because it was one of the first films shot with 70mm film in the 2.20 to 1 aspect ratio. Its like a classic HD movie. The story was great.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love being able to get a book on my phone & read it where ever I am (that has internet). The convenience is great. Love getting the free books. Love not having to carry a book where ever I go. I love to read.
B0084HJE0S|1.0|25 pages of nothing. This is a very brief overview of html5's new features and how it integrates with java script. Nothing to try.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Another modern Nancy Drew..  separated sisters, by continents and lifestyle.  The  black sheep is murdered , the conventional sister looks for reasons, cause and killer.  Along the way<br />Maggie meets a  handsome Frenchman.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I've had to restart twice but I keep coming back.<br />You can get by without buying gems. but it takes a lot of time.
B000AP04MO|5.0|A lot of directors have tried to capture the delicate unraveling of a marriage, but few ever seem to be able to capture ever angle to the astute wonderment and honesty of `Two for the Road'.  A film that appears, on the outset, to be rather chaotic and uneven comes together in a beautifully robust telling of marital follies and the reuniting of spirit.<br /><br />I think that is the most beautiful aspect of the film's obvious themes, that reuniting of spirit, for it allows the audience to find hope and charm in the film's depiction of this marriage on the rocks.  By giving us interwoven vignettes that show us the beginning, middle and end (or is it the end?) of this relationship, we are able to see how time has affected their lives and how similar situations, spaced years apart, carry a very different connotation.  I love the balance here.  While it may appear to some that Marc is the aggressor here, as one watches all the details unfold it really becomes clear that this is a very well balanced portrayal of two people causing hurt and attempting reconciliation at various times and to various degrees.  No one is the chief aggressor or victim, and that to me shows an honest and unbiased look at marriage in general, since no problem is solely one person's fault.<br /><br />It just doesn't happen that way.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney are at the tip top of their game here, delivering stunning performances that dig down deep and show us so many shades of character.  Portraying a couple at three different stages of their relationship, there is a lot of develop and they do so effortlessly.  Hepburn in particular possesses so much girlish charm, commanding the screen as a youthful choir girl (convincingly played, despite the fact that she was well into her 30's at the time) and then falling right into middle age and motherhood without a single hitch.  Finney bounds along with so much commanding presence, playing up his rugged good looks and booming voice while exuding charm that would make Cary Grant blush with jealously.<br /><br />Simply a flawless film that will make you laugh, cry and smile, sometimes simultaneously.e exuding charm that would make Cary Grant blush with jealously.<br /><br />Simply a flawless film that will make you laugh, cry and smile, sometimes simultaneously.
B004C6QFAM|1.0|The product received was not what was pictured, which is a movie, It was a DVD/CD of Steve Vai, who I don't know who that is. Returned item.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Only playing the game because got an update for ice age village game and couldn't play that one because the update dose not work.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|all of her associates and efforts in the beginning got to be more than a reader can digest.<br />However the last two chapters after she had been such a success with Saturday Nite live.<br />THESE WERE HEART WARMING ACCOUNTS OF HER GOALS AND SUCCESS.
B004X80QNG|3.0|This is an overall useful app for organizational purposes. I had a hard time at first figuring out how to use everything, and its labeling is awkward. It is useful if you need one electronic resource for your general task lists, calendar, and events, but its features are very basic. I can accomplish just as much with my physical planner in a much quicker and less confusing way. Pocket Informant is okay, but I do not think it is worth $10. I only downloaded it because it was free that one day, and I have actually uninstalled it from my tablet.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This app is so fun it goes along with the others from this group. It is fun for the whole family. My son and I both enjoy saying things to the dog. It is worth all five stars that I gave it in this review.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|I enjoyed this movie overall, but it's nothing special. It has no real depth or elaborate character development, and parts are often corny/hokey. But, if you watch it knowing this beforehand, you are more likely to appreciate it. It is a decent time-waster, but I would not purchase it to own. Rent it maybe.
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Shyamalan seems to have botched yet another film with great potential. To me at least, I liked the premise of futuristic survival story on an earth which has \\"evolved\\" to be hazardous to humans, but two main things ruined it - 1) Jaden Smith's acting and 2) several gaping plot holes.<br /><br />1) Jaden Smith's acting, as noted by many, seemed painfully forced in this film. I realize they were trying to go for a kid raised in a military-academy environment, but Jaden's acting was so stiff I just never saw him as a believable character.<br /><br />2) The plot holes:<br /><br />a. The enemy aliens are shown to have ships with laser weapons, and humanity apparently somehow manages to fight them off with oversized swiss army knives and no warships? Maybe these things just weren't shown, but to me it doesn't make sense to be transporting an Ursa on a ship without actual weaponry.<br /><br />b. Ghosting is a cool concept and great for personal fortitude, but it's kind of unnecessary. As demonstrated when Kitai's sister is killed, if a person is within a sealed environment the Ursa cannot detect his/fear. None of the humans thought of wearing sealed suits like astronauts or fire-fighters?<br /><br />c. Earth doesn't seem to have evolved to kill humans as much as it was suggested initially. Earth is different, but not horribly more dangerous besides the rapid temperature changes. None of the flora was demonstrated to be dangerous to humans which would have been cool. Even the various animals aren't really evolved to kill humans - the leech has developed poison, the monkeys were provoked, the condor/eagle was trying to feed its chicks, the big lion/tigers were hungry, etc.<br /><br />d. Why did the condor/eagle save Kitai? Kitai was more trying to save himself than the babies (and failed to save the babies). It's not an impossible scenario, but the condor/eagle save felt way too convenient.<br /><br />e. How does the Ursa get around if the only senses it seems to have are touch and smell (maybe hearing)? Unless it's using echolocation, how can navigate through uneven terrain like in the mountain with all of the cliffs and pitfalls? Again, it could be countered easily by wearing sealed suits and actual weapons.
B00B52F278|5.0|This is a great series. All if these have a lot of nudity so not meant for young viewers. It is great to see how Rome was taken by the slaves.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great little calculator, the ads do not interfere, very user friendly and I use it all the time! Thanks!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Out of the first three seasons I would have to say this is my favorite. The first season started off a little slow introducing you to the characters and situation. This series was more fun.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This voyage through beautiful England, is indeed, a pilgrimage into one's inner soul, family relations, social issues and more. Full of subtle humor that makes it a very enjoyable reading..
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Had heard that Season 2 was not that good but I enjoyed each and every one of the episodes.  Can't wait for Season 3.
B003J4MAAC|1.0|I couldn't even PURCHASE the movie because the stupid 1-click-purchase feature doesn't work. Amazon needs to get there act together, now. I mean why is the stupid 1-click-purchase feature mandatory even?!?!
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|The quintessential Fleetwood Mac album! This collection contains the harmonies and lyrical emotions we all love about this super group.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was fascinating because of the unusual pictures he incorporated into the story. Found out later on the pictures came first then the story. Read they are making the book into a movie. I would really like to see this movie.
B00007GZR5|5.0|You can't go wrong with a Robin Williams movie.... He's my favorite and the colors and story are wonderful to watch.  Loved it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can get lost for hours when I get on Pinterest.  I have made many of the things that I have pinned, saved tons of money on dinners, gifts, and crafts.  Love it.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|This is a page turner for sure! It starts out a little confusing and then as you read you get totally sucked in!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a very fun and addictive game. I have been playing now for over three hours and didn't even realize how much time had passed. If you like this type of game, I would definitely suggest trying it.
B008JFUO36|3.0|If you don't like Cruise this will not work for you since he's the whole movie. Nice twist near the end.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|Years ago I used to play WoW and was always frustrated with macroing all my different abilities on my keyboard and having to do the hand Olympics to raid or to do PvP. That is when I found this product and thought conceptually this thing must be awesome! I thought how awesome it is to have everything there in your reach and accessible but boy I was wrong. Years later I decided to take the plunge and get this thing so I can make my life so much easier for almost any game. When I got it I was so excited and thought of all the possibilities that come with this new device. I plug it in and install the drivers and test it out. My initial opinion was WOW this thing is so cool! You can see life news feeds on the LCD screen and see in-game stats etc. But as I came more familiar with the device the more I began to hate the thing. So the G-keys on the device are membrane keys and as an avid mechanical keyboard enthusiast I was used to the fluidity of mechanical keys and the feel of the keys on this device were so rough. It would have really rough key presses and due to the positioning of the keys it made some just really annoying to press. The other thing is I thought how nice it is for the device to have an analog stick on it so now I can bind movement on that and put everything else on the G-keys but that analog stick is really lacking. It only senses one level of movement. There are no varying degrees of sensitivity on the thing. You push it up 5% it recognizes it as 100% and so forth. Also the buttons on next to the analog stick are really awkwardly placed. I don't know the reasoning behind the placement but it just doesn't feel right.<br />In the end I wish it was so much more but it was just so much less than what I had expected. I can't say it's a terrible product because everyone will use it for different things and some people like things that I don't etc so those are my two cents about the product. If you have a similar background as me then you should probably lookfor something else but if nothing here resonates with you then i'd definitely tell you to give it a try.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|Never really took off. Entertaining and easy reading. I expected a lot more drama and suspense. Not one of Grishams best.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|I loved this movie growing up. I will be happy to share it with my kids when they get older.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|He is and always will be the true storyteller! I recommend this book to anyone who needs to travel through this world of today.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game for a wide range of ages. Try it you will enjoy! My grandchildren in 4th and 5th grade are very good  with this game and like to play it when they visit.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely love this book, I would suggest it to anyone. It is possibly the best book I've read in a long time.
B00AEFXZVM|4.0|Loved the movie maybe even better than the original.  Okay, maybe not as good as Kevin Bacon but I did enjoy it very much.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is a great protector because it is sturdy and is very handsome.  I love that I can prop my kindle up at so many different angles. I would tell everyone to get this little case.,
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Can't think of anything negative to say about it. It's much better than GO Keyboard I was using. It's definitely worth the money.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Overall, this is a really wonderful app. It has actually been my first exposure to Magic: the Gathering, and I've greatly enjoyed it. You can pay for awhile on the free app alone, but I went ahead and purchased the full app for $9.99.<br /><br />Seems a staggering price, but I think the gameplay, excellent graphics, and solid recreation of the card game makes it with the price. You won't be paying for specific cards, at least.<br /><br />My problems with the game are twofold: Multiplayer is Bluetooth only, which is a huge loss, as I think a WiFi capable multiplayer would help them greatly. The other is the blocking touch movements are sometimes buggy.<br /><br />A number of reviewers said that this app would go into an endless download cycle and eat up all of their devices memory. I believe this is only a problem with 1st gen Fires. I am playing on a 2nd gen Fire and have had no such issues.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Classic Ronstadt songs. I have the albums, now I have the CD's to listen to in the car. Excellent purchase.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app all the time and its great. Buying, selling or browsing. This is awesome. Love this app all the way. Very convient.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Excellent music from a talented singer and performer. I enjoyed every song on this CD which is remarkable as usually you like a few songs but not every song. This is an exceptional musical experience. Love it.
B004SDEP38|2.0|It wasn't what I was looking for. Yes it is free, but you have to buy the full version to get things done.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Classic Carole King blasts from the past. I have the album and now I have the CD to enjoy in the car. Excellent purchase.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|I bought this movie because I was reading somewhere that it is one of the best movies of 2012.  Well let me tell you, I watched this movie 3 times, googled it, and discussed it with friends and I'm still not sure what it's about.  When The Reader gives a movie 3 1/2 stars it must be pretty good.  I'm going to watch it again.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|When this app stops working delete it and download it again. It will start working again. It really will work trust me I know.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|This film has some very well photographed shots of the Grand Canyon. The 3-D effect was O.K, but the narrator does not show a fair look at the pros and cons of hydro-electric dams. the video is more focused on showing damaged (from there point of view.) sections of the canyon than the beauty everyone wants to see. Showing some damage is good, but this film makes the place look bad. Which is not what one expects from an Imax film.
B000W27AE0|5.0|Originally released in 1985, eight tracks made up this superb album.  Now, Universal Music has released it with extra tracks from the same time frame from the band.  TFF would never match this album again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Such a sweet book of a family torn apart by so many things.  The years in between and how it all comes together again.  I would recommend it to anyone from high school age on.
B005VO6MYS|5.0|In 1986, this two album set was originally released on vinyl as an import.  Eventually it became available on cd.  A combination of rock and jazz, Sting had a handpicked backup band for his first solo outing.  This year, we get the crappy The Last Ship.  What happened, Sting?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am doing this book for a 8th grade book report and I 're..Lily enjoyed this book because there were so many emotions in the book it's perfect for a project!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I thought the movie moved at a good pace.  Unfortunately, there are no nude Helen Mirren scenes  (losing one star).  Morgan Freeman has a small part in the movie.  Watch the end credits and notice ALL the people assigned to Freeman  (makeup for Mr. Freeman, etc).  Some actors do not know how bad real people have it.
030758836X|3.0|This book reminded me of certain movies that are excellent but which I have no desire to ever see again because they're so depressing (\\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" and \\"No Country For Old Men\\" come to mind).<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is a great twist on the classic murder mystery, with a victim who's not really a victim and the villain turning out to be the last person you'd expect. It's a well-written book, but not one I'm in a hurry to read again. I don't demand happy endings all the time, but I read books (and watch movies) to be entertained, not depressed. I want there to be some hope for the future in my endings, some lesson learned, some hint of redemption in even the most immoral characters.<br /><br />When I got to the ending of this book and realized the two main characters are stuck with each other for the rest of their lives, I thought \\"You two deserve each other, so I'll leave you to it. Good riddance!\\"<br /><br />I gave it an extra star for the skillful look into two very depraved minds, but don't think I'll be reading it again anytime soon.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|The new self portrait album is even better than I thought it would be.  Some really beautiful songs that I've never heard before.  Thank you Bob Dylan & Company!!
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|This is really excellent. Great playing and outstanding singing from Beth Hart. She can sing Tina Turner (Nutbush City Limits) as well as the Tina herself (never thought that would be possible) and do a great Billie Holliday/Nina Simone (Strange Fruit). When I think about the fuss made about Amy Winehouse (Beth can do her too), it is criminal that most people have never heard of her. Joe's great too of course, but this is not a recording about him. As these are covers it is not exactly \\"original\\", but this is an example that proves that originality is often overrated.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I first started this book, people kept telling me &#34;oh it's so good, you should read it&#34; and I just read it thinking I would be perfectly fine. All I have to say is John Green, I hate you so goddamn much for making such an incredible book. I hate you for making me feel the sorrow Hazel feels. I hate that this book is now on my favorites list and will always be.
