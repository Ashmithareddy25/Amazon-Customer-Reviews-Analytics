1440503257|4.0|This book really looks great. I didn't read it yet, just quickly browsed through it. And I would give it 5 stars, but problem is that it was damaged. Most pages are not cut straight, they look like they were torn. But I recommend this book despite that damage cause I think it is really interesting, and yours probably won't be damaged :)
0312323867|1.0|I bought this at the same time I bought \\"Something Borrowed\\" (otherwise I would not have bought \\"Something Blue\\" after reading \\"Something Borrowed\\", since I did not enjoy the latter). I did not like \\"Something Blue\\" either: It is not realistic. You just now how it is going to end, but still it is not believable. All this \\"turn a new leaf\\" thing. Going from an obnoxious person to a forgiving loving one. I don´t think so. Leaving her job when she is pregnant and spending all her savings in designer clothes? Plain stupid. There is not a leading female role in this book, a strong character, a smart woman. No, just the opposite. She has no backbone (just like the protagonist in \\"Something Borrowed\\"). It is going straight to the bin. Don´t say I didn´t warn you.
0743243153|4.0|A lot of lengthy reviews have been written on this little gem of a book that I think it is slowly becoming a classic as year after year we can still find this on the book shelves around the world. I have seen it in many nations. I will not add to the already thorough reviews.<br /><br />So, here goes, if you like self-help books and are looking for a fresh view this is probably a book for you. Life may be difficult but a book at $9.00 (new) or $2-3 (used) this should not be a difficult decision.<br /><br />If you are not particularly keen on these genres of books and are just seeing what is out there, out of curiosity, it may also be worthwhile as there is on average a very positive rating of this book. There must be some interest if you have made it to this review - and again, for the price and ratings, it is hard to go wrong. BUT - having said this it may be best to read the 1 ratings along with the 5, if you are skeptical as it is not for all. I quite enjoyed the thoughts and like to think about thinking.
0061537969|5.0|The Art of Dancing in the Rain cleverly delivers entertainment and thought-provoking questions about man's best friend. The reader will experience a complete emotional spectrum including joy, anger, and sadness while simultaneously learning about racing techniques. Not to be overlooked is the insightful approach to guessing how a dog thinks and interacts with it's co-evolved species. The book is written from a dog's point of view throughout the dog's entire life and my one wish is for this to be a true story of how clever canines truly are.
B00288KNL8|5.0|This movie is in excellent shape.  3D on one side and regular on the other. The price was great.  My grandkids and I have watched and watched this so many times that we lip sinc it and quote complete sections of it. Thank you for this movie.
0763631205|5.0|I shopped around quite a bit for the \\"perfect\\" edition of Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\".  I settled on this edition, and I couldn't be more pleased and satisfied.  Quite simply, Candlewick produced a beautiful edition of this COMPLETE work.  I stress complete, because as I was searching for a good edition, I discovered several others which were abridged.  As best as I can tell, this edition has preserved the original work.  The rest of my review will focus on the cosmetic aspects of this edition, and why it's perfect for me.    The dust jacket is thick and gorgeous with detailed artwork.  The title \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is raised and glossed (tho the rest of the cover is matte).  Under the dust jacket I was surprised to see that the publisher made the hardcover appear like scrooges door with the marley knocker.  The back cover is also made to look like the back of a door.  You cannot turn a page of text in this book without seeing color artwork, of which the vast majority are highly detailed.  There are also several pages dedicated only to artwork which is fun to admire.    The page stock is very thick, and the typography fits very well by giving you an old world feel.  The size of the words and spacing is typical of what you'd see in a young adult or early teen book.  That's not to say there aren't plenty of reasons for an adult to love this edition.  I have no regrets in regards to my purchase of this edition, and I trust that you will cherish it too.
038533348X|4.0|This was my first Vonnegut book, and I wasn't disappointed. It took me a bit to really get into it (about 50 pages) but after that it was pretty smooth sailing. I didn't find it hilariously funny like some readers, but I did find it hugely entertaining. It's a pretty fast-paced read (there are 127 short chapters). The themes covered (religion, meaning of life, end of world, government, war) were right up my alley and I found myself agreeing with the author's observations. The style of the writing is very modern and it feels like it could have been written today. Overall, I found Cat's Cradle to be a pretty good read, and would recommend it to anyone who might be interested in reading something from this author.<br /><br />I'm definitely looking forward to reading more Vonnegut in the future.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|This is one of the most stunning albums I've listened to in a long time!  It's a sonic avalanche with lyrical depth that is uncommon in modern music.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.

B0045HCJKS|4.0|This review is from the 2010 DVD re-release of the original film.    From the early to mid-'70's, there was a run of science-fiction films that seemed to be trying to break out of the pulp stereotype, and to address questions about where expanding technology and cultural changes from the '60's were leading us as a society.  Generally speaking, the first 'Star Wars' film effectively canceled that trend for some time - during the '80's, most science-fiction retreated back into the adventure mold, or else confined itself to satire ([[ASIN:B00005N7Z1 Robocop]]) or to eccentrics (Terry Gilliam's brilliant [[ASIN:B000G8NXZA Brazil]]).  It would be interesting to know, if the theory of parallel universes is true, to what lengths the science-fiction field might have developed if it hadn't been altered in 1977, although it's possible that it had already reached a saturation point with these other themes.  That may even have helped propel Lucas' efforts to greater heights than it would have reached otherwise - as vastly entertaining as 'Star Wars' was (and I saw it first-run in the theaters - it was mind-blowing at the time), it wasn't addressing any issues.  It was escaping them.      So what's that load of hot air got to do with 'Westworld'?  Not much, really, other than I have a fondness for the niche these films occupy in the broader genre of Science-Fiction film, and that a little context could help viewers who might not intuitively appreciate these films for what they are.  And it's obvious that some people do not understand their charm - the recent remakes of [[ASIN:0792838300 Rollerball]], [[ASIN:B0038SUBEG Death Race 2000]], and [[ASIN:B000E6ESEO Planet of the Apes]] tell me that an inherent factor to the success of these types of films lay in the sensibilities of their times, and that modern filmmakers have effectively excised everything about them that made them worth watching in the first place.  These aren't necessarily classic films we're talking about here - enjoyable though, yes - but apparently it's harder to lift them out of their time period and reinterpret them than it may have looked.  Both 'Logan's Run' and 'Westworld' are slated for remakes around 2012 - we'll see if anyone learns anything from these other adaptation failures, but I'm not holding my breath.      So anyway - 'Westworld'.  An amusement park where a handful of guests interact with an accurate recreation of either the old West of the American Frontier, medieval Europe, or ancient Rome - all populated with robots who are nearly indistinguishable from humans.  The operative word here is 'fantasy' - each guest gets to live out his fantasy at whichever 'world' he or she feels will best cater to it.  Most of the film focuses on two guests, Peter (Richard Benjamin), and John (James Brolin) as they kick back in Westworld, indulging in gunfights, bar brawls, and cathouse shenanigans.  Everything to appease the inner child - at least, that is, until things start to go terribly wrong, and the machines who once were the playthings of humans begin to turn the tables.      Concept science-fiction or not, it's doubtful this film succeeds anywhere near as well as it does without Yul Brynner's relentless, unflappable gunslinger, who is positively a wet blanket on our vacationer's picnic.  In fact, without Brynner, I think the film's plot holes are too overpowering to sustain it - they'll still need to be solved, either by suspension of belief or by willful ignorance, but at least the gunslinger helps take your mind off of them.  Purportedly, Brynner's character was a major influence on James Cameron's 'Terminator' film, as well as several other iconic 'unstoppable' movie villians, and I think that's pretty easy to see after watching 'Westworld' again after several years.  Almost everthing else in the film is above average to well done - Brolin and Benjamin are good in their roles, and the script didn't really call for any effects that were beyond the capabilities ofthe time - and if the parameters of the film's logic are accepted, it moves forward in a consistant manner and, I think, to a riveting conclusion.  But the details concerning the operations of the park will likely be a hurdle for a lot of viewers - this is the type of film where, a few hours after watching, if you think too hard about some of the particulars, the structure of the story starts to fall apart.      There are a few other problems - mostly the childish infatuation the guests have for the sexual freedom of the park.  These are robots that they are hopping into bed with, after all.  But that is a product of the time it was made - it's part of what makes these types of films curious artifacts of a sort, and one that evidently gives remake directors fits.  I will say that Michael Chrichton, who wrote and directed 'Westworld', did seem ahead of his time in at least one area, and that by intimating through one of the characters that the problems the park has with its technology is a 'virus'.  I don't know if that terminology was in use in 1973 among computer users, but it seems like a very early use of it to me, if not the first.  Ironically, if I were to imaging myself watching this film back then, I believe I would have thought it was a pretty ridiculous plot device.  Shows what I know.  But taken all together, with its flaws and all, I think of this as one of the better films in its niche, and very enjoyable.      I don't know what sort of priority a film like 'Westworld' has on blu-ray technology - if there is a remake in the next few years I'd imagine that's when we'll see it in blu.  This 2010 release is fairly nice though, upscaled, although defects in the film are still apparent if you look for them.  Aspect ratio is 2.35:1, and the only extras included are the trailer, English/French language options, and subtitles.
B00004W4UB|5.0|This entire movie seems dreamlike to me - with the haunting violin emitting its folk song tune as if it were drifting on the fog that is ever present throughout the film. For me, this beautifully disturbing film is really about Julia Roberts' character working through the pain and abuse her father has caused rather than a true love story, or story about Jekyll/Hyde. Mary Reilly is attracted to both Jekyll and Hyde and continues to do the strange and dangerous errands he asks her to rather than refusing because she is so uncomfortable doing them. The result is exposing a surprising and complicated duality to Mary Reilly as well the obvious one we all know about for Jekyll/Hyde. An additional result is also a positive one - at the end she has experienced true love (and to some extent sympathy, which is perhaps connected to the forgiveness she has for both her father and Jekyll/Hyde) for someone so unworthy of it, and also allowed herself to receive it (love), which is not something she has experienced as an adult woman yet (due to the horrible abuse she suffered at the hands of her father), even though the ending is only happy in that she is able to leave. I love this strong yet completely vulnerable and self-conscious character Roberts has portrayed, and truly feel that this role is one of the most interesting and insightful of any character Roberts has played before. And of course, Malkovich, Glenn Close, George Cole, and Michael Gambon are phenomenal. I also enjoyed seeing Michael Sheen in this role so early in his movie career.
B0030EWB96|5.0|This \\"review\\" is not meant to be an objective perusal of Hiromi's first solo cd release. I am way too big a fan to pull that off. No, I am writing to simply endorse her latest release and first solo effort. A common thread of excellence permeates all of her recorded works and the latest cd is no exception. She plays with such a disciplined and detailed abandon. That almost seems like an oxymoron when one considers most who play with such a high level of discipline and attention to detail cannot add the words \\"free and spirited\\" to their description. Listening to \\"Place to Be\\", I am struck with such a feeling of freedom and perfection wrapped up in the same notes. Hiromi has risen to a higher spiritual plane in her performance which goes beyond the physical. She is able to energize the intellectual while stirring the emotional. I highly recommend this varietal collection of songs played by one of the most innovative voices of our time. Once you've sampled \\"Place to Be\\", the other works in Hiromi's fine discography await you.
B00436GNVC|2.0|I Really thought that she had more substance than this. I am very dissapointed with this CD . Duffy is really not living up to her raise that she had on her first CD . I think that the only song worth listening to is Well, Well, Well and that really isn't much .Sorry for the terrible review but as i stated, very dissapointed .. She had so many great tracks on her first CD ....I even saw her live, when she opened for COLDPLAY . Very talent young lady, nice voice live ......Lets go ADELE !! ROLLING IN THE DEEP .................Now that is what I call a HIT !!!!!!!!!MAKER!@!!!Take the U.S by STORM
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I'm not an expert on Tom Petty.  In high school, i was a huge \\"Full Moon Fever\\" and Traveling Wilburys fan.  However, i got bored with and subsequently lost touch with the man, his band, and their music.  Fast forward twenty one years:  I read  a review of Tom's new album and of the blistering guitar solos by Mike Campbell.  I decided to step out of my stubborn shell of a music fan and grab a copy......then i listened and listened......did a bit more listening... and i can't stop listening.  I feel like this album is Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers first CLASSIC ROCK album.  Please hear me out.  By CLASSIC ROCK, i mean big, hard-driving classic rock.  Granted, there are a half dozen mellow tunes, but even the other slow, bluesy tunes drive deep with masterfully rockin' solos.  It's like the Byrds meet Led Zeppelin and father Tom Petty's MOJO.  The songs wrap around your sinues like vines and make you move--the harmonica knocks on your front door, the keys linger outside your upstairs, bedroom window begging you to join the adventure, and the bass, drums, and guitars already have your momma's permission.  Believe me!  Jump right in for some inspiring, pulse-pumping music.<br /><br />  I don't always listen to tom petty......but when i do(from now on), it's todos mojos.<br /><br />  STAY THIRSTY TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS!!!!!!!<br /><br />  p.s.- from the sounds of it on the tune, \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\", you'll be thirsty quite often with the ol' cotton mouth jonesez.
B002ZG981E|1.0|My husband and I watched this on DVD last night.  I wanted to see it in the theater, because of all the hype, but never got around to it.  I am glad I waited for the DVD.<br /><br />The movie was a mess right from the beginning.  My husband left the couch for a game of WoW 30 minutes into the movie.  I decided to sit and watch the whole thing. You would need a score card to keep track of all that was going on.  The story wasn't a story.  It looked like 3 or 4 differenet scenes from different movies.  Very confusing.<br /><br />Going into someone's dreams didn't seem to be what it was all about...more like Leo's character's obession about trying to find himself.<br /><br />If I were to compare it to another movie that I wasted money on, it would be Hereafter.  Another dismal movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this lemon.
B000O59A2K|5.0|These movies are great classics and hard to find. I bought these as christmas gifts for my father. I highly recomend them to everyone to watch.
B00436GNVC|3.0|Like many others, I loved Duffy's first CD and have been waiting for the follow-up.  And the involvement of Albert Hammond in this project held great promise.  However, as other reviewers have noted \\"Endlessly\\" is a definite fall off from \\"Rockferry.\\"  That is the bad news.  Several of these cuts are terrible and Duffy's voice even becomes annoying on some of them.  However, there are four great cuts on this CD, and that is the good news.  The title song, along with \\"Too Hurt to Dance,\\" \\"Don't Forsake Me,\\" and \\"Breath Away\\" are worthy of \\"Rockferry.\\"  I wish I could get in a time machine and take \\"Too Hurt to Dance\\" back in time and give it to Lesley Gore or Connie Francis to record.  Great song, as are the other three.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|This DVD set comes with three versions of the movie plus extras.  The reason I am suggesting no one else buy it is that all three versions are split between two discs.  No matter which version of the movie you chose to watch you have to change discs in the middle of the movie and then wait for the intro, FBI warning, and menus to be displayed again before you can navigate to the second half of your movie!      I just cannot believe that they would ruin a great film by packaging it that way!  I will be donating my copy to my local library most likely!
B000J4QWMC|4.0|I join the general population of reviewers who gave mixed reviews. This film lacks any sense of humor and is sometimes unclear. Jamie Foxx does an excellent acting job, but Colin Farrell did not seem to always express the correct emotions. The story begins with an undercover job gone bad resulting in a death. Farrell and Foxx insist upon stepping in if their undercover work is not revealed because they suspect that someone in the police agencies is revealing information to the criminals. Farrell makes some rather foolish mistakes, principally falling for one of the outlaws, a rather attractive woman, and displays his emotions, a kiss, in a public area. One of his associates is captured and hurt badly. The woman he is attracted to is also captured. There is lots of drama, shooting, and killing.
B003UYUQZW|3.0|The first half of 2010 was supposed to be full of action blockbusters.  All of them flopped.  Titles such as Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia, and the A-Team all fell by the wayside as two animated flicks, Toy Story 3, and How To Train Your Dragon, dominated the box office until Inception came out in the summer.  This movie, Prince of Persia, was especially disappointing considering the Disney name, and that it was supposed to be the beginning of Disney's next big franchise after POTC.      Well, lets list out what went wrong.  First of, the action scenes were way overblown.  Specifically, the chief protagonist, Prince Dastan, is performing physical feats that would put Jet Li and Jackie Chan blush.  In other words, they were too outlandish to believe.  In fact, this is the first Disney live-action film I know of which features an action hero in the style of Rambo, Bruce Lee, etc.. a normal human being routinely capable of Olympic caliber performances.  Way out of character for a Disney movie.  Second, the movie had an absolutely forgettable soundtrack, which again was a big failing for a Disney movie.  Third, too many characters just looked out of place.  This movie is supposed to be set in Persia, yet all the main characters are played by whites of American or English origin.  Fourth, this movie takes place in Persia, yet it features deserts only seen in North Africa and the Arabian peninsula.  Again, too much of a stretch.  So overall, to fake for my tastes.  The only thing it had going for it was the on-screen chemistry between Prince Dastan and Princess Tamina.

0061120073|5.0|I read this book first at 11 years old. It has been one of my favorite books ever since. The writing and the story are so clear it takes my breath away. You should definitely read this if you haven't already.

B0047DVHV2|5.0|Great read! The standard of writing was surprisingly good. What a character, what a life! Lucky sod. He seems to rate himself as a guitarist but I always thought the band was very average musically - no virtuosos! Their songs were great though, especially Midnight Rambler, Satisfaction and Sympathy for the Devil.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|The second disk to this set is blank and doesn't play so it is really a single disk set being marketing as a two disk set.  Charging too much for a single disk DVD.
B000031EGV|4.0|The movie[[ASIN:B000031EGV Jumanji (Collector's Series)]]is an action packed board game that changes the lives of the children  and gives them a second chance at life.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This is Disney's best return of a masterpiece yet. The colors are more vibrant and characters move smoother than before. The feature allow full freedom to watch the theatrical, uncut, and hand animated movie as well as offer several more nice feature.
6304233639|3.0|Will Smith, Harry Connick, and Jeff Goldblum counter-act the impossibly horrible acting of Judd Hirsch and a few others. Hirsch's \\"Jewish Father\\" portrayal challenges Laurence Olivier's in \\"The Jazz Singer\\": two fine actors going out of their way to make your skin crawl, with cheesy stereotypes. What were the Directors thinking? Anyway...<br /><br />This movie makes me think of Demi Moore's \\"Striptease\\": coulda/shoulda/woulda...go for the biggest possible gate and later for the reputations of the performers. You get the feeling a \\"Airplane!-type follow-up is just around the corner...in fact,  the parody *feel* is quite prevalent, with the Wagnerian orchestration adding fuel to the fire(s).<br /><br />There *are* some very entertaining scenes, however: Will Smith ejects from his fighter plane and runs towards a downed UFO - he punches out the alien inside, then lights up a stogie - \\"Now that's a close encounter!\\". Another fun sequence is at \\"Area 51\\", where the President encounters a humanoid still hanging out after about 45 years; and a scientist who's equally...spaced out. These serio-comic expositions really work; loaded with timely symbolism.<br /><br />If you're gonna get hung up on how a craft 15 miles long can stay in the air a thousand feet up or have its' computer system hacked, well, see if your local library has that Michael Rennie flick. A much better choice.<br /><br />Yet, this totally off-kilter movie does say something about the American Spirit: recalling The Alamo and the first American attack on Japan, shortly after Pearl Harbor. We're gonna fight!!
160094048X|5.0|Really. I bought this book just for the B&W cookie recipe. I haven't found a really good one since I left NYC and thought I'd never have one again now that I'm newly vegan.<br /><br />Now, just to be fair - I'm a really, really crappy baker. However, the recipe was great and I was thrilled with the results. I still want to know how to get vanilla icing to be white, like in the picture, mine always comes out..kinda maple colored. But the taste is great. The chocolate chip cookies were a big hit at a recent gathering.<br /><br />My only request would be that subsequent books have altitude modifications on them. Living at 7K' presents challenges to an already baking-challenged cook~<br /><br />HIGH ALTITUDE UPDATE (7,000):Reduce both leavenings by 1/4 tsp and reduce sugar by 1/4 cup - Perfection!
B0013G3RA0|5.0|Kids, parents and grandparents love this touching story of a young race car, full of himself, who learns about life and how to respect and relate to those around him.  The story is set on Route 66 through Arizona, and the scenery and locale are exciting as they trace the demise and restoration of the \\"Mother Road\\" through some of the most spectacular scenery in the West.
B004FTSAZO|3.0|Sorry, this series is a guilty pleasure for me, but it really really bothers me that \\"wolfsbane\\" is shown to be a yellow plant with small, pollen-like flowers that attach closely to the stem and that isn't toxic to humans.<br /><br />\\"Wolfsbane\\" is a real plant, also known as aconite or monkshood. It's cultivated in many gardens for it's hardy nature and pretty flowers... The most common variety is purple. It's also HIGHLY toxic to humans, although someone who's very well trained can extract the poison to use it safely in medicines. But even they have to be careful because pure aconite extracted from the plant is poisonous enough that if it gets into a small cut on your skin it can be fatal. DON'T try giving someone wolfsbane at home, kids! Not even as a joke. There is a very real possibility that it will kill them.<br /><br />Even if I didn't already personally know that, I could have found it out very quickly by looking at Wikipedia. So it's not \\"a hard to track down herb.\\" Even in the rare, yellow varieties the flowers are shaped very differently than that, and giving a human aconite to check to see if they're actually a werewolf is like dunking a witch into a frozen pond to see if she's a witch. Even if they aren't, they're likely to die. Please do some research, writers and prop people. This is common knowledge to anyone who's a werewolf, paranormal geek, and also to people who garden. Little details like that can serious help with suspension of disbelief.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is about dreams - many levels of dreams which are so disjointed they are a nightmare to watch. Do NOT waste your time or money on this.
0307408833|2.0|Let me begin by saying it took me a lot time to realize that the reason the recipes tasted so awfully bitter and strange was because of the Bob's Red Mill flour combination the author calls for. Apparently there are some people who have a really strong aversion to the bean flours used in the mix, and I am very much one of them. I mixed up my own gf flour blend without the bean flours and I was really excited to trying the banana bread recipe without the bad aftertaste. I have tried and tried several of these recipes (chocolate chip cookies, frostings, and cupcakes--mostly because some of these are gluten free, unlike several other recipes) with really bad results. Besides the bad aftertaste and oily consistency, there was the problem of the baking times being off. That is what happened with my last attempt, the banana bread. I was so happy at the look of the bread loaf when it came out of the oven (after baking it 15 minutes longer than the said 35 minutes the recipe claims) and broke off a little piece to see if there was that awful bitter taste, and there wasn't! After it cooled, however, the center was completely raw. After looking on the website and seeing that the author says to fill the bread tins half-way, I am seriously frustrated at the fact that she did not think to include that tip IN THE RECIPE. It would have saved my bread and the costly ingredients I just wasted. Again. I gave the author, this cookbook, and these recipes the benefit of the doubt for several months, even after reading the negative reviews, but now my patience is worn out. Test your recipes with the EXACT ingredients the home baker would use, EXACTLY the way the recipes are written, and INCLUDE the essential tips that will result in a successful product.
B00000331V|5.0|One of the best live bands ever and this is their best live album. It just doesn't get any better than this. I had the album way back in the 70's (It was a double album), and wore it out. The sound quality of the cd is true to the analog sound of the album and Peter Wolf and the band's unstoppable energy comes blasting through live, loud and clear. It'll blow your face out.
B0032JTV38|5.0|I have never heard of this show and got it from Netflix. After my wife & I watched the first Disc, we bought it.   Remember when you watched a really really really good show from HBO or similar TV channel, & before you knew it the hour was up? This show does this. It makes you think about it the next day & discuss it with your wife. When a show does this, it is a 5 star show.   Life was not pretty back then, or even 100 years ago. This show shows it all. THIS IS A REFRESHING ADULT ONLY SHOW.
0525423273|5.0|I am literally in LOVE with this book! I didn't think that I would like it, considering it is a \\"teen\\" book, but I love Twilight and that is considered a teen book.  I was in Barnes & Nobles the other day & I saw this.  The Eiffel Tower kinda popped out considering I am obsessed with the French culture so I try to read a lot of Paris romance novels.  The way that she describes every single detail in Paris was soo amazing I thought I was literally right there watching Anna do her everyday things.  And St. Clair. Oh man!<br />Give this book a try.  I promise you will actually love it.  I didn't notice before, but the author is actually living in Western North Carolina and that's where I live! Love love love it! Def. a book I will recommend to anyone. I couldn't put this book down. And it snowed when I got it (It was an early Christmas present) and it just set the mood just right to be cuddled under my blanket and with a cup of hot chocolate

B000E5N6LG|5.0|In 1994, \\"Wyatt Earp\\" was released; eventually becoming a DVD movie that tells a possibility about key parts involving a family of brothers who stood in the face of angry evil.  Kevin Costner fans will enjoy seeing him in the role of Wyatt, as Dennis Quaid portrays Doc Holliday, who joins forces with Gene Hackman as the patriarch Nicholas Earp, David Andrews as James Earp, Linden Ashby as Morgan Earp, and Michael Madsen as Virgil Earp - a combined force to be reckoned with.  Jeff Fahey portrays Ike Clanton, joined by Adam Baldwin as Tom McLaury; who merge their band of outlaws and can't seem to be slowed down - let alone stopped, until they clash with the Earp brothers in Tombstone AZ.<br />This story has heart, and gives a realistic sense of strong willed women (like they would have to be to be associated with the Earp brothers), who resist the stone-willed Wyatt's leadership of the Earp brothers.  Catherine O'Hara as Allie Earp (you will recognize her as the mom in the first two \\"Home Alone\\" films, the loopy designer mom in \\"Beetle Juice,\\" and several other past roles); JoBeth Williams as Bessie Earp (better known from the first two \\"Poltergeist\\" films in her role as Diane Freeling, also appearing in Frasier as the attractive woman named Madeline Marshall who goes with Frasier to Bora Bora for a hot time in a suite unknowingly next to his ex, several Hallmark TV movies, and several TV series); Betty Buckley as Virginia Earp (also an accomplished actress with many TV series to her credit, and a movie or two); and then there's Mare Winningham who portrays Mattie Blaylock a saloon vamp lover of Wyatt's who is hoping to become his wife, but is replaced by a younger woman love interest - Joanna Going in the role of Josie Marcus (you'll recognize Mare Winningham from the 2009 film \\"Brothers\\" as Elsie Cahill, and Grey's Anatomy as Susan Grey, along with many other TV series roles; and Joanna Going from the 1991 remake of \\"Dark Shadows\\" as Victoria Winters and other TV series roles).<br />Isabella Rossellini plays the role of Big Nose Kate, the consort of Doc Holliday; and Annabeth Gish as Unilla Sutherland, the poignant element of Wyatt's early life - his wife who dies of a respiratory disease after which Wyatt goes off the deep end for a while.<br />Have I made my point yet?  Okay let's keep going.<br />Tom Sizemore is in the role of Bat Masterson, Mark Harmon portrays Sheriff Johnny Behan, and Bill Pullman portrays Ed Masterson.<br />This is a stellar cast including Gabriel Folse as Billy Clanton and Kris Kamm as Billy Claiborne, with great scenery, easily believable costumes, and every actor / actress giving their respective role a pristine performance to make this movie unforgettable.  Of all the portrayals, perhaps the clear stand out is Dennis Quaid who somehow even looks emaciated enough (as a tuberculosis victim) to convince any theater goer that the role was custom made for him (he lost 30 lbs for his role in this film).  Most reviewers like Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday in \\"Wyatt Earp\\" better than Val Kilmer's in \\"Tombstone.\\"  It helps if you like Kevin Costner, who is the headliner for \\"Wyatt Earp\\" (go figure), and he delivers his typical performance with aplomb.<br />Primarily focusing upon Dodge City and Tombstone, this film gives us a feeling of law and order not being all that easy to come by; except for stalwart men who were willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of justice.  In case you can't tell yet, I enjoyed this DVD movie, and am quite happy I bought it.  \\"Wyatt Earp\\" is a 63 million dollar epic western filmed in South Dakota, USA, that will make you glad you spent 3 hours and 11 minutes to watch.

B0041CGOZS|4.0|I love the CD.  However, I wish it had stated more clearly that this was the one disc version, because I would have rather purchased the 2 disc set.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|There is nothing to dislike about this edition (not on Blu-ray anyways.) Contrary to some of the other reviews I've seen, there is no problem with the packaging. It's different than what you're used to, but isn't an issue to anyone with fully functional hands and digits.  If you like the movie, and wish to delve a little deeper with the plethora of informative extra content, buy this set.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|As others have said in their reviews, the 5th series never matched the brilliance of the previous 4 seasons... not in the acting nor in the writing.  I was willing to give Smith lots of room to make the Doctor his own, (especially after the stellar work of Eccleston and Tennant), but he just is not convincing.  He is far too immature to pull it off, as is Gillian.  But the biggest let-down was the writing... almost nothing original, and nothing of any substance... as immature as the actors.  The one exception was the Vincent van Gogh story, which I thought was well done and up to the standards of the previous seasons.  Even the TARDIS is a let-down... looking like a cheap circus.  Sigh... I tried to like it (since I'm a big fan), but I just couldn't.  I really hope the next season is better, and maybe Smith will grow into the Doctor's shoes and find some of the Doctor's wisdom.  My real rating is 2 1/2 stars, but I'll bump it to 3 because I liked the previous seasons so much.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I so enjoyed Jim Carrey in Disney's \\"Christmas Carol\\". I had been wanting to see it since it was released and finally bought it through Amazon. The story was very close to the book by Charles Dickens. I was amazed at the amount of big named actors in the movie also. Disney \\"did it\\" again.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|I purchased the Double CD with great anticipation.  I expected these old treasures from Bruce to be produced in their purest form.  Stripped down like his earlier albums were.  However, as pointed out by Bruce in his liner notes, he added \\"Rich Arrangements\\" to the songs.  My question is \\"WHY\\"????  There is not even a hint of the stark atmosphere that is present on Darkness. There are maybe 3 or 4 songs from this collection, that make me want to listen to them again, and say \\"Man, that is a GREAT song\\".  2 chestnuts, \\"Fire\\" and \\"Because The Night\\" are very lackluster.  There is nothing there.  No feeling, no emotion.  Just richly produced songs that are listenable, but not memorable. I've seen this trend from Springsteen in the last few CD's he's put out, and his music is just not very appealing anymore.  Seems like he just mails it in now.  Not the BOSS that I grew up with.
B000ZOSMTW|1.0|I was really looking forward to getting this DVD,but all it is,is a poor copy of the Two Against Nature DVD,the picture and sound quality is quite poor,it was so bad I gave my copy away as I had purchased Two Against Nature at the same time.I hope this help's somebody not to get ripped off.
0060899220|5.0|I listened to this an audio book which i highly recommend if you have a long commute. This book was brutally honest and entertaining. While I didn't know what more than a few dishes he was talking about were, I was still engaged and wanted to hear more.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is a really good series, well done and true to history. In the style of Band of Brothers, it tells a story about real soldiers...Marines....and what it was like to be in the Pacific theatre during World War II.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Innovative, great plot, awesome animation; Best movie so far of Toy Story series and of Pixar.  It was shipped on time and excellent shape.
B00498YZH8|3.0|As one reviewer put it, this movie does offer \\"a glimpse into a rarely-seen world.\\"  Problem is the glimpse feels kind of voyeuristic--as if the movie was more an anthropological study of these weird looking hillbillies, with (overly) quaint ways of talking, and different ideas of hygiene than us coddled, movie-going city folk.    I found many parts of the plot just didn't fit together either--people switch from violent hostility to being helpful in the blink of an eye (I had the sense the director read reports on the Ozarks that said sudden outbreaks of physical violence are part of the culture, so he thought he needed to throw it in there).    Final criticism is that every character is sort of a type--e.g., don't hold your breathe waiting for the main character to show any real character flaws.  She's pure, mountain-folk resilience, and that note gets struck over and over.    All that being said, the movie does look beautiful, and does a great job of creating a unique atmosphere throughout.  I just felt cheated, and a little guilty, at the end.
0307408833|1.0|The chocolate chip cookie recipe is the only good one in the book and even those are greasy if they reach room temperature because of the coconut oil used in the recipe. I had high hopes for this book, and I wasted my money.  I finally found soy milk powder (made by NOW, but is being discontinued) and after being excited to have all of the ingredients for the frosting I was really let down.  I use coconut oil for many things, but frosting with coconut oil?  I knew it would be grainy when cold because it's solid when it's cold!  I wasted a lot of time tracking down these ingredients and a lot of money as well.  Save yourself the trouble.  This book is not worth it. Try this one instead:  [[ASIN:0470448466 Allergy-Free Desserts: Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Egg-free,Soy-free and Nut-free Delights]]
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Annie Lennox -- a genuinely, truly, uniquely, one-of-a-kind artist.  Any new release by Annie Lennox is eagerly anticipated by Planet Earth.  When I heard about Annie's Christmas CD, I lit up like Christmas tree myself and ordered it right away.  When the CD arrived, I marveled at the CD's booklet enclosure -- a remarkable piece of art by itself that encumbers Christmas and its many elements.  Even Bible Scriptures are noted.  The CD packaging is truly award-winning.    To the music, shall we?  I must remember as I listen that Annie is who she is.  The selections are marvelous -- some very recognizable, and some that only Christmas music aficionados would know.  The perfect blend of known and not-so-known.  (Everyone needs to learn a new Christmas carol every-now-and then!)    My only tiniest bit of displeasure with the album is that the entire feel and attitude of the recording is... well... melancholy and somber.  Annie's voice is front-and-center -- as always -- though I'm wondering if it was Annie's specific and direct intention to stay away from the transient, secular, wrapped-up with a nice bow feeling heard in virtually most Christmas albums.  I take this cue from her song on the CD which she wrote entitled, \\"Universal Child.\\"  It's not a pretty world, but the message of Christmas does provide hope and the positive outlook that the world can be a much better place.  Quite frankly, I do not disagree with her not one bit.  As Annie notes in her video on this web page, she embraces the 'human' in us.   We, as humans, have great needs around this planet.  Let's care for each other much better, shall we?    My greatest pleasure in this album is to see the refreshing usage of 'Jesus Christ' in so many of the CD's selections as the Hope and Savior of this world and of us all.  Annie, whether you meant it or not, thank you for bravely and honestly not changing the lyrics.  Bravo!    To conclude:  \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\" is my favorite brand-new Christmas CD this Christmas season.  Merry Christmas to all, and may God bless you, the reader, in 2011!
1401324029|3.0|Reading this is like watching one of the episodes, a very long episode. It was funny and cute, mixed with murder and deceit. Nikki and Jameson have great chemistry, much like Castle and Beckett. The book ties in with what Castle does on the show. Roach is the best.  Nothing was naked in this book, it was just a clever title.    I hope the writers are having fun with the TV series and the books. I would love to watch more seasons and read more books.    [...]
1449389627|5.0|As a kid I remember feeling uninspired because there were genius' out there, and I wasn't one of them.<br /><br />*How can I ever amount to anything when competing with such people?*<br /><br />Although there are people with amazing mental abilities, most of the people I now consider a genius have no special mental ability, just determination and hard work which enabled their breakthroughs.<br /><br />I wanted to read this book because I spend a significant amount of time learning and doing work, and I figured this book would inspire me to stay along the same path. This book did indeed do what I wanted it to do, but the book covered a lot more as well.<br /><br />We tend to attribute innovation to a moment's insight or a lucky accident, but the true story behind innovation is much more exciting than the false stories we believe. There is no magic element which allowed past innovations to happen, simply hard work. Hard work which is based upon, and combined with existing hard work. Everyone that does hard work makes mistakes, encounters obstacles, and has failures. The people who succeed are the people that embrace these mistakes and take the opportunity to learn from them.<br /><br />This book inspires the reader to not only passively consume information and knowledge, but to be a creator instead.<br />This book also covers many other topics surrounding ideas and innovations including reasons why ideas fail and succeed. An idea needs to be able to fit its surrounding environment for it to succeed, and as an innovator we need to frame the correct problems to solve before trying to solve them.<br /><br />The author (Scott Berkun) does an excellent job of not blindly giving his opinion, but backing up his claims with sources and situations throughout history.
B000SW16LC|1.0|Some classics should not be re-done.  This version added nothing but color.  Without the actors who we grew up seeing and appreciating, it is a poor attempt to make money off a sweet story.
B0044WUQ3G|1.0|I've seen some bad movies before, but this one has got to be the worst! I know it's a movie and you're supposed to set aside all logical thinking, but c'mon, at least make it a tiny bit believable!! Some parts are soooo incredibly ridiculous!! wow, it was really bad!!!!!!

B0036TGSIK|5.0|Easy A raises the bar for comedy.  The humour count per minute is incredibly high for a movie which actually has a plot.  The only minute which does not have a joke is the last one, when the movie is being wrapped up before the novel presentation of the end credits.<br /><br />Notable features are:<br /><br />1.  There are no time-wasting romantic interludes.<br /><br />2.  No cheesy bits anywhere in the movie.<br /><br />3.  No cliches.<br /><br />4.  No apology made for politically incorrect humour.<br /><br />5.  No physical comedy.  The witty script does not depend on physical comedy to get laughs.  Body language from good acting enhances the comedic ambience.  The part where Emma Stone punches her pretend-sex partner in the belly - I really did not see that one coming.<br /><br />6.  Excellent subtitles, which occasionally moves unobstrusively to other parts of the screen.  I need the subtitles because there are a number of difficult SAT words which could easily have been misspelt.<br /><br />7.  An excellent soundtrack.  Many songs are by the original singers, like Natasha Bedingfield.<br /><br />8.  No crude or foul language.  No sexual inuendos.  No nudity.  No references to current events.  However, I had to google Urban Dictionary to find the meaning of \\"butter bean\\" and \\"lemon squeeze\\".<br /><br />9.  A real, believable setting in an actual Californian town Ojai (\\"oh-high\\") in Ventura.  No super-rich, no mansions, no ostentatious displays of wealth, no playing up of class distinction: which underscores the theme of being ostracized by peers.  These are normal guys, if you can suspend disbelief that a cast of so many big name stars can come from a town (actually the smallest city in California) of just 8,000.<br /><br />Good comedy is hard to find, especially when it comes in a continuous stream.  I was thoroughly entertained.
B003X9W98G|4.0|Sci-fi is my genre of choice and I love British Telly. However, I have to say...I never liked Doctor Who. I tried to watch the seasons with David Tennant, but I found the stories to be a little ridiculous and cheesy. I liked Tennant very much, but I could not get into the show. I love the series \\"Sherlock,\\" and when I heard that the writers from that show did the recent season of Doctor Who, I decided to give it a go. I was drawn in from the first episode. I absolutely LOVE Matt Smith. His Doctor is sooo much fun and energetic. I love Amy Pond as the Companion, she reminded me of Donna (strong willed, resourceful, ginger haired). I did not care for Rory at first, but his character grew on me and by the end of the season, I was happy with his return. The stories are great, especially the Weeping Angels (actually scared me). I thought the season finale was fantastic. I loved how it tied in all the loose ends by sealing the cracks in time. Now, I am officially a Doctor Who fan and I am looking forward to the Christmas episode.

All tied together by the breathtakingly<br />lyrical description of the tightrope walker, Philippe Petit's  journey from<br />one tower to the other.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|The same songs over and over; trying to decide if the gift you are buying will please or ruin someone's holiday; gorging on hot apple cider, cheese ball, and cookies;  wondering whether to say Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays so as not to offend (thanks to the whacked out \\"christian\\" jerks) - Christmas can start to \\"get to\\" you.  It can become a season in hell and if you feel like you need to drive a wooden stake thru the heart of Christmas then watch this DVD. It's twisted abuse of Christmas will put you right back in the Merry so you can survive the season.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I read a previous review from someone that said these were a piece of junk because theirs broke after a few uses. I just thought that they handled them roughly. I've had mine for a few weeks and from the beginning they hurt my ears. I just thought and it may still be the case that I have poorly designed ears. My major complaint is that these headphones should be handled like glass. I seriously just picked them up and placed them on my head and the swivel happened to be positioned wrong and the piece that sets on the left ear just broke in half. There is just the smallest piece of plastic that connects the piece that broke off. I thought for the price that they would last a lot longer. I think they have great sound and many good features. It is too bad that they couldn't put as much effort in the design and maybe used better materials at the most used pressure points.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I really like this series. I think that the producers were right in creatinf The Pacific. It gives a perspective of the war from the other coast of the US. It's nice to see how the Marines fought in their amphobious style of warfare. Also, it shows how battles were fought with different strategy compared to the European war. This gives a prime example of what jungle warfare in the pacific was like. It was also nice to see how it followed only a few marines rather than a whole company.
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|This movie is simply amazing. I love it.    Another Night's classic story telling.

This movie is addictive as the sixth sense.

This book sums up, very simply, the essence of Taoist thought (or, no-thought as it were) and does it in a most entertaining way, through the eyes of the the Master taoist, Winnie the Pooh. This is a book that you can also read to your kids, who will probably \\"get\\" the ideas put forward here very easily. Highly recommended!
B003EYVXSW|4.0|\\"Splice\\"  (Warner, 2010)  -----------------------------  This is a genuinely creepy, intentionally low-rent horror/sci-fi story involving genetic engineering and a hefty dose of dark humor and morbid camp. Like Larry Cohen's \\"It's Alive\\" (which is referenced early in the film), \\"Splice\\" parodies the conventions of child-rearing and parenthood, as two morally tonedeaf scientists create a new human hybrid and proceed to bicker endlessly about how to raise it. Meanwhile, their new \\"daughter\\" evolves and adapts rapidly - and starts to develop a taste for blood.  Meanwhile, of course, there's an evil corporation to contend with, and an inevitable experiment-on-the-run scenario... It's the \\"Mommy Dearest\\"-meets-\\"Kramer-vs-Kramer\\" bad-parenting psychological schtick that's the heart of this movie, and of its over-the-top humor. If you aren't into old-school so-bad-its-good, midnight movie camp-horror, this flick won't appeal to you... But I suspect there are more than a few viewers out there that will consider this a classic. (Axton)

B004DK5CYM|4.0|\\"Secretariat\\"  (Walt Disney, 2010)  -----------------------------  An enjoyable film about an epic horse, made as a true throwback to the corny, bio-pic storytelling of the 1940s and '50s. First off, I appreciated that this film was family-friendly enough that I could take my young child to see it: there aren't many in-theater movies these days that are suitable for young children, or worth the use of their braincells, but this was a good choice. The story of Secretariat, a remarkable horse who won the 1973 Triple Crown, is also the story of owner, Mrs. Penny Tweedy, who was a \\"simple housewife\\" who also happened to be a millionaire heiress (back in the '70s, when a million dollars still meant something!) Although the horse, physically speaking, was not an underdog, Ms. Tweedy was -- a woman competing in the boy's club confines of professional horse racing. The film's script pounds this home, touting her as a feminist standard-bearer during the heady era of the Vietnam War. The war is also touched on, lightly, as Ms. Tweedy's teenage daughter becomes politically active in the antiwar movement (painting flower-covered signs in rooms full of earnest extras who look like a retro-oriented episode of \\"Glee\\") but the hippie stuff is just period-piece background color, peripheral to the real story, which is a standard-issue sports triumph tale.    Intriguingly, the horse racing itself is minimized -- the training sequences are short, and most of what we learn about Secretariat's prowess comes from exposition, while the races themselves fly by all too quickly and are full of distractions, just like in real life. Indeed, the filmmakers show the second of the three big races, the Preakness, from the vantage point of Ms. Tweedy's distant family, watching it at home on a grainy, smeared-image '70s-era TV (an interesting narrative choice, and also one of the most effecting evocations of the era in the entire film.) What horse-racing we do see is absolutely thrilling, exhilarating, shot more or less from the horse's POV, with pummeling sound design full of thunderous hoofbeats and snorting breath. My heart was in my hands during each of the races, and any horse lover will enjoy these sequences. Also impressive are the '70s couture outfits worn by Ms. Tweedy (primly played by Diane Hall); although the period costuming and other recreation of the hippie era had some emotionally inauthentic moments, it was still a fun flick. Even John Malkovitch, who I frequently find unbearably pretentious, was relatively restrained here, and managed not to pull me out of the film too much. In short, this is a nice, uncomplicated feel-good sports/horse film, certainly worth seeing if you're looking for something in that department. (Axton)
B00338QENI|5.0|I whole-heartedly agree with all the reviews about the amazing story of Henrietta Lacks and Skloot's thorough research and balanced storytelling.  I will add that while the story is one of the most intriguing tales I have ever read (fiction and non-fiction), I was disappointed with the author's style and at times found her writing cumbersome and distracting.  I wanted to share just so future readers won't be surprised if they come to the same conclusion...regardless, I highly recommend.
0679882820|5.0|This is my son's favorite book!  He is 10 months right now.  We have been reading this book for about 3 months.  He loves all of the animal noises.

B002VPE1YS|5.0|I bought the HTC EVO and was looking for cases for me and my bf. Was not happy with what I ordered for my bf so I continued to look for more cases and I came across this bag. It looked pretty cool and the reviews are awesome so I bought two, one for me and one for my bf. I really love this bag. I didn't buy me an armor suit for my phone, just a plastic durable case on Amazon, for like $5-$10, and I keep my phone in the bag at all times. Whenever I'm done using the phone, in it goes in to the bag. It slips in to my purse easily. I am definitely going to buy more bags, probably one for my camera. My portable hard drive fits in too perfectly. I highly recommend this bag to anyone who wants something to put there electronics in. THe bag gives protection because it's padded. I love it!! I think I paid around $6-7 with super saver shipping.
0399230033|3.0|There are barely any words in this book.  It's mostly pictures.  I'll give you a breakdown:    32 pages (23 of them have no words)     47 words total (all but 4 are either \\"good\\", \\"night\\", or an animal name.  The other 4 words are \\"dear\\" (twice), \\"zoo\\", and \\"zzzz\\".    When I buy a book to READ to my son, I expect more than pictures.  The pictures are nice, but from the high ratings I was expecting a lot more.  It may be better for older children who can talk to their parents about the pictures (my son is 10 months).  I like amazon prices, but I will be checking out books in person before ordering from now on.
0385523912|5.0|I love how from the very beginning, Demick sets the tone for this book: \\"Whether in CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, or int he East Asian studies department of a university, people usually analyze North Korea from afar. THey don't stop to think that in the middle of this black hole, in this bleak, dark country where millions have died of starvation, there is also love.\\"    This isn't just a political/sociological account of North Korea that cites statistics and keeps readers as a distance. Instead, it offers an oral history and personal account of the lives of six North Korean defectors. It's the details in this book that shock you and break your heart. Starving children singing, \\"We have nothing to envy in this world\\" - and believing it with all their heart. 8-year olds with walnut-sized hands. Some of the examples of propaganda are so ridiculous, it's hard not to be a little incredulous, but for people who have grown up under the regime their entire lives, they really have no reason to question the information they're being fed.    It was interesting to see the different \\"breaking points\\" for each of the characters, the point where, as Demick puts it, \\"they realize their government has betrayed them.\\" For one woman, it is not until she has crossed the border into China and sees a pet dog eating a bowl of white rice (rice is a luxury in North Korea), confirming that even dogs eat better than North Koreans.     I did not have much knowledge of North Korea prior to this book, and Demick does a wonderful job of interspersing personal accounts with the historical/background knowledge. Yet even when she is describing the extremely tragic conditions, she never does it in a way that is condescending or lacks compassion. She doesn't distance herself from her interviewees. This was key for me, because I know how easy it is for writers of non-fiction to approach subjects in a purely academic way.

B00436GNVC|2.0|Such a strong Rockferry led to such a weak Endlessly. Her vibrato is bizarre, her stylings are all over the place. Yes, the lyrics at times are cring-inducingly trite. Amazing that after nearly three years, this is the best she came up with - imagine what songs didn't make this album!
B003XKB0RG|4.0|The theme of Earth, Wind and Fire always seemed to reflect the 70's social ideology of love, peace, and brotherhood. At the peak of their popularity, EWF was able to capture the hearts and imagination of millions of music fans who yearned for togetherness and peace with their fellow man and woman.  EWF quite simply were musical prophets for a liberated generation who looked to bring down social barriers and integrate people of all walks of life into one.  At the dawn of 80's, a new generation was rising with its own set of views and customs that was aimed towards self prosperity, glamour, and monetary gain at the expense of dividing people and alienating others. So when Faces dropped in 1980, Bands who were a symbol of peace and unity like EWF were beginning to look out of place in what will become the decade of individualism.      That fate is unfortunate considering that Faces is in many ways vintage EWF-though it doesn't contain any established classics. Outside of the sense of mystery that this album carries in their catalog, Faces is intriguing because the overall tone finds Maurice White and Co. trying to come to grips with the then new social reality while stubbornly maintaining their ideology. Their feelings are made very transparent on the opening track \\"Let Me Talk\\" where Maurice White enter the 80's aware as well as defensive with references to inflation, business practices , and superficial women who finds gratification in image rather than character.   \\"Turn into Something Good\\", \\"Pride\\", and \\"Take It to the Sky\\" aims to inject the self determination, confidence, and the belief of one's ability to succeed in an era where hope seemed to be lost for many.      Of course there are the ballads and other songs removed from its socially aware stance.  As far as the music goes, some may argue that some of the elements sounded a tad dated, but in actuality, EWF does bring their classic 70's sound to date with the then happening production qualities- if only slightly.  Notice how the keyboards on \\"Pride\\" and \\"Win or Lose\\" are in the front of the mix almost drowning out the bass to give it a stripped down synth funk feel.  On the gorgeous ballad \\"You\\", EWF take the same structure of After the Love is Gone and give it a more pronounced pop/ easy listening feel than its sister song. The sleek execution kind of predated  much of the slick yuppie ballad soul that will practiced by a lot of urban contemporary artists in the decade, but in EWF hands it's so uplifting that the slick sheen helps the song more so than hinder it. On \\"You Went Away\\", Phil Bailey and the band goes into Power Ballad territory where its bombastic chorus incite listeners to raise their hands in wave them back and forth and sing along  in the same way that Foreigner when they hit that power chord and  invitingly plead \\" I wanna Know what Love is... I want you to show me\\".  \\"And love Goes On\\" foreshadows a lot of the up-tempo perky dance songs of that decade- but without the soul and funk EWF possess here. The way they pick up the pitch at the end will immediately bring to mind Whitney Houston's \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\\". \\"Sailaway\\" also standout for its smooth wavy groove where you feel like you just retreated to an exotic island with the one you love to escape your troubles. The only time where I feel like the experiment is a bit off the mark is \\"Back on the Road\\" where its pop rock feel is well intended but sounds underwhelming compared to the other songs- though the power guitar riff at the beginning will probably incite a smirk on Eddie Van Halen's face and the lead guitar solo at the end is also worth a listen.     Faces is consistently strong from start to finish- especially for a double album.  A lot of artists who record two albums worth of original material tend to overreach as they try to take on too many styles that's radically different from their core sound. Rather than EWF trying to adapt to different styles, they let the different stylesadapt to their core sound on Faces.  Even though they bring in different textures here and there throughout the course of the record, their patented sound over powers the experimental touches.  The fact that most of these songs- with the exception of the title track- are three to five minutes long, make them easier to digest as a whole.    Faces was to Earth Wind & Fire in 1980 what Muse-Sick N- Hour-Message was to Public Enemy 1994. The albums find both groups adjusting to new realities in society while shrewdly sticking to their principles. Faces nonetheless is a fascinating EWF album its own right. The fact the most of these themes still hold weight in today's volatile American landscape makes this album sound even more relevant. While some may be put off by the disco/pop touches on the album, others who love funk, soul, and disco in equal measure will grow to appreciate this.  While the world and music was changing drastically in 1980, EWF was still able show why they were Shining Stars.

I was really sorry when it was over.  I do not want to spoil the book for those who haven't read it, but suffice to say if you like the Camel Club you will not want to miss this one! Hope the next one is not far behind.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|When I saw this sequel in the theatre I was disappointed. I felt the second movie lacked the charm and simple entertainment of the first movie. When the second movie was in the theatre we saw it once as a family, then my son and I saw it again. We saw the first movie a 3rd time at the drive-in. When the video came out for the first movie we purchased it on opening day of release and we have watched it countless times since then. However one viewing in the theatre of this movie was enough for me and as well our son. Still, we tend to get the video releases of movies of this type when they come available but we kind of put this on the back-burner. When this went on-sale as a blu-ray release we picked it up for Christmas in October but I couldn't wait to watch it so we opened it up and watched it at home. It was much better the second time and we have watched it several times since.
B004498KPU|4.0|only reason i wouldnt buy this is its not fully complete. its suppose to be his full uncut short films and yet its missing Captain Eo and the mini movie he did with Stan Winston to promote blood on the dancefloor GHOST. not the music video listed the 35 minute short film which is amazing! other than that, its pretty much complete and if it had both of those on there, id buy it in a heart beat. so 4 out of 5 stars.
B00475BUVM|3.0|I will not provide a review of the movie as there are plenty of movie critics out there. I will however, concentrate on the in-home 3D aspect of this movie. As many already know, this movie was not originaly made for 3D, and that is where it suffers - While there is some good depth of field, and little ghosting, the image never pops out and pushes the image into the viewers room.
B00061RZXI|5.0|I love this story but got robbed by a poorly displayed \\"region 2\\" notation.

B00447G29S|2.0|I will not provide a review of the movie as there are plenty of movie critics out there. I will however, concentrate on the in-home 3D aspect of this movie. Of all the new Blu-ray 3D movies I have, this is the worst and most disappointing - especially after seeing what was possible with this movie in the IMAX. as with the anaglyph 3D version of this movie, the image on this Blu-ray 3D ghosts terribly which absolutely ruins the entire movie. The only advantage over the analglyph version was an obvious improvement in the picture color. If I could turn back the clock, I would avoid this purchase until the company releases a clean version.
B003EV6DBM|1.0|I have been a devout fan of the new Dr. Who series and I have been looking forward to this installment ever since I finished watching all of the David Tenant episodes. But this whole series story line lacks so much in so many ways. Everything is really obvious with no under story. A crack! A crack everywhere! Ugh! And both Amy and the new Dr. Who are exceptionally uninteresting. The stories are also without any humor or depth. And, one of the best previous Dr. Who stories in my opinion was \\"Blink\\" so you would think that the same guy could again write a compelling story, but no! A most disappointing purchase. Wait for a new Dr. Who to come out - not a new series, but a completely new person with a completely different companion!
1439181780|4.0|this book is worth reading, even if you don't read as much. if your thinking of reading a book, this is a book worth owning
B004856SQ8|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It's basically along the same line as Mission Impossible, but it acknowledges and embraces its ridiculousness.  Granted the last 15 minutes are the worst 15 minutes of the film, but the first hour and a half is pure gold.  The South African actor who plays Murdock and was in District 9 is funny and Liam Neeson has his best performance since Taken, and of course by performance I mean punching people in the face.
B003NFM3JK|2.0|As an English teacher who's taught the novel for over ten years, I'm very familiar with the story Dickens crafted.  He is a master of the English language, and of story telling.  While Disney studios know how to do animation, they and Robert Zemeckis fell short on this adaptation.    ORIGINAL STORY: It is important to know that when Dickens wrote his novel, few people celebrated Christmas; in fact, the holiday was more or less ignored by most of the world.  The Industrial Revolution was in full swing in England, and a large portion of the population was extremely poor.  Those that weren't tended to be business owners, who were rather selfish and greedy, and treated their workers poorly.  Dickens' intent in writing the story was to use this well-known but little-celebrated holiday as a touch-point for his Unitarian beliefs (which basically suggested that all people should unite [thus, \\"Unitarians\\"] to help each other and make the world a better place) and get the rich to help the poor, and the poor to help each other, so that all people could live happier lives. As an allegory, the novel features Scrooge, who symbolically represents the repressive and greedy business owners of the time, ill-treating his clerk Bob, symbolically representative of the thoughtful and kind but poor working class. The story is presented in five chapters (called \\"staves, the plural of the musical term \\"staff\\", since this is a Christmas \\"carol\\"), each of which has a specific function.  The first introduces the main character, Ebenezer Scrooge, describing his miserliness and presenting him with a supernatural visitation from his former partner, now a tormented ghost who sees that Scrooge will have the same torments when he dies if Scrooge does not change his ways.  The second stave deals with Scrooge's past, and how he became the horrible person he is.  The third stave details Dickens' ideas of a perfect Christmas, and how even the poorest of the poor can find happiness in the day.  The fourth stave deals with Scrooge's potential future if he does not change his ways.  The final stave explains how all of this has affected Scrooge.    MOVIE ADAPTATION: When it comes to the movie adaptation, the whole affair begins rather well with an adaptation of the first few pages of the novel; the interpretation is interesting, and generally captures the concept Dickens was going for.  Zemeckis made the choice to not have a narrator for the story (until the very last scene), which is curious, since the story specifically has a narrator that interacts with the audience and help clarify certain portions of the book.  This would have been a useful addition, especially for some scenes that are relatively faithful to the language of 1840's England that will undoubtedly leave modern audiences, and especially the young, confused.     I was very pleased at the accuracy of the dialogue and general action of the first few scenes after the introduction, but grew worried during the famous scene with Marley's face appearing on Scrooge's door knocker.  Zemeckis added an overly-dramatic twist to the scene which didn't add anything to the story and which sets up an expectation that the story will be much scarier and action-filled than it actually is.    Jacob Marley's arrival as a ghost was rather well-done, and captured the spirit of the scene (pardon the pun), if not hewing to the actual word.  This is when I grew more curious - Zemeckis had initially followed the book rather faithfully up until this point (barring the introduction), and this scene turned out to be the beginning of every-greater swings away from the actual story as written by Dickens, both in the letter and in essence.    Completely neglecting the fact that Scrooge falls asleep and sleeps through an entire day, things started to get ever-farther away from the original text with the arrival of the Spirit of Christmas Past.  A few scenes are neglected that help the audience truly get a sense of how Scrooge came by his dislike of the holiday, and which show how he actually did enjoy some of his Christmases.  One of the most important scenes that didn't make it into the movie is Scrooge's completely unselfconscious discussion with the Spirit about how his old boss, Fezziwig, made people happy without having to spend much money, and how happiness is, in fact, more important than money; this leads Scrooge to speculate that he could make his own employee much happier very easily.  This is a seminal moment in the story, in that it plants the first of many seeds in Scrooge's mind about how he should behave, and helps Scrooge begin to re-connect with humanity.  Still, the story is generally (if not specifically) faithful to the original, and provides a basic understanding of how Scrooge became the man he is.      It is with the next scene that the wheels really start to come off the train.  Again, the perceived passage of time is ignored (which makes Scrooge's amazement about how it's Christmas Day at the end of the movie completely irrelevant).  Zemeckis makes some very unusual choices in staging the scenes with the Spirit of Christmas Present.  First and foremost is the (rather literal) framing device used as the Spirit begins to show Scrooge the wonders of Christmas Day - it is distracting from the action, and completely unnecessary.  It was in this section of the story that Zemeckis and Disney seem to decide that they know more about how to structure a story than one of the greatest writers of all time.  Major sections of the third chapter of the novel are completely left out, and this is a shame.  Dickens did not include these scenes lightly - they serve the important narrative purpose of pointing out to the audience what a perfect Christmas is supposed to be like (and, indeed, on which many of our modern celebrations of the holidays are founded), and providing Scrooge with insight into the lives of people he has treated poorly.  These scenes are, at best, truncated, and most aresimply left out.  The final scene in this section of the story is wildly over-the-top, and though it does do a decent job of summarizing some of the symbolism in a narrative fashion, it is extremely grim and dark, much more so than Dickens probably intended.    The visit of the final spirit, of Christmas Yet to Come, is completely ridiculous and bears little resemblance to what is related in the novel.  There is a five minute chase scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the story, and is not very entertaining to watch even on its own.      The concluding part of the story goes back to being rather faithful to the source material.      Overall, the story is very disjointed, and does not capture the original very well past the first quarter of the movie.  As my wife said, \\"It's as if they split the story into pieces and had five different people work on each piece in isolation, then slapped all the sections together at the end.\\"
0812550706|3.0|I rate this book somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  I won't overview the story as that is a waste of time on Amazon reviews.  I thought it started out fairly well but tended to drag a bit after the first 25 pages.  It was easy to read, but a bit plain in writing style for my taste.  I prefer more detail in the books I read, but the author has addressed that with his own post on this book.  The only real irksome part of the book was all the time spent performing laser tag at Enders 1st military training facility.  Plenty of uninteresting (for me) military speak, overly mature dialogue for children, and generally a slow part of the book.  It did contain important events, but it took up so much book space.  The side story with Ender's brother Peter and sister Valentine was interesting and I enjoyed it.  After Ender left his first training facility and headed for the old bugger rock is when the story showed more promise and interest.  I was ready to write a bad review but the final 1/4 of the book saved it.  Great read for young adults no doubt, or those looking for a simple and quick sci fi read.  I doubt I'll look into the rest of the series.
0345505387|2.0|The Disclaimers:  I am a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series.  I own all of the books and I am currently in the process of re-reading each one of them.  I am not a fan of graphic novels; I feel they are over-priced comic books that pander to a generation either too lazy or too ignorant to read a book.      Gabaldon's vivid, detailed descriptions give the reader a clear image of the character -- from the swing of Jamie's kilt as he walks to the lace fluttering on Claire's gown.  Her style of writing in the first person works well in the novels, but is not easily translated to other forms of media.  In spite of these reserves, I was curious to see how Gabaldon's writing style would work in this format and how some of the characters, such as Murtagh, Dougal and Colum would be depicted.      There were two things I found very disappointing:  1) the choppy story line and 2) inconsistent graphic depictions.  In order to move things along a large part of the storyline was left out.  A new character, Kenneth, was introduced as part of the Murtagh-Dougal sub-plot.  Geilie Duncan has a smaller part in the story and she is somehow connected to Kenneth (they are both time travelers).  Overall, there were key pieces of dialog that were left out and other bits of dialog that made no sense on why they were included.      As for the graphics ... well, Jamie was not depicted as being tall, braw and bonny.  He was the same height as every other male in the book.  The artist, Hoang Nguyen, did get Colum shorter than Dougal, but Dougal did not come across as being the Black Celt that he's depicted to be in the novels.  But what I found more frustrating was that there were several variations on the look of a character from page to page.  With all due respect to the artist, when Jamie and Claire are getting married, why do their faces change shape from the sharp, angular Scottish and English lines to the softer, flatter shape of an Asian face?  I did a double-take on those images because I thought I was seeing things.    This book was disappointing and I would not recommend it to my friends.  I usually finish an \\"Outlander\\" series novel feeling that my time was well spent in the reading and looking forward to the next book.  I walked away from The Exile feeling as disjointed as the book's storyline.  It was nice to see Gabaldon try something different, but this effort did not work for me.  I hope Gabaldon will go back to writing her wonderful, richly detailed 1,000 page books that leave me wanting more and that she will not pursue further efforts on graphic novels.  If she wants to do another graphic novel, her Lord John Gray short stories would be better suited for that format.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|the dvd set allowed me to view all the episodes that I missed.  I hadn't tuned into this new show until half way thru the season.  Love it.
B00005OCMR|5.0|First, this is a fantastic classic from the dawn of the computer age as we know it today. The movie came out just after the birth of the IBM PC. Back in those days the concept of distributed computing was unknown outside of the computer room. Main frame and mini-computers lived in air conditioned secured rooms, hosting a bunch of dumb video terminals for the users.  Most people had no idea of how they worked and they were usually found only in big companies.    Even today the special effects, though quaint by modern standards, are still impressive and the story line is pretty good.  But the visual concepts from back then of what it would be like to actually be inside of a computer is what makes this movie really special and fascinating.  To say the movie was conceptually far ahead of it's time is an understatement.    The video quality in this version is great and looks impressive on my 65\\" screen with the upscaling provided by my Blu Ray player.  Color saturation is rich but not overdone and the images are crisp and clean although you can see the black outline around each character from the matting process.  The 5.1 sound is also very clear and clean with good surround sound effect.  All in all, it's a terrific movie that all sci-fi fans should have in their library.    As for the exorbitant prices being charged for the movie now, bear in mind that it is not Disney that's setting those stupid prices even though they undoubtedly contributed to the situation by not producing any more copies of this movie and/or forcing distributors to return unsold stock.  But the prices you see are being set by greedy resellers, for the few copies they have left in stock, who are basing them on the law of supply and demand and hoping they can find enough suckers who want a copy of this movie badly enough to pay them such ridiculous prices.  I'm just thankful that I bought my copy from Amazon before these greedy moron resellers jacked up their prices.  You'll notice that Amazon is not selling this particular movie; they are just providing access to other resellers who are.    Actually I think Disney is being very short sighted and greedy itself in trying to prevent sales of this movie because they think it will negatively impact their revenue from the new Tron Legacy release.  It they were really smart, they would have done a digitally remastered Blu Ray version and promoted that to drum up additional interest in the new movie.  That way they would have made even more money off both products.  I know I certainly would have bought a remastered Blu Ray version and also gone to see the new movie.    Bottom line, just don't buy this movie until the prices come back down to a reasonable level.  I think that after the new movie has been out for a few months, these prices will come back down to a reasonable level, especially if no one buys from these greedy resellers until they bring the prices back to down to reasonable levels.

B004A2V3K0|1.0|It's a better album by far than this, and it's probably cheaper. This is a pure money grab! Only worthwhile if you love the songs from BJ of the 2000's and up.     BUY CROSS ROAD And then you get the 3 or 4 songs off this that are worth it!    that's what I say
B003L20ICE|4.0|A bittersweet comedy-drama with fine performances and perceptive direction by Lisa Cholodenko (who collaborated with Stuart Blumberg on the screenplay). Despite a few predictable story turns, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" looks at the family unit in a refreshingly offbeat manner. The film slowly gets under your skin thanks in part to the effortless chemistry between Annette Bening and Julianne Moore - complemented by Mark Ruffalo's best portrayal in years. Expect a few Oscar nominations for this unconventional gem.
B00005JGAB|5.0|I'm not sure it really needed this remastering, as this was their first and greatest album! The Ramones were great to hear on vinyl and at their shows, and this album best captures their energy!
B00436GNVC|2.0|What the heck happened to the most promising new singer in years? Duffy's debut was a revelation, the product of a young woman who grew up in Wales listening to her parents'  (or grandparents) record collection from the British Invasion of the sixties. That record evoked the chilly cool and emotional warmth of Cilla Black, Lulu and, at times, Dusty Springfield. Listening to that record was like hearing the coolest songs coming out of the UK during that era, and it was one of the years' best. Now, unfortunately, we have this mess. The up-tempo songs could be on any current pop diva's record and seem cultivated for the living room dance floor of an audience too young or unsophisticated to appreciate the nuanced music that was such a marvelous showcase for Duffy's voice. The ballads here are lifeless. And, speaking of Duffy's voice, it sounds like a very poor choice was made to put her with a vocal coach that brought out an annoyingly over-the-top uber-vibrato to everything she sings here. Come back Duffy - we can all just try to forget about this record!
B003UYV08E|2.0|I really enjoyed the first Iron Man movie, but this movie was pretty bad. There was way too much inane dialogue, and characters that were not needed except for Marvel to advertise their other upcoming movies. Scarlett Johanson phoned in her role, but who could blame her, there was no reason for the Black Widow in the movie, she hardly did anything. Samuel L Jackson, whom I love, was actually annoying as Nick Fury, not this fault though, really the writers fault for putting him in scenes when the movie didn't warrant it. Don Cheadle was OK but I missed Terrence Howard's charm. Sam Rockwell as Hammer was good though, and Mickey Rourke as Whiplash seemed terrific if only they had used him more! Paltrow and Downey were good but the movie was really slow moving and the fight scenes pretty sparse. Overall a big disappointment.
B004FTSAZO|5.0|This series is so much better than the books.  I love the fact they took a good premise/plot from the books, and created a more adult type show that doesn't have as much whining and angst present.  Bravo to Julie Peck (one of the writers)for making this a show that I shut all electronics and family off to watch!
B000002JSR|5.0|When I went to buy this all those years ago, I wasn't jumping for joy. My favorite band lost it's great drummer and disbanded. Just outtakes from the past I figured, but you know what? This album had kick azz energy and still does. Love all the songs, guess if I had to pick Poor Tom would be my favorite.

B004EI3ON4|2.0|So, like most of you interested in buying this album, I was hooked on the trailer that featured the 'Derezzed' track by Daft Punk (which co-incidentally is the only song worth buying on this album). I was eagerly looking forward to the release and blindly purchased it expecting some quality Daft Punk... boy was I disappointed.<br /><br />First off, there are absolutely NO VOCALS except if you count narration by Flynn in 'The Grid'. Secondly, the songs are mostly not the usual electronica beats that we expect from Daft Punk but rather some very dull orchestral music. Seriously? Is this false advertising or what? Daft Punk and orchestra music? At the very least, this is false advertising. If I could I'd take a full refund... but alas!, I purchased the Mp3 Download.<br /><br />Daft Punk, if you are reading this, I don't know how you would stamp your name on this horribly boring soundtrack. What a disappointment...

B004132HZS|5.0|I. Loved. It.      Full disclosure: I haven't really watched Jeremy Brett's or Basil Rathbone's Holmes.And I only read the books *after* I watched Sherlock.      So I can understand the trepidation of some Holmes purists when they found out this version of the Holmes story(3  separate stories on this DVD as well as the original unaired pilot, with LOTS of nods to canon) was set in the 21st century.It shouldn't work, but it does. And very well at that.      As in the original story,A Study In Scarlet(here renamed A Study In Pink),Watson(Martin Freeman) is fresh back from Afghanistan after being injured. He runs into a med school acquaintance who  says a friend of his is also looking for a roomate(who turns out to be Holmes(Benedict Cumberbatch-superbly cast, as is Freeman). Needless to say,the two become flatmates, and are  called in by Inspector Lestrade(Rupert Graves) when they are out of their league. Holmes knows the score.      The second story (The Blind Banker) is considered the weakest of the 3 stories, but I liked it just fine, and it introduces a love interest for Watson, Sarah(Zoe Telford).      The third story, The Great Game, has Holmes and Watson racing against time to solve puzzles given to them. It ends with a  cliffhanger that is WAY better than anything  American TV could come up with(and I'll be interested to see how they resolve it.)

0385523386|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Piper writes with a lot of emotion that draws the reader in.  I laughed and cried - tears of joy and sadness - and found myself genuinely concerned for her.  She also does a great job describing the other \\"characters\\" and her surroundings.      I would definitely recommend this book.  Great read.
1423113381|4.0|The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan is filled with adventure, magic, history, and family. Carter Kane has always wished his life was normal. During his and his father's yearly visit to his sister, things quickly spiral even more beyond his control! Carter has always traveled with his father (an esteemed Egyptian archeologist) and wishes he could live a normal life, going to high school, making friends, and living in an actual house. His sister, Sadie, lives with their grandparents in England and has always envied Carter. On Christmas Eve (the only day they all get to spend together), their father decides to awaken some ancient Egyptian gods to \\"set things right\\", whatever that means. In doing so, he got himself kidnapped and sent the angry god Set after his children, not to mention the crazy people of the House of Life trying to kill them. Their adventure to rescue their father is dangerous, difficult, and forces them to decide whether or not to accept their unbelievable fates!    Switching back and forth between brother and sister, Rick Riordan has managed to create an understanding for the reader of each sibling. I enjoyed how the narrator switched between Sadie and Carter, but at times it was a little bit confusing to discern which one was telling the story. I really loved how enthralling this story was and can hardly wait for the second and third books in this trilogy to come out! The reading level was pretty easy, but it made for a quick read even given the extensive number of pages.
0786868724|5.0|Have a Little Faith weaves the stories of Rabbi Al Lewis and Pastor Henry Covington as each man deals with deep hurts, obstacles, crises, and a personal call to minister to their respective flocks. Have a Little Faith is never \\"preachy\\" although it ends with Mitch's deeply felt and poignant eulogy for Rabbi Lewis. It has humor, charm, and a quiet dignity that reveals the lives of two men from utterly different backgrounds. Both men share an abiding love and concern for others and each man has lived through personal storms that could have left an abiding residue of bitterness, anger, and desolation. The rabbi and the pastor chose faith over despair and Mitch's book is a dialogue about faith in the context of an era that seems to have little regard for those values. Mitch's book is an eloquent plea and endorsement for hope, faith, and love.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|Nerd diving in to the review space here...<br /><br />This movie was good as a standalone, but I agree with the notion that it lacked the depth of the Original Series, and Generation, for that matter.<br /><br />I had two major problems with this movie: one, Kirk gets promoted after saving Earth, from Cadet to. . . captain?<br /><br />Uhm, lolwut? Speaking as ex-military spouse, that is not even the least bit believable. Promotions work on a scale, I don't care if someone does save the planet. For that matter, a medal is more realistic then a leap that quick.<br /><br />Second major problem I had: The Characters. Kirk, I could buy as being all over the place when he was a teen. Fine, cool, good vibe, whutev. McCoy? Oh lord. I have to give hands down to Karl Urban. I was immensely impressed with his overly emotional fire, very in line with the original portrayal of our beloved doctor. Who I had a problem with? Spock.<br /><br />Now, this is not a come-down on Quinto, who had the look and the presence of personality to pull of Spock. No, this one, I blame on the writers, who eliminated nearly all of the original backstory for Spock-who clearly favored his Vulcan heritage early on in the series (mostly due to pressure from Sarek, kthnx) in favor of hooking him up with a nice pair of legs. In TOS, it took spores or a virus to make Spock crack, and so many women (said a Mr. Asimov, please see \\" I am Spock\\") took a fangirly crazy sort of glee in imagining different ways of busting that shell open. A large portion of Spocks fans way back when were female-essentially, it was because he was virtually untouchable. This movie? Totally wiped all of that off the board. His past, his struggles to find a balance between human and vulcan...all of it. Gone. Poof. Just like that. And it was awful.<br /><br />I gave this movie a three, for those facts alone. Spock &lt;3 Uhura? Nowai.<br /><br />Also, no one can EVER replace Mark Lenard as Sarek, sorry. That man had a presence that no one else can match for that role, gods rest his soul.<br /><br />/end nerd rant./end nerd rant.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|the packaging could be better.  I'm not talking about the flipping system, I mean the format.  There are 8 discs, but only 5 seasons and two movies.  The seasons should have been evenly divided amongst the discs, instead you end up without an insert telling you want episodes there are and what season they belong in.  This proves most annoying after Season 4.  The Season 4 finale Dye! Dye! My Darling is the final episode before the movie Is It Fall Yet? but on the disc following that episode there are 2 other episodes from the beginning of season 5.  The movie is found in the extras section on disc 8.  So you have to a. know when to put the movie in to continue the timeline correctly and b. put the disc back in to watch 2 measly episodes before you need to change it again.<br /><br />Yes the music is different and at times doesn't fit with the mood of the show, but I'll gladly take new music just to have the whole series when for awhile it looked like that wasn't going to happen.<br /><br />The show is just as wonderful as it was back when it was first airing.  I've owned the series for a few months now and have watched it several times without growing tired of it.<br /><br />The extras are great, especially the character evolution...the early Brittany was in obvious need of a makeover.<br /><br />Three cheers for teenage cynicism.

So this books only cover things that every web designer or web developer should know if he have a little experience.    The most valuable chapter is the one of user testing, that's because I have never done that tests in my work and it was new for me.

144867185X|5.0|This review is for the CreateSpace, or Classic Books America, version of The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, which is not the best edition. There are quite a few typos. The Signalman Publishing edition is supposed to be better. But this review will be more about the content of the book and, despite the typos, this is a really important book.<br /><br />I will admit upfront that I am not an expert in Keynesian economics, or economics in general, so rather than trying to give a detailed summary of this whole book I will merely attempt to highlight some of the revolutionary aspects of Keynes's theories as presented in this book, or some of the ways in which Keynes himself believed he was transforming the \\"classical\\" theories that preceded him, to the best of my limited abilities.<br /><br />I will say as a general comment that if you want to understand Keynes's revolutionary theories you should read Keynes himself since Keynes as he is presented in the textbooks (the Neoclassical synthesis) is a watered down version. Reading Keynes is not easy. There is not a ton of math in this book but Keynes's writing can be difficult to understand, particularly if you are not already trained in economics. Someone who is completely unfamiliar with economics should obviously not try to read this book but assuming you are familiar with supply and demand curves and you know what terms like marginal productivity, marginal disutility, elasticity, and real wage mean (among many other terms) and you are persistent you should be able to achieve some degree of understanding from reading this book. It is a book that really has to be read more than once and I am quite willing to admit that it is foolhardy of me to attempt to write a review for this work having only read it once, but I like to live on the edge, so here we go.<br /><br />Keynes begins by laying out the postulates of classical economics in regard to employment. Keynes notes that most work in economics within the classical school had been concerned with determining the distribution of resources between various uses while the question about what determines the general level of employment of available resources has been left relatively in the dark. Keynes's book is primarily interested in analyzing this question, namely, what determines the general level of employment?<br /><br />Keynes believed the classical theory, to the extent that there was a theory about this at all, rested on two postulates. The first postulate stated that \\"The wage is equal to the marginal product of labor\\" (pg. 6). Firms will hire workers until the real wage (the wage adjusted for prices) is equal to the marginal product produced by the last worker. This behavior is based on profit maximization. If marginal product is still higher than the real wage a firm will be able to increase its profits by hiring additional workers, if they hire workers to a point where the real wage is higher than the marginal product they will be losing more money than they gain. Profit is maximized where the real wage equals marginal product.<br /><br />The second postulate states that \\"The utility of the wage when a given volume of employment is employed is equal to the marginal disutility of that amount of employment\\" (pg. 7). This is based on individual maximizing behavior. Workers will offer more work up until the point that the marginal disutility of that labor equals the real wage. If they worked less they would be able to increase their total utility by working more, if they worked more they would be able to increase their utility by working less. Utility is maximized when the real wage equals the marginal disutility of labor.<br /><br />These two postulates together determine the level of employment in society since the first postulate determines the demand for labor and the second postulate determines the supply for labor and their intersection determines the equilibrium level of employment which for the classicaltheory is always full employment, meaning: everyone who is willing and able to work at the going real wage rate is able to find employment (minus some possible frictional unemployment). If there are people who want to work but cannot it can only be because the marginal productivity of labor is not high enough for employers to be able to offer workers a wage which would be at least equal to the marginal disutility of that labor. There can be no involuntary unemployment according to this theory, meaning: people who are willing to work at the current real wage rate but are unable to. Since Keynes considers the existence of involuntary unemployment to be an obvious fact of the world we live in he believes that there must be something wrong with the classical theory on this point.<br /><br />Keynes believes that the second postulate of the classical theory is invalid for two reasons. First, the real wage rate does not in general equal the marginal disutility of labor since a fall in the real wage due to rising prices does not, in general, lead to a lower level of employment. This seems to indicate that the level of employment is not a function solely of the real wage, meaning: the theory is unable to explain the actual level of employment.<br /><br />The second and more important reason that Keynes believes the second postulate is mistaken is because as he says, \\"There may exist no expedient by which labour as a whole can reduce its real wage to a given figure by making revised money bargains with entrepreneurs\\" (pg. 13). Indeed, the notion that labor can, as a whole, bargain to reduce the real wage as a whole seems to contradict other postulates of the classical theory since prices are supposed to be determined by marginal prime cost in terms of money and money-wages largely govern marginal prime cost (pg. 12). So as money wages change prices are likely to change along with them leaving the real wage the same as it was before. In fact Keynes believes that the struggle over money wages is primarily about the distribution of the aggregate real wage between different labor groups and not a struggle over the general level of the real wage itself (pg. 14).<br /><br />So what is the upshot of all this? Keynes believes that with a given level of technique (the production function in neoclassical economics) the real wage and the volume of employment are correlated so that increases in employment lead to a decline in real wages. This seems to simply be due to the diminishing marginal productivity of increased employment. However, it is no longer the case that a decline in employment, which necessarily raises the real wage, is due to the demand of labor for a higher real wage. We can no longer blame unemployment on the laborers being unwilling to accept a lower real wage, or the inflexibility of the real wage due to labor contracts or minimum wages.<br /><br />This means we have to find another explanation for unemployment and, hence, the general level of employment. This review is already quite long and I have literally only summarized the first two chapters (twenty pages) so I will have to pick up the pace a bit. I am merely going to summarize a few of the aspects of Keynes's theory.<br /><br />First, as we have seen in the classical models the level of employment is determined by the supply and demand conditions of the labor market. Once the level of employment is determined in the labor market the production functions determine the level of output. Keynes, on the other hand, as Hyman Minsky makes clear in his book Stabilizing an Unstable Economy (a book I highly recommend) believes that the determination of employment begins with demand for output (what Keynes calls aggregate demand). Aggregate demand is composed of consumption, which is a function of disposable income and the propensity to consume, and investment. Employment is equal to the demand for labor as determined by the demand for output and it is possible for the labor demanded in this case to be less than the amount of labor supplied at a given money wage. This allows Keynes to explain involuntary unemployment.<br /><br />The important variable, therefore, becomes the level of aggregate demand and the truly volatile variable is the level of investment and this is due to another revolutionary aspect of Keynes's work (though I should admit that I am on shakier ground here in terms of my own understanding so if someone recognizes mistakes in my presentation feel free to respond and correct me). As I understand it the level of investment in classical theory was determined by the marginal productivity of capital and the interest rate. This was a point in time measurement, meaning: if the marginal productivity of another unit of capital is higher than the interest rate prevailing at that moment then investment will be profitable and a firm following profit maximizing rules of behavior will choose to increase investment until the marginal productivity of capital equals the interest rate.<br /><br />Keynes introduced time into this measurement so that it was the productivity of capital over its entire life-span, as opposed to a point in time measurement of its marginal product, which determined whether an investment was profitable. Of course it would be fairly easy to calculate the total product that could be produced by a new piece of capital equipment over its entire life-span but in order to be profitable the firm must be able to actually sell this output at a decent price. This introduces uncertainty into the problem since the life-span of a piece of fixed capital can be quite long and future prices are often unknown. The firm can no longer simply assume that the current price is going to be the ruling price for all time and so the calculation to determine whether a given investment is going to be profitable becomes much more difficult to determine with any degree of certainty.<br /><br />This makes the level of investment a function of mass psychology since in periods of little confidence the estimates of profitability are bound to be quite low while in periods of high confidence estimates of profitability will be quite high. According to classical theory the level of investment is determined simply by real variables (i.e. marginal productivity, the production function, the interest rate). Introducing mass psychology into the mix makes for some de-stabilizing dynamics and self-perpetuating slumps (i.e. recessions, depressions, and business cycles). The phenomena of recessions, depressions and business cycles are difficult to explain if the level of investment is considered to be a function of real variables only since the real variables often remain largely the same between periods of high economic growth and periods of economic downturn. Keynes, however, can explain these phenomena quite easily.<br /><br />I will point out two further aspects of Keynes's theories that I found interesting and then bring this overly long review to a close. The first has to do with speculation and the financial system. The financial system, broadly speaking, is designed to channel capital from those who have excess capital to those who are in need of capital and have profitable investment opportunities. This leads to a separation of ownership and management which Keynes believes has four consequences. 1) the element of real knowledge that enters into the valuation of investments by those who own them declines 2) minor, day-to-day fluctuations in the profits of existing investments have an excessive influence on the market 3) conventional valuations made on the basis of mass psychology are liable to violent fluctuations based purely on changes in mass psychology as opposed to changes in the real prospective yield of the investment 4) professional investors will tend to accentuate these instabilities rather than mitigate them since their goal will be to predict the movements of mass psychology rather than to provide objective analyses of the prospective yields of various investments (pg127-128).<br /><br />This means that the financial system may not be the most efficient means of channeling capital to productive uses. As Keynes writes, \\"There is no clear evidence from experience that the investment policy which is socially advantageous coincides with that which is most profitable\\" (pg. 130). Speculation can lead to large profits but it does not necessarily lead to capital being used in the most socially advantageous way. In fact, it can lead to the opposite if, as Keynes says, production becomes a bubble on the stream of speculation rather than the reverse.<br /><br />The last point I will make has to do with the interest rate and the fact that Keynes determines the interest rate based on liquidity preference rather than on the propensity to save. I cannot go into detail about this particular aspect of Keynes's thought due to limitations of space and limitations of my own understanding but I would like to highlight one interesting consequence of the fact that, as Keynes says, the interest rate is determined by \\"prevailing institutional and psychological factors\\".<br /><br />The money supply is considered to be perfectly inelastic and determined exogenously and the propensity to hold money is considered to be a function of the liquidity preference which determines the interest rate. In order for increased investment and production to take place it must be considered profitable in comparison with the interest rate. If the interest rate is higher than the marginal efficiency of capital as Keynes defines it then increased production and investment will not take place. Since the money supply does not react endogenously (i.e. since the retarding effect of the money-interest rate on production does not lead to the increased production of money) the money interest rate becomes a factor which determines an upper limit to new investment and output.<br /><br />Since the marginal efficiency of capital decreases as more capital is accumulated this ultimately means that \\"capital has to be kept scarce enough in the long-period to have a marginal efficiency which is at least equal to the rate of interest for a period equal to the life of the capital, as determined by psychological and institutional conditions\\" (pg. 183). The rate of interest, thus, enforces an artificial scarcity on capital. There is an institutionally determined limit to production which does not necessarily correspond to any real limits on production. There may still be demand for more goods, and there may still be resources unused which could be used for the production of those goods, but if the expected profitability does not at least equal the prevailing interest rate the production will not take place (what effect does this have on the definition of economics as the science of the relation between given ends and scarce means?). This seems to be a limit imposed on a society in which production is geared towards the production of exchange value rather than use value (to use an expression of Marx). The question is: what other possibilities might there be? I won't attempt to answer that but merely present it as something to think about.d in this case to be less than the amount of labor supplied at a given money wage. This allows Keynes to explain involuntary unemployment.<br /><br />The important variable, therefore, becomes the level of aggregate demand and the truly volatile variable is the level of investment and this is due to another revolutionary aspect of Keynes's work (though I should admit that I am on shakier ground here in terms of my own understanding so if someone recognizes mistakes in my presentation feel free to respond and correct me).

B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I discovered Collins I was reading Greagor the Underlander. (a book you should really read) I LOVED it and wanted more of Collins great writing. A year later I was looking for a book and I saw the intresting cover of The Hunger Games. I picked it up and bought it. I thought it was going to be a reagular old book. Then I was taken on a wild journey of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. It was an emotional ride for them. When Peeta annocess that he is in love with one of the contests that he has to kill. I was so sad. The two of the star crossed lovers are taken in to an arena and are forced to kill 23 other people. Well if they want to survive. I have recomended this book to all of my friends and family. Did I mention the star crossed lovers have other siblings at home watching them. Also there's Katniss's friend Gale Hawthorne is also at his house watching. I felt terribal throughout the book for them but the ending oh the ending will sure be a surprise!!!!

B001JNNDEW|5.0|1 Blu-ray disc, released February 2009<br /><br />Some comedy classics stay fresh forever. This one still wins after eleven years.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" is a Mike Judge comedy about the cubicle life. There are so many memorable characters! Lumbergh played by Gary Cole who drags out all his sentences and Milton played by Stephen Root who is the squirrelly guy with management issues and a red Swingline stapler.<br /><br />It embodies a fantasy of what many office workers feel their life is like and what they would love to do about it working up to the beat down of the fax machine.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There is a new trivia track called \\"Post-It Pandemonium\\" where post-its appear on the screen in random places with facts you probably didn't know or ever need to know necessarily...I thought it would be cool but after a while it gets a little annoying since they cover up faces and other stuff on the screen.<br /><br />If you like games, this has a bunch. You can play Grab the Stapler, Printer Beat-Down, Whack-a-Drone, and Jump to Conclusions 2.0. The \\"Out of the Office\\" Office Space Retrospective with Writer/Director Mike Judge allows you to see the animation and voices in the cartoon where Milton and Lumbergh originated. It goes over the casting process of how they found each actor and how that actor interpreted their characters and motivations. There are also eight deleted scenes where Peter is being caught in a lie about his whereabouts, Happy hour at the restaurant where Peter talks about the hypothetical no job scenario, Peter goes off on Nina, Peter grandstanding about life and revelations which doesn't make a lot of sense at that moment in his new carefree zen state, etc. As with almost all deleted scenes, the movie is better without them.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I am a die-hard S&tC fan.  I've watched the entire series multiple times and have seen the first movie multiple times, and I love these characters.  After seeing the second movie I was actually ashamed.  I'm going to pretend I never saw it in order to preserve my appreciation of everything that came before it, but I wish I didn't have to.  The second movie is cheap, shallow, manipulative, and is offensive to women in the sense that it assumes our stupidity as a prerequisite to enjoyment.     I have never reviewed anything online before.  That's how much I hate this movie.  This is coming from a fan.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|6 Blu-ray discs, released on October 26, 2010<br /><br />The Alien Anthology collection contains all four Alien movies with a boat-load of extras, two discs alone are just for extras. In space, no one can hear you scream and if you watch all 60 hours of content and view all 12,000 photo images, no one will ever see you for days. All four movies have completely different tones. While eventually each has at least one alien to make a pile of bodies, that is about all they have in common. Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\" is a suspenseful horror movie, James Cameron's \\"Aliens\\" is a sci-fi spectacle of entertainment, and \\"Alien 3\\" is a drama about religion, society, and isolation. \\"Alien: Resurrection\\" just gets into a very weird fan-fiction type fantasy. Spoilers to follow.<br /><br />Before jumping into the extras, I started on Halloween with a marathon of all the movies. Starting with \\"Alien\\", I passed on the 1979 theatrical version to watch the 2003 Director's cut edition with the introduction by Ridley Scott. Scott claims to have been fully satisfied with the film for years not wanting to change it, but then a few years ago decided to make some changes to improve it (or as I call it, go \\"Lucas\\" on it). I'm sure he just added content and length to the film as all the other films did. In this film, we meet Lieutenant Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver for the first time, a strong woman who follows protocol and is second-in-command on the ship until their captain meets an untimely demise. They were awoken early from hyper sleep to investigate a strange signal so they land on a planet to investigate and strange things happen. She elected to follow protocol and keep the infection out of the ship and another crew member later revealed to be a Droid working for the company instead let it in knowing full well what would happen. The first infamous alien-bursting-out-of-the-chest occurred, Ripley's prejudice against Droids developed after nearing being killed by one, and Ripley fought the good fight to save a cat and become the sole human survivor of the experience. The effects were practical and the movie looks fantastic and still holds up today. I've only seen it a few times and parts of it still make me jump! The character Ripley was important because she was one of the toughest female characters ever in a movie and held her own. Not many women led an entire movie during that time.<br /><br />Then James Cameron, master of the epic movie took on the series. Before \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Avatar\\", this film and \\"Terminator 2\\" were his claims to fame cementing him in the sci-fi genre. I again bypass the 1986 theatrical edition in favor of the 1991 (no hesitation to add stuff here!) edition with introduction by Cameron mostly just to cite all the additional stuff he wanted to put in and now could (not surprising). In my opinion, this is the best of the series and the popular favorite. The premise of the creatures is already established so all they had to do was pull Ripley out of space, explain that everything she once knew was gone, and accuse her of lying and making the ship self destruct for no reason. Instead of charging her for losses to \\"The Company\\", they send her back to the planet she picked up the alien on in the first place in hopes of reestablishing contact with the colony grown there. She gets combat soldiers to accompany her including one of the most buff women I have ever seen in my life who can do backwards pull ups and Bill Paxton in the best performance of his life (\\"Game over man, it's game over!\\").<br /><br />My father-in-law used to use \\"Aliens\\" as a teaching tool for showing how to act in a stressful situation. Ripley and Hicks keep their heads level and try to think of solutions. Bill Paxton's reactions as Hudson were like a play-by-play in what not to do in terms of panicking and negative group thinking. In this movie, the cat has been replaced by a little girl named Newt. If Ripley can just save this little blond girl with a fantastic scream, all will be good in the world. She has to learn to trust an Android in order to make this happen. This movie just does everything right in terms of effects, speed of storytelling, character development, and keeping the whole thing exciting. You actually care about the characters and the size of the giant guns being toted around while impractical is pretty bad-[...]<br /><br />Now I moved on to \\"Alien 3\\" with the little 3 so it's an exponential amount of aliens. Passed over the 1992 version for the \\"restored workprint version\\" from 2003, directed by David Fincher. Ripley actually made it out with some friends last time so they automatically all died during the journey where she crash lands on a prison planet. The prisoners are no longer held captive and have adapted a religion, shaved heads, and a monk-like lifestyle but are seething with potential violence. Ripley gets a G.I. Jane haircut and instantly goes on a search for which of the bodies may have been impregnated with an alien and eventually discovers it's her (oops).<br /><br />In this film, it's hard to get a picture for the layout of the joint, where people are and why they are lingering there. With the bald heads, it's even difficult to tell who is who sometimes. The audio mixing is an issue because there are really long, quiet conversations and then loud battle scenes. This film uses almost completely CGI aliens and it looks really obvious compared to the old practical effects. The aliens move smoother and more fluidly, but it still looks unnatural with the backgrounds and lighting. Over two hours in to this extended cut, I fell asleep at 1:00 a.m. I came back a few days later to catch the last thirty to forty minutes where bodies continued to pile up (as they tend to do), Bishop made a reappearance in a different way, and Ripley decided to take a backwards swan dive into a convenient furnace to avoid scientific study.<br /><br />I watched the 2003 Special Edition version of \\"Alien: Resurrection\\" with an introduction by director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet who helpfully declares that you will not be seeing the version you say in 1997, but the newer version he edited together in 2003. Seeing that the screenplay was written by Joss Whedon made sense with the whole band of bandits get stuck in a situation, we all try to grow, one woman has superpowers theme. Somehow despite her incineration at the end of \\"Alien 3\\", they managed to find blood samples of her left on the planet, cloned her, extracted the queen as they always wished to do, and encourage the queen to breed. The Ripley clone begins with a child-like understanding of the world around her, but has retained her memory through a vague scientific explanation, and super strength. Baby face Winona Ryder, Hellboy, and a few others show up at this space lab and throw things off a little. One of the biggest reasons this movie is a fail is that Winona Ryder is entirely TOO whiny offering up lots of complaints, but little substance or help to the mission. Saying you want to stop the aliens and doing it are two different things and she keeps snubbing the super-human Ripley who might be the only one to successfully take them on.<br /><br />The Blu-ray high definition looks great on each of these films.

B002VUFKG6|3.0|If you read Eat, Pray, Love then this book is a continuation of the love story between Elizabeth and Filipe. Well sort of... This book is really more about the fear of marriage, the history of marriage, the beauty of marriage and the unfairness of marriage. Elizabeth also addresses some highly political topics which are sure to alienate part of her audience.<br /><br />Some of this book is an outright rant while at other times there are great lessons to learn. I enjoy the intellectual style of Elizabeth Gilbert's writing and find her deepest thoughts entertaining. What I did not expect from this book (unlike EPL) was that it would make me depressed for two complete days. Sure it kept my attention but all the fighting between Filipe and Elizabeth and all the fears about marriage left me feeling a little hopeless.<br /><br />More than once we learn about Elizabeth's complete and utter fear about getting married again. It is really the entire reason she wrote this book. It seems like she felt that if she could understand marriage on a deeper level she would be able to endure being married. She was literally forced into marrying Filipe although it is very revealing that they had their own ceremony twice without official recognition.<br /><br />The truth is really, when Elizabeth Gilbert decides to read books on marriage I felt like saying: \\"Yay! Finally.\\" What results from this research is the revelation of some shocking and surprising facts about marriage in various cultures. She also ends up having some interesting thoughts on Christianity.<br /><br />Now and then, the book actually made me laugh. Although parts of it made me cry. So if you read this book realize that while it is the same person who wrote EPL it is a much more troubled person who writes Committed.<br /><br />When Elizabeth asks the question: \\"Should you lower your expectations to be happy?\\" I'd have to say YES! By the end of this book I was SO happy that Elizabeth and Filipe got married. I hope they have a very happy life together. When Elizabeth fell in love I don't think she could have imagined the difficult circumstances she would be forced to endure. Yes, this book has a happy ending, but what a journey to get there!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewn Elizabeth fell in love I don't think she could have imagined the difficult circumstances she would be forced to endure.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|This review is after 2 week's usage of this Sony MDR7506 headphones.I bought this through the Black Friday deals at Amazon and i think i made the right decision. I could have gone for the low end Bose noise cancelling headphones (low end one) or the Sennheisser ones for almost the same cost(+- $15) but i am very happy to choose MDR7506 headphones. They are comfortable on the ears. I must say i have not worn it for long: may be a max of 2 hours. I did not feel uncomfortable while wearing them. The build quality is amazing. It feels sturdy. The quality is very good too.<br /><br />It sits in a compact pack so its easy for taking around. I will need an year to comment on the durability. I am a very protective of my things and hence my assessment need not be true for all.<br /><br />Overall a very good product.
0393068382|3.0|Delusions of Gender focuses in particular on the brain and media coverage, whereas Brainstorm is a synthetic evaluation of the theory that prenatal exposure to hormones has a long lasting impact in organizing the mind. The former is also much more geared towards the general public. Although both focus a great deal on methodology, Brain Storm is actually focused on the question of the etiology of gender differences, whereas the message of Delusions of Gender is focused on flaws in interpretation and use of neuroscience research.   While I admire Fine's questions, I think she makes some researchers and conclusions out to be more unreasonable than they actually are. She points out that researchers often make much of small studies and highlights two claims that originated in studies with a limited number of participants: the idea that males are more lateralized for language than females and that they have larger corpus callosums. Fine contends that when meta-analyses are done, it becomes apparent that this is not the case. It's not that clear cut. Daniel Voyer conducted a meta-analysis and concluded that there are sex differences in lateralization (Voyer, 1996). Similarly, the corpus callosum claims often depend on how the measurement is done. It's important to take into account study quality as well ( Holloway 1998). She downplays the ambiguity on these questions. Also, even Hyde's Gender Similarities Hypothesis documented sex differences in some language-related skills(Hyde, 2005). Girls outperform boys on standardized reading and writing tests (Program for International Literacy 2006, US Department of Education 1997). Moreover, Fine's discussion of the mental rotation and math relationship does not note some compelling findings that might alter a reader's impression. For example, Casey and colleagues found that spatial abilities mediated the gender gap on the SAT-M (e.g. Casey et. al 1995, Tartre 1990). She cites Ceci et. al 2009 for a statement of dispute, but doesn't go into detail about the issues they raised. They don't think the research showing SAT-M scores and mental rotation are flawed, per se.  That said, Fine raises some legitimate issues about how the scientific community and press responded to some papers, especially in light of subsequent findings and controversy.     Although one can easily beg to differ with some of Fine's takes on the data, many of the questions she poses are important and worthwhile. Much of the book features Fine explaining this technology and its limitations. She spends a lot of time indicting particular studies, illuminating how ambiguous some data is, and how it gets wildly interpreted. She emphasizes how challenging it is to interpret what's really going on in the mind. One need not agree with Fine's take on certain controversial issues on the topic to see her point about popular writers gone wild. She also rightly stresses that people tend to be particularly impressed with this research (Weisberg et. al 2008). Fine's text is well-suited to instilling skepticism into readers and enabling them to look critically at the claims they might encounter in press reports. This is especially valuable because press reports typically mention methodological details, but don't cover some of the limitations in procedures.   The downside, though, as Diane Halpern notes is it not as helpful to distinguishing between cautiously executed studies with reasonable conclusions. Note also, such investigations do exist. (e.g. Allen et. al 2003; Koscik et. al 2009; Hanggi et. al 2010). Researchers who care about these sorts of issues, exist too. Consider Tor Wager who conducted a meta-analysis of 60+ brain imaging studies, and noted he was speculating in his discussion of them. Wager and one of his colleagues also opened a discussion of sex differences in the emotional brain by pointing out Aristotle's views on women's inferiority, and ended by emphasizing sex similarities. I suppose there are still limitations inthe research, and some of this could be misconstrued. It's not a researcher getting overly excited about a single spurious finding that conforms to stereotypes.   Genes, hormones, and their impact on brain structure and function contribute to making the lives of men and women different (Hines, 2005). Yet, the awe that some neuroimaging studies inspire may not always be conducive to understanding how. New York Times editor wrote that Fine's book helped her \\"see how complex and fascinating the whole issue is.\\" I do worry that this comes at the expense of dismissing legitimate scholarship.   Ultimately, Fine posits that some of this research will wind up in the sorry scrap heap of the past. That's not beyond the scope of possibility. Maybe in retrospect, we will see some bias, some flaws and gaps. But it won't just be a bunch of over-eager researchers to      References  Allen JS, Damasio H, Grabowski TJ, Bruss J, Zhang W.

B0042816YK|1.0|This movie is absolute trash, and is the most self-indulgent crap I have ever watched.  The title of the movie ought to be:  \\"Everyone Loves Julia Roberts; Julia Roberts loves nobody except herself.  I couldn't stand to watch the most idiotic trash ever produced.  If you like watching Spaghetti drooling out of Ms. Robert's face, then this is the movie for you.  Whether its New York, Italy, India, or Bali, everyone loves her more than she loves them, and she dumps them all.  What a concept.  Glad I rented it, I think JR should send me the buck back.    If that's not enough, she makes sure after dumping her New York husband, who loves her deeply, but really shouldn't if he had any self-respect at all, she proceeds to get herself laid every which way but loose from some guy in Bali, after which she gets a bladder infection, which probably should have been Syphilis, Gonorrhea  or worse.  YUCK !!
B002ZG980U|5.0|I really loved this movie - the story pulled me right in and was fast paced. It is definitely not something to throw on while you are distracted or doing something else, though, or you won't get what is going on. In fact, you should probably buy, not rent - I'm going to have to watch this a couple more times before I've really seen everything. It rather reminds me of The Matrix in that respect, not in storyline really, but in the feeling that you've missed something but if you watch it a couple more times you'll see all the subplots and hints eventually. Some people are complaining that it is too confusing - maybe Despicable Me is more their speed. Personally I love a good \\"thinker\\" that gets your brain working.    writer/director/producer Nolan & the crew he put together are going to need a flatbed to bring home all the awards they're going to get for this masterpiece. I'm not normally a huge DiCaprio fan, but I have to say this was quite a performance by him - best-actor-worthy. I am a big fan of both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page, and they were both also quite excellent.    The somewhat debatable ending will have people talking for months yet. Excellent writing and plot layering gave opportunities for some really clever special effects that ought to get still more awards (I'm thinking of the spinning hallway right now, in particular). All in all, I loved this one - and rather disappointed now that I never got to see it in theaters, or especially IMAX. I bet that would have been fun.
1401228801|5.0|\\"Witches\\" is the latest graphic novel in Bill Willingham's outstanding Fables series.  If you are unfamiliar with this series, I recommend you start at the beginning.  Suffice it to say three hundred years ago, characters of folklore were driven to our world.  They settled in what is now Manhattan, living in secret.  The non-human counterparts live in upstate New York on a mystically hidden enormous Farm.    Fabletown in Manhattan has been destroyed by a mysterious dark figure.  Our heroes have escaped to the farm.  Their plight is compounded by the fact they know nothing of this extraordinarily deadly enemy.  Efforts at reconnaissance have proven futile.  However the reader is given insight into his activities and his capture by the forces of the Adversary. (There is one anomaly,  the origin of the Witching Cloak.  Regular readers of the series will know what I mean.)    A new character is introduced, Dunster Happ.  Under the Adversary's empire he is a licensed rural wizard with a growing reputation of brilliance.  He is recruited into the Boxers,  the Emperor's own secret, elite Delta Force.       Meanwhile the business office is disconnected from our world.  A genie and the witch Baba Yaga are free. The flying monkey, Buffkin is trapped also.  Presumably he is as big a threat as cockroach to either opponent.  Ha!  Buffkin is the librarian who has read every book in the library and he remembers everything..........    Frau Tottenkinder is making an all-out effort to restore Fabletown and defeat this new enemy.  She proceeds on this effort solo.  This creates a power vacuum with Ozma taking over the leadership of the other witches and wizards on the farm.  The first challenge she faces is the return of Geppetto.....    While all this is going on, Flycatcher is playing baseball.    This is an excellent addition to the series.   It is beautifully drawn and executed.  Mr. Willingham and his artistic staff have set a high bar for fantasy.
0393072231|5.0|(This is a belated review posted on a previous site, which explains the allusions to going over to Amazon. An advantage of the belated post allows me to point out that this book lays the foundations for understanding the foreclosure fraud: I think the banks mixed the CDOs and the synthetic CDOs legally, which created not only ambiguous claims to foreclosed properties but also redundant claims.)    I've read a dozen books describing the crisis before it came (see Bonner, Phillips, Grant, Rubino, etc.) and a dozen describing the crisis and claiming that nobody saw it coming. (I could rattle off hundreds of names who saw it coming in broad brush strokes if not ultimate severity--see Doug Noland in particular!) I was going to skip The Big Short because I was saturated, but prodding by my brother (and others) got me to do yet one more. This book was by far the best of breed. Admittedly, you have to get past the implied notion that few saw it coming (which Fleck told me was the reason he skipped it) and accept the premise of the book that few saw it coming and played the downturn huge. (Again, many of us were short but not BIG short.) Lewis is a brilliant story teller, finding subplots in all his books that really turn what could be a generic story into a barn burner. In this instance, he winds a yarn about a half dozen guys (three groups) who saw it, played it, and scored huge. Michael Berry was a glass-eyed Asperger's wielding physician who blogged after midnight. Another was some standard hedgies but headed up by Steve Eisman, a wild-eyed crazy by any standard. The third is what Lewis called a garage-band hedge fund, starting with $100K in a garage in Berkeley. Unlike many of the other books with \\"crisis\\" or \\"meltdown\\" in the title, this book shows the absurdity from inside the system through the eyes of the CDS buyers. The problem was not simply going short and waiting but rather a Texas hold 'em all-in bet using CDS's. The process was door-to-door fighting in Stalingrad. They all were in a state of total confusion trying to understand what they must be missing. Why is the smart money so damned dumb? I think the seediest part of all was when the CDS purchases started to really come into play and the brokerages refused to mark them to market. The bankers claimed they were still only worth pennies while the subprime market tanked. The guys shorting said, \\"well then sell us some for pennies\\" and Wall Street said \\"nope\\". In essence, they simply refused to make a market until it was game over. The banks even went so far as telling the players that they were capital short and had to anti up more. Michael Berry, the one-eyed Aspergers' guy who saw how to play it most clearly and earliest, had his investors demanding their money back and calling him a fraud. Another, the colorful Steve Eisman, would ream guys out In open meetings, calling CEOs variations of clueless idiots, hurling epithets at them. All of the shorts came out of the experience with various degrees of jaded. I believe they would all claim that this crisis is not over. Berry made a fortune for his investors and didn't get a single apology for their attacks. Lewis concluded that the problems, which finds their origins in the mid 80's, remain unresolved and are likely to lead to yet another, potentially fatal, crisis. It clearly bothers him that the biggest crooks and incompetents, got outta Dodge with the loot.    As usual, I stopped over at Amazon to see what the Amazonians had to say. Not surprisingly, the enthusiasm was high. One guy wanted to hear more about the government policies underpinning the crisis, but Lewis is a story teller not an archivist and that wasn't the story. (Notably absent was John Paulson, who Lewis found to be a boring plot line.) Others (the few detractors) said Zuckerman told the story better. Hard for me to say.

B002ZG981E|4.0|Another great movie from Christopher Nolan.  One of the best thought-provoking movies since The Matrix; once the movie ends, you want to watch it again to catch the things that you missed.  Good cast and great writing, Nolan is able to have the audience follow along with the dream concepts in the movie without long, complicated soliloquies.      Though the movie was a 4 1/2 to 5 star movie, the 4 star rating is for the digital copy.  Instead of a disc, the movie contains a code for download.  Even with a high speed internet connection, it took about an hour to download from iTunes.  Minor annoynace; great movie.  Highly recommended.

That means it's fine for your grandmother, your uncle, really, anybody that doesn't plan on intense gaming, it's fine. It even handles some games on lower settings. But if you want to game, you probably aren't buying an i5 anyway. And if you are, you're certainly going to grab a discrete card.<br />However, this processor lives up to its marketing. Simply put, if you are trying to put a decent computer that will last a few years, or you are building some microATX boxes, this is your processor.
0393051587|5.0|For decades I have read A Christmas Carol every December.  I can't imagine Christmas without reading Dickens' classic.  The Annotated Christmas Carol is a handsome book, filled with dozens and dozens of illustrations.  The introductory essay and the erudite and insightful annotations greatly increased my understanding and appreciation of this little book I love so much.  Indeed, the annotations made it seem as if I were reading A Christmas Carol for the first time, and made my love for Dickens even greater.  And the price for this handsome, scholarly work is very,very reasonable indeed.  If you love the Carol, you must own this book.  God bless us everyone!
B00436GNVC|2.0|I was really looking forward to this release after Rockferry.  Maybe that was the problem.  The texture and nuance of that record just aren't here.  It seems somewhat overly commercial and upbeat, in the wrong ways.  I am definitely going to keep my ears open for what else she releases, but I'll be inclined to listen before I purchase as opposed to advance ordering.  A shame.
B002ZG980U|1.0|How far are we from creating very long movies containing only explosions, special effects, loud music and \\"action\\" without any or little sense, purpose and meaning?  I think we are already there with the \\"Inception\\".     The \\"explanations\\" of the rules inserted in to the movie at all the time, is nothing more than explanation of the rules in the video game before you begin to play, after that all there is left, is a video game like movie, with one huge difference, you don't hold the joystick in your hand.  And this is what makes this movie a bore, you can not even interact with that stream of nonsensical intense and bizarre action, so it becomes almost instantly boring and annoying cacophony of never ending sounds and moving, exploding and falling objects...    Hey Mr. Nolan, ever try to understand concept of building and exploring \\"gripping\\" story lines and characters?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The movie, \\"Serenity\\" begins before the [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] really gets going, with the rescue of Willow from Alliance scientists.  The movie then picks up after the series was cancelled, providing a satisfying way of picking up loose ends that were left.  We learn, for example, how the Reavers came to be.<br /><br />Like the series, it's not always clear whether the movie is a \\"serious\\" sci-fi or whether it is a spoof of the \\"Space Western\\" sub-genre.  The subtext of satire however, is kept as subtext, and the overall movie has a rather serious note, which is as to the nature of human belief, which encompasses religious belief but is broader than that.  What does it mean to believe?  What is the power of belief?  What happens when our beliefs collapse and we are shown we are wrong?<br /><br />In the end, the primary adversary to the crew, a nameless Alliance assassin shows that he has as much nobility and courage of spirit as anyone else, and when confronted with the nature of his own beliefs, makes a surprising turn-about.
1439177783|3.0|This book was an impulse buy.  I could not resist another read that chronicled another food/weight/body obsessesed struggle!  I devoured the first several chapters with rapturous pleasure and enthusiasm.  It was difficult to resist skipping pages or chapters to see what happened next. I couldn't stop absorbing the brutal honesty and emotion that spilled out on every page.  However, once I slowed down enough to taste every word and absorb what I was reading, it settled in my gut with a dull, persistent ache.  At first glance, de Rossi appears as a humble, self-deprecating woman searching for herself and trying to find her place in the world. As quickly as I became captivated and voracious in the beginning of the book, I equally was anxious for it to end and purge from my mind.  Further into the book, each page became more mind-numbing and vacuous. I wanted to stop, but couldn't until I reached the very end, hoping I would somehow feel better once it was over.  However, I found that with the end of the book came that familiar feeling of regret, anger, and remorse.  Portia de Rossi is jut another self-obsessed celebrity with very little humility and very little insight. I should have known that I would come away feeling empty and even more disdainful towards celebrities who think that even just because they have an mental or physical illness that they can identify with everybody else.
B002ZG981E|5.0|After the innovative ideas presented in the original Matrix movie, the subsequent films failed in a disappointing manner to add any real intellectual content.  They were good as SCI-FI, but not ground-breaking like the original.  This film takes off where the Matrix left off, raising strong issues and ideas with respect to the nature of reality and dream-states.  It gets into the \\"dream within a dream\\" experience (a real experience) with authenticity and depth.  The experience of multiple personalities within dreams gets substantial treatment.  Even the physics of dreams, and Einstein's General Relativity (equivalence of gravity and acceleration, as detected by the inner ear) gets a wonderfully creative treatment.  I have a very good strip sound system, and the audio was great on this.  This is a film that will keep you thinking for a long time, with tremendous special effects, and very fine acting by a strong cast of major characters.  With three disks and a digital copy, this is quite a value.
B002SF9YUM|2.0|Based on the performances, this might have been a better movie if it had been all-Spanish rather than Spanish/English, both in language and production. In the four principal roles, the two Spanish actors (Javier Beltran as García Lorca and Marina Gatell as Magdalena) are good, but the two English actors (Robert Pattinson as Dalí and Matthew McNulty as Buñuel) are awful. Even I as a non-Spanish speaker could tell their accents were as phony as mine would be. Pattinson sounds like an American in the Twilight movies, but in this he just sounds English with a bad Spanish accent, and McNulty is no better.    Bad accents are forgivable if there's acting talent to make up for it, but there isn't in these cases. I never for one second believed in anything Pattinson said or did, particularly when he had to pretend to be attracted to Beltran; it was painfully incompetent acting. He should stick to imitating Marlon Brando with orange contacts and leave Spanish roles to the Spanish.    Since the Spanish actors were having to speak English dialog, their accents were pretty heavy too, so I needed subtitles, and if I'm going to be reading subtitles anyway I'd rather hear the right language in the soundtrack. This is one movie that should NOT have been an international production. That's a shame, because it's a fascinating story that could have been beautiful rather than tedious.    I expect I'll get plenty of negative votes from livid Pattinson fans, but there's nothing surprising about that.
B0033B5XCS|3.0|Before purchasing the Nightmare box set, I had seen all of the Nightmare movies except Freddy's Revenge (part 2).  I remember the feeling that I liked the movies, but I only remembered scenes from the original, Dream Warriors (part 3), and New Nightmare.  There's a reason that those are the only ones I remembered -- they were the only good ones.  Not unsurprisingly, I later found out, those are the only ones that Wes Craven was involved in.    Nightmare on Elm Street -- five stars  Nightmare on Elm Street was a truly original film which introduced us to one of the most unique, most feared, and scariest villains ever conceived.  By today's standards, this film can feel \\"campy\\" and silly, but I still think it's one of the best horror film I've ever seen.  On top of great writing and acting, it had the most important part of a true horror film -- suspense (something which is sadly lacking in the gore-fest films which are given the \\"horror\\" tag nowadays).  This film also had one of (if not the) best scores I've ever heard.  Charles Bernstein's score (especially the part which has become the Nightmare theme) was just as much an actor, and just as important, as any on-screen character.    Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge -- zero stars  Freddy's Revenge wasn't really a Nightmare movie at all.  Whoever wrote this film had obviously never seen the original Nightmare.  The plot (if this even has one) is not even remotely similar to Nightmare on Elm Street.  This was a disgrace to the Nightmare name, and is counted as one of my top-five worst films of all time (alongside Anything Else, Jason Goes to Hell, Me & the Mob, and When the Party's Over).  This film had bad writing, bad acting, and bad casting.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this film.    Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors -- five stars  Dream Warriors reintroduces us to the real Freddy and the real Nightmare world.  Personally, I think this film has the best characters in the Nightmare series.  Eachof the characters has their own unique personality (aside from the typical \\"Oh no, Freddy's out to get us\\"), and that makes each of them stand out and memorable even after 23 years (you may not remember their names, but you'll likely remember the characters).  This is also the film in which Freddy is given a much more comedic side to his personality which, in my opinion, is one of the things that makes Freddy unique (he's not just a killing machine like Jason or Michael).  Even though I think the storyline of the original film is better, this (Dream Warriors) is definitely my favorite film of the series because of the characters.    Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master -- three stars  The Dream Master was a fair film.  It certainly wasn't good, but it wasn't a truly bad film, either.  It did, however, have some serious flaws when viewed in the context of the Nightmare world -- things such as Alice gaining the \\"powers\\" of those who were killed, Alice seeing the dreams of others as they are killed, and the ridiculous way in which Freddy is killed at the end.  As its own movie, its rating may go as high as \\"good\\", but as a Nightmare movie, it's \\"fair\\" at best.    Nightmare on Elm Street 5: Dream Child -- zero stars  Dream Child was just bad (and not in a good way).  I don't know if the opening sex scene was thrust upon us to get people to watch (after all, \\"sex sells\\") or because they thought we would be too stupid to figure out how Alice got pregnant, but it felt too forced, like it didn't belong.  Then again, that's the feeling throughout the entire film.  Dream Child, like Dream Master, fails to fit into the Nightmare logic, preferring to define its own rules moment-by-moment as it goes along.  Perhaps the most ridiculous thing is that Alice keeps telling her friends that Freddy is real, but she never says that she fought him before or that he killed her last group of friends.  As such, there's really no reason for this new group to believe her.  Add to thatthe fact that the psychiatric hospital in which Amanda Krueger was raped is now abandoned (even though it was the hospital used in Dream Warriors, with that wing shut down).  The acting was decent, but the writing (thus the overall movie) was horrible.    Nightmare on Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead -- two stars  Freddy's Dead is another bad film.  It completely broke all of the Nightmare rules, deciding (like Dream Child) to make up the rules as it went along.  The worst example is at the end when they are supposedly in reality, but the 3D glasses Maggie is wearing are still in the dream state.  I really wanted to like this film because I think they had some great ideas (such as Freddy's motivation and personal history, not to mention the cameo of Alice Cooper), but the writing was just plain awful (for example, if Carlos was so pained by a pin dropping, because it was so loud, then why wasn't he equally pained by the blasts of steam, his own footsteps, or Freddy walking up behind him?).  If this film was released as a separate entity, not part of the Nightmare series, then it would have been a good film.  However, as part of the Nightmare series, it just didn't have what it takes.    Wes Craven's New Nightmare -- five stars  This is the one which truly brings it all home.  I don't think anything similar had been done before or since.  This was an amazingly original idea which was brilliantly executed.  Sure, there have been other films in which the characters are themselves actors in a film production, but New Nightmare brings it to a whole new level by having the actors play themselves and eliminating the line between the actors as real people and the actors as the characters they previously played (such as Heather/Nancy).  Personally, I loved the line said by Heather in the hospital, \\"Screw your pass\\", linking Heather the actress to Nancy the character.  I also thought the end was very fitting for Freddy.    New Nightmare brought back what was then (and is currently) missing in horror films -- the scare factor.  Starting around the time of its creation, and continuing through the past 15 years, horror films have let go of true horror and have gone strictly for gore.  Even in New Nightmare, Wes (in the commentary) said that New Line Cinema told him it didn't have enough gore, so he had to add some.  To me, horror is not about gore.  Gore is used to shock and disgust you; big deal, anybody can do that, it doesn't require creativity.  To scare you, on the other hand, is a true art.  Wes Craven was able to blend the suspense and the fear of the actors/characters to create a truly chilling film which is as true to the horror genre as it is unique.    All-in-all, the Nightmare series box set is sold at a great price, so I highly recommend it.  Nightmare on Elm Street, Dream Warriors, and New Nightmare are all excellent movies and are well worth the price of the set.

B001FB55I0|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Terminator series. The second movie being my personal favorite and also just my favorite movie of all time. 'Nuff said. That being said, it's hard for me to watch a Terminator and be... impartial I guess you could say cuz I love this series so damn much. That first Terminator movie was incredible and you were really hoping to see more of the incredible story unfold. After Judgment Day, I would always wonder what the hell happened to the movies?! At the very least, there were plenty of Terminator comics you could follow. I never actually read them cuz I was just a kid and had no idea of there existence until more recently... I've gotten side tracked... Uhhh I read Robocop vs Terminator though. That was awesome. OK back on track: Flash forward some 12 years I see a commercial for another Terminator movie. Well its about damn time. I saw it, thought it was dope few things coulda been done differently but I didn't care. The franchise had finally been revived. So all that side tracking and talking about movies and comics that have nothing to do with the rating of this movie brings me to... this movie. Terminator Salvation. As I was walking out of the theater, I thought it was an incredible movie and they did absolutely no wrong with it. We're finally seeing what we've been waiting to see since Kyle Reese talked about the future way back in the first movie. Now I gotta step back and attempt to impartiality. This is gonna be tough... OK visually; stunning. Bale as John Connor; I've heard it before and I agree. His stoic acting needed to go somewhere. Nothing against him as an actor cuz I enjoy the stuff he's done but I don't feel like he portrayed John Connor the way he should have. Also, its gotta be rough hiding that accent and trying to act a certain way so I'll just chalk it up to that. Ok, the story; Yeah, it was pretty weak.(Spoilers) Exactly what I mean by that is that the machines knowing of Kyle Reese's existence and even capturing him and not offing him that very second didn't make any sense. That would have been the end of everything right there. I have no beef with Marcus' character either. Considering all the changes that happened in the past, it makes sense for something new to emerge in this altered future. It's also cool cuz you have this guy who lost his humanity to Skynet and wants to take names because of it. I think that about covers it. Giving this movie 3 stars makes me feel dirty though. If it were possible to give it 3 and a half I wouldot offing him that very second didn't make any sense. That would have been the end of everything right there.

B003EYVXT6|3.0|I didn't see any ads etc for this so it was all new to me upon first (and rather likely last) viewing. Unlike most reviewers here, the alien sex scenes didn't bother me a bit, but merely confirmed how irredeemably goofy this flick is.<br /><br />In fact, I'd wager that we'll be seeing more human/alien sex scenes in the next few years, so you might want to acclimatize. We're getting more and more hints in the media that not only may there be life out there in the trillions of planets (gosh, what are the odds?!), but who knows? Maybe WE are already alien/simian hybrids! It would certainly offer one of the few viable explanations as to how we're the only species on earth that reliably destroys its environment over and over. Remember that speech by Mr. Smith in The Matrix about how humans are a cancer on this planet? He might be a lot too accurate.<br /><br />In any case, to me the alien sex scene was a whole lot less disturbing than what we see on the news every night. My tax dollars killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians...now THAT is truly disturbing. Whereas this movie is fiction. Our actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and elsewhere are not. It's fascinating how we've been conditioned to regard massive violence and military massacres as no problem, but we can't even see a pair of breasts on tv without freaking out about morality...even alien breasts that don't really exist.<br /><br />But beyond all that, Splice fails on so many fronts. The script misses endless chances to explore the ethics of interspecies gene splicing, the acting is weak at best (thought Sarah Polley had us hating her character pretty early on; she's very good at being annoying), and the pacing is mixed. Despite all that, we were entertained by it all, bad and good. It's shot pretty well, has a few amusing moments, and did hold our interest (even if it was just disbelief). Brody adds little, but Dren is quite entertaining...I like how she suddenly reveals whatever genetic accoutrements she needs, from wings to gills to a fully-loaded interstellar credit card (but only on the European dvd version).<br /><br />Dren was what made this worth sitting through, for me, and the concept raises enough questions and few enough answers to really make one ponder what is Right and what is Wrong...and if there even is such a dichotomy anymore. In fact, the best part for me was the ending (big spoilers coming); it makes perfect sense (and gets us sequel-ready) that the non-Heroine gets pregnant by an alien with her own dna...that's a near perfect metaphor for modern life! We're so far up our own butts we have no idea what's &#34;right&#34; any more, and you can bet that we'll be seeing interspecies slicing any day.<br /><br />In fact, it's almost a sure bet that the military is already doing it in their various black ops, and like I said it's also a fair bet that we are all carrying non-terrestrial dna around as well. We seem to give first use of all new tech to the military, so who knows how we'll first learn of it...a fake alien attack to promote a one-world government? Now there's a movie just waiting to be made. Or a &#34;reality&#34; already prepped for release..<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend Splice if you enjoy bouncing all sorts of concepts around in your head, and are willing to withstand weak acting and writing in exchange for the chance to ponder many imponderables. Because what was once imponderable is now quite within the realm of &#34;reality&#34;, and despite Splice's many failings, it raises plenty of thoughts worth thinking. The blu-ray has a good transfer, btw, and its detail shows how good the cgi on Dren was, at least.<br /><br />And to all you folks who were omg SO grossed out by the alien sex scene, let me ask you this: if you found out that the only way you could cure your child of a fatal disease was by someone, even you, having sex with an alien...might you not suddenly reconsider your moral stance? Stem cell research is but one step away from that, and one thing we've proven as a species is that when it all comes down to it, it ain't all for one and one for all, it's one for one. We're a mighty selfish bunch, and who knows what lines we'll cross to preserve our all-important personal dna...wherever it might be from.ne step away from that, and one thing we've proven as a species is that when it all comes down to it, it ain't all for one and one for all, it's one for one.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|When I was in High School (mid 90s) one of my science teachers handed out copies of Jurassic Park to everyone in class and would then quiz us on the parts we'd read. This is because, at least in the book, intermixed in all that genetic engineering and scary Velociraptors were also real solid science facts. Well that's sort of the way I feel about this book.    I don't know enough about other cultures or history to know which details are true and which (I assume some) are actually false. Was there ever actually an \\"Orange-84\\"? I have no idea and I haven't looked it up. I assume not. What about the \\"ping-pong navy\\"? Probably not. I'm almost positive the Russians probably put explosives on dogs and sent them running under tanks in World War II. There were perspectives of Palestinians and Israelis, Indians and Pakistanis, Iranians, Canadians, and those who happened to be on some remote Pacific Island. The part of me with some interest in anthropology just couldn't get enough of that. And each character seemed so real and believable.     I happened to start reading this book the same night I watched the season finale of TV's only zombie-oriented show: \\"The Walking Dead\\". I suppose the two universes could almost be connected in some way (but aren't as far as I know). I mean this book could easily be Walking Dead: 25 years later. In theory. I haven't read the original comic of Walking Dead so what do I know...    I really, really loved this book from beginning to end. I just couldn't put it down. Even though it is written in a context of having already happened the stories feel very real and there is still a lot of tension in the telling of it. It's really a series of short stories revolving around roughly the same events. Entire movies could be made from just one of these short stories. I heard they were making a World War Z movie and I hope they do it right. Like it's just a an adaption of this book released after the book and U.N. report and intended for the survivors of the the actual event. That would probably work and I think it would be cool that way...    The metaphors for zombies in general have been around forever and this one is no different: there's in environment stuff of course, the we're-all-in-it-together stuff, the survivor guilt, the finding out who you truly are as an individual as well as a society... Well I don't always catch all the metaphors but I know they're there.     I personally didn't find it that \\"scary\\". I guess because it was all past tense. I think it did have an effect on my sleeping patterns for a couple nights. Some the imagery (the exodus from India by see for instance) some how stuck with me. But line-to-line, if that makes sense, I never wanted to stop reading. If I could have I would have read the whole thing in one sitting.    I can't recommend this book more highly, even if you don't like or have any particular interest in zombies. It's as much about the \\"survivors\\" and the reactions of different parts of the world as anything else. And that's the true value of the book.

1591843162|5.0|There are many excellent reviews for this book already present, so I will not be repetitive but only give my slant on Godin's latest book. Seth Godin is a trendsetter. He identifies in society and in the culture what is new and what is impacting our society and our world. That is why it is important that you be aware of what he is saying.<br /><br />In this book Linchpin, he has correctly identified that there is a massive new trend taking place. This trend is rapidly transferring our society from the post industrial society where we are now. The next step is that we must become a new society of individual creative people who break away from the mindset that has been inflicted upon us.<br /><br />The cause of this mindset is an antiquated education system that seeks only to make the vast majority of us ready for work in factories. As such, we are paid the minimum amount possible that still ensures that we make a profit for those that own the means of production.<br /><br />There are several remarkable short statements in this book that will absolutely impact the way you think and look at things. Here is just a sampling:<br /><br />* To be remarkable, to be different, is to stand out, to make yourself<br />absolutely indispensible.<br /><br />* The ethic in America in the past, is to keep your head down, follow the boss's instructions, and make sure you show up on time, work hard and the usual suck it up.<br /><br />* The New American Dream is to become remarkable, to be generous, create art, and be able to make judgment calls, connect people, and engage.<br /><br />* We live in a corporate manufacturing mindset.<br /><br />* Things that you learn in frightening circumstances will stay with you forever. This is a concept that Godin calls STICKINESS.<br /><br />* The author believes that there are only two things that should be taught in school. The first is how to solve problems and the second is LEADERSHIP.<br /><br />* Lousy teachers cause damages that will last forever, and lousy teachers are DANGEROUS.<br /><br />* Depth of knowledge combined with good judgment is worth a lot.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />I urge you to take the time to read this book and make it yours. Underline it, write in the margins, and copy important thoughts on the blank pages in the back of the book. Godin's thinking is original. He is ahead of his time, and you want to capture the essence of what he is getting at. There are other books and seminal thinkers that touch on the same subjects, but this author seems to have a natural flair for making his work very interesting. He will both capture and redirect your attention. I promise you that you will not be disappointed, and thank you for reading this review.<br /><br />Richard C.

B000001EAQ|5.0|Since 1980, Dublin-based U2 has been a musical favorite - their singles have been number one hits on radio (well, most of them anyway!), and the four Irish guys, Bono, The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr., and Adam Clayton, are well-known for the historical tours, including \\"Elevation Tour\\" and \\"ZooTV\\".    In 1991, U2 was at a cross-roads. They could either follow the same formula that had worked so well on their past hits albums from the 80s \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" - an ambient stadium-rock sound with lyrics touching on war and peace, along with religion and things of that nature - or, they could try something new; innovative; experimental. And they chose the latter option - thus, \\"Achtung Baby\\" was born, and that began the trilogy of techno-influenced albums that was released by these guys in the 90s. The trilogy continued with \\"Zooropa\\" and ended with \\"Pop\\", the album I am reviewing now that just so happens to be my favorite of these guys' entire musical career.    You may be wondering why I would make such a statement. I know, I know. Most U2 fans claim \\"The Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\" as their favorite album; the definitive point of the gelling of these four musicians. And maybe they're right. Maybe before purchasing this album, in all of its darkness and questioning of God's faithfulness and power along with its odd musical tendencies, a new-comer to these guys should start with perhaps any of the albums I have mentioned in this review. But in my opinion, this album represents a truly magical and powerful moment in U2 history - one that shouldn't be taken lightly, nor should it be overlooked.    The disk starts out with first single \\"Discotheque\\", a dance-anthem that presents a rather puzzling riddle about love that settles in your brain before you even realize it. \\"Do You Feel Loved?\\", \\"Wake Up, Dead Man\\" and \\"Mofo\\" are my top three favorites from the album - these songs feature lyrics that speak on the challenges of celebrity (\\"Do You Feel Loved?\\"), hopelessness in this fallen world of which we live (\\"Wake Up, Dead Man\\"), and the loss of someone special in your life, a role model or such, and how it shapes us (\\"Mofo\\"). The latter song is easily the heaviest track here - it relies heavily on technology and Bono's remarkable falsetto that he unfortunately rarely uses these days - and...it works! It proves to be an album highlight, and sums up the whole idea of \\"Pop\\", as an album, in one single lyric - \\"Lookin' for the baby Jesus under the trash\\" - and maybe that's the point Bono and company was trying to get across thirteen years ago with this album. Everyone is human; everyone is selfish inside and we will hurt one another to get what we want. We cause our own problems - and we have to try and find baby Jesus under the rubble our lives become. Or it may have been about something else entirely - who knows? That's the beauty of U2's vast collection of albums: each one has no one certain interpretation to made of it.    So, long story short (too late.. *oops*), ignore all the anti-hype surrounding this album and check it out. It's well-worth it, and you will not be disappointed. (Just be sure to give it time to grow on you!)    Album highlights: \\"Mofo\\", \\"Wake Up, Dead Man\\", \\"Staring at the Sun\\", \\"Do You Feel Loved?\\"    PROS: An effective album from beginning to end questioning faith and God; in its stark honesty, we can all relate.  CONS: The occasional awkward lyric or experimentation turned sour; will offend most, if not all, conservative Christians.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Well I have had my Logitech G930 Wireless Headset ever since Christmas, 2010, now, and I am even more satisfied with it now than I was then. At first I bought the World Of Warcraft Wireless Headset, but I bought it blindly and just after I ordered it, I checked the user reviews on it. To my dismay, there were so many negative and very poor reviews given by very disatisfied people that purchased the WOW headset. I could not believe it, I had never read so many poor reviews on a single item than I read on the WOW headset. To my good frtune and blessing, it hadn't shiiped yet so I was able and managed to just cancel it. I rarely stray away from buying something based on user reviews. I actually like forming my own opinion on things. But with so many negative reviews, I took it this time as a balant warning Not to buy them. Anyway, then I decided to check Logitech and see if Logitech sold something similar. I wanted a very good wireless headset that was different from the rest, has extraordinary performance with everything; movies, music, videos: Everything. Upon reviewing the product and also seeing much better and way more positive upbeat reviews on the G930 vs the WOW wireless headset I originally ordered and cancelled, I decided to buy them, and I found them at Best Buy rather than having to of ordered them.  I have to say that now, after these passing months, I am still very satisfied with my Logitech G930 Wireless Headset. Unlike the WOW headset, the G930's is built with durability in mind. Whereas the WOW headset connects the two earpieces with a single flimsy piece of cheap plastic, the G930's connects them with a double metal band And a very sturdy plastic strap piece covering the metal bands for extra support. The sound quality of both the headset And the mic is sharp, crisp, and crystal clear.  The G930 wireless headset are based around a 7.1 surround sound system, and believe me, you can detect all 7.1 aspects of the headset.  The Only drawback isn't with the headset itself, but with the wireless USB adapter that comes with it. The USB adapter is made with a plastic that is too big and just glued together.  It is very easily broken if not careful.  This is a flaw with All of Logitech's wireless headsets it appears, as I have other different wireless headset models with the same USB adapter design. I don't understand why Logitech didn't/doesn't use a more solid, more sturdy or at least flexible rubbery plastic, and I also don't understand why Logitech just glued it together cheap-feeling and where it csn very easily be pulled apart or snap apart and break if banged slightly or dropped. Logitech should have thermoformed it, molded it, or rubber-welded the parts together. They would have produced a much more solid,  sturdy USB adapter had they of built it this way. Still though, that doesn't take away any positives at all about the actual quality of the wireless G930 headset. And as long as a person's careful with it, the headset and its parts will last them a very long time. Besides, both Best Buy And Logitech have been extremely wonderful and generous about replacing any of their wireless headsets that becomes defective via any way, Including and especially if the USB adapter breaks, No questions asked. Logitech is very aware (or should be) of this flaw, and they have no problem at all with even sending out brand new replacements for any defective headsets. They have proven themselves to me more than once, to be a top-notch company in every aspect of the way.  It is their professionalism, willingness to go above and beyond for their customers, and their high quality products, that I continue to buy and depend on Logitech products.  They are truly a cut way above the rest on computer and electronic parts, accessories, and knowledge. To sum this up, I still very much highly recommend the Logitech G930 wireless headset to anyone and everyone that's looking for a high quality stand-out wireless gaming headset. Believeme when I tell you that you will definitely Not be disappointed with either Logitech's high quality performance, durability of their accessories and parts, or their top-notch customer service and tech support!  Thanks for reading! Now give the Logitech G930 a chance! You will Not regret it!
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie was original, well-written, and well-acted.  The story was creative, fresh, and engrossing.  One of the best films I have seen in years.  I really don't understand the bad reviews on here.  I realize you cannot please everyone, but calling this movie \\"terrible\\" or saying that the experience of watching it was \\"nightmare\\" seems a bit extreme.  If you don't like something, that's cool.  I get that.  Say something like \\"I didn't like it, not my type of movie\\" or \\"the effects were cool, but I didn't think the story made sense\\" or \\"this movie wasn't what I expected, here is what I was looking for...\\"    Those types of comments can be helpful.  But saying the movie is shyte, or saying \\"I hate it\\" or \\"it sucks\\" is not very helpful.      I liked this movie because it was not like anything I have seen before.  I thought it was exciting and engaging, the story really pulled me in, and held me tight, never letting go until the credits rolled.  Lots of good action and effects, but the STORY and the acting is what separates this movie from other, lesser flicks.  The performances were fantastic, I am not a huge DiCaprio fan, but he has done some great work here.      I watched this movie with my mom (66 yrs old), and my cousin (18 yrs old), and I am 42.  We all loved it....if this movie can appeal to 3 different \\"generations\\" and both genders, they must be doing something right!    Great flick, great story, great acting, great effects, what else are you looking for?
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|The dvd was in excellant condition and on time. I will use this company again and recommand them to friends and family.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I have heard grumblings from hard-core AIC fans, but I really like this album. There is nothing in this CD that takes anything away from Layne, IMHO. The music is a transition to a new incarnation of AIC. My advice: buy this CD!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was doing this along with the treadmill on off days and it reshaped me vs doing just the treadmill.  Easy to follow workouts. Love it.
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|The item seemed to be a little bulky for my Kodak easy share 180 but ended up being exactly what I was looking for, not expensive in case it gets damaged through the usage, the construction is firm and the interior si really soft so the camera stays protected all the time! Great Purchase totally recommended if you have a medium/small camera!
B00433TO52|5.0|The language of Shakespeare is so beautiful, and I have always been a fan of it.  It has this magical ethereal quality that so awe inspiring and inspirational. So I was very excited to be able to get a complete collection for my Kindle. And when I read about these extra plays that I know nothing about, I was even more excited. I'm really enjoying reading my favorites and these news ones!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This is one of King's works during his best period.  He wrote long, involved, interesting books.  Sadly he decided later in his career that long was sufficient and he could skip the involved and interesting portions.  That being said this is classic King.  When I first read this book I literally could not put it down, much to the dismay of my family.  Even while cooking dinner I could be found with the book propped on the counter.  You have to pay attention as it does skip between times but it flows nicely. Definately a keeper of a book and now that I own a Kindle it was one of the first books I was willing to pay to have.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My son received this movie for a gift shortly after it came out on DVD, and it is a family favorite!  We have watched it countless times but it's one of those movies that the whole family will stop and watch rather than being one of the many videos that end up being played in the background!  I would definitely suggest this movie for any family, especially with toddlers +!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I look forward to the next season.  Now that I know this originated from a series of books, I am going to get them.  (I know the show is not the same, they never are)  But there is my 2 cents and 5 stars!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Buy it without any hesitation. I have watched this movie like 100 times on dvd, but when I watched it on this blu-ray version, I felt like I was watching a new movie. Some of the finer details I have missed on the regular dvd copy. Go for it. A++++++++++++
0321146530|5.0|Very practical and hands on. You can see a Test-Driven Development from the beginning with some iterations. You don't get the JUnit speech, but the mind setting required to embrace test-first development, with examples in Java and Python and, of course, using xUnit, but not depending on it. You'll also get some design patterns and a refactoring techiques. Must read.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|To keep it simple, Josh has a quirky and random personality.  I believe this album finally suits him.  He is truly a talented musician who could fit anyone's mold, but he chooses to experiment and never conform. Some tracks work, some do not, but I'm sure he loves every single one.<br /><br />If people stop buying his albums, he would join the theater...or a traveling circus...you just never know with him.  That's how he rolls and as a fellow nonconformist, I appreciate that.
B00472OBYI|5.0|I just got through reading Socialnomics. It only took me a week and a half, and it was a very fun, easy read. That's not to say that the book doesn't have its educational merit.    I will be taking a new position next month as a sales and marketing associate at a tech startup, and the majority of my efforts will be in social promotion (linkedin, twitter...) and I am all the more prepared today that I was last week.     Thanks Erik! Keep the books coming...
B003L77GRO|5.0|I have Showtime, and season 5 ended this past Sunday (Dec 12). This season really was great and each week was even better than the last week. I will try not to provide spoilers. Basically Dexter is moving out of the family home after Rita's death, but stumbles upon blood in a moving van that leads him to discover the \\"barrel girls\\".  He then goes on the hunt for the men responsible (along with an accomplice).  One of the men is a high powered motivational speaker (Jordan Chase) who is \\"psycho\\". Season 1 was my favorite until this season occured.  By far, this is the BEST season yet!! I can't wait to buy it for my personal collection.
1572814748|5.0|For years I have been using the Aquarian Tarot because I was turned off by the artwork on the original Rider Waite.  I do, however, like the symbolism of the original deck, which was very carefully worked out by Waite, and I would often refer to it in order to delve into the subtler meanings of the cards. Thus I am delighted by Mary Hanson-Roberts' reworking of Pamela Coleman Smith's original illustrations.  The Universal Waite cards are very beautiful, and all of the original symbolism has been preserved, as far as I can tell.  I got the pocket version because it is the perfect size for easy shuffling and portability.
0525951652|3.0|If I didn't know who the author was, I would never have contributed this novel to Ken Follett. The characters are just too shallow and contrived in the way they interact with the real historical figures. The farther I got in the book, the more disappointed I was. Definitely not up to Follett's usual standards.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|This is a great movie. Even as it was made in 1973 it is way ahead of it's time. Terminator before the actual movie.
B0038BBA4I|2.0|I was recommended this CD after I heard one of their songs in a store I was in.  I can't remember the name of the song at this time, but it was pretty upbeat & had a great variety of instruments you don't hear with to many bands.  The clerk who gave me the name of the band also allowed me to hear the song \\"Little Lion Man\\" as he said it was a big hit for them.  I have 2 issues with that song. First off the song is a complete rip-off of the song \\"Babylon\\" by David Gray, but it's also not that great of a song anyway. What makes it worse is, with all that said, it's still one of the better songs on the CD!  I give this band credit for attempting to be original sounding (if that's really possible anymore), but I don't have the patience to listen to 48mins of hum-drum music.  Every song just blends into the next!  This CD is background music & nothing more.  If you want to listen to a band who has a simliar sound but a better balance between the highs & the lows of the song writing check out the band Carbon Leaf.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This is a GREAT bundle to add to your movie collection for the Bourne Trilogy.  I enjoy watching it over again at home and it is nice to have all 3 to watch one after another.  The price is also GREAT for a blu ray bundle.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I caught one episode of Lark Rise to Candelford on PBS and I was interested to see it because I had been recommended this series from Amazon.  After seeing just one episode, I knew I was going to have to buy the complete first season.  I was hooked.  The story follows one young woman Laura Timmins as she leaves the small rural village community of Lark Rise and heads to the more bustling larger community of Candelford to work for her cousin Dorcus Lane who is the Post Mistress at the Post Office in Candelford.  Through these two characters we see some of the more pressing social issues of the day.  This series deals with everything from woman's issues, to better working conditions, liberal vs.conservative ideas. The main theme of the series is the growing upheaval of the rural communities going through a period of urban expansion. You can find almost any emotional issue in this series, from first love, unrequited love, and the power of friendship.   Julia Sawalha plays Dorcus Lane and I think she does a fantastic job in this series, she captures Miss Lane's spirit, fierce independence and warm heart.  Her performance is well worth watching.  If you enjoy period dramas, this is another excellent one by BBC and a great addition to an collection, I personally will be buying Season Two and Three and looking forward to devouring them.
074356619X|4.0|The secret is a world wide phenomenon, although I can't understand why. It's like \\"twilight\\" or the \\"Aragon\\" series. It just seems to be another unjustified cultural fad. So I'll add my two cents to the endless sea of people who have read this book. It's a good book and it's well written, and it definitely inspires you to take control of your reality. It's a classic self-empowerment book and it can help people realize that they are in control of their own destiny, but it in the end it's still lacking. This cult classic makes it seem like all you need to do is perform a mental exercise to make all your dreams come true. It's clearly focused on money, and so are the people involved with its production (just read about the lawsuits involved with it).If you want success in life then this book is a good place to start, but it's just a get rich quick product. The reality is that if you don't get off the couch then don't expect to see your giant mansion anytime soon. While I'm on a rant, one thing I thought was ironic about this book was the title itself. \\"The Secret\\" is the law of attraction which is one of the most widely written about topics in the self-empowerment world. It's not a secret that \\"they\\" don't want you to know, it's a concept that won't make you a dime until you put forth an effort. Bottom line: It's a good inspirational book, but it's not going to make you rich. If you take the ideas in this book and add the appropriate balance of hard work, then you can have anything you want.
B0043EV774|2.0|Not so great 3D, I have seen better, like Polar Express, was great. Also this movie is not for young children, it's scary all the way through. The 3D switches back and fort between 2D and 3D. I even took my glasses of to check and at times it was in 2D. I am disappointed with this movie coming from Disney.
B002XOTPU2|5.0|Simon's Cat is halarious. I think that Simon's cat deserves a book. The videos are halarious, the book is halarious, everything to do with Simon's Cat is halarious. Simon Tofield is a great illustrater and has done a good job with this book.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|Finally available on Blu Ray!  Some great features of deleted scenes, production notes, music notes and trivia about the real Von Trapp family.  The image quality is superbly crisp.
B004E9CFZG|3.0|...holes big enough in the plot and logic you can drive a truckload of zombies through.    1. If blood in the eyes/cuts, etc. can turn you, why does the goofball with the crossbow continue to wipe arrows (target arrows by the way) off on his pants time and time again? And why does the sister continue to hold her dead, BLOODY, sister, with blood all over her face, arms and clothing? Is she immune?    2. If they need transportation, why not grab one or two of the thousands stranded on the roadways? Are they price-shopping for a better deal?    3. Why do they have to be in or near Atlanta? Why not move away, far into the country, away from once populated areas? Or maybe Barstow...nobody goes there unless they have to.    4. Why did the other doofus cut off his hand instead of cutting through the rusted pipe he was cuffed to? (Then again, he isn't exactly a brain surgeon.)    5. Etc.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This weekend is the 64th anniversary of that great old film, It's a Wonderful Life.  I found that this weekend is also the It's a Wonderful Life festival at Seneca Falls, NY, which claims it was the inspiration for Bedford Falls (see their site here: [...], which also includes an appearance by Karolyn Grimes, who was the character Zuzu and her pedals).<br /><br />But what a story!  I'm sure most readers know this story and the DVD I picked up had a lot of interesting extras and \\"making of\\" that was fascinating.<br /><br />The film is a slice of Americana, taking us from the Roaring 20s to the post-war era of the mid 1940s.  Featured is George  Bailey, the son of a small town building and loan president, whose kind heart and common sense had kept the town running for years.<br /><br />On the other side of the spectrum is old Potter, a miserly miser that makes Scrooge look generous by comparison.<br /><br />The story's general plot goes through George's life through the eyes of an angel, a little guy who wants to earn his wings.  He watched with the viewer as George grows up:  George prevents several deaths, gets the town through a run on the bank during the '29 Depression and gets through the war.  He has kids and runs a successful business that is booming.<br /><br />Despite these successes, his uncle loses money that was accidentally given to the Potter miser.  Potter looks at this as an opportunity to finally beat George.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart's acting ability was amazing in this film.  His range from pure happiness to deep despair was palpable.  Despite his personal sacrifices to give up his dreams for the benefit of others, George Bailey was finally at the end of his rope.  Stewart's performance as a broken man on that bridge was just an amazing piece of cinema.<br /><br />No Man Is a Failure Who Has Friends:<br /><br />Many themes in this film too many to mention, really.  There is a reason why this film has endured as a Christmas treat.  It is deep and philosophical without being preachy.  It has a dark side that cuts across the aisle of greed and despair, of heartache, and of suicidal tendencies.  The film raises you up and makes you think.<br /><br />What if you had never been born?  What hole would be hard to fill without your contribution to people around you and to Man as a species?  Would lives have been better off if you had never existed?<br /><br />DVD Specials:<br /><br />I enjoyed the bits with Frank Capra's son as he went over his father's inspiration for the film.  They showed a clip from an interview with Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra himself.  It's Capra's favorite film.<br /><br />The DVD also has a brief spot with Tom Bosley who again goes over similar ground to the bit on the \\"making of\\" segment, but adds some film history.  It's a Wonderful Life was not a hit at the box office at its release.  In fact, viewers thought it too depressing for the holiday season (which I find simply unbelievable).<br /><br />When the film fell into the public domain, it was shown on TV in the 70s and there was a revival for it.  Now we have Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) touring the country pushing the film.  Karolyn has an endearing and powerful personal story herself, which I wish was part of the DVD set.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  An enduring, heartwrenching film (for me, anyway) that nearly always makes me cry as well as makes me look at my life.  Would it had been better I'd never been born?  For George Bailey the answer is a resounding no!that cuts across the aisle of greed and despair, of heartache, and of suicidal tendencies.

0802473156|5.0|Our pastor gave us this book when we got married, but I never read it because talking and communicating is not a problem for me.  What I didn't realize is that not everyone communicates in the same way, and, more importantly, that talking to my spouse did not have the same affect on him as it did to me.  Who knew we all interpret love differently?  I didn't realize how different people really were.  Now that I understand my husband's love language, our marriage has never been better!!
B002ZG99N6|1.0|Ben Aflick, first of all, cannot act or direct. Secondly, this is a poor rip off of a better film, Heat.    Get \\"The American,\\" it has integrity.
B0015D3YQI|4.0|This movie will not appeal to most casual, modern movie fans, lacks the technology for believable CGI effects that most younger audiences would eb accustomed to and the thing I noticed most was that Argento seemed to be obsessed with having women's heads go through broken glass. (Yes, it was to an excessive extent, in my opinion).<br /><br />However, as a collector of Connelly's works, this is a must have! If you like classic horror and films that do actually have storylines and can ignore the more primitive effects such as swarms of insects painted directly onto the film media, you will want to get your hands on this rare find before it ends up being completely unavailable! The commentary even mentions that this was the film in which Connelly had an accident that required surgicly reattaching one of her fingers. If you want to find out the details, you'll have to get this and watch the commentary carefully.<br /><br />Like Knut Kristiansen mentioned in a review above, I too am still wishing Opera and some others will someday be re-released (as well as the unrelated \\"Seven Minutes in Heaven\\" featuring Connelly, but only available on VHS and possibly degraded from age of the magnetic media).
044654759X|4.0|After some experiences I have heard of this year with some of my classmates in college, this book made it all seem more real. It's a book about how it can be difficult to leave behind a past life in order to have a new future. The chapters switch back and forth from perspectives of different characters, even the one in her past life. It's definitely another great one from Nicholas Sparks-maybe not the best, but still emotionally moving. Read it!
B002ZG981E|1.0|The movie wasn't bad but had terrible dirty language in a couple of spots so it's not family friendly. I would be embarrased to show this movie to anybody. That foul mouthed Leonardo DiCaprio should be ashamed of himself!<br />Although it says the package contains Blu-ray, DVD and digital copies in the 3 disc set there is no digital copy, the 3rd disc is just some special features. Amazon seems to think you can download the movie from the DVD but there is nothing on the DVD but the movie in DVD format, no digital copy and no menu to download it. The instructions in the package say to go to wbdigitalcopy dot com slash inception where it asks for some personal information and has a Download From iTunes button at the bottom but all it does is take you to an Apple site to download the iTunes program itself, there are no instructions and no way to get the movie copy except to buy it from iTunes.<br /><br />After a half dozen emails back and forth with Amazon tech support where they kept insisting the digital copy should be on the DVD no matter what WB says they decided to send me a second copy of the disc because the first one must be defective. However, I get the feeling they don't have a blu-ray disc in India and don't know<br />what a digital copy is. Also I found the contact info. for WB and emailed them about it and they said I needed to use the WB Digital Copy Manager and I have to have Adobe Flash and Adobe Air installed to use it but I have no idea why. So now I have 3 different opinions on how to get the digital copy but none of them work.<br />This is what WB said:<br />Hello,<br />Sorry for the technical difficulties.

0783229372|2.0|If you're expecting a (real-life based) disaster movie full of thrills and suspense, forget it. This pic is a great big lead balloon. Directed by Robert Wise (\\"The Sound of Music\\". \\"West Side Story\\", \\"I Want to Live\\") we could have hoped for more. Someone should chop off the screenwriter's hand as this is deadeningly boring. Even the great George C. Scott and Anne Bancroft cannot breathe life into soap opera cardboard cutout characters, desite ther talent and charisma. A wonderful supporting cast including the always excellent Burgess Meredith and also William Atherton, Richard Dysart and others make little impression in thankless roles. This interminable turkey would have been better if the dirigible had burst into flames during the opening credits, along with the script.
1439107955|5.0|Since my diagnoses four years ago with melanoma and three years ago with metastatic lobular breast cancer, I have struggled to understand and proactively and aggressively fight these diseases. \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" has provided more insight into the medical and scientific establishment than anything else I've found. It has also given me a much sounder basis to understand what has happened to me. I am normally a very optimistic and rational person. This book has shored up my optimism and provided much grist for the rational in me. I will always be grateful to Dr. Mukherjee for providing perspective and understanding. One can read this book as a scientist (I was originally a research biochemist), a patient, or an interested bystander. It offers a great deal for each of us.
B0043EV774|4.0|I did not even buy the movie from amazon but wanted to write a review because no one has yet.  This movie was one of the better 3d flixs  i have watched on my 3dtv.  3d worked great no ghosting, and almost no break down in the 3d image.  I was nervous about future 3d movie releases after i received how to train your dragon from samsung.  The dragon movie was great in theaters, but horrible on 3dtv, it was not full screen (this completely ruins the 3d quality), and the 3d broke down continuously, unwatchable! This was not the case with Alice. Full screen, and almost no break down. Even though it was not filmed in 3d it still gave great sense of depth at home.  If you own a 3dtv i def recommend you add this to the small list of 3d movies to buy. PLus its pretty cheap for a 4 disc combo. I only gave it 4 stars because i reserve 5 stars for the completely flawless(story,3d, ect. Avatar if ever released in 3d, and if it does not have a single split second of 3d break down will get 5 from me)
B00005NRN9|2.0|Until I purchased a packet of two Cirque du Soleil DVDs, I had only seen it on television. Since I was always impressed by the professionalism, beauty and originality of their productions, I was really disappointed with this DVD. When I got home and read that it was only thirty some minutes long, I thought I had misread it and read it again. In my opinion, the show was also very boring in spots, especially the underwater ballet. The acrobats were fantastic and I was sorry to see their act end.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Chris Nolan is -step by step- the most innovator, defying and risky of the actual generation of North American filmmakers. This audacious project seems to confirm it .<br /><br />Sleep is unquestionably a \\"dangerous\\" condition, from the biological perspective; it's to say a Box of Pandora who suddenly may be waken up, switching off the array of defense mechanisms, exposing it with all its fragile vulnerability in order to be shaped or forged.<br /><br />Dom Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio in lifetime role until this date) is a specialist in what concerns to permeate the frontiers of the subconscious and so, being capable to steal ideas of other people during the dream state; he seems to be a perfect target to undertake a most hazardous mission. To plaint an idea rather than steal it. This bold plan will allow him to recover part of his missing existence. But at the meantime he will have to face other big challenges of the enemy in this puzzling game of interests and strategies all the way through.<br /><br />The film carves in relief and brings us back the old romantic notion of the imagination and two worlds, night world and day world. And so, the psyche is the basic pillar of the whole drama. The psyche is far to be what supposedly we mean by unconscious. The psyche -in its perpetual evolution- makes intelligible statements being able to erect new hidden connections, unthinkable projects, dreams, moods, desirable worlds or unbearable environments. I cannot stop to think in the famous short tale of Jorge Luis Borges titled \\"The memory of Shakespeare\\" in which the owner of this gift has a crown of thorns in his head and only can be saved when other people asks him why he has this arrange crown. Once you have asked this question, the crown goes to your head and you will have to wait for weeks, months or centuries for other who asks you the same and finally it releases you from this torment.<br /><br />When Napoleon defined the death as a dream without dream, he was conscious or unconsciously, pointing to the core of the question. The different layers of reality in what we move, the levels of relative sanity or insanity in what we live, the powerful contradictions of  terms such passion, caprice, firm determination or relentless attitude in pursuit of something or someone, depend in last instance, of every one of us; this implies a subjective matter, obscured by the jungle of the prefixed concepts that have nothing to do with our surrounding reality. The more intelligent you are, the more you are near of leave behind what many people may regard as impossible at a first sight. When Balzac stated the bravery was just an habile calculus about the fear that struggled our adversary, one can infer the will as the main vector of our live may surmount obstacles of any sort, and so, for many this defying and even irreverent attitude may be associated with a state of dementia.<br /><br />Nolan takes advantage of this script and exposes several lines of behavior around the chaser and victim and shows us they are not so distant like it seemed at fist sight.<br /><br />It would be convenient not forget that this fascinating issue had previously explored by Rene Clair in The beauties of the night, Bu&ntilde;uel in the Exterminator Angel,  La Jete by Chris Maker, Dodes-Kaden by Kurosawa, Gilliam in Brazil and Twelve monkeys, David Lynch in Mulholland Drive.<br /><br />Complex, dynamical, imaginative and fascinating film that I wouldn't hesitate as the best script in years.<br /><br />A must-see.nting to the core of the question.

0385341008|5.0|Long on my TBR (to be read) pile, THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY had so many intriguing factors in its favor that I could not put it off any longer. Firstly, I cannot tell you how many of my customers come in searching for this novel even two years after publication. It was on the bestseller list for over a year and is a book group favorite. Secondly, it takes place during and after WWII, one of my favorite historical periods. And thirdly, it is filled with literary references. The puzzling bit is that it is written in epistolary format!<br /><br />\\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books.\\" Isola Pribby, page 53<br /><br />Yes, an entire novel written as a collection of letters. A very popular style in the mid seventeenth-century, the epistolary novel was utilized by the venerable Samuel Richardson, no less, in his bestselling novels PAMELA (1740) and CLARISSA (1749). This format has its challenges - like characters not being able to interface with each other directly and react in the moment. Jane Austen discovered this dilemma after writing LADY SUSAN in 1795, and the first drafts of ELINOR AND MARIANNE (later SENSE AND SENSIBILITY) and FIRST IMPRESSIONS (later PRIDE AND PREJUDICE). The latter two were rewritten into the third-person omniscient style that she is now famous for. LADY SUSAN remains unchanged, and for those who have read it, it is quite charming but not as accessible to modern readers as her later works. I was very curious to see how co-authors Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows could pull off a novel written in letters and why readers were clamoring to buy it.<br /><br />\\"Sophie - what is the matter with me? Am I too particular? I don't want to be married just to be married. I can't think of anything lonelier than spending the rest of my life with someone I can't talk to, or worse, someone I can't be silent with.\\" Juliet Ashton, page 8<br /><br />In 1946 post war England, our heroine and unmarried thirty-something Juliet Ashton is ready to move on from her comedic war-time newspaper column to more serious fare. Interested in writing a novel, she is searching for the inspiration for a new story. Living in bombed out London she has few personal connections that are still alive. Her parents and brother are dead, and besides her agent Sidney and his sister Sophie, she has few friends and only one suitor, the \\"great catch,\\" the wealthy and imposing American publishing heir Markham V. Reynolds, Jr. who woos a woman who has lived for five years on war ratios with champagne, lobster and dancing at the Savoy. Heady stuff.<br /><br />\\"I wonder how the book got to Guernsey. Perhaps there is some secret sort of homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers. How delightful if that were true.\\" From Dawsey Adams, page 10<br /><br />Juliet is pleasantly surprised to receive a letter from one of her readers, Dawsey Adams, a farmer on Guernsey Island who is now the owner of a used book by Charles Lamb with her name inscribed on the flyleaf. They strike up a correspondence and she learns about his co-founding of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, an ad hock group first formed by residents to fool the Nazi's into allowing after curfew movements during the German occupation of the island. Later, the book group would become the axis in their lives; both for fellowship and intellectual nourishment; building friendships and, changing perspectives. She was intrigued by his descriptions of the society's eccentric members and activities and welcomes correspondence from them. What unfolds is a truly remarkable tale. As the society members retell firsthand accounts of their challenges and tragedies during their islands Nazi occupation, Juliet is drawn into their stories and feels that it would make a great subject for her next book. Her eventual visit to the island will change her life forever.<br /><br />\\"We clung to books and to our friends; they reminded us that we hadanother part to us.\\" Eben Ramsey, page 64<br /><br />At times the epistolary format from twenty different voices had its limitations, but the authors overcome the challenge of characters not being able to talk to each other in real-time by supplying detailed accounts and engaging stories with humorous undertones. The narrative is primarily told through the viewpoint of Juliet, but the heart of the story is Guernsey resident twenty-something Elizabeth McKenna, co-founder of the Literary Society and later prisoner of war in Germany. Many of the anecdotal reminiscences told by the residents circle back to Elizabeth's life, her brave heroism during their horrendous occupation and how her fellowhip and honor affected her friends, residents and concentration camp inmates.<br /><br />\\"After all, what's good enough for Austen ought to be good enough for anyone.\\" Juliet Ashton, page 274<br /><br />The ongoing glimmer of hope of romance for our heroine Juliet kept me intrigued, like a cat watching a mouse, but it was not the main focus of this novel and I found its d&eacute;nouement predictable and mildly satisfying. The tragedy, and this is a war-time tale with some troubling and gruesome bits, is offset by occasional humor, the joy of literature as a tonic especially during the worst of times, and the resilience of the human spirit. As many classic authors are mentioned and discussed: Lamb, Dickens, Bronte, Chaucer, Shakespeare and Wilde, I was quite pleased that Jane Austen, my favorite author, was given her due deference and place of honor as the final to be discussed and her philosophies entrenched on the last page. THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY was a delightful exploration of strength, compassion, enduring friendships, and the irrepressible spirit of the British people during WWII. I enjoyed it greatly.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenprosee epistolary format from twenty different voices had its limitations, but the authors overcome the challenge of characters not being able to talk to each other in real-time by supplying detailed accounts and engaging stories with humorous undertones.

B0000009SY|5.0|Frank Zappa is a lot of peoples favorite artist as well as heroic with as many albums as he has released.
B003TXKSWK|2.0|This album was a disappointment on two fronts -- the song selection and the arrangements.  When I looked at the songs peformed I was a bit puzzled; but, since I've heard so much about The Roots and John Legend, I thought the arrangements would bring out something special.  While Mr. Legend has his own reasons for picking the songs he did, I couldn't help thinking of better substitutes for the songs included here as I listened through the album.  What about something from Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Happening\\" like \\"Flying High in the Friendly Sky\\"?  How about a Curtis Mayfield tune like \\"Freddie's Dead\\" or \\"Thin Line\\"?  And, as far as political messages go, a Gil Scott-Heron song like \\"Gun\\" or \\"Pieces of a Man\\" would have been nice.  Since the band on this album is supposed to be top-notch, why not include a Mingus song or let the band stretch out and include an instrumental like Coltrane's \\"Alabama\\" or an Art Blakey burner like \\"Free for All\\" or \\"Freedom Rider.\\"  Of course, there are so many great Soul and R&B tunes from the era covered, it's hard to pick just a handful to record but I think William Parker's tribute to Curtis Mayfield \\"Inside the Songs of Curtis Mayfield\\" is the real deal that Mr. Legend may have been striving for.

0143113100|5.0|This was one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. So much so, that I bought several copies and shared them with others, who afterward felt as compelled to discuss this book as I did--one even suggested the formation of a book-group to discuss it. Compelling real life stories!     The human brain is still such a mystery in many ways, and as such so are humans, but there is so much hope as we learn more and more about the brain and its function.  While some of the stories are disturbing, they provide understanding if not hope as well.     Honestly, this is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Why five stars?  Because of the pure joy this album has given me since I first started listening to it a couple of weeks ago.  I was in a Barnes and Noble the weekend before Thanksgiving, checking out some sales, surrounded by swirling Christmas shoppers, and then the music started . . .  It was \\"good\\" Christmas music, by some notable artist or group that hit every note exactly right and sang each song exactly in the spirit traditionally intended.  But suddenly the room started spinning and I knew I had to get out.  By the time I got home, I told my wife I was through shopping this Christmas (I hadn't even started).  I was desperate for an antidote, something to pull me out of the seasonal doldrums.  What could there be out there?  Then it hit me: what about that Dylan Christmas album that so many people disparaged last year?  Surely he would have a different take on things, right?  He certainly doesn't disappoint in that regard.    For starters, he sends visual clues before you even play the album.  The front is pure, secular Americana.  The back is very traditionally religious.  And then you open it, and, well . . . if that isn't Betty Page in the most tastefully seductive Christmas outfit I've seen in a long time!  So what's on the album musically?  Traditional secular songs, traditional religious songs, and some things that are just plain fun.    Then there's the sound.  I honestly don't get people complaining about his voice.  This is Bob Dylan, after all.  Were they really expecting him to suddenly sound like Nat King Cole?  (I've tried to imagine how the conversation went at home:  \\"Honey?  I bought the new Dylan Christmas album.  Guess what?  He still sounds like Dylan!  Damn!\\")    He was nearly 70 years old when he recorded this.  He's been straining those vocal chords publicly for over 50 years now.  Why in the world would you expect anything different?  For whatever reason, at this point in his life, he decided to record a Christmas album.  Is it possiblethat this is exactly what the title proclaims--his expression of the varieties of what Christmas means to him, from his heart?  Personally, I find some of these to be the most genuinely heartfelt renditions I have ever heard, precisely because they come from Bob Dylan.  (One reviewer said that if this was recorded by some nobody named \\"Bob Smith,\\" we wouldn't care and would agree that this is a \\"terrible\\" album.  To which I ask, \\"What's your point?\\"  Objectively speaking, how \\"good\\" musically are Johnny Cash's final albums?  But those of us who loved his music over the years love those last offerings as well especially because we know he was singing from the heart and soul more than from whatever was left of his voice.)    Maybe I have always been more tolerant of Dylan's voice because of other voices I have loved, especially among the blues artists he admires so much.  Listen to Son House, Reverend Gary Davis, Skip James, Robert Pete Williams, etc.  Their voices aren't immediately accessible in the usual sense.  They don't always hit the right notes, and it's often hard to understand them.  But as you do come to understand them, both their music and their words, you discover a depth and an authenticity that far exceeds that of supposedly more accomplished artists.  Which is why they, like Dylan, have been so influential on musicians more agreeable to the ears of the general public.    As I write this, 151 people have given this album 5 stars, 110 have given it 1 star.  About 100 other people are scattered evenly through the other ratings.  Can you imagine anyone other than Bob Dylan so polarizing music fans?    So what's the bottom line?  If you like Bob Dylan, the most important thing I want to impress upon you is that you owe it to yourself to give it a sympathetic listen before dismissing it.  (Listen carefully for the interesting, often subtle, twists he gives to some of the lyrics.)  You may in fact find it to be as horrible as some have delighted in writing.Then again, you may find it a wondrous relief in the midst of another miserable Christmas season.  Remember: Dylan has been angering/disappointing/annoying people for almost 50 years.  And the odd thing has been that the people he has irritated the most have often been those who proclaim themselves to be his fans. (Notice how many of the 1 star critics attempt to establish their street cred before ripping away.  And remember how often his fans have been the bane of his existence.)    The common theme through the years is that whenever he has dared to do something different, something he himself liked for whatever reason, many of his supposed fans, instead of honoring his right as an artist to grow, change, and explore (whether it be going electric, turning religious, exploring country music, or whatever), have felt the right, indeed the need, to pronounce profound and absolute judgment.  How many times does this man have to hear someone yell, \\"Judas!\\"?        Instead, I say, Merry Christmas, Mr. Dylan, and thank you.  God bless us everyone. (Amen.)

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|If you're into music and love a good story line, this is a great movie to watch.  I remembered seeing it years ago with a few musicians and wanted it for my collection back then.  A quick search at Amazon.com and voila! There it was.  And the price was AMAZING too. I couldn't wait to see it again once I received my order. The down-home blues, classic guitar riffs, actors and Steve Vai all made this movie what it was (and still is).  A must-see for all!

B001AQO3XS|4.0|I am a huge fan of this movie. I have it on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, and now Blu-ray.  I have the regular and extended cuts.  I essentially have seen just about every version and quality they have.  The only version that I wish they had made was an HD-DVD version.  I have several upconverting DVD players(one being my HD-DVD player), and 3 blu-ray players.  I also have plasma and LCD tvs to compare on.  At this point, I will say on my plasma I give the blu-ray a nod as far as being a bit superior to the upconvert DVD, but on my lcd tvs it really is splitting hairs.  The film still has quite a bit of grain to it, and the edges seem to be a bit blurred, but as a fan of the film its a version I must have.  You can only do so much to 23 year old film.  At least it won't break the bank getting the blu-ray version.
0385339585|4.0|I was introduced to my first Grisham novel, The Client, in 8th grade.  At that point I realized how much books are like a movie in the mind.  Years after the client, I read Bleachers.    Finally came the Testament, and it has been the most superlative of Grisham's books I have read thus far.        If you are familiar with Grisham's books, you will know that they correlate with the lawyer lifestyle.  So yes, the testament does have lawyer décor, but it has an outstanding plot.  Without spoiling the climax; a terminally ill father is delivering a will to his \\"ungrateful\\" adult children.  Somewhere in the dust there is a distance daughter doing missionary work, and money is her last concern.  To top that off, a former alcoholic and drug addict is sent to find her and deliver news any person would die to hear.         In a society that is so focused on money, and impression, this realistic novel gives a nice dose of reality.  How much does wealth mean to you?  If you were to receive a large sum of money, would you take it?  Read Grisham's novel, and then reflect on where you stand towards its core themes:  Money, family, and trust.  Your perspective will change for the better.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Sounds great, range is excellent and quality of the headset is super, but nonetheless i will have to be returning it to amazon. The wireless USB device disconnects maybe once an hour for about 6 seconds and then reconnects itself, I've also noticed that since I have been using this headset it seems to interfere with my Laptops wireless internet connection causing random drop outs of the internet which in then I have to disconnect the USB receiver and reconnect it only to have the drop outs and disconnects happen again at a later time.  The headset is really good and like i said it sounds awesome, but little issues like the one im having shouldn't be happening in a $130+ headset.  If your skeptical I would say try the wired version before the wireless. I will be now ordering the Steel series 7H USB Headset and hopefully it sounds just as good as these did.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|I can not say it is boring, but I had a hard time to finish watching it. Lots of meaningless actions, gun fights packed to the eyeballs, \\"mind bending\\" talking about what nobody including actors understands. Comparison to \\"Matrix\\" or \\"Memento\\" is just laughable.  Plot is ridiculously complicated in a bad way and poorly executed.     Center piece dream design is underdeveloped. Heck, it's not even tried! It feels like any freshman from \\"Mind Bending Academy\\" is genius enough to do the job somehow. Yeah, there is a silver case with a big button and some sort of tubes to connect to the dreams, yet dream is full of other peoples, which is explained via sub conscience.    For some strange reasons beyond me sub conscience is a bitch: always aggressive and ultra violent, military trained and is using firepower without hesitations. No guns? Fear not, it can still tear you apart with bare hands, just like dead men in \\"Resident evil\\" or hivers in \\"I am a Legend\\". Which is good - if you are dead, you awake.    The whole idea to plant the idea is secondary. First things first, ACTION! It's non-stop, it's 24/7 without any reason and regrets. Who cares why? As long as it blasts, shoots, burns, cuts, hits, kills, tears, drives, drowns, climbs, flies - it's good    Stupendous action reaches its peak in the best Bond-like tradition when heroes are storming fortress in the remote snow covered mountain region. So they ski, they shoot, they climb, etc. Throw in Aston Martin, shaken martini and famous \\"my name is Bond, James Bond\\" and it could be easily disguised.    There is no logic anywhere. Events are disconnected. Ex-wife factor is overdone and happy end with kids is unexplainable: why would they jump to unknown alien who says he is the father? Yet there he is with eyes and tears. This movie may work for someone who likes shooting, but why so many emotions then?    Movie has a couple of fresh ideas, like recursive dreaming, 12x time stretching factor when you re-enter (although 12xis obviously not enough, it should have been 100-1000 times judging by the length of the movie and time needed for the van to reach the water in the free fall from the bridge). So I stretched too and gave 2 stars, but overall I do not agree with positive reviews here and almost regret my promotional $5 spent towards renting this movie.    The good thing I did not spend real money on it. I do not want to watch it second time even for free, never mind buying the disc.
B002ZG9940|5.0|How can anyone review what you like???? Only you know if you like it!!!  Movie critics give you there thoughts and who cares what they think, after all you are the one paying and watching the movie.!!
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is easily one of the best movies ever made. I honestly don't know how they were able to make a movie so funny, touching, and powerful all at the same time. I love every aspect of it.
0307455874|4.0|This book has so many great characteristics to it. It has honesty, compassion, political views, values, family, passion, religion, and simple straight talk. I actually listened to this book as I drove to work and back and really enjoyed the face the Mr. Obama read it himself. He brings a sense of natural humanistic tone to his words and a sense of honesty. I believe if you are an Obama support, independent, democratic, or republican, you will find something in the this book that can connect with your life.
B000005RR0|3.0|Good compilation of Stones tunes, but from song to song the quality of the recording is quite variable.  Not to mention that some tracks are in mono, not stereo.  If you are looking for a historical compilation of Stones tunes, then this is worth having, but you will not be listening to the disc on a frequent basis.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I pre-ordered this dvd in October. It was released on 12/3. It is now 12/13 and I still do not have it yet. I am furious. I could have bought it at Walmart on 12/4. I will never pre-order a anything from Amazon again!
B001GCUO5W|4.0|I read the book first, i actually read it twice before seeing the movie. Obviously the book is better.  The book and the movie have the same exact plot, but when you read the words instead of actually watching actions unfold on the screen, it's easier to believe the twist. I don't know why that is but i think people see it so they view it as real. Whereas when you are reading it you have more of an imagination. I knew what was going to happen but i still enjoyed watching the movie. People just get soo caught up in the ending, how would you of liked it to end? I'm sure if it was ended a different way it would still be \\"cliche\\", \\"predictable\\" or \\"confusing\\".
B002436WJE|1.0|Even with the understanding any movie like this is going to formulaic, this one is pretty weak.   Liam Neeson tries to breath a little life into this one, but there isn't much really connected with the story to make the story interesting, and the supporting characters are very limited in their performances.     I understand you don't look to movies like this for realism, but it's hard to believe that the French authorities wouldn't have some interest in taking action if a couple of American teenagers had been kidnapped.     I didn't watch it to the end because I didn't care.
1594488843|5.0|This is a not a book it is a manual on how to get on with your life and help others as well.  I have been recommending it to all of my friends.  It has a tool kit at the end to help figure out how to apply it to business, school, your kids and losing weight.  Wonderful.
B002JCSRKC|1.0|These boots are very cute, but unfortunately the fit is very uncomfortable.  They are so rigid and don't bend at all.  It is very difficult to walk in them.
B00406UK7S|5.0|I'd never heard of this movie until my cousin rented it, and wasn't really expecting much from it, but I liked it so much I went out and bought it the next day. The scenery alone is just... beyond words. It's so beautiful. I'd never heard of Michael Fassbender before, but he really carried this movie. Not to say the other actors weren't spot-on as well, because I don't remember a bad acting job in the whole movie, but he definitely has a leading presence and it's understandable that he becomes the de facto leader of the small band of survivors. I did have to look away at certain parts because of the blood, but I'm a bit squeamish about that. I really enjoyed the little bit of romance that was in it, as well. I actually wouldn't have minded a bit more. What can I say? I'm a girl.
0452295548|4.0|Having a stroke must be hard enough for anyone. It must be that much harder to be a Harvard-trained brain scientist having a stroke, knowing what is happening to your brain as it happens.    In December 1996, the author woke one morning knowing that something was very wrong with her. Within four hours, the left hemisphere of her brain had deteriorated to the point where she could no longer read, write, talk or understand what those squiggles were on her telephone keypad. While her logical left brain was shutting down (she was able to get help in time), her intuitive right brain gave her a feeling of total peace and being at one with the universe (not necessarily a bad thing). Taylor is able to give an almost blow-by-blow description as her brain shut down. For instance, when she loses the ability to speak, that means that a spot called Broca's Area is affected.    Taylor's type of stroke was called an arteriovenous malformation, an abnormal arterial configuration. Even though it's a rare type of stroke, it's the most common type of stroke for younger sufferers (Taylor was 37 years old when she suffered her stroke). After several days in the hospital, she was sent home with her mother, who had come to help nurse her back to health. The plan was to get her as well, and as strong, as possible, because the operation to fix her arterial malformation, a stereotactic craniotomy, was coming. She survived, and over the next several years, was able to put her brain back together, leaving out the unpleasant and negative parts.    During her recovery, Taylor learned the things that caregivers should, and should not, do to help stroke patients. Make eye contact with me. Honor the healing power of sleep. Speak slowly and enunciate clearly. Please don't raise your voice. Keep visits brief. Ask me multiple-choice questions, not Yes/No questions. Break all actions down into smaller steps. Don't finish my sentences or fill in words I can't find.    This is a really interesting book.On one level, it looks inside the brain to show just what happens during a stroke; good for stroke victims or caregivers. On another level, it shows that the two lobes of the brain have very different personalities. It's very much worth reading.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is definitely one piece of sci-fi candy to be enjoyed over and over again.  I will not bore you with the plot and special effects.  Suffice it to say that you have to pay attention and additional viewings will be rewarding. It appears to be inspired from an older movie, The 13th Floor, staring Gretchen Mol. That movie explored the realm of tapping into a computer simulation program (a very real appearing program in which participants believe they are real people).  Inception actually gives the movie a bit of a nod by naming one of its central characters Mal (pronounced \\"Mol\\" in the film). But that's where the similarities end. I suspect that those who gave the movie a negative review were expecting a traditional and very linear feature.  You have to re-adjust your expectations, take a deep breath and keep awake for this little gem. And that's the \\"kick.\\"
B001VZY4MS|5.0|I was already a Neil Young fan in 1977 but had somehow never listened to or purchased his debut. Until I heard \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" in my girlfriends dorm room one winter's night and was quite frankly blown away. The melodic and lyrical brilliance on this first album are undeniable.     He was young (no pun intended), romantic and these songs reflect youthful themes of alienation, unrequited love, and deep compassion. Jack Nitzsche's production (and the strings) has always seemed appropriate for these songs. The \\"Godfather Of Grunge\\" was still a few albums away (see \\"Tonights The Night\\").    \\"The Loner\\" or \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" are much more than folk, or country rock, or pop... During his first \\"Decade\\" (1969-1979) Neil Young was the most vital, important, and consistently interesting artist making music, and it started with this album.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|these guys were great and underrated in the 80's.......they are back with this new singer....this is a great metal album!!!!!!!....thanks to that metal show on vh1 for recommending this album
B001AR0D4A|5.0|So many people miss the point of movies like this. They dont seem to notice that it's not about the monsters and it's not about the killing. It's about what happens to people who are scared, trapped, and stuck with eachother. They even call it during the movie. This is a masterful demonstration of horror!
1572816112|5.0|An absolute FEAST for the eyes and the spirit! The deck not only features a wonderful array of art, but a thoughtful connection to the symbolism that will have you reading new insights into old issues!  A WONDERFUL balance to my Goddess Tarot...can't wait for the companion book!
B001IB63J2|1.0|I'm not a huge fan of the band but i like this album with the singles Helena and The Ghost of You really standing out. With vinyl as my preferred medium, i was happy to see this get released, but my happiness was short lived. This record is WAY overpriced. It is touted as a \\"Special Edition\\", and therefore comes on a red vinyl disc with an embossed cover and a stencil and a photo of the handwritten lyric sheet and a sticker. $32.00 for a stencil? red vinyl? embossed cover? i know that little extras cost more but this stuff is worthless and the vinyl is not heavyweight 180g and the cover is very thin card stock and not gatefold. For a $32 \\"Special Edition\\" i expect a better quality package, even if some of the \\"extras\\" need to be sacrificed (even though an indie label wouldn't sacrifice).     But even worse for a $32 dollar record is that the pressing quality is terrible. This record is unlistenable. It has horrible surface noise (crackles and pops) and distortion throughout the entire record. My mid-level equipment is properly set up properly and I hand cleaned the disc twice. No improvement. My experience seems very similar to another review of the vinyl here on Amazon and as a result i recommend avoiding this at all costs. Descent music, overpriced package, pathetic vinyl.
B002ZG974M|3.0|Babies cry a lot.  And hit their siblings a lot.  That's what I got out of this documentary.  I appreciate the idea behind the documentary, which is wonderful, show the similarities and differences between having babies and raising babies across four different cultures around the world.  However, after 30 minutes, I had enough of the story, and just fast-forwarded to the end.  I mean, there's only so much cute baby footage one can take.     Recommended strongly for parents of babies, or people thinking about becoming parents.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Nice BluRay, gave me the movie in gorgeous HD, and I don't need some extensions of some scenes to love the time spent watching...2 DVDs for a small price...priceless!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|The Princess and the Frog is a sumptuously animated film, with a look that goes back to the Disney classics of yesteryear.  The story was completely entertaining that hit all the right notes, and the music was lively and hit all the right notes as well.  Another five-star review, it's great entertainment for the whole family.
B000000XK5|5.0|Another amazing session by the immortal duet. Joe as always strikes listeners by his incredible ability to fit some crazy virtuosic stuff into an accompaniment and to lead a melody of his own that perfectly suites the original vocal part, whereas Ella's voice got just so much more interesting with age. Her talent for acing any tune in the world is now flavored with a profoundness and an intriguing touch of...experience or mystery if you will. The chemistry that comes out of their playing together is quite rare, something that you would call \\"in the best traditions of The Great Jazz\\".  Also read in some of the comments that she's out of the tune in a few songs, which made me wonder which world that was in. Ella was somebody who could never miss a single note. In fact, in some sense she was inventing them. I'm sure she even snored \\"in tune\\", if you know what I mean. 5 stars, one of the best duets in the history of jazz.
B002ZG981E|2.0|Inception gave me a strange sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, I felt like I saw this movie earlier in the year and didn't like it when it was called Shutter Island.<br /><br />So is Inception accessible enough to plant the idea of an entertaining experience in viewer minds? In your dreams. No one short of a NASA systems analyst will be able to articulate the plot.<br /><br />One way to salvage some fun with this blunderbuss would be to fall asleep while watching and dream up a better movie yourself. Try it. You'll avoid a headache.
142311339X|5.0|This book is soo super duper great.It is a book I could read over and over again. THis book is rated 5 stars including me. Only three people have rated it a 1 star which is strange. My friends and I have agreed it is on our top ten list. This book is about mainly three characters and is mostly about roman gods. The first characcter is Jason who has no more memory and keeps having these strange dreams. Piper is a girl whose dad is a buisness man is rich but she acts totally different. Leo is looking for a golden dragon that is destroying camp. All three of these are friends. This book also has the greatest cliff hander of all. IT goes like this, \\"Percy could be at the other camp with his memory lost too. Isn't it great. Find out more by reading it!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|For film details, check out IMDB.com.  In regards to buying this item from Amazon, I recommend it.  The item arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Exactly what I wanted.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I was very disappointed when I had saved this for an Anniversary gift & when we opened it & put it in to watch there were episodes that would not play & other episodes that skipped, then I tried it in another DVD player & it did the same thing.  So, I was dissatisfied wih the product & am tying to begin the process to return it, but the seller doesn't have a return policy or phone number to be reached at.
B0011NVC98|3.0|The story line wasn't bad.  I just half expected Grendal to turn up and big a big Green guy with a scottish accent and have a dry wit, also I expected him to turn up with a talking donkey who wouldn't shut up and a cat wearing boots and a hat and a spansish accent.  With all the CGI it just made me think about Shreck and I reckon that they would have been better of doing it live action with some special effect's.  As the title of my review say's Shreck without the funny bits.
1401228801|5.0|I had been waiting for months to get my hands on Fables 14: Witches, and when it came, the only disappointment I felt was that the volume had to end at some point.  In contrast to Fables 13 which was boring and nonsensical, Witches has all the classic components that makes the series so incredibly addictive.  If you think of 13 as a departure, then 14 brings you safely  within the realm of the Fables we've come to know and love.    Much is the same as when we left off: the colorful characters (who you both love and hate), the looming darkness that threatens the Fable community externally, and the schisms that divide the Fables internally.  The volume also makes a nod or two to \\"Peter and Max\\" (worth a gander, like Fables with more words and fewer graphics) and several side-stories that filled out the Fables volumes preceding (barleycorn girls, and what Totenkinder is always so diligently knitting). However, some of the bedrocks are shaken.  Some fables die, some are (in a sense) reborn to man, and some are becoming more fanatical with each passing day. A witch grows young again in order to do battle (and you are both excited and worried for her), another grows into a newly vacant leadership position through a very different (and showy) leadership style, and yet another is vying to bend the Fables to his will in order to mold them into \\"good citizens\\" once more.  You meet new characters while discovering that the Mundy world is not completely mundane and even has some magic in its roots. Characters are coming and going, but all the while there is a cohesiveness to the story that 13 lacked entirely. Pieces are set in motion and at the end of this engrossing volume, things feel like they are getting out of hand... but only in the best possible way.     And if you've been reading Fables all this time, and you have given up on the series due to vol. 13, please, come back and give 14 a try. You won't regret it.
0143118420|5.0|I think that Liz Gilbert is an amazing writer. I literally laughed out loud numerous times. I think that the way she organizes this book is genius. You can instantly relate just from the first page, and when you pick it up it seems you are talking to a friend over coffee at your kitchen table. It is comforting and spirit lifting. Recommend for anyone who is going through a rough patch and needs a boost.
B0042RUMEQ|3.0|Cd was just okay, I was expecting better but I do like about 50% of the songs but she needs a new writer.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  If you like the conspiracy theory and secret society themes, you'll love it.  However until you suspend your understanding of reality it will be tough to get into the book.  This was very difficult for me on one point.  I mean really?  The Redskins in the playoffs?
B00445JSWS|4.0|i know this is a DVD review but i would like to focus on some events i experienced considering the tour of the universe and the actual Barcelona concert filmed here.  waited for this DVD release with great anticipation. i was present at some of the drama considering the DM tour of the Universe, first by being on their cancelled-on-stage Athens show, the news about Dave's health the following day in Athens, their cancellation of several dates and finally their quick return touring with a great set. i booked my tickets for Barcelona for a second attempt to see the TOTU and i was completely satisfied by the 21th Nov. performance. the DVD release was a great memory of a dramatic but very successful tour.  good points:  -the energy of the band on stage. they just LOVE what theire doing, their fans and they give all of their emotion performing their songs. they are something that one has to experience live.  -the set is one of the best they've toured with.  -the crowd was very active, following the band, singing along and in this release you can actually see and feel the live, much better than \\"touring the angel-live in milan\\" DVD where you could barely see the crowd.  -never let me down again-in this DVD is filmed the best way than any previous DM releases.  weak points:  -Dave's voice was not on his best that night. he had been through serious problems with his health during that tour and it sounds so. his performance on stage though is completely amazing, he is non stop moving, dancing, communicating with the crowd, classic Dave at his best, with a slight tired voice.  -the mistake on the second night on the closing song, waiting for the night to fall. Martin and the crowd saved it to a wonderful ending.  -the DVD release is kinda blurry. i dont know about Blue Ray release but i expected better quality from the DVD.  -a question of lust is missing. it was part of the set list for the first half of the tour and was replaced for Barcelona nights. of course with such a big catalog, something should be left out anyway.  overall: this DVD is good, much better than their previous release, perhaps their best DVD release of the decade. if it can stand together with 101 or Devotional or even One night in Paris, only time will tell.   fans surely wont be disapointed.
B003QNXPUK|3.0|Installation was a little tricky, but if you follow the tips (wash your hands, turn off your fan, don't try to do it in a car or someplace random), you'll be fine. I happen to like the textured feeling of the screen protector and the traction it creates. I love the look of the iphone 4 so I wanted something that would keep it exposed so I chose this screen protector and a 'bumper'<br /><br />My problem is that the corners bubble up at least once a day and it drives me CRAZY! I was going to request a warranty replacement from Zagg but they do not offer replacements due to 'bubbles' as it is seen to be an installation error. I do not have bubbles anywhere except when large bubbles form when the corners lift away from my phone. I am not satisfied and I will be looking for a new option.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I very much enjoyed Predators and hope that the rather obvious hooks left for a sequel have traction.  Certainly not a high-point in the career of Laurence Fishburne.  In parallel, if they take some time to put AVP back on track (getting as far away from the requiem debacle as possible) there could be several more opportunities to enjoy the franchise.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|My BF and I purchased this for his daughter's Birthday! It shipped quickly and she was thrilled with her gift! It came at a great price for such a fresh & new TV series! Everyone I know loves this show!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I wasn't too sure what to expect from this movie but I loved it! My husband and I talked about it for days after and I am still thinking about it. I did cry at parts but then again I cry over a Disney flick....Must see!
0375851569|5.0|I highly recommend this Dr.Suess's Beginner Book Collection. I have a three year old son and I think that I have enjoyed the stories as much as he does.  The style really makes reading more interesting and memorable.  I was familair with Green Eggs and Ham but the other books in the collection are also excellent.  I feel that I made a great investment for my child.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I have been following Josh's musical career for many years.  I wish he would come to Ohio for a concert!  Now saying that, I will move on to my review - I was fearful of Illuminations because I am older and do not like change, and knew that Josh's creativity and talent would not keep him continuing with the same sound.  I applaud him for going forth and trying out different sounds, words, music.  For taking the chance to have his music ridiculed, his words laughed at, more power to you, Josh.     When I first listened to Illuminations, I knew right a way that this wasn't going to be good-where was my good ole Josh music? his voice? I didn't like this-go back to how you were doing it, Josh.  But then I listened and found myself, for most of the songs, feeling the same passion, the same stirring within my soul. And no, I am not a Grobanite, I am not a member of his fan club, nor do I wear Josh Groban jewlery or clothing.  But, I might, if he would come to Cincinnati.  I hope he doesn't give up on us and some of us have done him for exploring more of his creativity.
0307595579|5.0|I'm a great fan of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy and already own his works in hardcover. When I saw this set though, I knew I had to have it because I'm also a collector of books, and this set seemed worth having with all the special features.<br /><br />The set consists of four books in a beautiful slip-case. The four books are The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, and On Stieg Larsson. The three novels are cloth bound (no dust jacket) and have beautiful, unique engravings on each. There are also unique features such as maps and full-color endpapers. The book titled On Stieg Larsson consists of essays which have never been published before as well as correspondence with Larsson who died in 2004.<br /><br />Just a note: There is another collector's set which is not to be confused with this. The publisher is Maclehose Press, London (2010). It is a more expensive edition than this (also contains 4 volumes), and the major difference between this set and the other set is that the other set has a poster of 16 different dustjackets of the trilogy published around the world. Each book in the other slipcased set has gilt titles on the spine, and a gilt dragon on the front boards. I knew of this set because my friend (an avid fan of Larsson's works) owns it (purchased online).<br /><br />However, I decided to purchase this set instead as the other set is much more expensive. I think this set, for the price, offers good value for collectors and fans of great crime fiction.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have seen the second and third season as I caught up late. Now I have the first season and I love it. It really cleared up a lot of questions that I had like \\"who was Renee and why was he evil\\" \\"How did Bill meet Sookie\\" things of that nature.  A Twilight saga for Grown ups with a sense of humor.      So glad that I got it from Amazon too, it was even cheaper than Walmart and arrived the day it was supposed to \\"marked my calendar\\"

B002ZG997C|2.0|SPOILER... it wasn't a half bad apocalyptic movie until the surprise ending where it turns out that the King James Bible he was carrying around in his backpack was in braille.  Apparently, the makers of this film were under the misguided impression that a braille version would be the same exact size as a smallish font print version when the reality is that the braille version has about 18 volumes and weighs about 70 pounds.  In the end of the movie, he transcribes it to a group that had a printing press, and it is clear that it was a complete Bible.  Oops.    Still perhaps the book of Eli is an abridged version without all the unnecessary filler.  He was being guided by God, so maybe all the parts that had been misinterpreted had been removed from the good book of Eli.  Keep the 10 commandments and all the stuff about loving your neighbor and turning the other cheek, but maybe get rid of some of the animal sacrifice stuff.  Alternatively, it could have simply been one volume like the book of Ester, and in the sequel the new post apocalyptic society then builds their religion around this one section of the bible.

B000W796OM|5.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban earns a 5-star review from me (typical). One factor is the acting, which went from superb to perfect! Another is the increasing dark and increasing interesting story. Make no mistake; there are funny moments in the film, too. For instance, the candy that makes you sound like a creature. Another example is when Harry pelts Malfoy with snow, invisibly. Of course, Hermione demanding an apology from Ron is worth a laugh as well. As we watch each film, we see more of Harry's world. Things begin to make sense: how did Voldemort know where Harry's parents were? Who is Scabbers, the rat? Why did Hermione decide to change her hairstyle in subsequent films (yes, that is covered in the film). To those of you who want to know the answer, she thought her hair looked horrible, after seeing it from the back. Anyway, despite that humorous moment, this film, is a great deal darker than the first two, although nothing in it is as creepy as the basilisk scene in Harry Potter 2. The dementors are pretty frightening though, and who could not cheer when Hermione, wanting to give Malfoy what he so clearly deserved, punched him in the face. The hippogriff ride was certainly invigorating. Of course, there is even more character development. Hogwarts also has a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher again. If it sounds like I think this film is stupendous, I do! I recommend that you buy it at once. There is a great probability (99.9%) that you will be glad you did!!!!!! Thank you for reading my review!!!

B002PMV9FG|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, like the other 6 (see my other Harry Potter reviews}, receives from me a 5-star rating! The reasons? For one, the acting has not only retained its flawless level, but has risen to new heights! Snape was picked perfectly! The horcruxes, another factor as to why this film is so high in my esteem, are immensely clever! They also explain quite a bit! The reasons behind the power of Tom Riddle's diary and the ring are explained by the horcrux theory. The film starts and ends with a bang, too. {SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!} Dumbledore's death was particularly horrifying and touching; it was quite sad. Something I was glad to see was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are growing up. Ron and Hermione's affection for each other is by now very obvious, and I, for one, will be immensely joyful when they get married. {ANOTHER SPOILER!} Malfoy appears quite a bit, doing unknown deeds, adding to the suspense of the film. The visuals are great, as always. The film's ending will leave you in shock, but will make you extremely impatient to see the 7th Harry Potter film! When I first saw the film, I was stuck to my seat the entire 153 minutes! I was quite glad quidditch matches were introduced again; I missed them. Slughorn was very funny, as was Hagrid. The inferi were very scary, and young Tom Riddle was chilling. Harry and his friends are becoming more and more real, human, and lovable with each film, and this is no exception. I still think Luna Lovegood steals the show, and wish she could have been in the Half Blood Prince even longer than she was! The identity of the Half Blood Prince was shocking!!!! In short, I thought the film could not be improved upon! I only wish it had been longer! Thank you for reading, and I wish you a happy time viewing Harry Potter!
0439023521|5.0|I started reading this series during finals week (grad school), which was a bad decision, because I could hardly tear myself away from it. It has everything a good story needs, adventure, romance, great plot, and a deeper level of social critique and psychological insight. Very well written, unlike many young adult sci-fi books. Adults will enjoy this series just as much as teens.
B0041T52S6|5.0|no idea why it didnt do good in theaters because the movie is amazing. everyone i watch it with says they ve never seen anything like it and laugh the whole time. one of my favorite movies
1926778103|3.0|I love the art of course, but once you look at it more than a couple times it starts to fall apart at the spine. Super low quality and maybe due to its thickness, don't know what happened but I am sad that I am afraid to open the book again and have all the pages fall out :: [
B002HFWAWW|3.0|The condition of the movie was not as it was described. It came to me with damage to the clear protector on the case. And the plastic wrapping was torn.
B003XKAZKO|5.0|Excellent compilation of early Morrissey stuff...Great songs admirably well interpreted. Excelllent bonus tracks which make this an essential Morrissey album (with VivaHate and Vauxhall and I)
B004132I20|5.0|This is one of the best series to come along in ages. It is the show for Americans with intelligence who are tired of stuff like Jersey Shore. This series is very well done and modern London is as much a character as Holmes and Watson. There have been many incarnations of Serlock Holmes, some of them in the modern age, but none of them have been as good as this one. The modern characters really work and have great chemistry. This is broadcast on PBS which has a limited audience but I'm sure by word of mouth, INTERNET chat, and DVD sales the word will get around and many Americans will enjoy a great adventure.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|I wasn't expecting much when I purchased this seeing how lackluster her last studio album was, but since I must purchase all things Mariah Carey I couldn't help myself.  This is such a good album!  It's got plenty of originals, and some new versions of songs from her first Merry Christmas album.  The entire album sounds joyful, upbeat and just all-around happy.  Carey definitely sounds like she's having a blast performing these songs.  It surprised me because I wasn't expecting it to sound so fresh and original, instead I thought it would be a bit more traditional.    Standout tracks for me include \\"Oh Santa!\\", \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\", and the fabulous rendition of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" (a song which I've always found really boring).  Fans of Christmas albums should definitely add this one to their collection!!
B00428CPUY|5.0|This was the third Crossroads event.  I missed the first (it was in Texas) but attended the second outside of Chicago in 2007.  In June 2010 I sent my son and his best friend to the third edition, which once again was held SW of downtown ChiTown, and they had a great time.  Why not? They were right in the front row, and thus they're very visible in this DVD! But, that's not the only reason I give it the highest rating, of course...it's all about the music.  Like the previous festivals, this one had a killer lineup of guitar hero after guitar hero, and this 2-disc set captures a selection of songs by just about every player who hit the stage.  I can't imagine anyone who loves the blues or guitar music NOT liking this package.  Your only complaint will probably be: where's the rest???
B000VXVWUI|4.0|This is a review of the 1994 digital remaster. I like the sound quality on this version although I don't have any points of comparison for it.  On first listen I would have given this album 72.5/100 but on second listen bumped it up to 75/100. I'd describe the music on the album as interstellar space folk-rock, experimental, soundscapes, genteel, plonking noises, fx. It's mostly instrumental. Has a relaxing atmosphere which is occasionally broken by grating noises. The studio album runs to 46:57 minutes long on one cd and the live album, which is mostly relaxing versions of their earlier material comes in at 39:21 minutes.      The studio album -      Sisyphus:    Part 1 - I've marked it down this part as being 1:08 though Wikipedia gives it a different run time. A symphonic instrumental. An Emperor march type track (I'm not even sure that phrase exists...if it does, hopefully my use of the term is apt!). Has big drum sounds, which makes me think of something imperial in any case. Might have a synthesiser. Violins and Cymbals.    Part 2 - mostly a piano piece. My notes say that this follows on from the first part without a gap, which may explain why my time length differs from Wikipedia's entry for this album. Percussion does appear later on this track...cymbals and drums. Piano has a slow-medium tempo. Track becomes more violent towards the end with the percussion and chords on the piano.    Part 3 - experimental instrumental...plucked strings, percussion on metal objects and drums, sort of animal noises (or weird human ones...sometimes it sounds like someone has inhaled helium gas and started singing!), piano?    Part 4 - symphonic, slow tempo song. Sombre tone but with some ambient noises, a la meditation music. Has sounds of twittering birds but also a jolting transition from peaceful to loud music. Maybe you could describe this piece has having three movements (?). What I take to be the third movement is relaxing.    Grantchester Meadows - has ambient naturesounds...birds twiitering, insects. The ending has an amusing bookend to this use. Dual acoustic guitars playing genteel notes.    Several species of small furry animals gathered together in a cave and grooving with a pict - if they released this song as a single, they'd just have had to sing the title once for the needle to have reached the end of the vinyl!  Anyway, it sounds like ambient jungle sounds from another planet. Early on you get weird tapping percussion. Track is a bit schizophrenic at times. Sounds like a Scottish explorer or something at the end of the track. You also get experimental scat sounds and what sounds like UFO noises...presumably. I have never heard UFO noises myself.     The narrow way:    Part 1 - jarring bookends but pleasant dual acoustic guitar notes in-between. Some squeaky noises recalls their debut album. UFO sounds reappear for the intro and the outro to this track.     Part 2 - sort of Black Sabbath type proto-metal then mixed with spacey sounds. Bongo percussion.    Part 3 - a bagpipe sounding synth (presumably). Dave Gilmour sings, I think. Slow-medium tempo. Piano, cello? twangy guitar, woodwind type instruments, electric guitar at the end, bass and some solid drumming.    The Grand Vizier's garden party:    Part 1: Entrance - 1:00 minute long. Dual woodwind type instruments. Jarring military style drum/drum roll.    Part 2: Entertainment - Experimental. Like the drum intro and the tone of the drum...watery! Drums bookend this track. A candidate for my drum songs list, especially for the drum outro, which is good. Small passage in the middle of the track which has a grating, fingernails down the blackboard sound. A more experimental soundscape later. There are other ringing type noises in the track.     Part 3: Exit - 0:38 minutes long. Peaceful track with dual woodwind type instruments...recorder?      Live album:      Astronomy domine - 8:29. Seems pretty faithful to the original. Studio quality sound. Relaxing track. A percussion strong piece...cymbals etc. You only hear the crowd at the end of the track.    Careful with that axe, Eugene - 8:50. Crowd sound faint at the start. Mostly an instrumental, with just a few words and a little scat. The scream in this track prefigures that used on their \\"The wall\\" album. Sombre. Violins, organ and cymbals. Crowd sound louder at the end of the track. I heard a pop on my cd at 0:24 minutes in, I think.    Set the controls for the heart of the sun - 9:12. No crowd noises on this one. Genteel track, especially the vocals. Keyboard, hand percussion on interesting sounding drums. Big drums are used too.     A saucerful of secrets - 12:48.  Got a note questioning if this is a new track. They released an album by this name right after their debut...can't remember if this was on it or not. Probably not, going on memory. Another contender for my drum songs list...this track has a bit of a \\"Dance with the devil\\" vibe to it (Cozy Powell drum solo track) as far as the rhythm goes. An instrumental pretty much, but has some vocalising at the end. Organ, bassy, cymbals. Genteel for the most part but gets noisier later. Surf Guitar sound at times and maybe they  have a sort of Jimi Hendrix vibe to them as well.      Pink Floyd recommendations:      More. 4/5. Experimental album at times, but a couple of their heaviest rock songs thrown into the mix as well. Some genteel tracks too.    The wall. 9+/10. A concept album with an actual concept. Polished double cd release.    The piper at the gates of dawn. 7.5+/10. Strangely compelling debut album. Whimsical.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|When this movie came out in 1998, I was seven years old: so, I'm a part of the original target audience.  And I grew up with this film, ever since it aired on TV.  But I'm pretty sure that I'd still adore \\"The Parent Trap\\" if it wasn't a nostalgic childhood memory; it's one of those rare films that actually holds something for all ages.    Of course, the plot is quite fantastical and doesn't bear too much scrunity; but you're not supposed to overthink the movie, just to sit back and enjoy it.  Several other reviewers have expressed distate for the idea that two parents could split and seperate twin daughters; yes, in reality, that would be a horrific situation.  But \\"The Parent Trap\\" isn't reality; it's a beautiful fantasy.  Certainly as a kid I wasn't at all worried by the parents' situation, I was too captivated by the fun and romance and luxury, and the fact that they were going to get back together to live happily ever after.      I must make special mention the mother Elizabeth James (wonderfully played by the late Natasha Richardson), who is surely the idealized image of a mother; loving, a beautiful and elegant wedding-gown designer, and with a mischeivous streak to match her daughters.  The only downside to Richardson's great portrayal is that surely no real mother could measure up to this Hollywoodified image.    Of course that's the other concern; that the movie will set children who come from broken homes up for disappointment, when real life doesn't turn out like the movie.  But director Nancy Myers cleverly works against this by making both girls come from rich families, setting the story firmly in fantasy.  This also allows for beautiful sets and supporting characters of the butler and the nanny, played charmingly by Simon Kunz and Lisa Ann Walter.  I remember being fascinated by the beautiful London townhouse with all its ornaments.    As for any other concerns about the film not being child-friendly, I think they're misplaced.    -Yes, the baddie Meredith is a hot young thing; but as a kid, the only impression her flirting with Nick made on me was that I disliked her more (and the one line \\"That's why they have Do Not Disturb signs...\\" should go over the heads of anyone too young to know about that)  -Yes, the film includes alcohol; Nick Parker owns a vineyard of course.  But the scene in which Hallie (pretending to be Annie) samples some wine is harmless; she's taste-testing, not throwing it back, and it's a comedic moment as she shows off Hallie's knowledge of wine (which Annie should lack).  As for Elizabeth's drunk scene, it's hilarious, and it's not exactly going to corrupt the youth.  Mum's terrified of seeing Dad again because she's secretly still in love with him, so she has a little too much vodka...So what, really?  I watched that scene when I was little, and I for one haven't grown up to be a raging alcoholic.  In my opinion, Elizabeth is more of a lady than Maureen O'Hara in the original film, leaving her bra lying around the father's house!  How is that 'child-friendly'?!      Basically, \\"The Parent Trap\\" is a beautiful, harmless family fantasy.  And more than that, it carries real emotional weight.  When both girls first meet the mother or father they've lived without for eleven years, it's a really beautiful moment; it sure brings  a tear to the eyes of my family.  And Lindsay Lohan really was a very talented little actress, her double performances are brilliant.    \\"The Parent Trap\\" is a movie with enough happiness and heart to make anyone want their own happily ever after.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|This is an excellent follow-up to Only By The Night!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE every song on this cd!  I didn't think they'd try to make another album like the previous one because that's not how they are as artists, they didn't and what a GRAND success!  There's a mix of all of their previous sounds, but still distinct, and it sounds great!  If you've not bought it yet, do so IMMEDIATELY, you won't be disappointed at all!
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is a great thriller that is original, intelligent, and worth the price of admittance.  It is a movie that demands participation of the viewer.  This is the case of any real \\"think of the possibilities\\" film.  Anyone who expects the film to unfold in simple terms will not only be disappointed, but will not understand the content.  This is the reason the film is getting some bad reviews on Amazon.  There are those who are unable to get involved in film and would rather have some monster running around gutting a cast of guest victims (the lowest common denominator).      Inception deals with dreams and the layered dream world affect on space and time.  The special effects are well rendered, but the real thrust of the film is the storyline.  If the viewer enters the world of Inception with a mind to follow its complexities, the film will not only prove itself worthy of a top rating, it will open the neurotransmitters of the mind and send the intelligent on a trip they will not soon forget.  In other words, this is not a film for the common dullard who will not understand what the heck is happening.  For more in the dullard perspective, read the one star reviews.    The blue ray disk has excellent extras, including a great 50 minute documentary on dream states. Beyond the talking heads, the visuals are akin to an acid trip.  The whole package is well worth the ride.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Wired Magazine did a review on this game about a year ago. If interested, it's a great review into the background of the game's origins, as well as a transparent view into the basic building blocks of what makes a great board game.<br /><br />Really a great board game for kids as well as adults. Very few rules that are basic enough to give everyone a good grasp on the concept, as well as leaves room for personalizing the various inevitable situations you will encounter.<br /><br />Beware: it can become addictive.
0307595579|3.0|Bouquets first - I really enjoyed 3/4 of the first book and I finished the other two in quick succession to satisfy my curiosity and found them to be enjoyable. I haven't read any books set in Sweden so I reveled in the author's descriptions, as it is an unfamiliar place to me and I could easily imagine the settings he was writing about. The premise the initial book was built around i.e. solving an old mystery/disappearance was intriguing to begin with.Lisbeth Salander is an interesting character and her background story (which helps explain a lot of her actions)is revealed gradually and is well rounded and fascinating.<br />Brickbats - well I can't be specific as that would spoil it for those who haven't read the books so I'll just generalise. As I moved through the trilogy I found that most of the characters were cliches and caricatures and I couldn't help but think I've read about their type many times before. With each book the plot becomes more ridiculous and implausible with miraculous escapes, extraordinary coincidences and good luck abounding. Perhaps I am being too harsh but an ability to suspend belief, not dig too deep and simply enjoy the story for what it is will serve you well.<br />Larsson, I would equate to Sweden's answer to Wilbur Smith or Dan Brown and I'm not trying to be unkind as I have read and enjoyed these authors but I am just putting in perspective where these books sit for me. The fact that the books are very popular is neither here nor there but anything that gets more people reading like the aforementioned Dan Brown with The DaVinci Code can only be a good thing.<br />Like a good popcorn movie blockbuster if you just want to be entertained, not think too hard and don't expect literary greatness, but want something to read on the aeroplane or on a sun lounge next to the pool, these books will do nicely.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Ms. Granik, the film's director, had the good sense to select one of America's better writers on the dark side of rural life, Daniel Woodrell. as a source for her film. She appears to have let his sensibility have a large role in Winter's Bone, and I think in this instance it was a good decision.    For me, the strongest element was Granik's choice to stay intensely and consistently focused on the main character and her milieu. The viewer is never distracted by extraneous elements or stylistic sops thrown in to appease Hollywood conventionality. I was riveted throughout the film, even as the outcome of the main unseen character became evident, the denouement.    Credit goes to the filmmakers for studiously avoiding the showing of the beating of one of the characters - we do see the aftermath, and that is brutal enough. Also the scene involving a murder victim and the prolonged attention to the corpse is shot indirectly, and is all the more horrific as a result. As the ancient Greeks knew, violence is best implied off stage, and all the more effective as a result. Granik's camera had better ways to address violence.    In addition, the dysfunctional male hill culture is portrayed without condescension, as is the omnipresence of way too many guns. We're left to draw our conclusions about the impoverished, backward way of life and its struggling denizens amidst one of the most lethal drug epidemics to have ravaged the poor, white working class.
0634022296|5.0|Every Beatles fan that plays guitar should have this book.  I was over at a friends house one night who had this and ordered it later that night because I had to have my own copy.  Simple to follow and loads of fun.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|My review is from [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO the 60th Anniversary Edition]].  The film is also available in [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO a 2 disc colorized set]] and on [[ASIN:B001UHOWXI Blu-ray]].    The movie that will forever be director Frank Capra's masterpiece.  \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a fantastic story of a man with big dreams that he watches slip away as life's responsibilities take hold of him.  We watch George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) go from wide-eyed dreamer to a broken man convinced the world would be a better place without him.  Stewart shows fantastic range in the movie, which is not the pure, sappy, feel-good movie it is so frequently portrayed as.  It has those elements, but there is also a dark side to the movie that is often overlooked.  This is my all-time favorite film, bar none.  And while most people view it as a Christmas movie, I think it should be enjoyed all year long.    The 60th Anniversary Edition has a beautiful black and white presentation of the film.  For bonus features you get the original trailer and two featurettes - \\"A Personal Remembrance\\" with Frank Capra Jr. and \\"The Making of...\\" hosted by (the late) Tom Bosley.  Both are rather old (early 1990s) but still very interesting.  The newer 2 disc edition contains this same DVD along with a second disc containing a colorized version of the film.  Unless you're a fan of colorized movies, I'd recommend saving your money and picking up the 60th Anniversary Edition.  The Blu-ray has the same contents as the 2 disc DVD.
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|HAMLET is the greatest drama in our language. Any questions?    Branaugh's 1996 production stands as the most complete, star-studded and visually impressive HAMLET ever filmed. Yes, it feels a bit overblown at times, and a few choices of casting and exposition are questionable. But there is nothing actually BAD in it, and much that is excellent, even unsurpassed.    I had the pleasure of seeing the film in 70mm format, one of the handful of prints struck directly from the original negative. No Blu-ray is capable of reproducing that much image information. Nevertheless, this transfer was beautifully handled. The image is clear and detailed, but not in-your-face \\"sharp.\\" It feels like what it is, a disc made from an ultra-high-quality ANALOG source. \\"Velvety\\" is the best word I can think of. Colors are subtle, and not a speck of dust is visible. Hard to imagine how this could look any better at home.    Watch out for the soundtrack! It appears to have little or no compression, and when it gets loud, it gets VERY loud. If you play it so that dialog is easily audible, the climaxes will wake up the kids.    I will return to this disc again and again.
B001F0WXY0|1.0|Dune is an amazing journey, and anyone who has thought of reading definitely should.  However, I want to know why the Kindle version is more expensive than any other version?!  I'm starting to get REALLY sick of all this. Well, Amazon got their $189 out of the person who bought the Kindle itself for me, but they sure won't get any more money from me for books that are outrageously overpriced.
B0049P1VHS|1.0|ok, i going to play mr. bad guy here.i own all 6 volumes of the walking dead in book form. each book contains about 10 issues of the series; and, yes, all 6 of them can be ordered here at amazon.com.         i have one hell of a super love affair with the graphic novels.         cheers to mr. kirkman and team, for creating the best survival horror graphic series, i have ever come across todate!   now on to my whine about the television verson of the graphic novel. television series SUCKS!              i have no one but myself to blame, for letting the television series suck.              if i had not read the graphic novel series... i would have loved the television series to no end!           every time i read something and, it is made into a movie or television program; 95% of the time i am disappointed.     i'm sure alot of you understand where i'm coming from on this matter.            if i had never read even, one issue of kirkman's fine graphic novel; i would give the television verson of the walking dead 5 stars; however, standing on it's own the television series is super great and, i have pre-ordered the television series here at amazon.com. it is more then well worth the $26.00 price tag as far as i am concerned.     i guess my review here needs to be taken as moral... 'if you read the book first; expect the movie/television redition to live up, to what you create in your own imagination.'
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|Angelina Jolie's appearance in \\"The Tourist\\" may someday set records for sheer photogenic appeal. She plays one of the most glamorous undercover agents ever to grace the silver screen; her wardrobe, her makeup, and her hair are all immaculate, and for some strange reason, they stay that way all 103 minutes of the film. Even when her character is roughed up by an odious mobster near the end, she still looks as if she has been prepped for a \\"Vanity Fair\\" photo shoot. This is, of course, a testament to her beauty as well as to the capable hands of her makeup artists, her hairdressers, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. Credit also to co-writer/director Florian Henkel von Donnersmarck for letting the camera linger on her face and figure a little longer than necessary. He clearly knew what the people wanted to see.    But where does that leave the film itself? Is it supposed to be less about plot and more about serving as an extended fashion show? This is one of the few action thrillers that doesn't get away with being preposterous, for it doesn't have the conviction to go all out with it. Unlike Jolie's previous action film, \\"Salt,\\" \\"The Tourist\\" is timid and flimsy. The stunts are never daring enough, the romance isn't passionate enough, and the sense of humor is so reserved that it seems completely out of place. The story is exceedingly simple, pretty much to the point that it barely holds our interest. Worst of all is the lack of onscreen chemistry between Jolie and costar Johnny Depp. The only real credit I can give it is for its beautiful cinematography and breathtaking scenery, the canals and Byzantine architecture of Venice shot with the same care and precision of an Italian tourism commercial.    In the film, Jolie plays Elsie Clifton-Ward, a British beauty who cunningly misleads a federal investigation of her former lover, the unseen Alexander Pearce, a career criminal wanted in many countries by many people. This includes the heatless gangster Reginald Shaw(Steve Berkoff), who he embezzled billions from. Scotland Yard's Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) has been keeping tabs on Elsie for two years in the desperate hope that she will lead them to Pearce; for reasons never adequately explained, he's driven to capture the elusive criminal and bring him to justice. Pearce stays in touch with Elsie through a series of handwritten notes, which are delivered in plain but neat white envelopes. Her latest instructions: Board a train from Paris to Venice, and along the way, throw off the authorities by seeking out and befriending a man with Pearce's height and build.    Here enters Frank Tupelo (Depp), a nervous math teacher from Wisconsin hoping to forget a personal tragedy. He reads a spy novel. He puffs away on an electronic cigarette. He fumbles for his words like a man on his first blind date. Elsie regards Frank calmly, all the while calculating every move. They arrive in Venice. She convinces him to accompany her to a hotel and stay in her luxury suite - and, of course, he'll have to sleep on the sofa. In the aftermath of an intimate dinner and a few drinks, they kiss on the balcony. The next morning, while Elsie is out, a group of strange men barge into the suite intent on killing Frank, believing he's Pearce. And so begins the thriller portion of the film, highlighted by awkward action sequences, a contrived romance, and curious sudden appearances by Rufus Sewell. I leave it to you to discover whether or not his character is red herring.    \\"The Tourist,\\" a remake of the French film \\"Anthony Zimmer,\\" has all the reliable crime thriller clichés, including exotic locations, mobsters, a train ride, a mystery woman, and an apparent case of mistaken identity. It even has Timothy Dalton, although his role doesn't require him to be James Bond once again; he plays Chief Inspector Jones, who finds Acheson incredibly irritating and seems to take great pleasure in telling him off at the end. But even with all this at hand, something is missing. For something meant to be thrilling, we never quite go beyond the image of Johnny Depp running barefoot across loosely tiled Venetian rooftops. The blood never really pumps. The adrenaline never really rushes. It's all so flat and tired and insipid - not at all what I expected from a movie like this.    There is, of course, an inevitable plot twist, one that surprised me by not being surprising. Perhaps that was shortsighted on my part. Considering everything that happens, considering what was said, considering what we're shown, could the film have ended any other way? Crime thrillers are constructed with the intention of misdirecting the audience before revealing the truth. What bothers me is that this movie makes no real effort to trick us; it leads to a conclusion that was obvious from the very start. With no good romantic subplot, with no decent action sequences, and with no engaging plot, what else is there? The more I think about \\"The Tourist,\\" the more I return to its star, Angelina Jolie, whose beauty thoroughly overshadows everything else. That's not much of a compliment for the film itself, but it's the best I can do.
B004FTSAZO|4.0|This was an excellent episode.  It wasn't predictable and left a lot of questions yet to be answered.  Wonderful werewolf transformation segment.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|The soundtrack was insanely loud, the vocals from the actors were mumbled and the plot was chaotic.

0307454541|4.0|A riveting tale by an author who lived -- and perhaps died by -- the story of a muckraking journalist and his genius research assistant who must wend their way through the dangerous worlds of high-stakes businessmen and their passions, prejudices and dark crimes. Lisbeth Salander, an adult-Goth version of Pippi Longstocking, demonstrates the creative pluck and toughness that makes her one of the best new heroines in fiction. The book starts slow and easy, and many readers might set it aside, but they'd miss the growing tension that finally gives the story a can't-put-it-down excitement. It has captured the hearts of millions of readers as well as the creative forces of Hollywood (who will release a second film version of the story in as many years, this time for English-speaking audiences). Highly recommended.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Regarding the movie itself, there are enough movie reviews out there to substantiate the (subjective) claim in my title. Even Ellen Paige, who I regard as vapid and uninteresting as a whole, was excellent in this movie. Christopher Nolan did quite an impressive job in every way, shape, and form.    The Blu-Ray disc itself is an incredible piece of work. The image quality is precisely how I remembered it in the digital projection movie theater. Not one single complaint about either the film or the Blu-Ray.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|I am Buddhist, yet was raised in a Christian family. So I've been exposed to Christmas songs and carols all my life. As a long-time fan of Annie Lennox, I was very dubious about a Christmas album. So many of the songs we hear in America are tripe, and annoying in the way that the jingle music gets stuck in your head.    I am very happy to say that I really LIKE this album. It's good music as well as being amazing renderings of the carols. And for those of us not from the UK, many of the carols may be new to us.    I really don't understand many of the comments from the 1- and 2-star reviews. The modulation and complexity of the vocals is amazing, particularly in the Hallelujah's at the end of one of the songs.    Highly recommended.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|The main problem with PS3 consoles is their thumsticks are convex.  Xbox 360 consoles have  concave thumbsticks, so they prevent the finger slips.  And it also gives the complete fun of 360 console.  Its been 2 weeks that I play with my new console without any problem.
B000063UR1|4.0|It's hard to believe this movie was made before ruthless corporate depletion of resources, the greenhouse effect and climate change became popular material for crusades. I remembered this movie with nostalgia from first viewing in the cinema, and it has survived the test of time. And it's good to see Bruce Dern in a leading role. Without recounting the plot, he's a botanist - a fancy gardener, in fact - on one of a small group of ships on station out past Saturn, with the last of Earth's forests in bug-eye-shaped pods attached to them. The company orders the pods destroyed so the ships can return to commercial use. And there the tale begins.   What will a tree-huggin' hippy do in the circumstances, when all his crewmates want to do is go home to a defoliated Earth? He's not alone, though. He has his three droids, clumsy perambulating bar fridges that cheat at cards.   A good story, and it still looks good - yet, like \\"2001\\", it was made before computer animation when everything was done, one way or another, in camera!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Unsurpassed Blu-Ray video quality.  Excellent audio quality. Good story although somewhat predictable.  The viewer, with quality home theater equipment, has a sense of immersion in the story and in the world of Pandora.  Many movies cannot stand the test of multiple viewings and therefore are not worth buying. Avatar is an exception ... It is a masterpiece deserving of a place in any video library.
B002436WFI|3.0|Originally a two-part telemovie, \\"The Color of Magic\\" uses elements of Terry Pratchett's \\"The Colour of Magic\\" (he's English, they spell it that way) and \\"The Light Fantastic\\". I found it a little more convoluted than, say, the excellent \\"Hogfather\\" movie, and to my mind David Jason doesn't match any other depiction of Rincewind the failed wizard. But he doesn't have to. And Sean Astin doesn't even try to look like an Asian tourist - anyway, how can a Hobbit not succeed in a fantasy movie? Fans won't be disappointed. The cast are all great, and with Death, the Librarian (who's NOT a monkey) and the nicely animated Luggage, it can't fail.
B00338QENI|1.0|This book was too scientific for me. I thought I would try it because of the great reviews but I am more of a fiction reader. I couldn't read past the first 10 pages. Boring......
0765326353|5.0|I admit it took me a little while to get into this book, but once I did, I was hooked straight through until the end. When I finished, I put it down and said \\"Wow,\\" then immediately went to Sanderson's website to see when the next volume will be out.<br /><br />The world building in this story is impeccable; if I have any complaint, it's perhaps that some of the scenes read a little too much like a description of playing a video game. (I, personally, don't feel the need to know which Lashing is being used and how it works every time it comes up.) But even if there are small details that bog the book down a bit, the overall sense is one of amazement and impatience to find out more.<br /><br />I have not read the Kindle edition, so cannot speak to its quality; I feel like this is a book that deserves to be had in paper, the better to appreciate the illustrations and chapter headings.
B0041EVYVK|5.0|I've been listening to this CD for over a month now and I absolutely love it. It has that special Daniel Lanois mystical touch with the added excitement of Trixie Whitley's sensual soulful singing. Wow, can she belt it out.

There is not a track on it that I've gotten tired of yet.<br />ps. check out the song from this disc \\"I Believe in You\\" on Youtube. Oh my!
B003KLGKAA|5.0|This season is the best as all previous seasons lead up to this one! The writers set it up from the first season to combine a perfect funny and dramatic season. Donna Noble is the best companion for the Dr. as she is not in love with him and her comedic, stubbornness helps the Dr. be more humane. Best season of the series but I suggest watching all the seasons first along with the specials!

0307454541|1.0|I am thoroughly enlightened now that I know that the original title of the book was \\"Men who Hate Women.\\" THAT is what the book is about. The titular character in the English version, the \\"girl with the dragon tatoo,\\" is a poorly developed character who is nothing more than a sidekick to the \\"liberated man\\" who is the main character in the book. I am guessing that the main character is the alter ego of Steig Larsson, who clearly is a man who has issues with women. Major issues. This book is promoted as a feminist book, a book that is strongly pro-woman. It is not. It is about men who hate women, and the \\"good guy\\" is a man who just likes him some sex with any woman at any time. The female characters are developed only with regard to their potential as a sexual partner, or with regard to their bitchiness or victim potential.<br /><br />Stieg, may he rest in peace, loves to write about sexual torture. Everything in his book is about sexual torture. Then, he likes to have the main character think about \\"how bad it is\\" that men engage in sexual torture. The main character is enlightened. He does enjoy S&M sex, but only with a willing and EAGER partner, who is married but is liberated enough that her husband does not mind her sex outside of marriage.<br /><br />The main ideas in this book are the following: 1-marriage should be open with regard to sex. 2-sexual torture is only good when both parties like it. 3-Men who like to engage in bondage and sexual torture with unwilling females are bad people. 3-corporate entities in general are bad, leftist types are good.<br /><br />The girl with the dragon tatoo is basically a young girl who is totally F***ed up because...drum roll please...she was sexually tortured. But she does love her some sex with the main character, who is old enough to be her father. She also loves her some sex with other women and basically anyone who is not a chauvanist PIG. Somewhere in the middle of her abnormal psychology, she is a genius who is the planet's most remarkable hacker. She has surpassed all other hackers and can figure anything out about anyone. She is not believable as a character at all. The villains are also not believable. From the social services worker who....drum roll please....sexually tortures the patients he is supposed to help, to the CEO of the family business who....drum roll please....is a serial sexual torturer of women...the plot is just so \\"out there\\" that you will be laughing out loud.<br /><br />I will give Stieg one thing though. He is good at creating suspense at important points in the story. This is enough to get you to finish the book. But I have no clue why this book is even slightly popular at all. I have a sneaking suspicion that it is only popular because of the many scenes of sexual torture. Some of y'all be needing you some therapy.le hacker.

0060936223|5.0|One of the best memoirs I've ever read. With simple, clear and beautiful language, Smith not only invites us into the intimate relationship she had with her friend Robert Mapplethorpe, but transports us to a place and time in history when everything seemed to be happening in New York. But beyond that, Smith's book speaks to the experience of all young people trying to make their way in the world, to break free and yet hold on, to that time when life seems bursting with possibilities. Moving, haunting, sad and true--what more could you want from a memoir?
B003Q6D25K|5.0|Hi all  I watched this film yesterday, it came out on Friday in SA. I went to the very first 10h00 Sunday morning show as i couldnt wait for evening time.    I had seen the first one and, naturally, i just had to watch the second follow up, without too much thinking.  I enjoyed it of course, i found it scarier than the first one..towards the middle of the film, there is a hectic fright scene and from then afterward the ball starts rolling...it gets freakier and keeps you jumping. It was awesome.    I am a sucker for these thrills and jumping out my seat just seems to increase my serotonin levels!     Anyway.Back to the film. I need to mention this fact though - the producers must have made a killing on this franchise - there are no more than 7 actors all in all in this movie (if i count the priest in the first one), not much camera work needed, and if the sound guy doesnt pitch up on set one day - cool, it will just add  to the intended feel for the movie.    All good, all i will say is well done team.    I particularly enjoyed the awkward  'realisism' in this particular movie - that they must have done their research on demonology, as is the usual well-known case of main-stream films in this genre - kids never getting hurt or murdered, its always the grandpa or the nanny to get butchered, etc. The truth is that demons will not differentiate between an adult man or a child, they get what they want.    The scene where the little kid gets 'grabbed' by the demon made my hair rise at the cinema and my skin crawl. Excellent. Unbelievable special effect there. Well done thats a 10 / out of a 10-er.  For real horror fanatics only.    I enjoyed the ending, it tied up nicely with the first one, there is a door open for perhaps a third one as well.  All in all, what else can i say..i thoroughly enjoyed the film. Its my cup of tea after all :-)      I would like to just point out something that seems to boggle my mind. It is way too easy to obtain Ouija boards these days and way too easy to summon a demon, why - just ask some kids at school and they will tell you of a few 'games' on how to summon forces from the other world. It doesnt help producers showing this actual action being done in the movie.    I totally agree with films and entertainment, but scenes like this - where forces are summoned might just pop an dangerous idea into a kid's mind.  Age restrictions dont help, besides this isnt about age.  All im saying is - dont do anything of the kind at home. Dont even think about it. Demons are real. Be warned and google some facts, about the danger and total life changing experience you might have should you mangle with these things poorly known to man.    I am all for entertainment and as ive said i am a horror film fanatic, all i watch is horror. I dont do dumb romance / comedy / laughable action.   I do sometimes do cheesy slasher if theres nothing out there at the current moment and if i am desperate!    Enjoy the movie - in my opinion its better than the first. The 'paws' of the demon in the first one ruined it for me. For crying out loud - they dont have hooves or paws! They hardly have a shell or a body. The invisibility of the demon in this movie was portrayed well, was great. Adds to the creepy feel. Scientifically correct as well i guess. The way it should be.    Kids - do not think it is 'awesome' to have a haunting, as Aly from the film thought at first.    Enjoy - great movie. Different.      El.
B00008972S|5.0|This is an outstanding package that contains DVDs, a nice booklet containing the (libretto?), photos on the DVD covers.  I spent several hours just reading the materials before I watched the show.  That's the way to do it, I get a better feel for the story, what's happening and what's about to happen.  I'd have liked to see the musical score.  I am still shocked that Natalie Wood didn't win an Academy Award for her portrayal of Maria, in my opinion one of the very finest performances in movie history.  I think that public libraries, school libraries, individuals who are interested in dance, theater, music ought to own this masterpiece.  Written in the 1950s, it's post-modern, which appeals to some and turns off others.  So, perhaps you might wish to view it first on loan from a library, etc.  I clearly give this an, \\"A+\\" for both the show and the packaging.
B002VECM72|3.0|The Blind Side (2009) is one of those heartstrings-pulling, feel-good, underdog sports movies that we get every few years from Hollywood. It tries, like so many films before it, to mimic the success of Hoosiers (1987) and Rudy (1993). And I'm surprised to say that this one works! Or at least better than most. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5. While it's not quite at the level that Hoosiers and Rudy share, it's the closest I've seen a sports movie get since them. As one of the ten films nominated in 2009 for the Best Picture Oscar, The Blind Side is really the story of the American Dream that we all idealize and strive for. It's the story of a talented young black athlete named Michael Oher who has challenges in school and at home. But what he needs is someone to help him dig himself out of the deep hole of problems he's been thrown into by his parents and society. Sandra Bullock, as Leigh Anne Tuohy, is the \\"lifeguard\\" that recognizes Michael's needs and she comes to his rescue, offering him a nurturing and safe place to live and a better high school to attend. She sees the love inside Michael and his unique talents for protecting those that he loves. He just needs to learn how to combine those talents with his natural athletic abilities so that he can perform at a high level on the football field, where he is pushed to perform due to his physical size.<br /><br />I can see why Sandra Bullock won her Best Actress Oscar for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy in this film. She is at the top of her game here like I haven't seen her since Speed (1994) and A Time To Kill (1996). She's been taking a lot of romantic comedies over the past decade, and her acting just wasn't going anywhere in those roles, even though her films had marginal financial success and she gained vast name recognition. It's with The Blind Side that she has taken the talent we've seen in her supporting roles and brought it to a leading role. After seeing The Blind Side this Fall, I'm not sure I agree with Bullock winning her Oscar for this role, but once again, I think the Academy was really awarding her for her body of work, which has culminated so far with The Blind Side.<br /><br />The Blind Side is another great looking film with beautiful cinematography and good production design. I wouldn't say that Director of Photography Alar Kivilo broke any new ground photographically, but his work here is nicely lit and saturated to give the movie the warmth that its viewers certainly feel. I think one thing missing from elevating this great visual package is a more moving musical score. I can't remember that music elevated anything for me during this film. It wasn't a bad score, but it was merely serviceable and didn't elevate the emotional punch that this film strives for.<br /><br />All in all, The Blind Side is a great family film that has something for everyone. I especially love young actor Jae Head as S.J., the fun and precocious son of Sandra Bullock's character. His relationship with Michael as a brother is both endearing and hilarious. Some of the best scenes in the film are between S.J. and Michael. And many of the family scenes where the entire family is at home eating, watching TV, or just goofing off, reminded me of similar times in my own life and family. The Blind Side is the rare film that appeals to a broad audience, but doesn't sacrifice too much of the artistry and creativity in the craft of film either. It finds a nice balance that wins in many areas.ing her Oscar for this role, but once again, I think the Academy was really awarding her for her body of work, which has culminated so far with The Blind Side.

0446195529|5.0|The real review is already in the place where you buythe book, but I would say that this is an extremely interesting book and one that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I just didn't want to get up to do any of my chores.    Like all of the books I've read of David Baldacci it is just another wonderful story.  He's really got the knack of keeping you reading.
B000Z45PEC|5.0|Although the movie was worse than the others, The toy is great. It lacks the detail to seriously be considered as a collector's item however, given that it lacks any serious degree of detail and that it was MADE IN 2010. However, as a toy it is by far better than about...ermm...98.346575432 percent of all toys on Amazon.com. This has been confirmed by a voyage forward in time to the last minute of Amazon.com's existence, where shortly before the servers were vaporized by a supernova, the toy was still better than 98.346575432 percent of all toys on the site.
B000I0QL82|4.0|Overall, this move is really good.  It's a great story, which I won't bother describing here. However, when purchasing this movie, keep in mind that it was a product of it's time. There is a black-face scene in the film that is offensive and outrageous.  You can probably find it on YouTube. It's about Lincoln freeing the slaves.  I can't even watch it - I have to skip past it every time. Unfortunately, it integral to the story line. I've seen it shown on cable, and they cut it out, but the scenes absence makes the film a little confusing.  My wife and I really like classic movies, but we're hesitant about showing this film to any of our black friends.<br /><br />I've been watching loads of classic films lately, and it seems like almost all filmmakers were falling over themselves to insert the obligatory 'offensive' part of a movie. It's unclear if most people involved were even aware of what they were doing, but I doubt anyone stopped to ask black, Hispanic and Native American communities what they thought.<br /><br />If you can stomach and get past Bing Crosby and his love interest pretending to be black, and the black actors in more housekeeping/cook roles, then the remainder of the film should be quite enjoyable.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I think that this is the best movie yet. I'm not too sure about how they are going about the 4th movie but i hope they stick to the concepts like they have in this one. A few details in the book i think were personally left out should have been included. But it is still a great movie.

B002UNMWAG|1.0|Oh its just awful! The first Boondock Saints is a great movie, great quotes, great action, great story, just great! BS II? Its just that, b.s. It's SO cheesy and cliche. The acting is terrible; its almost embarrassing to admit being a fan of the original movie. The worst part is how they replaced the detective character. The same quirky almost idiot savant of detective work who listens to classical music & sees things that NO ONE else even noticed. But wait! They made her a smoking hot female. Maybe then no-one would notice that it's the exact same character. If you like the original movie PLEASE do not watch II. Leave your memory unblemished and remember the saints as what they were.
0525423273|5.0|I have not read a book that I have enjoyed as much as Anna and the French Kiss in a while. Anna is such a fantastic character. She reminds me of so many of my friends. She is uncertain of herself, but she is still able to find friends. I loved her interest in film. St. Claire is the type of guy that every girl wants. He is sweet, friendly, loyal, and sensitive. He also has a British accent and is cute, which just adds to his awesomeness. Like a girl with a crush, I loved every moment that he was in the book and wanted to know more about him. The relationship between Anna and St. Claire was realistic. It wasn't a sudden relationship, and started as a friendship and became a romance. The other friendships in the book were also a lot like what I have with my close friendships. The personal problems that St. Claire and Anna had, were explained enough that I understood the connection between them, but not enough that it overpowered the plot. The plot was stunning and I loved every moment that I was reading this book. It was very original in contemporary fiction. I haven't seen a lot book that are this realistic. The setting was also so intense and amazing. I really want to go to Paris and find the magic that St. Claire and Anna found. Perkins has become one of my favorite authors, since reading Anna and the French Kiss. I can't wait until her next books Lola and The Boy Next Door and Ilsa and the Happily Ever, which are companion books. This book was just what I wanted and I enjoyed the characters, plot, and setting. This book is a must for fans of contemporary young adult and I highly suggest that you buy this book now!

0307454541|1.0|I got the book from a co-worker who said it was the best (she doesn't read to the extent I do which is 3 and 4 books at time.) It was all I could do to get through the story. The beginning is slow. Then you meet the main character and it begins to pick up. The middle is a bunch of mish-mash that I continued to read thinking, \\"this has got to pick up\\". Toward the end it picks up again and then falls flat at the end. What's all the hoopla?
0316098337|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, until I read about the real people who endured these horrors of being imprisoned by their own families for years and years. The book then seemed terribly trite, like reading a fictionalized holocaust novel. The reality is just far too poignant and awful to attempt a fictionalized version.

The wonderful thing of this book is that from the investing side of things many of the rules are outlined within.  This isn't an easy read, I would reccommend it to someone who really wants to take the next step in understanding investing, I have read it several times gaining small flashes of enlightment each time, I suspect that this will be on my regular re-read list for some time

B003L77GRY|4.0|I didn't think \\"Dexter\\" could possibly top Season 4, and I was right. Although Season 5 was a good season, I think it could have been a lot better. For the first time ever, the show disappointed me. (Warning: This review will contain some spoilers, so proceed with caution.)<br /><br />Season 5 picks up right where Season 4 left off...Dexter (Michael C. Hall) has discovered his wife Rita's dead body in the bathtub of their home, the final victim of the Trinity Killer. The only person who believes Dexter knows more about Rita than he's letting on is Quinn (Desmond Harrington), who does some digging into Dexter's personal life and eventually hires a shady private investigator to snoop around a bit more. However, Quinn's growing feelings for Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) force him to back off from Dexter, but it may be too late.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dexter copes with being on his own, being a single father of three, and still finding time to devote to his Dark Passenger. He begins an unusual friendship with Lumen (guest star Julia Stiles), a young woman who has been through a terrible ordeal and becomes a way for Dexter to try and atone for Rita's death.<br /><br />The storyline in Season 5 is a good one, and I really liked the addition of Lumen's character, along with the budding relationship between Deb and Quinn. However, a lot of things annoyed me about this season. Angel and LaGuerta's characters drove me crazy the entire time. I always liked Angel and never liked Maria until she hooked up with Angel in Season 4, but this season Maria went back to being her usual conniving self, and the relationship drama between her and Angel was super boring. Also, I was looking forward to more \\"Dexter as a single dad\\" issues on the show, but the writers shooed Aster and Cody out the door in a few quick episodes. I would have liked to have seen more of Aster turning into a troubled pre-teen and Dexter having to deal with all of her dramatic girl problems.<br /><br />More than that, though, what really bugged me was all of the ridiculous situations this season that required an extreme suspension of disbelief from the audience. The writers don't seem to care if their plots have 50,000 holes in them. Too many things happened in the show that made no sense at all, and things that should have been dealt with on a much larger scale were just swept under the rug and forgotten about by all parties involved. Here are just a few examples:<br /><br />1. When Dexter and Lumen are in the warehouse and Deb shows up with her cop entourage, the vigilante duo have no problem slipping out of the warehouse sight unseen. Why didn't Miami Metro have the place surrounded? Makes no sense.<br /><br />2. What was up with Jordan Chase wearing Emily's blood around her neck? What really happened to her so many years ago, and why was she still so devoted to Jordan until the bitter end? Why didn't the writers explain ANY of this?!<br /><br />3. When Liddy turns up dead and Quinn refuses to answer questions and insists on getting a lawyer, everyone just forgets about that as soon as the blood on his shoe comes back as someone else's. Quinn just gets to walk away and go on with his life. Wouldn't Deb, Maria, or anyone else be a little curious about why Quinn's name was on Liddy's surveillance equipment or why Liddy called Quinn five times right before he was killed? No one seems to care about that at all.<br /><br />4. The biggest thing that bugs me is how close Deb came to catching Dexter in the act. The only way this season could have trumped Season 4 is if Deb had come face to face with Dexter and Lumen in the camp, and that didn't happen. Obviously Quinn knows that something is up with Dexter, but it seems like he's willing to keep his mouth shut because he loves Deb and because he's smart enough to stay on Dexter's good side.

B003YFIUW8|2.0|Oh my. This book was so bad. The beginning was absolutely unbearable. If i had to read one more word about his activities during the day...excruciating. Everything in this book was so repetitive. It could have been so good. I'm absolutely shocked by how popular this book is.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I am still waiting for this to be delivered.  I have never had to wait so long before.  Next time I will just wait and purchase it from the store.  What's the point in pre-ordering if everyone else get their copy going on weeks before I receive mine.  I rate Amazon.com a -1 on customer service for this one.
1599218011|5.0|This book is amazing!  I am 14 days into the cleanse and it has changed my body, mind and health enormously.  The book is filled with the most concise, informative, motivating, health and wellness information.   I have had my book for a month and it is filled with post-its, splashes of green juices and is showing lots of wear.  I  refer to it all day for recipes, motivation, encouragement and lots of answers.  Everyone must have this book in their library and in their kitchen.  The recipes are out of this world. The tips on supplements is very specific and attainable.  I love her break down of juicers and how they differ.  The book was worth it just for this one page, rather the surfing the internet for all the desciptions.    I found Kris in 2008, through her website crazysexylife.com.  I have all of Kris Carr's books and DVD.  She is brilliant.  She is cancer warrior. Her site was the ONLY site I ever referred to for information on alternative healing during my battle with breast cancer.  Her community is filled with love, knowledge and never ending support.  She has gone out and asked all the questions that a person would want to ask of health professionals, alternative and traditonal.   She has gone to all the greatest welless clinics in the country and shares her journeys in detail.      Her book \\"Crazy Sexy Diet\\" is an amazing collection of all the info her site offers but with her fabulous wit and way of relating to a reader like a best-friend.  She is hip, funny and genuine.      This is a book that you will buy for yourself and for all your friends.    Do the cleanse she outlines, it will change your life. She holds your hand the entire time with daily motivation, tips and the much needed reminder to take care of your body and mind. It is more than a food cleanse.  It is a life cleanse!!
0930289234|5.0|A friend of mine once told me how frustrated she was at her friends when she showed them the movie \\"Casablanca\\".  They laughed at it because it was \\"so cliche\\"...and missed the point that this was *where* the cliches came from.  If you're a reader of comics who was *not* a reader of comics when The Watchmen first went to print, it might be easy to feel the same way.  Comics (or \\"Graphic Novels\\", if you wish) are not at all the same today that they were in the '80s.  They have changed a great deal, and The Watchmen was one of the early turning points.  It broke narrative down to move back and forth in time.  It changed storytelling by deftly flipping from \\"a constant stream of panels\\" to inserting pieces of scrapbook or newspaper article or other third-party way of communicating to the reader.  It also put together a fairly grim world that wasn't as black-and-white as the typical hero universe.<br /><br />In the world of 'The Watchmen', something changed in society, and people turned against superheroes.  Anyone who donned a mask and/or fought for the good guys is now either retired, undercover, has been banned.  Some capitalized on their fame, others labor under the 'blessing' of government surveillance.  The character 'Rorshach' is the plot's centerpiece:  watching from behind the scenes, Rorshach sees that a murder of one of their own has unraveled a pattern that hints at a global power play, and it is his fanatical determination to fight that helps draw back together what's left of the former team to which he belonged.<br /><br />That said, this story is not solely about him.  Instead it introduces a plethora of people--very human beneath their costumes--all of whom play a part in the final story.  Each is given intrigue and depth, and all slowly draw together to face the future.  Without giving you any spoilers, I will say that if there is one flaw in 'The Watchmen' it is a key plot twist that is rather awkward...it just didn't read well (and was handled differently in the movie).<br /><br />If you have seen the Watchmen movie, you won't see many surprises, but you will most likely enjoy 90% of this book.  If you are curious about what makes The Watchmen such a key piece of comic book history, keep in mind when you read something you've encountered before, it most likely happened here first.ntly in the movie).<br /><br />If you have seen the Watchmen movie, you won't see many surprises, but you will most likely enjoy 90% of this book.

B002ZG976U|4.0|Guys, don't be afraid to see the film \\"Burlesque\\" with your wives. Ladies, don't feel guilty asking your husbands to go. I caught the film over the weekend with my wife Alison (her pick), and ended up enjoying it quite a bit.<br /><br />Christina Aquilera is both down-to-earth and sexy as the country girl who wants to make it in the big city, Cher lords it over everyone as the tough-but-lovable boss of the burlesque house, and Stanley Tucci is once again everyone's gay best friend. Making all of the preceding palatable to the guys in the audience is the general air of sexiness pervading the proceedings, in large part generated by the wonderfully skimpy costumes worn by Ms. Aquilera and the variety of women performing on stage with her. The songs are very good, too.<br /><br />Trust me, guys, if you owe your wife a movie pick after dragging her to numerous sci-fi action thrillers, you can do worse than heading out to this one.  Kudos to writer/director Steve Antin for delivering a fun night at the movies.
B0027G783W|5.0|This is an outstanding CD, very sophisticated and thoughtful. It certainly reveals Moby as a master as a writer, musician, and arranger. Much of the work is haunting in its beauty or orchestral in is ambitions. There is a sense of sorrow or lament in many of the selections but these compositions are multi-faceted, taking the listener from grief to resolution or from sorrow to acceptance. It would be a big mistake to label this CD dark or sad for it moves beyond a single emotion.  The electronic instrumentation is lush and superb. Lush is a good word to describe these multi-layered compositions. Some selections are a bit hypnotic and trance evoking. The juxtaposition of vocal selections and instrumentals works perfectly in this CD for the listener is never startled as he transitions from one selection to another.  Like a multi-movement concerto, the CD is best when listened to in one setting. There is a sense of artistry and experimentation, as if Moby wished to push himself with this CD. The music combines southern blues and gospel from African American churches as well as chants from mystic choirs. Despite the fact that many accomplished vocalists were used to create this CD, the presentation is seamless with the vocals never taking over the instrumentals. It is hard for me to identify favorites, even though Wait For Me is outstanding. It is so nice to find a CD that is top rate from first song to last.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|There seems to be a song missing (The Love is Gone is actually GONE) or there is a disk issue where it's skipped for some reason.  As it's one of my favorite songs in the movie, I was more than a little disappointed.<br /><br />this is our family's favorite Christmas movie... we watch it year after year, and getting all the kids (now grown) around to tv to watch is one of our family traditions.

0307473473|4.0|This book is a page turner and a great story that made me buy the Swedish Blu-Ray based on the novel.  Too bad the author died b4 the publication of this great trilogy. (The Girl Who Played With Fire & The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest are the other parts).  Each book stands on it's own quite well and of course the first one requires that you read the other two.  Action packed, somewhat violent to say the least and filled with detail about computers, the internet, hacking, spys, politics, Sweden, publishing, law and a host of other compellingly presented features to provide the most demanding nitpickers among us.<br /><br />The female main character was most intriguing and different from what I usually read about and a joy in the uniqueness.  The story unfolds at such a pace to hook the reader into the adventure.<br /><br />I recommend this book wholeheartedly.
B0048IMZMG|4.0|Enjoying Taylor Swift music is all about managing expectations.  If I'm looking for a vocal masterpiece, I'm not going to enjoy listening to her.  She's not a bad vocalist at all; she's a fine singer.  But she's not a Martina McBride.  However, if you're looking for some fun music that reminds you of love and life during your younger (or current) days, this is the stuff to listen to.  I always feel a bit nostalgic after listening and certainly enjoy the sweet songs as they play.  So, for the gym, a long car ride, or any time you're in the mood for something not too serious, this album is the perfect pick.

B004289ZW0|5.0|Like some, I bought the Wi-Fi only iPad because I specifically didn't want the 3G capability.  But  in hindsight, I did miss at least the  GPS capability. So to make up for my \\"remorse\\", I ordered the external bluetooth GNS 5870. It pairs quickly with the iPad buetooth and locked on to  6 satellites (based on one app's notification) through a large upstairs window in about 2 or 3 minutes. It was a little faster I believe through my car windshield. And it stayed locked on  even after walking briefly into a shopping mall with it in my shirt pocket.  How accurate? Two iPad  apps say accuracy is within 30 feet but this reading is through an apartment window. The accuracy of  Wi-Fi only was reported as 213 feet. But the GNS 5870  works very well all by itself and thats why five stars. I would not rate it less just because the \\"touch and slide\\" on and off is  slightly finicky and  can be unexpectedly activated by certain movements within a coat pocket etc. Its very portable at 1 3/4 x 3 inches and has a nice rubberized body except for the 1/2 inch wide plastic touch strip. The total GNS 5870 cost at $160.00, means I'm paying about $30.00 more than the iPad 3G model would have cost.    None of my views would matter though, if the GNS 5870 cannot work with the few iPad mapping, navigation, and GPS apps that are compatible with the Wi-Fi only iPad. So I discuss these apps not as an endorsement, but just to show that the GNS 5870  does work well without Wi-Fi and with no extra expense of a 3G data plan.  It should be noted however, that this does not replace the usefulness or maybe the overall accuracy of the iPad 3G, as the iPad 3G  has three modes of triangulation: Wi-Fi, 3G and GPS, which provide navigation assistance when some of the modes like satellite are not available. My uses however, may be in areas of no Wi-Fi and no cell towers. In this case, my Wi-Fi only IPad with the GNS 5870 will probably be as useful as the 3G model.     That said, I have tried all the following apps riding in my car with the GNS 5870 resting on the dash. The device tracks fine with the following apps that store map data internally in the iPad: Topo Maps, MotionX GPS HD and the iPhone app Navigon MyRegion. It also works fine with the iPad Google Maps but only in \\"classic\\" and \\"terrain\\" views.  This is because Google's map base is not stored internally in the iPad and must be first accessed on the fly through  Wi-Fi. The \\"satellite\\" and \\"hybrid\\" views are too large I believe to be cached in the app itself. For the same reasons, the GNS 5870 does not play well with Google Earth  because the app does not store large data fields internally.  But smaller, less memory intensive map areas  and routes in Google Maps (\\"classic\\" and \\"terrain\\")  can be cached and used later using only the GNS 5870.  These are erased from the cache however after any changes are made. The GNS 5870 works and tracks with the app Big World although this app also uses the Google Maps data base and I'm not sure how much of that map base is stored internally.     But if you are having Wi-Fi only iPad \\"buyers remorse\\",  and you still want  GPS, this is one excellent way to go. And if I get lost 30 feet from where I want to go then I'm in big trouble anyway.
B002ZG999U|2.0|Each star from \\"Expendables\\" alone in any other movie worked just fine. But bring them all together on a screen and it's a disaster waiting to happen.    In fact, only one decent performance really stood out... by Jason Statham. The rest were just filling in the gaps (even Stallone). I have no idea what was the point of having Dolph Lundgren (Drago from Rocky IV) in this movie and the movie itself was quiet chaotic. Stallone should have used more money on the screenwriter and drop some of the cast (like Bruce Willis, Arnold you-know-who, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren). Jet Li did not fit into the cast at all, IMHO.    But I think Sean Connery probably feels left out. Wesley Snipes could have used extra money right now. Hell, Chuck Norris could have used a break from the \\"Total Gym\\" infomercials.    Overall, there was absolutely no depth to any of the characters with a very \\"safe\\" story line.

B0045ODPKY|4.0|Ok, this is not a product review. I merely want to help you decide which version to buy.<br /><br />For the first time ever, I personally prefer a theatrical edition over an unrated director's cut, and I'll tell you why. The version shown in theaters was more fun, and made a lot more sense. Unlike typical director's cuts, this one doesn't just add cut footage and tweek some of the editing, it actually uses alternate takes, with alternate events and outcomes, that fundamentally change the story. Simply put, without giving spoilers, the director's cut is far more bleak, and makes the idea of a sequel fairly pointless (or at least insurmountable). In fact, the alternate takes, if one looks back on them, invalidate the entire reason for the story in the first place, making it all a redundant waste of time. Again, trying to avoid spoilers here, so let me just make up a silly analogy that will convey the idea. Imagine a convoluted story about trying to, say, poison a city's water supply, and in the director's cut version you discover afterwards that the bad guys just happened to have someone planted who, by happenstance, already works at the water plant and could have poisoned the water at any time over a lunch break. Seriously, it's that sort of stupid.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Salt when I saw it. It's a fantastic, exuberant movie that could easily be the start of a really enjoyable franchise. The director's cut, however, I did not enjoy. It did not add anything of substance beyond a few fairly insignificant scenes that were extended by a minute or two, and the alternate takes were far less satisfying than the originals, and only made the movie depressing and, honestly, rather stupid (and I'm far more partial to clever, intelligent stories that make sense). I truly believe that if you decide to go for the director's cut you'll be robbing yourself of seeing the vastly more logical and exciting story that was presented in the theatrical version.<br /><br />My recommendation: Go for the original, and avoid the director's cut. The latter is not an expanded product, it's an alternate story, and a bad one at that.<br /><br />Update: I've now had the chance to see the third version of this film (yes, a third unique version!), which I was unaware of when I wrote the above commentary. It's the \\"extended\\" version, and appears to only be available on the Blu-Ray disc. First off, unlike the Director's Cut, the Extended edition is actually a very good story. Some sequences are moved around or changed a bit, but this time it works, and the stupid elements have been removed (only one thing I disliked was retained, but at least in this version it had meaning). It also has a completely different final chapter, and I mean that in a big way, as in the story literally goes in a totally different direction, with new dialogue and scenes in other locations, etc.<br /><br />My original recommendation still holds, but I'd like to sum-up the three versions in this way:<br /><br />Theatrical: Overall best of the lot. Riveting story, exciting plot, lots of surprises and twists, and left wide-open for a sequel. (Also note that the sequel, which is already planned, will resume this version's storyline.)<br /><br />Director's Cut: Unsatisfying. The alternate material is more morose, and undermines the inherent logic of the plot. Ruins any real chance of sequel making any sense by turning it from Die Hard into David and Goliath (and David's got a broken arm and is near-sighted --and Goliath has a Death Star). Worth watching eventually for novelty's sake, but in my opinion not for entertainment value. Prime candidate for Rifftrax.<br /><br />Extended Edition: Very enjoyable. Combines most of the best elements of the Theatrical and Director's Cut, then slaps on a completely different ending. The style and sentiment seemed to be trying to emulate the neatly packaged, tidy spy stories of the '60s and '70s. This version ties the story up in a nice, neat bow of the instantly recognizable \\"divine justice\\" tradition (and you won't care, because it's just darned cool). This version is standalone and finite, with no hint at a sequel (and a sequel to this version would somewhat go against Salt's apparent wishes, but that's really all I can say without spoiling it for you). Definitely watch this version if you can get ahold of the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Ok, that's enough outta me on this subject.

B000OPPBEQ|2.0|The picture quality for this is not much better than the DVD. I recently found out that not all blu-rays are going to be blu-ray quality picture because not all movie where shot in HD. This just happens to be one of those that did not.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Okay so this adapter works really well with the new Macbook Air (11 inch) 2010 model.  I use Windows 7 64-bit on my air and this works perfect with it out of the box.    In OSX - plug in adapter, go into system preference and choose which display to show the desktop/menubar on by dragging its title bar over to the new monitor/tv.  Go into the sound panel and choose the hdmi port as the port to output audio too.    In Windows 7 - its much more intuitive, it automatically will clone the display on both screens and the audio auto outputs to the monitor/tv; if you just want the screen on the monitor only right click on desktop, click screen resolution and choose which monitor is the default.    As a side note - apple really needs to provide an option to turn off the laptops screen when you are outputting to a monitor/tv as there is no option - Windows gives you this option out of the box; and it also is much easier to output audio/video from Windows to external displays - a few things Apple really needs to start doing.

1608870081|5.0|This pop-up adventure is quite a feast for the eyes to say the least. The interactive parts of the pop-up book are fun, raise interesting questions, and provide different insight into the filming and story of the Harry Potter franchise. While really designed for children, there is actually a large amount of trivia and knowledge on the books and movies to keep fans of all ages entertained.     When I was browsing through a few different interactive HP books, I really felt like this particular title brought a lot more to the table in terms of information, and overall detail to the franchise. If you are interested in a fun, visually and physically appealing and stimulating look at the HP franchise, then this title is one surely not to miss!

0525423273|4.0|If you are looking for a feel-good chick-lit to read by your Christmas tree, \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" is a book for you. This novel is as chick-y a lit as it gets.<br /><br />Anna is sent to Paris to spend her senior year at a boarding school. Of course she doesn't want to go - her life, her best friend, her potential boyfriend, her little brother and mom are in Atlanta. But Anna doesn't sulk for long, she quickly meets new friends and this one totally hot and totally unavailable boy Etienne St. Clair. I wonder what happens next;o)<br /><br />\\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" doesn't break any new ground, doesn't provide insight into anything of importance, it doesn't strive to be realistic or profound. I can find a hundred flaws with it. But I don't want to. This novel is light, clean, funny (I especially enjoyed Anna's father, who I imagine to be just like Nicholas Sparks with his books where someone always dies in the end), cute and sweet, with likable characters and a measured amount of teen angst. It is a quick and engaging read and a perfect holiday story.<br /><br />\\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" will never make it to my shelf of favorites, but I will probably read Stephanie Perkins's next novel if it comes out around the same time next year and is equally cute and inoffensive.
B002MW50KO|5.0|With his gravely voice backed by an angelic choir, Bob Dylan has succeeded in unintentionally creating the best Christmas comedy album of all time.  The only other contemporary male singer who could come close to matching the hilarious juxtaposition of incredibly smooth and gravel is Tom Waits.  I'm listening to the album right now and can't stop laughing, especially when the angelic choir paves the way for Bob to belt out a rough 'Hark the Heralds Angels Sing' or 'Little Drummer Boy'.  For me, this album is priceless because it never fails to make me laugh.  My stomach actually hurts.
0446579939|4.0|Nicholas, as one of your fans, I have some suggestions based on The Lucky One. You could have divided the book into Part One: The Background which would have been the first 370 pages of the paperback version and then had Part Two: The Exciting Part which included the last 15 pages (including the Epilogue). Incidentally, we are now on to your little trick of putting the most exciting \\"surprise\\" conclusion hidden in the Epilogue on the very last page of the book.<br /><br />Why don't you consider collaborating with a graphic novelist for a portion of your next book's Part One because this one, with all due respect, really dragged and didn't deserve 370 pages. That would definitely get the literary community's attention. Most of us knew Part One anyway by just reading the synopsis on the back cover. Also, how about a little more descriptive detail. I don't recall that you ever mentioned anything about Thibault, the protagonist's, appearance other than he had long hair and you didn't even tell us what color long hair. There was more description about the dog than there was about Logan.<br /><br />For those new to Sparks, he manages to tell a love story without every mentioning any body parts, never uses a swear word and often includes a church or pastor in his stories  and if there is any sex it is highly sanitized and very brief. I think he has a nice mother and eats a lot of apple pie. Eventually he may decide to write about some place other than North Carolina but I suppose there are a million more potential stories there. Keep up  the good work, Nicholas.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />David C. Ashley
B002JVWQT6|5.0|Modern Family is honestly my favorite show on television. I love that that you can watch it with almost anybody and not feel awkward about the subject material. It can go from laugh out loud funny in one scene to heartwarming the next.     At first, I thought Modern Family was simply a \\"mockumentary\\" trying to copy all the successes of shows like The Office, but it really is unique. If you haven't seen it, I'd recommend watching the Pilot Episode, Fizbo, or My Funky Valentine. Everyone has their own favorite episodes though, so you really can't go wrong.
B001F3FUK6|1.0|Hi Everyone. Boy did they get it wrong what a crap slow boring movie with really bad acting. Also there wasn't any feeling in the movie you didn't care if everyone died including superman himself. Brandon Routh isn't meant to be superman no afence to him it's not his fault they picked him to be superman. Louis Lane why bother getting someone who doesn't suit the role what so ever. Superboy as well come on and where was the action the slowness of the movie drag on too dam long. Tom Welling is meant to be superman and thats it! I don't watch much smallville but what I have seen is really good and they have good stories and good cast that can actually act. Also why always use Lex Luthor. In Smallville I've been told there's so many other villians used in the series why can't the superman movies have something different someone different that's really cool and has great powers. I think Tom Welling would make them a huge profit because smallville and non-smallville fans like myself would go and watch the movie. I think they should make one called Superman: \\"The beginning\\" Starring Tom Welling.

0385528752|5.0|An excellent book that describes how to make positive changes in an organization or in a society.  Unlike some books that say that change is important, this book says that change is important, and here are specific steps on how to make it happen.  I am painfully watching an organization flounder around as they ignore key elements that the Heath brothers describe.  Change isn't always simple. but it's easier to achieve when you consider the simple approaches presented in this book.  Don't invent the solution -- find the person who already is successful.  Don't make change difficult -- remove obstacles from the path (like including self addressed, stamped envelopes in letters requesting donations).  \\"Made to Stick\\" by the Heath's was outstanding.  This book is absolutely wonderful.  I anxiously look forward to their next book!
B002IKLZZY|5.0|I won't go into a long review of the story of North by Northwest.  Many other reviews do this justice far better then I ever could.  I will say, though, that this is one of my favorite movies by Alfred Hitchcock.    The quality of the DVD is excellent, one of the best transfers I've ever seen and it looks stunning on my HDTV.  The bonus features are also outstanding, more then enough for any DVD bonus features junkie or Hitchcock fan.    I highly recommend this.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Yes, you can get more extensive collections of Beatles music, and yes, this doesn't include every hit they ever had, but it is just perfect for casual fans like me.  I only really like the familiar hits you hear on oldies stations, and those are included here.  This is also a really good remastering job.
0399536108|1.0|Obviously most of the reviews entered here are coming from friends of the author because they are so off the mark and exaggerated. This a perfect example of how Internet savvy promoting can manipulate information seekers and book buyers to invest in crap. This book is so thin, the insight is so unfounded, and the writer's self-proclaimed success has no basis for spouting off his methodology on how to live life (or rather, how to scam the system). If you read between the lines, he cheated his way through school, spouts off ignorant criticism about formal and advanced education, and pontificates about his big life experiences. (Is he even 30 years old?) His accomplishments are short and insignificant, and for him to be profiting on his \\"expertise\\" is another sad example of how the unregulated new media allows people like this to wrap up a nice package and find vulnerable followers who will only get hurt at the expense of his profit. Please don't waste your money!
B0041T4O9Y|4.0|My son was required to read this book for high school over the summer so I read it with him.  Talk about one person's journey!!!  The story allows us to glimpse into another world where nothing is taken for granted and life is filled with setbacks.  Amazingly, even in these circumstances the human spirit prevails.  William is so filled with determination and hope, even though it may be difficult for us to understand how he continues on in the face of such adversity.      Not only does the book beautifully tell William's story and achievements, it also tells the story of an African nation and the soul of its people.  Reading this book may open your heart and mind to the many possibilities there are in life and the countless different ways to be in the world.
0767020308|4.0|The transfer was less than ideal, bringing it's overall rating down to four stars.  There is a small white line that dances across the top of the screen most of the way through the picture.  But this is the it's only shortcoming.  This version of \\"Emma\\" is the best I have yet seen.  Though this film is not of the caliber of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", it is a very worthy effort, offering great entertainment.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This show is great! Even though it follows all the standard formulations for zombie movies (IE- Night of the Living Dead) I was on the edge of my seat the entire episode each and every episode. I cant wait for season two.
B001EN71CW|5.0|First of all I am a complete Joss Whedon Fan. Watched Buffy, Angel, etc. Unfortunately, I never heard about Frirefly until my friend told me about it and of course it was cancelled by then. This show is great! The actors are funny, the story is well written, and everything is great about it. I wish Fox never cancelled it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Some animated films work better than others.  In our crowded market of animated masterpieces, Despicable Me stands out.  Better than Megamind, and on par with Hercules/(and likely Yogi Bear), Despicable is NOT.<br /><br />My first reaction was that Gru was a stolen name!  Really, Sergio Aragonnes and Mark Evanier created Groo the Wanderer, so we thought the worst.  We were wrong.<br /><br />Gru (Steve Carell) is delightful, and his supporting cast of 3 young children, and hench things are great.  His arch nemesis (voiced by Brand) is meaner, and leaner, yet this film just may define villain/hero differently.  Megamind took a villain and turned him into a hero, but this film is different, it turns him into a DAD, one step better.<br /><br />Animation wise, it rocks.  Humorwise, gotta love it.  Theme wise, no one is beyond redemption.  Plotwise, sometimes the most obscure work the best.  Steal the moon, sure Gru, give it a shot!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta
0756405890|4.0|This is a book for grown-ups who can appreciate a good story, don't mind putting in the time to read hundreds of pages, are strong enough to carry around a fat book, and can be patient enough with a young writer who starts at the end of the story to tell that same story through narrative told by the grown up in question.  If after all that you're still game (you should be), its a really good book.  I could not put it down.      I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for 38 years and sometimes it gets so predictable and thin that it sinks to the level of pringles - you know they won't be great but you want to eat them anyway.  Vampires, demons, shapeshifters, sarcasm and blood can get a little old.  It takes a lot to surprise me these days and a good writer to engage me.  This book engaged me, my brother and sister, my husband and several friends --- and those are just the folks I know.  It was surprising that Rothfuss writes beautifully, surprising that the story seems new and interesting, and surprising that it feels so sincere.  These things do not happen often.      Why not five stars?  It's his first book and I am not sure how #2 will be.  The most difficult part of The Name of the Wind is the length of time it's taking the sequel to come out.  Its hard to wait, but I literally come back to this part of the site over and over just to see if its ready yet.      That anticipation hasn't happened in a long time :)
B002G1YPH0|1.0|Ref:    - i5 750 CPU  - Cooler Master RR-B10-212P-G1 Hyper 212 Plus CPU Cooler  - Cooler Master Elite 330 case  - System operating at default    1st - This cooler does not fit the same manufacturer's mid tower case. The cooler extends 1/8\\" beyond the side panel. Go figure. A side panel mod will fix this.    2nd - The system operated at catastrophic temperatures. No matter which position this cooler is installed on the CPU, no matter what thermal compound [Cooler Master & others] is applied according to manufacturer's instructions, this cooler performed the following uniform and troubling results, in all cooler positions:    Idle: 55c-57c.  Stressed: 90c plus. [Stress test was immediately terminated].  These results can be system damaging.    The cooler was removed, the thermal compound was removed from the CPU and the cooler, re-applied and the cooler was reinstalled 90/180/270 degrees with the same results. Inspection of the the thermal compound on the cooler showed that only the 2 center heat pipes came in direct contact with the CPU. And those 2 center pipes only came in direct contact with the edges of the CPU.    I disassembled the entire build and removed the motherboard to detach the cooler mounting bracket.     I then reassembled the build and installed the Intel cooler. You know, the free one supplied with the CPU, that only takes a very few minutes to install. The Intel cooler performed the following results with the system operating at default settings:    Idle: 38c-41c  Stressed: 72c-75c  These results are reasonable, but I have always experienced lower temps with after market coolers in lieu of the CPU supplied coolers.    I am a firm believer of, \\"The cooler the system, the better\\" and I have always used Arctic Cooling Freezer Pro coolers, with their well machined base, with no problems. This time I thought that I would try a direct contact pipe cooler for this build. Maybe it was just a bad cooler. Maybe not! But, it now seems that it was a very poorchoice on my part.     All of this took several hours.     I won't be using this cooler again.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|After seeing a miniseries of Follett's &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; I couldn't wait to pick up one if his books. This weighty tome did not disappoint.

B001LF4ARC|4.0|Some really interesting observations and stories... as someone who is NOT obsessed with Mac, I think I wasn't as engaged as someone who perhaps is a fanatic. I like the idea of creating chapter takeaways, though I didn't find the takeaways from the book that useful as Job's processes seem very unique to his business.

The story is original and creative, and a really fun adventure. My son loved the book as well, and it sparked his interest in Egyptian mythology. We can't wait to read the sequel!
0198326769|4.0|Shelly Browne     Mr. Slater  English 9  13 December 2010    The Boy in the Striped Pajamas    In the book The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne some of the conflicts that happened could have been explained a little better but over all it was an amazing book and I recommend it to all people. The book was easy to fallow what was happening and I wanted to keep reading it. It was published in New York in 2006.      The Boy in the Striped Pajamas had a good plot over all but in some of the events leading up to the climax were a little bit confusing and I think they could have been explained better. In the story Bruno and his family are living in there house in Berlin and they have the best house and friends. One day they come back from school and Maria their maid is packing up all their stuff and they figure out that they have to move to Out-With. When there at their new home its awful until Bruno walks along a fence behind their back yard and finds a friend in striped pajamas, Shamuel. Bruno brings him food and they talk every day but they can never cross the fence to play with each other. Until one day they find out that they are going to move back to Berlin because none of them like it in Out-with. When Bruno figures this our he decides to slip through the fence and play with his friend Shamuel.    The characterization and conflict in this story are well put together and it is very clear on the description of the characters and the conflict of the story. In the Boy in the Striped Pajamas Bruno is the main character. At the beginning of the story he has a really good life.  His grandparents live in Berlin with them and his house is the best for exploring and finding new places in their house. Then when they move to Out-With his grandparents are not there and there are no friends to play with, Bruno has a really boring life until he finds Shamuel but he is his only friend. The antagonist who is the Solders don't really change they keep doing the same things to the Jews until later but that isn't during the time period of the book. Bruno's father quit his job of being a solder at the end of the book and he realizes that his job is really bad.      The main theme that stood out to me in this book was treat others the way that you want to be treated because you never know what is going to happen in life. Something like this story will most likely never happen again in real life. But this theme can refer to things in everyday life. No one likes to be treated poorly so don't treat others that way and people wont be mean to you. It shows us a big message of what happened in the past and what life was like back then.      My overall Opinion of this book is that it was an amazing book even though it was sad. This story is really well written and because of that it makes it easy to understand. There is a lot of good detail but I think that there could be a little bit more detail to make it more emotional and to make a better picture of what is happening in your head. I also think they should have explained some of the big events that happened a little better. I really liked the story line and how they wrote the book and set it up.    Works Cited  Boyne, John. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. New York, 2006.
0205313426|5.0|This has always been the \\"bible\\" at the New York Times, and for good reason.<br /><br />For those people who love to write, without those ridiculous abbreviations (i.e. LOL or BFF), this book is a must. The fact that it is not a textbook in every English class, in both high school and college, is beyond me.<br /><br />If you give this as a gift (which is what I did), the first time the recipient has to write a term paper, essay, etc., they will thank you profusely.

B003L77GRO|4.0|I started watching Season Five with apprehension.  \\"How are they going to top the \\"Trinity Killer\\" seasons?\\" was my main thought, and, at first, I was somewhat disappointed.  I felt that the writers were definitely twisting the plot to suit their needs in a way that was not believable -- Dexter saying \\"It was me\\" when the police discover poor Rita in the bathtub -- and of course, Quinn being the character who is on to Dexter when no one else seems to be the least bit suspicious.  I mean, come on, Dexter has a work schedule that gives new meaning to the word \\"flextime\\" -- no one else thinks he's a little weird?  But the amazing Michael C. Hall has such a grip on me, holding me enthralled as a viewer, that I had to keep watching.<br /><br />And I was so glad I did.  Julia Stiles has to be my favorite guest actor yet in this remarkable series, and her performance was so compelling, I couldn't even wait to watch each episode On Demand.  I had to watch it on Sunday night at 9.  I loved the way she developed from a victim in the throes of posttraumatic shock, so emotionally devastated from her experience she can hardly function, to part of Team Dexter.  The chemistry between she and Hall was palpable, and Episode 11, the next to the last, had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Johnny Lee Miller as the corrupt and totally despicable Jordan Chase was rivetting, as was the ex-cop turned criminal informant played by Peter Weller (one of the stellar supporting roles in this season).  Some have criticized Miller's lack of character development as a flaw in the season, but I think the writers had to keep the plot moving without dragging Season Five out too long.  This may have been done because Julia Stiles was, unfortunately, only available to them for one season.<br /><br />The fact that Season Five ended as it did, with Julia Stiles' character Lumen leaving, is why I can't give this five stars.  This definitely needed another season.  Quinn backs off, he is also given a reprieve that defies reality, and it's as if the writers were just in a hurry to tie up all the plot lines a little too neatly.  There were other instances that needed more fleshing out, too.  The relationship between Angel and LaGuerta is annoying; I can't figure out if he's sleeping on the couch or they're really separated.  Little hints are dropped, but nothing is really revealed. The character of the Nanny, played by Maria Doyle Kennedy, another fine actress, also needs more work.  We saw her fearless confrontation of Dexter when he leaves her with Harrison all night without so much as a phone call.  Then, she turns into Mary Poppins and even goes with Harrison to Orlando to stay with the grandparents.  Aster goes from a girl on the brink of juvenile deliquency and irrational hatred of Dexter to the sweet kid you always wanted her to be in the blink of an eye, too.  It's not a problem with the excellent acting or writing; it's a problem of too little time to do it all.  And that is a shame, because with a series of this caliber, nothing should be left on the cutting room floor.ty, and it's as if the writers were just in a hurry to tie up all the plot lines a little too neatly.

B002ZG98PA|5.0|This is the best Disney movie of late folks. It is not the traditional Disney Prince & Princess story but it is excellent nonetheless.     All movies these days are so dark and serious - or crude. Tangled side-steps all of those pitfalls. If I were to describe it in one word I would say, \\"Charming.\\" And that's not a word I like to use in conversatioin. The other word would be 'innocent.'    In my humble opinion, this movie is a thousand times better than Princess and the Frog. Princess and the Frog has some 'dark' elements to it, which really ruined it for me personally. While it isn't the most original movie ever, it holds its own in every aspect.     I went to a Saturday afternoon showing and I couldn't help but notice the audience particpation. For instance, when Rapunzel and Flynn went into the town and her hair was decorated with flowers and made managable thanks to little girls, the entire audience oohed and awed. I myself was blown away by that scene. Now I'm actually a 19 yr old guy - I love war movies, westerns, and good ole 'kid' movies. I really liked this movie.     The one thing I didn't appreciate was how inconsitent the evil Mother Gothel seemed. Sometimes she was like a true loving mom - if only for a brief time. It was just a little confusing and unsettling.     Also, I was suprised how well it 'got away with' all the musical scenes. Most movies today don't even try to do that anymore, and I like the fact that Tangled did decide to implement that seemingly forgotten technique.     Bottom line: It's a good, clean, light-hearted movie with great animation, character development, and vocal talent.   I would recommend this to anyone.
B00003CXTG|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, the action scenes are astounding, but as far as the story and characters go, imagine the opposite of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". I didn't feel anything for the major characters and was actually hoping for a Japanese bomb or bullet to take out Affleck, Hartnett or Beckinsale--not that they're bad actors but thought the characters were trite \\"gosh golly America\\" throwbacks of propaganda films.  Ignore the drama, watch for the explosions...
B000H6SXMY|5.0|My husband LOVES Friends!  But I've been putting off buying him the set because it's so expensive.  Amazon had the best price - over $100 cheaper than anywhere else!  Needless to say, he enjoyed his birthday gift!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|What can i say... WAS AMAZING!! When I had the opportunity to watch AVATAR I felt in love!! I watch it like 3 or 4 times more at cinema and then I got the DVD version. All was perfect!! The movie and the delivery. I'M RLLY HAPPY :'D
B00428CPUY|5.0|The festival is a unique undertaking for which EC deserves more than praise.  It is a blast to see so many true stars jam together.  This DVD is much better than the show made available in movies shortly after the event.  Having attended the festivals, I will attest that this is the next best thing to being there.  I hope there will be a next time.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Of all the CD's I own, I find that \\"Dangerous\\" gives the listener a trip into music itself. The album is of course for entertainment purposes, but the music is a journey into music itself. The melodies, the lyrics are brilliant to the point that I consider this to be MJ's best album.    1. Jam. An electrifying start to the album. The lyrics say that world problems aren't enough to get MJ down.  The music video with Michael Jackson and Michael Jordan is really great as well. 10/10    2. Why You Wanna Trip On Me. This is a pretty good song after 30 or so listens. At first I really hated it, but   after taking time, and really reading the lyrics (which are about social ills), it really grew on me. 8/10    3. In the Closet. A very sexy song. Some might call it a little too mechanical, but in my opinion it's a very daring,  sexy song by Michael. The music video with Michael Jackson and Naomi Campbell is very sexy as well. 10/10    4. She Drives Me Wild. This song, features a rap by Aqil Davidson, who was a member of Wreckx-n-Effect. I felt that I didn't give this song much credit in my previous review. I have listened to this song over and over again, and I feel that this song, while not a great song, is not simply filler material. 7/10    5. Remember The Time. One of my favorite songs of this album. It's very fun, the lyrics are very simple, but the   music is so incredible. Of course, the ad libs are incredible. The music video with Michael Jackson, Eddie Murphy is really great. The scene with the Egyptian dancing and when MJ dissolves into sand at the end is very cool. 10/10    6. Can't Let Her Get Away. This song, I feel has been unfairly neglected. It has been called \\"MJ's worst song ever\\" by some, because of the overly repetitive lyrics. I was among those people. But I have, once again, listened carefully, read the lyrics carefully, and I have decided that this song is very overrated! Melody is powerful, and even though the lyrics tend to be over repetitive, someone told me that what I perceived as overly repetitive lyrics were suited to this song. So, I now like this song. 8/10    7. Heal The World. MJ was always dedicated to saving the world and making the world a better place. We should really listen to this song, read the lyrics and try to make a better world for the future. MJ said that he was so proud of this song. And he has good reason to. 10/10    8. Black Or White. This is one of those songs that will never change color, never fade away to dust with time. It's simply an eternal song, and not only that, the message about racial harmony is so uplifting. The music video, which is also known for it's comedy, is amazing. 10/10    9. Who Is It. This song is so similar to Billie Jean that it can almost be called Billie Jean 2. But where Billie Jean is very quiet, with emotion simmering beneath the surface, this song really lets the emotion flow out. Incredibly passionate, this song is my second favorite song from this album.  10/10    10. Give In To Me. This song which is the closest MJ has ever come to presenting a hard rock song, this song is amazing, and the guitar solo from Slash adds to the overall melancholy of the piece. This is a song that really has a combination of various levels of despair; fury, sadness, and melancholy. 10/10    11. Will You Be There. AMAZING. My favorite song of this album. Why? Because not only does it have the Ode To Joy part from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the angels singing, and the melody is so powerful, and MJ delivers this so perfectly, that it seems divine. 10/10    12. Keep The Faith. This is one of those songs that manages to uplift me when it's raining, when I'm having a hard day. Lyrics are inspirational, and MJ's vocals are amazing (of course!). 10/10    13. Gone Too Soon. Why do people say that this is sappy? This is a loving, heartfelt tribute to Ryan White, a victim of AIDS. His vocals are the perfect match to this piece. We all know how Usher sang this song at the Michael Jackson Memorial, and it was absolutely horrible (but the idea was so touching!) compared to MJ's. No one will ever come close to him! 10/10    14. Dangerous. This song, where MJ is more talking that singing at full power, is so seductive, and the perfect way to end the album. I recommend you check out MJ's performance at the 1995 MTV Awards. His dancing is amazing! 10/10    This gives a total score of 132/140, which is 94%, which means this is a GREAT album.    * * *    As I said before, this album presents a journey into music itself. Songs such as Jam, In The Closet, Remember The Time, She Drive Me Wild, Can't Let Her Get Away are for fun, and they are primarily intended to put the listeners in the mood for dancing. Songs such as Why You Wanna Trip On Me, Heal The World, Black Or White, Keep the Faith are inspirational. Songs such as Who Is It, Give In To Me, Will You Be There, Gone Too Soon, Dangerous are packed with emotion. With all these wonderful pieces, this is the album, along with Thriller and Bad, that will shadow the music industry with its sheer power. What would music be had it not been for Michael Joseph Jackson?
B003NFM3JK|3.0|First of all I have to say I really wanted to like this film. I had high expectations for it. It was reasonably faithful to the book, the characters were well done. But there were a few things done in the name of 3D that took away from the story in the movie and made it seem silly in the end. Scrooge taking a fall backwards off his porch<br />when he sees the \\"Marley Knocker\\". The way the Ghost of Christmas Past's Cap goes off like a roman candle sending Scrooge across the sky. The way the Ghost of Christmas Present takes him around on his visit. The way the Ghost of Christmas Present \\"dies\\"  In the clock tower.  The events of the visit with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. The shrinking of Scrooge, the hearse chase. A huge departure from the book, or a Hollywood attempt to \\"improve\\" upon the original story to\\" punch it up\\". None of which helped the story at all. Otherwise visually this was a great looking movie, Even the soundtrack is a wonderful one, It just could have been so much more.
B000001ELD|3.0|I'm not a fan of Kiss because their music feels like nothing more than generic commerical rock to me, but Gene Simmons solo effort released in 1978 is a pretty decent album.  It's also a bit more diverse than a Kiss record.  However it's definitely lacking in truly great songwriting and guitar solos, which immediately separates it from Ace Frehley's solo album released the same year.    \\"Mister Make Believe\\" is a pretty good pop song.  It's extremely mellow, and not something you'd normally hear on a Kiss album so this might explain why I like it.   It's not quite a ballad though.  Probably my favorite song here.  \\"Burning Up With Fever\\" is a nice mid-tempo track with a nice chorus.  That's about the biggest compliment I can GIVE it though- it's just really nice.  It's not particularly *great*.  Nothing really interesting about the guitar playing despite the guest appearances either.  In fact what sounds like good guitar playing is completely buried in the mix so you can't really hear it anyway.  Bummer.    Perhaps one of the more underrated tracks is the semi-beautiful \\"Always Near You/Nowhere to Hide\\".  The verse melody is really sung in a great, compassionate kind of way, and despite its simplicity, it triggers a positive reaction out of me.  The gospel female chorus and hand claps at the end are a nice touch.  \\"Tunnel of Love\\" is a bit *too* simple and reminiscent of a mindless rocker for my tastes, but it's alright I suppose.  Just lower your expectations dramatically, haha.  The females during the chorus are fruity and pointless too.    \\"True Confessions\\" is a typical mid-tempo song with predictable lyrics about \\"temperatures rising\\".  I get tired of these kind of lyrics in rock songs.  It definitely gets boring after a while.  At least in the 70's those kind of mindless lyrics were considered relatively fresh since only a few bands were doing it.  By the time the 80's came around however... yikes.  Enough is enough.  As for the song, it's okay, but the femalevocals near the end are a little hard to tolerate because they keep repeating the same lines over and over again.  Come to think of it, this is basically the same exact song as \\"Tunnel of Love\\".    It takes a while for \\"Radioactive\\" to get going (an apparent tradition that originated on certain Kiss albums- it begins with weird, out of place sound effects).  Once the song DOES get going, well, it's mostly a repetitive chorus that keeps chugging along for the rest of the 3 minute time.  It's actually a good chorus though, so I'm not complaining.  For all you Kiss fans out there, this track sounds very much like a typical Kiss song.    \\"Living in Sin\\" is a pretty decent attempt at the glam rock genre.  Well then again, I guess most of the tracks on here are attempting to be like the glam rockers of the early 70's by artists such as David Bowie and Mott the Hoople.  This track is a notch better than most of the tracks on here but I can definitely do without the nonsense phone conversation taking place in the middle of it.      \\"Man of 1,000 Faces\\" contains a chorus that you can actually hum along to so that certainly makes it a quality track in my view.  Of course the chorus consists of nothing but an endless loop of repeating the name of the song over and over again.  However, it's too bad the song immediately turns generic after that 10-second opening guitar riff, but again, the chorus is the most noticeable feature so I guess I can't complain.  \\"See You Tonight\\" is pretty decent thanks to the uplifting vocal melody and the way sounds like a pop song.  Not quite the level of Paul McCartney though, but enjoyable nonetheless.    Overall, no, Gene Simmons first solo album is not a masterpiece (and neither are the rest of the solo albums by Kiss members released in 1978).  It's good enough to recommend however, and it's better in my opinion than the majority of Kiss's material.
0694524786|4.0|It seems like it was decades ago that I took a computer programming course in college.  Now that I think about it, it was decades ago, and those were the days of punch cards.  I hated computers because of that; what a lousy interface that was; but I didn't hate the punch card operators ... I presumed they were all attractive young women working their way through college and I wanted to meet all of them.  Bemoan the hormones.  One of the things I hated most then was that there was no debug code.  Every time I made a mistake, all I got back from the computer was a whole-page goofy-faced image of Alfred E. Newman with the phrase printed below saying \\"What Me Wonder\\".  I'm supposed to fix my code and that's the only clue I get?  But I digress.    Why do I mention all of this?  Because some stupid Alfred E. Newman computer programmer type at Amazon.com decided I should review an audio book CD that I obviously didn't buy for myself (because they took my credit card number and I'm pretty sure that young kids who are interested in these stories don't have credit cards) -- I bought it for a grandchild for Pete's sake.  I think it's up to her to do the review, but I'm pretty sure she didn't listen to it yet and for all I know she may never listen to it.  Besides, if she does, and by the time she does, Amazon.com's hour glass will have run out and I wont be allowed to review the CD.  So ... I think the CD is probably great, and I sort of presented it as a birthday gift while winking at the mother because she should make sure that her husband (my son) should spend some of his personal time with her every night listening to part of it (dispensed gradually over a period of days).  He doesn't spend reading time with her now because all she has is printed matter to read and that's a little fatiguing for my son.  To give him a break, that's not because it's difficult for him to read; rather, it's because he reads at a level far exceeding the level most people are accustomed to, andespecially what children are accustomed to.  So this CD is a win-win for everybody: my son isn't fatigued; my granddaughter gets exposed to great literature; and the two of them spend some quality time with each other.    Now if you want more than 4 stars, you're going go have to ask my granddaughter.  I gave it four because I imagined it's great.  Only her imagination will know for sure, and I wont know until I speak with her at Christmas time.  If it gets my son to spend more time with his daughter then the CD is great no matter whatever other measure is applied.  In due time I'll know that also.
B004927I50|5.0|This deluxe edition comes with the standard 14 track CD & a bonus CD that includes 3 bonus never heard or released songs, two acoustic songs & the pop mix of Mine. The bonus CD also has enhanced video features of the behind the scenes making of the music video of Mine and the music video is included.<br /><br />I love this album a lot of the songs on the album have some great beats and some very personal value to me.<br /><br />My favorites on the album are the following: Mine, Sparks Fly, Back to December, Speak Now, Mean, The Story of Us, Enchanted, Better than Revenge, Haunted, Long Live, Ours, If This Was a Movie, and Superman.<br /><br />Now I'm gonna give you may own personal reviews on my favorite songs & the songs I really don't know.<br /><br />Mine - This song has a great beat and meaning. It talks about how regardless of your past and what you see love can work as long as you really love the person you are with cause they may be \\"the best thing that's been (mine) yours\\". I give this song a 5 stars because it is just a wonderful song!<br /><br />Sparks Fly - This song is a good song cause I personally know the feeling of the song which is about forbidden feelings. I first heard a live version of this song and the live lyrics were changed for the album but the meaning stayed and I just love the beat and it's way of trying to tell the person this is what I want though I know I can't have it or shouldn't want it. I give this song 5 stars!<br /><br />Back to December - Taylor's personal apology to Taylor Lautner even though people say it's a speculation it is actually true the hidden message in the lyrics is Tay, so of course it means this song is for Taylor Lautner. I like this song cause recently with my own personal relationship I have had my doubts and wondered if this December would be our goodbye and knowing how I truly feel about my partner I would make this song my own personal apology if this every came into fruition. I give this song 5 stars for it's great personal meaning<br /><br />Speak Now - This song has always hit my interest cause it's a unique way to hear Taylor sing, she tries to hit notes that you'd think would be out of her octave range but like most artist she pulls them off beautifully. This song's true meaning is about speaking up before it's too late, it doesn't really have to revolve around speaking up in a church to stop a wedding, Taylor herself admits in the booklet that she's always had this thing about fantasizing over something like this happening and even though in real life no one actually does it doesn't mean you shouldn't even if you don't think it's the right time. This song is Taylor's way of getting to her fans that she believes you should speak up and tell the person how you truly feel. I give this song 5 stars for it's great personal meaning and awesome beat!<br /><br />Dear John - This song has a tendency to make me mad cause my ex-step-dad was named John and he just recently left my mother and had been committing adultery and this song seems to bring out (for me) the anger I held in for many years of dislike of the man. I am not saying it's a bad song, it's just okay to me. I give this song 4 stars.<br /><br />Mean - I just love the way Taylor does this song, this song is a true country song. Where you can tell from the previous songs which have a more popish-country beat this song is straight up country. I love the hand claps the beat and the way you know that if you're just mean to Taylor you're gonna hear her opinion back at you. This song is awesome and amazing! I give this song 5 stars!<br /><br />The Story of Us - I love this song it has it's own uniqueness compared to the previous songs. This song goes back to the popish-country sound but with a great reason. This song is about the incident that took place between Taylor and a guy she was with and saw at the CMT Music Awards (again thanks to the hidden message we know this.) It tells the story of a relationship that is falling into disaster over a \\"simple complication & a miscommunication\\" that led up to the events in the chorus and how even though both of them wanna say what they truly feel both are being too stubborn to do so and so the feeling is that the story of their relationship is gonna end even though this isn't truly what one of them really wanted. I give this song 5 stars.<br /><br />Never Grow Up - This song is about Taylor moving out on her own and leaving her mom & dad & brother into her own home so this song is of course about her own personal feelings on how she felt after she moved out and the things she misses and everything a parent doesn't like about their kids: all parents truly wish their kids would never grow up especially really fast. So this song talks about that as well and how she now understands why her own mother didn't want her to grow up. I give this song 4 stars. I personally don't feel the song and it's beat is really downing and kinda depressing but the song still has a good meaning behind it.<br /><br />Enchanted - I really love the way this song speaks for my own personal feelings cause I've known how it's felt to be enchanted and amazed by a person only to find that they may not feel the same about you. This song talks about how a meeting of fate causes this big personal reaction of feelings and how these feelings can eventually go into doubt and wonder and curiosity cause even though the two have a great time you feel one way and you wonder if the other person feels the same way. That's what this song is about and it really hits home for me and I just love this song and I wanna give a personal thanks to Taylor for this amazing and enchanting song. A BIG 5 STARS for this song!<br /><br />Better Than Revenge - What can I say this song is just amazing. The first time I heard this song I was surprised at some of the things Taylor was saying about this actress and how personal Taylor felt on the situation. I am pretty sure this song would be a great single especially to the women who've had another woman steal their man and they can't find a way of expressing their feelings. Well ladies this song is the one for you. 5 stars for this song cause it's a great way to get back at the cheating bimbos out there.<br /><br />Innocent - I personally don't care for the song nor understand it. It's Taylor's remark to Kanye West and what he did to her at the VMA's, I don't have to recap we all know about it. I personally have not forgiven Kanye for what he did and he obviously doesn't respect that Taylor was willing to forgive him cause from what I've understood his response was nothing less then pleasant. So this song gets my lowest rating from the songs on the album it gets a 3 star.<br /><br />Haunted - You ever have the feeling that you don't understand why your relationship breaks even though you knew it was on the edge and you really never expected it to break and are haunted by the memory of it? This song is exactly about that. I love this song cause I've been down that road before and it does have a lot personal meaning to me. 5 stars cause this is a great song!<br /><br />Last Kiss - This song has a tendency to drown on too long for me. It talks about  never believing the relationship would end and spending the rest of your life with the person you never thought you'd have a last kiss with and even though the relationship is over you still wish them the best cause you still love them. That's what Taylor is saying in the song though this song is to Joe Jonas (again thanks to the hidden message in the song which is Forever and Always.) I personally know the feelings but don't like the song cause I've never cared for the Jonas brothers nor care for songs about them. 4 stars.<br /><br />Long Live - This song is a good song even though it's pretty long. It talks about battling through life and standing strong and winning each battle together with the one you love. 4 stars.<br /><br />Ours - This song has a great beat. It talks about how no one approves of the love between two people but no matter what the love belongs to both of you and no matter what people say stand by that love. Recently became one of my favorites off the album, I know this songs lyrics so well it's a very personal song for me. 5 stars.<br /><br />If This Was a Movie - Talks about wanting back what isn't coming back though if it was a movie it'd come back. Basically this song is letting people know that the love in movies isn't what happens in real life though that's all we really want. I didn't understand this song until it recently happened to me. I cry now almost every time I hear this song because it's hard to want someone who's not there when you want them so strongly. It's another favorites from the album. 5 stars.<br /><br />Superman - Talks about seeing your love as a Superman and waiting for him and his love. It has a great beat and I know the feeling of this song as well. 5 stars.<br /><br />Back to December (Acousitc) - *Read review for Back to December*. This is a great version of the song it seems to enhance the meaning and the feeling of the song. 5 stars.<br /><br />Haunted (Acoustic) - *Read review for Haunted* This is a great version of the song. It definitely makes you feel the song a lot more then the album version. 5 stars.<br /><br />Mine (POP Mix) - *Read review for Mine* I've always liked the pop mixes of Taylor's songs and this one is no exception. 5 stars.<br /><br />Enhanced Features:<br />\\"On The Set\\" Behind the Scenes \\"Mine\\" Music Video - Split into 3 parts and is really good and funny and a great edition to this deluxe edtion. 5 stars.<br /><br />\\"Mine\\" Music Video - You've all seen it lol.

0374158460|3.0|Not exactly the chronicle of our times the NYT and Time magazine reviews would have us all believe.  It was an easy, page-turner about a dysfunctional family.  Some nice turns of phrase, but I'll stick with The Corrections as my favorite Franzen.
B000001ELF|3.0|Ace Frehley at *least* had the sense to put together a collection of songs that's not as mindlessly simple and dumb in comparison to Gene Simmons solo album, for example.  Instead, Ace Frehley created an album with relatively catchy, upbeat, and rockin' tunes.      Perhaps most of Ace Frehley's solo album is an obvious attempt to copy the glam rock movement that artists such as Alice Cooper had already done, but at least these songs are written with more rock 'n roll energy compared to anything Kiss was doing at the time.      In addition to better songwriting and heavier songs, another aspect that makes Ace Frehley's 1978 solo album stand apart from the rest is his ability to lay down GREAT guitar solos.  After hearing Gene Simmons relatively flat and generic solo effort, *this* kind of guitar playing is definitely a welcome highlight.    \\"Rip It Out\\" starts out on an insanely heavy note, and it even has a memorable verse melody to back up that heavy chorus (which is great too, might I add).  The guitar solo is awesome.  I wish Kiss wrote more songs like these.  \\"Speedin' Back to My Baby\\" is definitely a ripoff of *something* but I can't recall the song I'm thinking of.  I'm leaning towards a Deep Purple song that's not coming to mind at the moment.  Either way, I love it.  Terrific vocal melody and equally terrific chorus.      \\"Snow Blind\\" (no, not a Black Sabbath cover version) continues the theme of being a thousand times better than anything Kiss had done up to this point.  I love the vocals once *again*.  Of course nothing Kiss-related can go by without something fairly annoying getting in the way, and in this case, \\"Ozone\\" is that slight annoyance.  Yes it's got a catchy vocal melody, but... that's pretty much all there is to it- a mindlessly repetitive line that never seems to change into something else.  It's alright though, but a guy like Alice Cooper would have known how to take a similar vocal melody and make it better.  At least side one ends on a great note with \\"What's on Your Mind?\\"  More excellent vocal work here.    The best song on the album HAS to be \\"New York Groove\\".  A chorus that's instantly likable, and just a great pop song.  Funny how I never heard of it until a few years ago though.  I wonder why classic rock radio has been ignoring it all these years?  \\"Wiped-Out\\" is another highlight on an album already choke-full of surprising highlights.  Yes, VERY surprising indeed.  I totally wasn't expecting such high quality from a band member of Kiss.  I guess the only truly forgettable song would be the closer titled \\"Fractured Mirror\\".  It's a 5-minute instrumental with nothing in the way of creativity and just passes by harmlessly, but also does so in a bland kind of way.    Yes, of the four solo Kiss albums of '78, THIS is the one you need to own.
0439023483|5.0|The United States is gone. North America has become Panem, a TV-dominated dictatorship, run by a city called the Capitol. The yearly highlight is the Hunger Games: a bloodthirsty reality TV show in which 24 teenagers chosen at random--two from each District--fight each other in a desolate environment called the ''arena.'' The story follows Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12 and Peeta Mellark, a guy also from District 12. who begin on an adventure they will never forget, The Hunger Games.    \\"Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun...\\"    Author Suzanne Collins keeps the romance moving and interesting throughout the novel involving Katness and two gentlemen. At times it's twisted, changing and confusing, but Collins keeps you involved and torn between which guy Katniss should choose and wondering if her feelings are true. At the end of the novel I was left heartbroken by a big reveal that I had been on edge about for a majority of the story. Collins then, without resolving the issue, ends the book! Oh, how cruel but suspenseful! I suggest having the next book ready and waiting.    Even though Collins is an amazing writer, she, like all authors, has her faults. Although the story line is intriguing and she keeps you emotionally involved, she tends to drag portions of the story on for longer than necessary and you start to think, \\"okay okay already: what's gonna happen next!\\"     I loved this novel! It's one of those that takes a long time in the beginning to get into only because Collins is being sneaky and getting the reader attached to each and every character. Then, wham, here is this story that  you've lost yourself in and if you're not careful you'll forget it's just a book!  Such a suspenseful, thrilling, and emotionally capturing book. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all ages.
B003ZSH606|5.0|Man...I have been waiting for Jamiroquai to release something for a while now. Its been so long I kind of had to get readjusted to listening to their new cuts. I have been listening to his previous work so much that anything new was an adjustment. But it did not take long at all to get adjusted. The single \\"Two Completely Different Things\\" is my favorite and it entails their classic sound.<br /><br />I love the whole CD. Well worth it.
B0033QC0WE|4.0|Gardiner's period instrument cycle was the best of both worlds when it was released in the mid-nineties, appealing to purists and traditionalists alike. It secured better playing than Hogwood did in his fine cycle and has remained in-print unlike Bruggen's fantastic series. But most importantly, it did not grossly offended many listeners like Rodger Norrington's cycle did, with its hard hitting accents and fast tempos. Indeed, it was Beethoven for Beethoven's sake, with spirited tempos, big playing, and a true understanding of the composer's idiom. In this regard, despite the publication of the Barenreiter editions, the set still remains fresh, attractive, and \\"current\\" with much of the recent scholarship, in no small part because Gardiner worked with Del Mar in preparation of this set.    As far as complete cycles go, this still remains a favorite period set as well as a front runner as far as cycles are concerned. For one, Gardiner secures fabulous playing from his period band, with full-bodied, gutsy strings, golden-toned brass, and bright winds, especially from the typically undernourished clarinets and bassoons. Intonation is always spot-on and the overall timbre of the orchestra has that typical warmth and spice one can only find from period instruments. Secondly, Gardiner is across-the-board a very fine interpreter indeed. He is excellent in all the sonata-form movements, judging and balancing climaxes wonderfully, while finding the humor throughout, especially in Beethoven's delicious scherzo movements. But he also knows when to pull back and let lyrical passages be just that lyrical, that lack of which was the major shortcoming in Norrington's cycle.     A great example would be Gardiner's absolutely thrilling Seventh, one of the truly great performances of this work. The opening has that cosmic quality of Toscanni's reference account, while the allegro-vivace is imbued with boundless energy. The central climax and transition into the recapitulation managesto be both textually clear but exciting - no small feat - while the grinding lower strings in the coda are wonderfully present. Gardiner finds the perfect balance between grief and anger in the allegretto while the scherzo just overflows with joy. In the finale, Gardiner makes the music sound faster than it actually is with crisp playing from the strings and explosive playing from the winds, high horns especially. It is marvelous from start to finish and while it may lack that last ounce of fervor found in Kleiber, Toscanni, or Harnoncourt, the kaleidoscope of colors he elicits from the period instrumements more than makes up for that last ounce of obsessive energy.     The fifth is also fabulous. If there is one complaint, it is that the first movement is not as visceral as Kleiber or Szell with Concertgebouw. Part of the problem lies with using period instruments; the gutsy, full-bodied strings cannot create the same razor sharp attack on the famous opening as modern instruments while the general bright timbre of the orchestra fails to make the coda quite as terrifying as it can be. No matter, however, because from the andante onward, the performance is a true winner. Much of what makes Gardiner's interpretation so special is that it is one of the few interpretations that really highlights the famous \\"ta-ta-ta dum\\" rhythm in the other three movements, especially in the trio of the scherzo (thankfully repeated) and in the second theme of the finale. And of the latter movement, Gardiner cannot be praised enough. It just explodes with energy; the climax before the ghost of the scherzo has few peers and the taught rhythmic energy is about as exciting as it gets. Those that like the \\"German School\\" fifths of Karajan and Furtwangler might find Gardiner's fifth a bit direct but its insatiable energy is undeniably infectious, especially in the thrilling coda (what magnificent brass playing).    Gardiner's ninth is a real winner, especially in this crowded field. I certainly would not want to part with my reference Szell and Wand performances, not to mention Karajan, Friscay, and Barenboim among others, but Gardiner's can easily stand with the best. For one, Gardiner is one of only a handful of conductors - the other being Toscanni - that convincingly manages a quick tempo for the first movement. Where it sounds pedestrian and uninteresting in other hands (Jarvi), here the quick allegro really is exciting as hell because Gardiner lets the tutti passages explode with an overwhelming visceral impact. The recapitulatory climax is outstanding and the coda is a clinic on how this music should be conducted. At a little over twelve minutes, the adagio is ideally timed but never sounds rushed. The finale has everything necessary for success, and it certainly succeeds with its fine vocal quartet and sustained energy. After a wonderful \\"Gott\\" cadence, Gardiner takes the Turkish march in cut time, which was controversial at the time. However, to ears attuned to the recent tempo adjustments in Beethoven, this now sounds \\"normal.\\" The march is lively, with all its janissary effects, but Gardiner's dynamic swell into the double fugue is really outstanding while the fugue itself, along with the coda, are as exciting as any. Only in the scherzo does this performance suffer, mostly because the period strings have trouble where their modern colleagues have none - executing the dotted rhythms.      Listeners who like their Eighths fast and furious have long loved Gardiner's fantastic performance, although Jarvi's recent Eighth is now my reference historically informed performance. While Jarvi's Eighth might beat out Gardiner for sheer excitement, Gardiner is not close behind with his boundless energy in the outer movements. The development of the allegro is spectacularly aggressive, with an effective recapitulation (thank goodness!) and a blazing coda. The central movements, especially the delightful allegretto, have tremendous color from the winds and lower strings. The finale goes by in little over six minutes, which may seem extreme next to the eight minutes both Szell and Bohm take in their classic performances, but Gardiner's players justify the tempo with their razor sharp articulations and limitless reserve of stamina. It is just tremendously exciting from start to finish.    Not all the performances, however, are run-away winners. The forth begins shakily, Gardiner's dead-pan plain-faced opening missing a lot of the emotion of Mackerras, Bohm, or Jarvi. The allegro proper has many fine moments indeed, including a crushing central climax, but Gardiner all-too-gentle handling of the second theme group robs the music of its propulsive energy. The adagio, however, is spectacular; Gardiner's emphasis on lyricism is spot-on and some of the passages, including the sweeping triplet string figures under the soaring clarinet line, have never been bettered. The scherzo is all bumptious energy as it should be while the finale is all good fun, even if Gardiner does not capture the same manic energy found in Haitink (LSO), Jarvi, or Mackerras.     The second, like the forth, has many great moments, but somehow fails to delight in the same way as Gardiner's more successful outings. The opening to the first movement is taken lyrically - a valid point for certain - but the more hard-hitting approaches of Wand, Dohnanyi, and Vanska are that much more exciting. Gardiner's tempo choice for the allegro proper is very fast, which is not necessarily a problem so long as the players can generate the appropriate amount of energy, but here, something is lost. Gardiner also has a somewhat mannered approach to many of the wind declamations towards the end of the exposition and recapitulation, which is interesting but wears over time. Still, the developmental climax has boundless energy and the coda, while featuring some reticent trumpets, is still exciting. Gardiner navigates the two central movements with no problems but I preferthe brusquer humor of Vanska or Cluytens in the scherzo's trio. The finale is also very good, but still manages to be less exciting than simply fast.     In the allegro of the sixth, Gardiner fails to imbue the placid musical surface with the undercurrents of joy and happiness in the same way as Bohm, Vanska, Toscanni, Dohnanyi, and Wand. The development, for example, begins promisingly, with some exceptionally warm string swells, but the climax before the recapitulation (and in the coda for that matter) is not as joyous as it should be. Gardiner also adds mannered hesitations in the second theme group which sound less interesting than they do annoying. However, the \\"Scene by the Brook\\" is as wonderful as any, in no small part due to the very present cello duo throughout. The scherzo features a particularly rustic country dance, leading into a very dark thunderstorm, which sounds more menacing than usually with the tart period winds and timpani. The \\"Sheppard's Song\\" is warm and lovely, as it always is, but others, like Szell and Vanska, have shaped better hymns of Thanksgiving towards the movement's close and, for all of Gardiner's insistence on accuracy, it does not sound as if the final horn call is played by a muted horn.    Gardiner's \\"Eroica\\" is very close to great, but the first and third movements are less than ideal. In the former, despite some tremendous playing and one of the best realizations of the coda with Beethoven's original orchestration, Gardiner applies to mannered hesitations, one at dissonant pile-up and the other right before the coda that rob the music of a great deal of forward momentum. In the scherzo, Gardiner underscores Beethoven's emphasis on the weak beat, but the general lack of zeal and zest prevents the music from propelling forward as it should. However, the period strings and pert winds do themselves proud in the colorful march, although a darker timbre and greater presence from the lower strings would have made the music all themore special.     All in all, Gardiner's set is real winner and it is one of the few cycles where the big symphonies - the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth - are all consistently excellent while the even numbered symphonies, with the exception of the eighth, are scarcely less fine. It not only represents one of the greatest period sets available but also one of the finest cycles period. And at this price, if you didn't snatch it up the first time, now is high time to do so.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|As others have mentioned, this isn't Daft Punk's new club CD - its a soundtrack to a blockbuster futuristic movie.  I love techno, trance, daft punk, epic music scores, and soundtracks.  If those sound good to you - you'll have this on repeat for a very long time.
0316098337|5.0|Having only read Donoghue's historical fiction, I didn't know what I would be getting with her latest. `Room' is set in today's world, with a plot inspired by real world events: a girl kidnapped and held in isolation for years by her rapist, who has a baby by him.<br /><br />The setting is grim: an 11' x 11' sound proofed room, which is in a shed in the backyard. A backyard ringed by a 15' tall hedge. The only natural light is from a small skylight. The girl and her son live on meager rations, do their laundry in the bathtub, and are punished for misbehavior by having their electricity turned off, which means no heat, no light, no refrigeration. The door is steel, with a security keypad, the code to which only the man knows. This has got to be a story that is horrible to read. But, despite being heart breaking and depressing, it's also uplifting and infused with hope.<br />The story is told in first person by the 5 year old son, Jack. This in itself changes things up: he only knows the outside world from TV, so he has no idea what his mother has been ripped away from or what he is missing- in fact, she's told him that TV is all made up so he has no idea there are other people in the world. He is happy a lot of the time in this small world, playing games, helping with the laundry, learning to read, write and do math far above his age level. We only know about the misery, loss and stress his mother suffers through what she says to him and what he observes of her. Jack's life, from his point of view, is stable and loving.<br /><br />Everything changes when they escape. Suddenly, Jack is not everything to his mother, and he is bombarded by new sounds, sights, smells and ideas. To him, Room was security. But the changes don't stress only Jack- his mother has a lot of adjustments to make, too, ones that she's never thought about before. How will they make out? Can they make the needed adjustments, or are they permanently damaged?<br /><br />The book is brilliantly written. Donoghue never makes a false step, never wavers from seeing things only as Jack would have. There is a bit of satire at the expense of American media but even that filters through Jack's perception. Deeply affecting, this book will stay with the reader for a long, long time.a false step, never wavers from seeing things only as Jack would have.

1416583432|1.0|I have just begun to read this book but not sure I will finish.  The first problem is I hate to read a book where I have to have a dictionary handy to look up every 10 words.  I am well educated but this book is full of words that only a person with a PHD could understand.  However, the main reason I am dissapointed is that in the first part of the book, she talks about giving her dog grapes and raisins.  Wouldn't such an expert on animals know that grapes and raisins are toxic to a dog?  I'm not impressed and I wasted my money.
0061015725|3.0|I almost gave this a four star review, it is better than a three. The thing I dislike about Crichton is that he is dead. We are stuck with what he has written, the possibilities of new are zero. Hence this review can only be based on what is written, not how it might be better. To speak in the past, too many of Crichton's books are too fast paced for me, I only finish one episode when I am struck by another one maybe even more difficult, or more deadly, or even more impossible to surmount but somehow the protagonist does. The pacing in \\"Prey\\" is about at the speed I like, I survive one encounter  in a believable fashion, no coincidences and there is a break in the action before the next problem occurs, time for conditions to settle, and the characters have time to adjust to the conditions surrounding them.        Jack Forman starts out as an out of work manager with home and family problems. He enlists his sister as an aide, then things begin to happen. Jack refuses to see things as they are, we are in first person recounting of events so we are only provided with events as seen by the protagonist. When Jack misinterprets events, we can not change the interpretation, we are stuck with it. This helps determine the pace of events, Jack does not have lightning fast reflexes. He does have a good interpretsaive ability so I can see how he became a manager, but from what he does from here on makes me think he is still a good programmer, he catches on fast to what is happening to a state of the art program.        Jack is recruited as a consultant to a defense contractor, Xymose, to regain control of a nanotechnological device that has gone wild He is chosen because the recruiter believes Jack has the necessaries to accomplish the desired end. But, unknown to Jack, and not revealed to the reader, either, there are many forces at play, hidden desires and hidden motives for what looks like psychotic behavior. Jack plods ahead and various forces are uncovered. Xymose has lostgovernment contracts, some of the employees want to move up in the company, make lots of money, and they need the company to come out with startling results. At the moment they seem to be fastened on to the leading edge technology.       The wild component is destroyed, the domestic component strikes, Jack's wife, Julia, joins the fray, action picks up and some of the company employees reveal their true selves and all, except for Mae, one of Jack's former employees, are in league with each other and against Jack. Julia reveals she has infected her and Jack's children and this knowledge drives Jack hard enough to overcome his adversaries. We are near the end of the book here, time to quit before spoiling the read for others.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I bought these because I absolutely despise the sloped L2/R2 design,the moment I snapped these on, the feel was much different.  A change for the better, the way my fingers rested on the buttons felt more ergonomically correct.  Be careful though, the backs of the buttons can pinch if you decide to not place your ring fingers below the L2/R2 buttons and then decide to use your index fingers to press on the L2 and R2 buttons while your ring finger is sitting between the caps and controller frame, you'll end up pinching your skin.  It hurts like a b---h. If they curved the back ends of the clips, this probably would have been avoided, so -1 star for that aspect.

1439107955|5.0|I loved this book. It reminded me in many ways of another medical tome about a very different illness: Andrew Solomon's &quot;The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression,&quot; which won the National Book Award a few years ago. Like that book, &quot;The Emperor of All Maladies&quot; treats its subject matter from a historical, scientific and personal perspective, and never gets bogged down in excessive medical jargon. Solomon called his book an &quot;Atlas&quot; instead of a &quot;Biography,&quot; but both subtitles are appropriate.<br /><br />This book is exhaustive but not exhausting; it's broadly conceived without losing focus. I cannot imagine a more compelling overview of such a fascinating but tragic disease.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This movies is SO stunning visually.  The story is a little weak but does not take away from the film.  Very entertaining and good acting.  Pretty exciting at times.  Well worth owning!
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|I want to preface this by saying that, as far as entertainment value is concerned, `The Fall' was splendid and halfway to brilliant and I would watch it again in a heartbeat.  I think I should.  This seems like the type of film that needs to be watched multiple times, studied even, to determine its level of genius.  Having gotten that out of the way, while I liked this film a great deal, I just didn't love it like I was told I was going to.<br /><br />As my review title suggests, this film only began to scratch the beautiful surface of what I think it was attempting to capture.<br /><br />The film could be described as `The Princess Bride' meets `Pan's Labyrinth'.  Knowing that the films director, Tarsem, is the same mind behind 2000's `The Cell' makes perfect sense.  Both films are stunning to look at (as horribly mediocre as `The Cell' proved to be, especially as time wore on its glossy surface, the film is an astonishing display of visual decadence, even today).  `The Fall' tells the story of a stunt man who is injured and bedridden at a hospital in L.A., during the 20's.  Depressed with a broken heart, this young man contemplates suicide, but his plans are derailed by the presence of a young girl whose precocious personality adds a ray of light to his stay.  He begins to tell her a story, a fantastical story of love, death and vengeance.  In return for his words, he asks her to find him morphine.  The realities of the hospital bed takes a backseat as the fantasy world created takes over.<br /><br />I feel so split here.  This is such a hard one for me because there are so many pros here, so many reasons to just laud and praise and worship this movie.  Maybe I should list them to help me round out my review.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Lee Pace is beyond words astonishing here.  This may be one of the best performances by an actor the past decade.  The way he layers his multiple roles is beautifully precise and believable.  The way he sulks in despair yet takes the initiative to add a layer of prideful apathy to his character (the way he throws his head before shooting the woman he `loves') is just brilliant.<br />2. In fact, all the acting is great here; notably Catinca Untaru who is pinchably cute while remaining completely `in the film'.<br />3. The direction is nearly flawless, completely contrasting the tones of the real world and the fantasy world.  The way the scenes are shot, with perfect use of cinematography and lighting, helps establish multiple moods that mesh beautifully with one another; complements indeed.<br />4. The film is beautiful to look at; and the captivating sequences come at a marvelous pace.  The film understands how to layer, giving us something remarkable visually, followed by a dramatic sense of earthiness that allows the films central themes to develop realistically.<br /><br />But, there is just one big con that itches the back of my head.<br /><br />The film just feels, kind of...a little bit; hollow.  I hate saying this, but that was the one thing that I felt while I was watching it and trying to put it all together.  It felt like it wasn't getting under the skin of the themes the way that I wanted it to.  Let's just say that when `Pan's Labyrinth' concluded, I felt like it really SAID something.  It really underlined its themes and established something rich and deeply poignant.  While `The Fall' is a beautifully told story, it just doesn't seem to say a whole lot.<br /><br />Alas, I really kind of adore this film.deful apathy to his character (the way he throws his head before shooting the woman he `loves') is just brilliant.    2.

0810970686|5.0|The best word I can use to describe this book is FANTASTIC! This book was excellent because it made me laugh most of the time I was reading.  This book is about a middle school boy who writes in his diary about things that happen in his life.  He seems to always get himself into embarrassing situations.  For example, when he was staying in a hotel, Rodrick told him Holly Hills, the girl he liked, was staying across the hall from him.  When he opened the door, Rodrick pushed him out of the room in his underwear.  This was just one of the many awkward moments in the book.  He also ends up on a soccer team that he hates because his dad wants to impress his boss since the boss' sons play so many sports.      I recommend this book to anyone who has a good sense of humor.  You will laugh yourself to sleep, I sure did!

B001152TL6|2.0|David Lynch is one of those directors who you can't help but admire because he really understands his own aesthetic so well that he is genuinely `himself' at all times.  Every time you turn on a Lynch film it is unmistakably a Lynch film, and so you have to appreciate the level of technical skill and focused energy taken to craft these cinematic nightmares (that is not meant in the negative).<br /><br />While I consider Lynch a true auteur and a borderline genius, and I take great pleasure in declaring works like `Eraserhead' and `The Elephant Man' true masterpieces, there is a fine line that Lynch can walk, to where his directorial choices can either serve for the greater good (like the aforementioned) or where they can get in the way of his true genius (like `Inland Empire').<br /><br />Sadly, `Lost Highway' can join `Inland Empire' as `lesser Lynch'.<br /><br />It's not like there aren't moments here to be cherished, for I don't think there is any Lynch film that is a complete disaster, but `Lost Highway' (for me at least) is his worst film.  It feels jarringly incomplete and unfocused.  Lynch is the master of layering elements that don't necessarily go together in order to create a macabre structure that, in the end, `goes together', but his weaving here doesn't create a fluid product.  The meshing of the two worlds (a gimmick he doesn't know how to stray from) does create the desired dreamlike affect (something that made `Mulholland Drive' work so magnificently) and instead creates a confusion that doesn't etch itself out enough to invest itself in the audience.<br /><br />You don't feel a part of the film.<br /><br />Lynch's films can at times feel like amalgams of one another, all of them sustaining an emotional monotony that either adds to the narrative (like it did so splendidly with `The Elephant Man') or takes away.  The opening segments of `Lost Highway' feel stilted due to the zombielike direction.  Sure, it feels like Lynch, but it also feels lazy and underdeveloped.  The films second half picks up pace, but they two halves don't make a whole, and you need that revelation to tie them together.  While Lynch supplies it, it doesn't really connect like it should.<br /><br />For a film that contains jazz, parties, sex, gangsters, transmorphing, murder, adult films and a video obsessed executioner; `Lost Highway' feels kind of empty.<br /><br />Thankfully, there is a big redeeming factor here, and that comes in the form of Patricia Arquette.  I don't normally find her to be the best actress in the world, but her performance here is actually quite stunning and wholly necessary to the propelling of the plot.  She tackles a slew of personality fluctuations with ease and layers her multiple characters with enough differences and similarities to make them feel real.  It's a shame that Pullman and Getty are so vacant and numb, and it's a real shame that Robert Loggia (who is normally just plain brilliant) is reduced to a variation of Dennis Hopper's, Frank Booth, from `Blue Velvet' (one of those performances I just didn't get).<br /><br />Oh well, Arquette is amazing (award worthy amazing) but the film itself is kind of pointless and not worth seeing.<br /><br />I hate saying that.<br /><br />This is Lynch.<br /><br />I'm supposed to love everything he does.ond half picks up pace, but they two halves don't make a whole, and you need that revelation to tie them together.

0312600844|5.0|Beautiful, sparse, amazing book with a keen social conscience.  LOVED this book.  Thought about it for days after I finished it.
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|A very hard album to initially get into, but GIVE IT TIME! It's definitely growing on me by the day (but took weeks to even really \\"get in to\\" it). Every song seems to just have that one thing that stops it from being easy to say it's at least a \\"good\\" song! \\"Care\\" would be a good song if he didn't do that weird twist on his voice, the demo version is a little better since he only goes high for the first line or two. \\"Purple Sky\\" I think is good right up until he uses the title in the song, just seems out of place for some reason. I do like \\"Born Free\\" a lot. \\"When it Rains\\" is also one of my favs, along with \\"God Bless Saturday\\" - although the \\"Thursday ain't for ****\\" line doesn't mold well with the rest of the album, let alone the song. \\"Flying High\\" is a good collaboration, but with Zac Brown I almost expected more. \\"Collide\\" was a tough sell for me at first, but now I kind of look at it as a continuation of \\"Picture,\\" more than almost a remake, and it's grown on me quite a bit. If you've seen him live over the past year, you'll know \\"Times Like These\\" is FAR better performed live, you can FEEL it. \\"For the First Time (In a Long Time) is BY FAR the one that suprised me the most... The first time I heard it, I think I actually said out loud \\"What the heck are you doing with this falsetto stuff Kid?!\\" Since then, somehow it's become one of my favorites, and I still don't know why! I still think it would be better sang in his regular voice, but it's still good. The rest of the songs seem like fillers, but are decent. If you're looking into getting this album or dismissing it the first time you listen to it, TRY to give it a few weeks, it should grow on you some!
B004BSEKH6|5.0|I guess with any fortified influx of universal acceptance comes a large barrage of detractors determined to prove your success a fluke or undeserved.  That is the only way that I can understand that low general grade for Nicki Minaj's debut album, `Pink Friday'.  The `it girl' who has popped up literally everywhere over the past year, Minaj drops a bomb on the world that proves she has what it takes and establishes what I can only hope will be a long and lustrous career.<br /><br />Forget you haters; Minaj is the new princess of hip-hop.<br /><br />On the record, Minaj collaborates with a slew of big names.  `Last Chance', which closes out the album, features spotless vocals from sunshine herself; Natasha Bedingfield.  The track is soft and catchy and gets the listener aching for the album to start all over.  `Roman's Revenge' is a completely different ballgame.  Where `Last Chance' is soft and spunky, `Roman's Revenge', which features the slaughterhouse spitfire of Eminem, is dark and defensive (not to mention offensive).  Listening to these two spar is fun, exciting and memorable.  I love the fact that Minaj and Drake are in similar places in their career, and so the fact that they collaborate on `Moment 4 Life' seems very appropriate.  The track is catchy and undeniably the new movement of hip hop.  They complement one another beautifully.  Another great compliment would be the chorus provided on `Fly' by Rihanna.  Silky smooth and perfectly setting up the sincere and heartfelt lyrics Minaj constructs on the track.  The funky and pop diva'ishness that drips all over `Check it Out' is kind of flawless.  I mean, Will.i.Am is a tad hit or miss with his own sloppy take of posh style, but this one works.  And then, of course, Kanye West kind of completes the album.  Say what you will about the man's personal life, but he just understands music and when he hits the right buttons he hits them better than nearly anyone else.  He pulls the best out of Minaj (that killer run at the outset of the track is just insane), complete with throwback beats that seem fresh and appropriate.  Like the track name suggests, she is totally `Blazin' on that song.<br /><br /> Some of the tracks have a bubblegum demeanor, truly embellishing on the hip-hop side of rap.  `Your Love' has throwback beats that also add to the pop-like manor, not to mention Minaj's softer vocals.  `Right Through Me' and `Dear Old Nicki' carry a similar tone, very reminiscent of what we expect from the Young Money crowd.  `I'm The Best' was a great way to open the album, delving into these popish beats while maintaining her signature flow.<br /><br />`Here I Am' drops the tone a bit and delivers a darker and heavier prose.  Nicki's flow is effectively administered here, with the beat infectiously playing a starring role in the tracks delivery.  `Did It On'em' has a great beat (thank you Gucci Mane) that just elevates this track to perfection.  You can feel the crunk in your chest as Nicki plows through with a vengeance.<br /><br />And then there is `Save Me', the most personal, intimate and possibly the best track on the album.  Instead of spitting rapid fire lyrics, Minaj sings this song with passion and intensity that is totally becoming and heartfelt.  I just love the way that she basically transforms herself into a completely different artist here, yet it still feels very sincere and `real'.<br /><br />Pitch perfect.<br /><br />In the end, I totally recommend this album.  Think Lil' Kim with a bit of Eminem transformed over with the current influence of pop culture and radio savvy commercialism.<br /><br />This is the future of hip-hop!<br /><br />For those of you interested, my ranking is as follows:<br /><br />1) Save Me<br />2) Roman's Revenge<br />3) Moment 4 Life<br />4) Blazin<br />5) Here I Am<br />6) Last Chance<br />7) Fly<br />8) Did It On'em<br />9) I'm the Best<br />10) Check it Out<br />11) Right Through Me<br />12) Your Love<br />13) Dear Old Nickiof the track is just insane), complete with throwback beats that seem fresh and appropriate.

B001AR0D4A|5.0|I've been looking for this movie forever, and come to find out, it's already been on blu ray! It threw me off because of the cover art.  I thought it was the original old version.  So, if you were like me and wasn't sure if it was a misprint from amazon, don't worry.  This is the one your looking for.  Comes in both black and white, and color  versions.  Never understood, why can't they put multiple movies on one disk, since blu rays can hold so much information, but it's a must buy for any horror fan!
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I'm going to finally come out of the woodwork and give this soundtrack a much deserved five star rating because of the Daft Punk fans flipping out there are 'no vocals' on this album.<br /><br />What do you expect?  It's a SOUNDTRACK.  Daft Punk should be PROUD of their work, I wish their fans would be too.  This is a wonderful electronica/orchestral score, and very rarely do you get scores that sound so new and fresh. Or that combine the two different mediums. I think the score reminds me a bit of Trevor Jones' score for Labyrinth.<br /><br />The reason why I think this score works for the movie is that you need orchestral bits for the human bonding scenes.  You also need that electronica beat for the TRON world.  Which is what Wendy Carlos did for the original TRON score.<br /><br />Now, my review on the actual soundtrack.  The soundtrack has an 'overture'.  It's that epic, people.  And does it sound glorious.  I love the mixture of dialogue and music ('The Grid').  Some tracks have a very dangerous vibe to it (for example the 'Recognizer' track).  The world inside of a computer has VASTLY improved since the 1980's, and we can all agree on that.  You need something on par with the epic world that Flynn and many other game designers create.<br /><br />Overall, I find this soundtrack a fresh listen.  Of course, you're going to get people that say it sounds like Hans Zimmer.  And I can't argue that Daft Punk uses a lot of 'themes' over and over, but I think certain themes represent a certain character.  Kind of like what John Williams had going on with Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  (I have not seen the movie, so I am just basing it off what I think is going on as I listen.)<br /><br />This is a movie about a father and son finding one another again, this is a movie where it's gonna be a battle of creator against creation.  I want this to sound epic and I want this to sound dangerous, too.  And I think Daft Punk did an AWESOME job of making the score for Tron Legacy sound as epic and dangerous as it can be.  I hope that they are given another chance at doing more soundtracks, because this one proved to me that they're that talented to tackle different mediums.e.

0452295548|1.0|I purchased this book since both of my grandmothers had massive strokes and I was interested in reading a stroke survivor's insights (since neither of my grandmothers are able to describe it, due to effects of the stroke).  I slammed the book shut after the chapter describing the morning of her stroke and will not finish it.  Ridiculous.  Anyone who has seen the devastating effects of stroke will hate the author's condescending \\"I'm having a stroke!  It's so cool!\\" blubber.  Far too much detail about her thoughts during the stroke suggest that it is all fiction.  It doesn't read well, either.  I know she isn't a professional writer, but did she not have an editor?  Do NOT waste your money.

B00000721J|3.0|I don't know if it is appropriate for me to rate this album fairly as I am consider myself more of a John fan, but I am a true Beatles fan, so I couldn't resist speaking up a bit about it.  This is a nice try by Sir Paul to quickly get quality material out right after the Beatles demise ahead of his other Beatle friends.  Paul worked awfully hard on this, but it sadly doesn't match up to some of his later efforts to come, notably Ram, and of course, Band On The Run.  I think Paul knew that he would be ripped for this release because he had to dip into his Beatle days for a few tracks.  Also, he wanted to top his former partner John, so he hurriedly gathered up as much quality material in his own mind before John had the chance to finish his first solo effort.  He knew that John would have much to say about the Beatles breakup, and he wanted to do the same.  So, in short, the lack of quality here doesn't surprise me since Paul was never big on making statements with his material.  This effort is a product of the turmoil of the time.  However, in view of the turmoil, there is some quality material here, a tribute to Paul's excellence as musician and songwriter.  One point that has to be made here is that Paul was unjustly considered the villian in the Beatles demise, so he was on his own completely in the production of this album.  Paul had to do it all himself, including drums, which he handles quite well, particularly on That Would Be Something.  (A sidenote here...Paul often was the drummer in the Beatles early days...Pre-studio and Pre-Hamburg, Germany days.)  You can really feel the sadness and lonliness on this album.  I can't help feel while listening to it (which I've done many times), I keep saying to myself (and possibly Paul did too)....ohhhh, if only the other Beatles has played on this....Ah well, we can dream, can't we???   And possibly Paul was still waking up from that dream.  As others have noted here, if you are a true Paul fan, you will love this album, but if you want a more intimate picture of that period of time, I would skip this and choose John's Plastic Ono Band album or even George's All Things Must Pass.  But don't miss out on Maybe I'm Amazed here....still one of Paul's better tracks in his whole solo career...and I might add much better done here than the live version from Wings Over America.
0691142165|4.0|Wow...Although this imposing volume penned by Reinhart (Professor of Economics at the University of Maryland) and Kenneth Rogoff (Thomas D. Cabot Professor of Public Policy and Economics at Harvard) appears written solely for trained academics -- nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />This is an incredible study that is digestible fare for a wide audience who may desire to have a better understanding of the history of financial crises.<br /><br />Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:<br /><br />  The instruments of financial gain and loss have varied over the ages, as have the types of institutions that have expanded mightily only to fail massively. But financial crises follow a rhythm of boom  and bust through the ages. Countries, institutions, and financial instruments may change across time, but human nature does not. P. xxvii - emphasis is mine.<br /><br />  Economic theory tells us that it is precisely the fickle nature of confidence, including its dependence on the public's expectation of future events, that makes it so difficult to predict the timing of debt crises. High debt levels lead, in many mathematical economics models, to \\"multiple equilibria\\" in which the debt level might be sustained -or might not be. Economists do not have a terribly good idea of what kinds of events shift confidence and of how to concretely assess confidence vulnerability. What one does see, again and again, in the history of financial crises is that when an accident is waiting to happen, it eventually does. When countries become too deeply indebted, they are headed for trouble. When debt-fueled asset price explosions seem too good to be true, they probably are. But the exact timing can be very difficult to guess, and a crisis that seems imminent can sometimes take years to ignite. Such was certainly the case of the United States in the late 2000s. As we show in chapter 1,  all the red lights were blinking in the run-up to the crisis. But until the \\"accident,\\" many financial leaders in the United States-and indeed, many academics-were still arguing that \\"this time is different.\\" p.xlii & xliii - emphasis is  mine.<br /><br />Technology has changed, the height of humans  has changed and fashions have changed. Yet the ability of governments and investors to delude themselves, giving rise to periodic bouts of euphoria that usually end in tears, seems to have remained a constant. P. 292. - emphasis is mine.<br /><br />But highly leveraged economies, particularly those in which continual rollover of short-term debt is sustained only by confidence in relatively illiquid underlying assets, seldom survive forever, particularly if leverage continues to grow unchecked. This time may seem different, but all too often a deeper look shows it is not. Encouragingly, history does point to warning signs that policy makers can look at to assess risk-if only they do not become too drunk with their credit bubble-fueled success and say, as their predecessors have for centuries, \\"This time is different.\\" p. 292 - emphasis is mine.<br /><br />A reservoir of insightful research, data and poignant observations. A volume that belongs in your library as a reference book that one will likely return to on many occasions for further illumination.<br /><br />LOVED IT.ted States-and indeed, many academics-were still arguing that \\"this time is different.\\" p.xlii & xliii - emphasis is  mine.

B002T9H2L0|3.0|Strikes a good balance between hilarity and the dangerous role of double agents in WWII. While some take \\"Basterds\\" as a film that glorifies violence and is disrespectful to WWII soldiers, bear in mind that this is a hyperbolic WWII revenge fantasy and does not pass itself off as anything but.<br /><br />While this film requires a huge suspension of disbelief, the plot was interesting - quite a lot of little sub plots and twists to keep us guessing and Waltz's \\"Hans Landa\\" role was written and executed to perfection. The 1st scene on the farm is by far the best in the film. So much suspense written into those little cues, the analogy of the rat, the pipe... While Brad Pitt and his mangling of the italian language was the light touch on what was essentially a lonely story of a jewish girl's plan to avenge her family's murder.<br /><br />A few issues that I had was that,<br />a)anti climatic ending - for such a fantastical film, couldn't they have done something more creative with Hitler in the cinema?<br />b)the characters had virtually no characterisation with maybe the exception of Shosanna<br />c)we don't know enough about the assasination plot. Maybe we could have been let in on more of the tactics and the attempt itself could have been a lot more exciting if Hans Landa wasn't the only intelligent Nazi in the film<br /><br />Also, Novak kind of spoiled the film for me in a way that Rowan Atkinson spoiled Johnny English.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Disney.Pixar comes up with better stories than Disney alone. The third story in the series (It's not exactly a 'trilogy', which includes one connected story) is a very good entry. Characters are well developed. The story is complete, whether or not you'd even seen the first two entries, which is a sign of very good writing.     The version that I got includes the film and a disc of special features on Blu-Ray, a version of the film with some limited features on DVD and Digital copy which includes two resolutions, one for play on PC and one small MP4 version that can be played on most phones. Note that the phone version for some reason includes subtitles that can't be seen clearly on such a small screen, so they just appear as an obtrusive white line near the bottom of the play screen. Other than that note, I have nothing bad to say about the movie or about the various presentations of the disc features.
0140186395|5.0|I read this as a teen, but didn't appreciate the power and beauty of \\"East of Eden\\" then. It is Steinbeck's best work! I would recommend it to anyone.
1575666286|1.0|After reading the entire book, it became known to me that there was no mention of how to treat allergies or AIDS throughout the book at all. That's a surprise, since the back cover clearly states we can learn \\"How to combat allergies, obesity, high blood pressure, AIDS, lupus, and other diseases\\"<br /><br />As far as immune disorders, there is plenty of information of lupus, but as far as AIDS, it's practically never mentioned. No personal stories. No modified version of the plan. AIDS isn't even listed at all in the index under that acronym or any other one might consider it listed under alternatively.<br /><br />For allergies, from the index, we are directed to only two pages with regard to allergies. From page 239, we find: \\"Studies have been completed suggesting that people are addicted to simple foods to which they are actually allergic.\\" She then goes on to say that the Gerson diet is \\"intentionally devoid of foods that tend to cause allergies in some people.\\" So, it's just a matter of not eating anything that isn't in the Gerson diet. That does not amount to substantial content enough to warrant the claim \\"how to combat allergies.\\" It's more like a side effect of a highly restrictive diet trying to make a claim to fame for \\"curing\\" any ailment its authors (specifically Mrs. Gerson) wish to include.<br /><br />When it comes to the list, certain foods are \\"prohibited\\" for no reason other than that they taste bad, such as bitter vegetables like kale or spinach. If cooking spinach, Dr. Gerson says (p.53) \\"Spinach water is too bitter for use; it generally is not liked and should be drained off.\\" Don't eat any mustard of carrot greens either (p.104); no explanation given. What about blueberries, which are known to have anti-cancer properties? None of those either. No reason given. (p.98) \\"All berries, nuts...are forbidden.\\" No nuts either, even though those have high doses of omega-3s. Strangely enough, she strongly recommends rolled oats while condemning processed foods of all kinds. By definition, all rolled oats are processed and so are roasted coffee beans, organic or not. (At least one of the three studies cited used green coffee beans, which are not roasted and therefore more natural.)<br /><br />From page 61, we see foods that were not eaten (by percentage of the sample) by the 200 given people who had spontaneous remission of their cancer. Charlotte uses this to say that these people did so by diet alone. The keywords are \\"diet alone.\\" None of them did anything other than change what they eat, which is what, from the title, we expect the program to be based mostly upon. It's far from it.<br /><br />If the cost of a 3 month supply of supplements provided by a Gerson certified clinic gives an idea as to how many other things are involved, let me point out that it is $1,400. In today's dollars, that's at least $500 a month. So much for it being a \\"nutritional program.\\" Those carrots and other veggies on the cover fooled me. And, it's not simply about juicing either. Not any standard or even high quality juicer will do. She insists on a Norwalk juicer, or another one just like it made by one other company. Price tag? $2,500. That's not counting maintenance of the parts and accessories, such as filter bags. She also says we may need a second refrigerator, or, if we can afford it, a walk-in cooler. She hints at it at first as a recommendation, but at the very end of the book, we are finally told (p.325) \\"Do not use liquifiers, centrifuges, juice mixers or masters, and so on.\\"<br /><br />Other oddities and inconsistencies abound. In the critique of other types of juicers (p.119), one of them is labeled inferior because it \\"heats up inside,\\" which she says tends to damage the enzymatic quality of the juice. So, she fears that somehow the motor of the machine heats up the juice enough to be of concern. But wait, on page 140, we are told that to make the Gerson special Hippocrates soup, \\"fresh vegetables are mandatory, stewed in their own juices.\\" Now it is implied not only that heating is okay but beneficial to the healing properties.<br /><br />As far as being completely natural, it isn't. How natural does \\"dessicated pork thyroid gland\\" (p.141) sound? But, she states we should not use the synthetic version of the hormone, because it isn't natural.<br /><br />Recommended is bee pollen, which we are told is nonallergenic (p.148), but that \\"some patients may exhibit allergies to it.\\" Her source of this information is \\"World's Only Perfect Food: Bee Pollen Bible\\"<br /><br />As far as the tone of the book, throughout the book, I continually felt I was being lectured. At least once, she is actually rude, referring to addicts (p.236) as \\"these unhappy people\\" and \\"these unfortunate people.\\" She seems to idolize her father, though rarely referring to him endearingly, instead as \\"Dr. Max Gerson, M.D.\\" His discoveries were actually the result of trial and error, but we are reminded of his \\"genius\\" over and over. Many things are recommended and then justified with a quote from her father (Max Gerson). So, because he said so, it must be so? Early I listed the example of the 200 people who had spontaneous remission through diet alone, who had never even heard of \\"Dr. Max Gerson, M.D.\\" or his diet and supplement program.<br /><br />One final bit of misinformation is that \\"body tissues begin to release accumulated drugs from the cells into the bloodstream.\\" (p.239) She believes that recreational drugs are stored in the cells of the body. Really? So, drug users are actually getting high during their withdrawal symptoms? She says a coffee enema clears up the \\"toxicity.\\"<br /><br />This brings up the idea of toxicity in general. For whatever reason the coffee enemas bring relief, it isn't due to toxins being released from the body, not even in the case of heavy metals. From Steven Gundry's book \\"Diet Evolution\\" ([[ASIN:0307352129 Dr. Gundry's Diet Evolution: Turn Off the Genes That Are Killing You and Your Waistline]]), we learn of his experiences as a surgeon with people who have had gastric bypass surgery. All of them lose massive amounts of fat afterwards, but nobody complains of \\"withdrawal symptoms\\" when those heavy metals are released from the fat cells in their bodies.<br /><br />From that same book, Dr. Gundry states that vegetables expose us to small amounts of plant toxins, which are designed to protect the plant from being eaten. An animal that gets sick after eating one would rather eat something else. There is of course of cases of animals, dogs and cats, that will eat grass to induce vomiting. Gundry states that exposure to increasingly more and more vegetables amounts to \\"mini doses of chemo\\" that protect us rather than harm us. Gundry's diet is similar to this therapy in that is advocates eliminating breads and eating mostly vegetables (but not needing to juice them in any way). In his book, he cites numerous patients who were also able to get off of their medications (statins, insulin, etc). Gundry's book was very informative and at no point did I feel I was being handed speculation or guesswork or being talked down to and told what to do \\"because Gerson said so.\\" If just looking for health and well being, I recommend his book instead. He talks about the anti-cancer properties of berries and how nuts such as almonds and walnuts are very healthy for their anti-inflammatory properties.<br /><br />I don't doubt that this Gerson therapy works, but unless you are wealthy enough to afford 15-20 pounds of all-organic produce per day (yes, per day) and can arrange with a vegetable distributor to have vegetables available to you all year round, then this book is definitely inaccessible to you. Remember too this book requires working closely with a physician who can interpret lab results, unless you feel that, as the book says, you can interpret them for yourself using the section given for that purpose. (I have no medical background, and it all looked veryforeign.) Even if you could, this therapy Gerson is selling requires adjusting of the supplements after interpretation of the lab results. If all that sounds too complicated, Charlotte Gerson invites anyone to the clinic in Mexico to stay at a rate of $5,500 per week.<br /><br />This type of diet is clearly beneficial and may save lives, if it can be implemented. But, it is extremely strict, very expensive, and exactly how much of Charlotte's own speculation was thrown in makes it difficult to get to the bare bones of what makes this system work. I certainly would not give equal credit to all its parts; elimination of sodium is probably much more helpful than avoiding tap water, for instance. The book is massive and quite a pain to read, if I can be honest, due to the tone in which it was written. It certainly is not completely natural either, once one realizes the plethora of supplements one is expected to incorporate. Despite her claims of otherwise, I think this system would benefit those who try to use as much of it as possible, whether due to time restraints or financial limitations.<br /><br />UPDATE: From the Gerson website, we find that there are two Gerson treatment clinics - one in Mexico, as mentioned earlier, and another in Hungary. I will speculate that the reason for choosing these locations has to do with the legal consequences of the nature of the claims of this program and the risk of death of the patients involved.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I'm a headset enthusiast. I have owned many MANY headsets in shorts amount of time.  I have tried countless brands and I must say, Logitech is on top of their game.    I am a hardcore PC gamer and my equipment needs to be at a level that can keep up w/ the action.  Whether it's World of Warcraft and First Person Shooters, the audio quality on today's top games is absolutely stunning and these headsets deliver.  The audio quality, specifically the 7.1 surround sound, was so unexpectedly good that within 30 minutes of using them I had called 3 friends and told them to go buy these immediately.  I was absolutely blown away w/ the surround sound and locational audio.    The comfort is top notch, the charge-while-you-play feature is very convenient, even though at max charge these things last for 10 hours which is awesome.  The boom mic has telephone quality, and the incoming Ventrilo chat sounded like my friend was in the room with me.    I absolutely recommend these to any gamers and I have done the reseach, don't any more of your time looking around the web.  Order these on Amazon, get them in a few days and marvel at how amazing the audio is.  They are 10X better than what you THINK they are going to sound like - I can't express it clear enough.
0307454541|5.0|I bought this book out of sheer curiosity, and I am SO glad I did. I am biased when it comes to my book authors, so I was a little skeptical at first, but Larsson has proven me wrong. I bought it from Borders, and the woman at the register told me how amazing the book was, but that the first 100 pages are completely dry. She gave up on it at first, I laughed, doubting her.<br /><br />I brought the book with me to work for weeks and somehow landed on page 78, unable to move past it. The beginning is dry and slow. Very little of interest develops by that point. Almost exactly 100 pages in to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, things completely turn around. I could NOT put this book down! I'm absolutely hooked!<br /><br />Definitely recommending this, and the second and third in the series are even better!

B002CX99PA|5.0|These headphones are made for studio use, and that is what they are great for (I bet they would also excel as monitor phones for field or video/film recording). They weigh next to nothing (truly), and fit comfortably over your ears at the perfect height; isolating, but without squeezing your head. The cord is long enough to plug into your mixing board, amp or recorder and still be a few feet from them.     The sound is very clear. I wouldn't really recommend these for watching movies or gaming so much because the sound is very neutral with somewhat reduced volume, slight bass roll off - these are made to clearly reproduce sound and not enhance it. From the box, uses: monitoring; musical instruments; home recording.     If you are looking for comfort primarily, the JVC HARX700's are great multipurpose utility phones - great fit, full sound, clear highs with solid bass. The AKG K 99's are just as comfortable, but much lighter; and a bargain in studio phones for $70 or $80 (I paid $70). Now that I have the K 99's, I really want to get a pair of the AKG 701 or 702's for general use, maybe even mixing - I bet they're amazing.
B00005T30L|4.0|For some odd reason this was marketed as a laugh on the floor comedy, but it is not. It is a coming of age drama, but does have some very funny moments. That guy in the convenience store parking lot, to the art teacher(Illeana Douglas-always fun to watch), to the girls getting hit on at the pathetic 'party'. It even messed around with some of the themes from Clerks, dealing with annoying customers at a crap job.     We all experienced what the two main characters did right after high school. Dissociation with the adult world, but finding out that their old life is now gone, and they are left in a void and have to find their own way out. The gradual way that the two girls grew apart is spot on. Going from close friends, to distant acquaintances over the first few months of graduation. Of course, most people are not quite as cynical and mean, but that didn't detract from the movie.     Steve Buscemi's character was perfectly played. This is one of his strongest roles, IMO better than he was in Reservoir Dogs or Fargo. I think those that liked this movie are more like him, despising the mentality of the majority, the shallow and throw away society that is America. Those who disliked it, are probably more like the lady he met in the bar: accepting mediocrity with a smile and never looking beneath the surface. I think that is why people either love or hate it. They either identify with the characters and story, or dislike having a critical spotlight shined in their faces.     My only issue with this movie is that it does drag just a little.     There is a lot to see in this wonderful film, you just have to work a bit to find them, and that makes it all the more enjoyable.
1933492279|4.0|I came across this book after reading a FastCompany interview with Darren Gilford, the designer for the 2010 movie \\"Tron: Legacy\\". Daniel Simon, the artist of \\"Cosmic Motors\\" have been chosen to design the new version \\"Light Cycles\\" for the movie, after Darren Gilford and director Joe Kosinki saw a copy of Cosmic Motors.<br /><br />Darren says: \\"Joe and I found this book called Cosmic Motors from this new conceptual artist, Daniel Simon, this automotive designer who was the first guy I've ever seen that was conceptualizing in 3-D. He is an incredible 3-D artist. We reached out and made a commitment that we wanted him to work on this movie. I would say I got the Light Cycle 60% of the way there, but I can't take credit - it was Daniel's final design. His sense of styling and automotive history and detail really brought this design to fruition. I would say Daniel's design is probably one of the most iconic vehicles ever brought to screen.\\"<br /><br />You can see Daniel's completed work on \\"Tron: Legacy\\" on [[ASIN:1423131495 The Art of Tron: Legacy]]<br /><br />I immediately went and purchased the book and i must say i am thoroughly impressed with Daniel's vision and art.<br /><br />Although the 1st edition of the hardcover version is sold out, there are some extremely expensive copies available. This paperback version makes a great coffee table book, which instantly brings back memories of all the iconic vehicles of the movies like the DeLorean from Back To The Future, Audi RSQ from i-Robot, Lexus 2054 from Minority Report and Cadillac Cien from The Island.<br /><br />I gave this book 4 stars, because (as some other reviewers before me correctly mentioned) the binding of this paperback edition is not of top quality. But Daniel's art most definitely is.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|In \\"The Tourist,\\" director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck does his best to recreate the great suspense films of the late 50s.  Think Technicolor Hitchcock starring Cary Grant in \\"[[ASIN:B0045HCJ9E North By Northwest]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B00005JJX8 To Catch a Thief]]\\" where the locale becomes a character and the plot relies on the whimsy and romantic persona of the lead male actor and his seemingly magnetic talent to attract primo women.  Perhaps, von Donnersmarck feels that Johnny Depp with his quirky ability to masquerade as a multitude of oddball personalities (Captain Jack Sparrow of the [[ASIN:B001BYMX4A Pirates of the Caribbean Collection]] franchise, Dean Corso in [[ASIN:B000NQRR1Q The Ninth Gate]] and more recently The Mad Hatter in [[ASIN:B001HN694K Alice in Wonderland]]) can emulate the insouciance and nerdy nonchalance of Roger Thornhill and John Robie, both Cary Grant creations.  If, additionally and in the same sense, Angelina Jolie can totter in the 4 inch heels of the mysterious fashionistas Grace Kelly and Eva Marie Saint with their knowing ability to manipulate their men and conquer their worlds effortlessly, the film would come together as both a homage and modern take on the classic thriller where through the error of mistaken identity, an average innocent person is hurtled into a life threatening situation that inevitably rocks his world romantically for the better.<br /><br />\\"The Tourist\\" has all the right ingredients, but manages to fall short with perhaps too much editing and not enough background story.  The chemistry between the leads is meant to sizzle and relay to the audience just why one does anything for love.  However, some of the motivating factors are never spelled out or revealed with any anticipation or impact.  Sadly, the result seems a waste of talent and a film that doesn't intelligently scintillate as its advertising promises.<br /><br />In this case, Depp plays the innocent being led into the slaughter by femme fatale Jolie.  As with the Hitchcockian leads, their universe of espionage sparkles with the beauty of exotic locale--\\"Tourist\\" amply utilizes the Renaissance splendor of the Doge's Venice, scenes of luxurious hotels, glittering ballrooms and enchanted waterways as well as the elegant bustle of Paris where old world meets new at the immense Gare de Lyon for another classic innuendo-filled interlude on the TGV.  Grant and Kelly in a coupe on Monaco's famous hairpin turns are swapped for Depp and Jolie en water taxis traversing the canals of La Serenissima.  They all clean up nicely, donning tuxedos and gowns for the obligatory ballroom scene where the innocent has his \\"ah-ha\\" moment and accepts his new heroic role, cleverly driving the plot to its climatic scene and satisfying aftermath.<br /><br />Perhaps, director von Donnersmarck, feels that like the audiences of the 50s and early 60s, audiences today, tired of the austerity ensuing from financial insecurity, wish to return to an escapist genre of beautiful films featuring extravagantly dressed women and men with money to burn and an almost derogative nonchalance regarding its worth.  If this is so, to pull it all off more tightly, where the glitz of his locale and his two stars accent the story to perfection, he has a few things to reconsider.<br /><br />His leads must balance their elegance with a humanness that the audience feels and applauds.  Jolie is beautiful--her slim body draped in spectacular clothes that cause men and women both to stare unabashedly as she passes by like a reigning queen may seem a little overdone, but not completely unreasonable.  She is, after all, Angelina Jolie--so, why wouldn't we look?  As Elise, she doesn't speak much--just looks confidant, slinking through Paris and Venice, knowing full well wherever she goes she will be well received.  And, why not?  Nonetheless, despite this obvious perfection, when she taunts Depp with luminous eyes that suggest her struggle between the allegiance of career andthe overwhelming tour de force that is love, she seems overly controlled--more a study of a woman in love rather than the actual being.  Jolie's performance aptly illustrates the difficulty to convey the rush associated with love and the ability to remain coolly elegant.<br /><br />Depp can be mischievously attractive--but Cary Grant he is not.  Jack Sparrow, yes.  But, he has his moments where the audience laughs out loud.  His jaunt across the Venice rooftops (again in homage to \\"To Catch a Thief\\") emulates Jack Sparrow slowly and comically sinking in his dinghy when we first lay eyes on him in the first of the Pirates of the Caribbean films.  However, in \\"Tourist\\" this farce of Depp in his PJs running for his life confuses rather than amuses.  Nonetheless, Depp as the archetypical Scamp charms us effortlessly; it is always a pleasure watching a good-looking man with a self-deprecating attitude win while in a situation with the odds stacked against him.  Depp doesn't have his usual crazy range to fall back on; he seems to be holding back--trying for restraint to not give too much away and unfortunately loosing too much of the whacky persona the audience wishes most to see.<br /><br />The secondary characters work better.  Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton are both delicious as Scotland yard personnel. They blunder well while impeccably dressed, but other than the fact that as police on a case, the audience is not privy to the almost manic drive of Bettany to get his man.  The relationship between Bettany and his superior Dalton calls to mind Clousseau and Chief Inspector Dreyfus--even though \\"Tourist\\" thinks of itself as a different type of film when compared to Blake Edward's [[ASIN:B0001AG01M The Pink Panther Film Collection (The Pink Panther / A Shot in the Dark / Strikes Again / Revenge of / Trail of)]] series.<br /><br />But perhaps that is where Tourist fails.  Maybe it should be whackier.  Maybe Depp should have been allowed to channel a different type of innocent--one with Jack Sparrow's ruthless sense of humor and unconventional mores.  The hybrid nature of \\"Tourist\\" bewilders the audience into thinking something more is on its way that never quite arrives once the plot settles into the familiar ground that Hitchcock does way better.<br /><br />From the Hitchcockian standpoint, the storyline of \\"Tourist\\" may be a little weak with not enough moments between Jolie and Depp to make their more profound attraction more believable.  Think Eva Marie Saint, Cary Grant and that tunnel in North by Northwest. Whoa what a ride! Eva is on a mission, but she cannot help but be charmed.  In her attempt to be `the mystery woman,' Jolie seems to struggle a bit--trying too hard to be imperturbable, the audience does not always see her vulnerability and it wants to feel the chemistry. In this regard, the interlude on the train should have been more provocative, perhaps with some flashbacks to the Jolie character's affair with the infamous Alexander Pierce to show her confusion over her attraction to Depp and the allegiance she still feels for her lover.<br /><br />The city of Venice anoints the film with the benediction of its scintillating beauty and director of photographer, John Seale, can hardly ask for a better backdrop or assignment.  However, the city itself has mysteries of its own that could have been integrated into the story to make going to Venice less of a advertised travelogue and more the final destination culminating not only the Scotland Yard investigation, but the affair of the heart.

B000RJO57I|5.0|I love this movie, it is so funny.  Have owned for a while and still watch it every now and then.
B0001E5TSS|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />It's difficult criticizing a movie that's hailed as the greatest movie of all time. From the standpoint of cinematography, it might just deserve all the accolades that have been heaped upon it all these years. But my specific bone to pick with Citizen Kane is a story line that kind of runs out of gas.<br /><br />Orson Welles said that 'Kane' was not specifically about William Randolph Hearst but represents a sort of composite portrait of the rise and fall of a prominent American in the public eye. But one can see clearly that Welles had it in for Hearst. So much of the first half of the movie (up until the midpoint) is reminiscent of Hearst. And indeed it is the most compelling part of the picture. Up until half-way through Kane we feel that Welles is really being fair to his Kane-Hearst character who's depicted as charming but also capable of acts of megalomania. It's this multi-dimensional portrait throughout the first half that really grips our attention. Plot wise the stakes are raised until Kane's thunderous fall from grace when he's caught in a \\"love nest\\" with the \\"singer\\". This is the setup for the second half of Act 2 of the script leading to the 'point of no return' when Kane flips out after his second wife leaves him.<br /><br />Welles was faced with a big problem in the second half of his script--what to do with main character? The first half is so believable because it is based on the events of a real person's life. But when Welles looked to Hearst for inspiration for the second half of his movie, there really were few compelling conflicts LEFT for him to latch on to. In real life, Hearst continued to publish his newspaper, was sort of a recluse who didn't reveal much about his private life and did NOT have a bad relationship with the woman who he was involved with (in contrast to the relationship between the fictional Susan Alexander and Charles Foster Kane). So what did Welles do? He decided to create a false portrait of Hearst, a veritable straw man, which he could easily shoot down. Welles, the Hollywood 'progressive' now went into battle as the standard bearer, slaying the 'reactionary' Hearst. Kane-Hearst loses his charm and basically becomes almost completely unlikable in the second half of the movie. Welles grafts a 'character flaw' on to Kane-Hearst based on a man named McCormick, a Chicago heir who promoted the singing career of his no-talent mistress which is reflected in the Susan Alexander Kane story arc.<br /><br />By falsely depicting Kane-Hearst as a violent man obsessed with trivial pursuits, we no longer see a character who is multi-faceted. This is Welles deceiving himself that he's 'better' than William Randolph Hearst (despite Welles's disingenuous claims that the character was not really based on Hearst.)<br /><br />Citizen Kane is really the harbinger of things to come for Orson Welles's career--a career that ran the gamut from profound inspiration to adolescent narcissism. Technically Citizen Kane was probably the greatest film ever made and full of sensational performances. But at the same time Welles's elitist point of view and simple inability to follow through to complete a story full of great promise diminishes the overall impact (in small measure) of an American classic.e a false portrait of Hearst, a veritable straw man, which he could easily shoot down.

B0012EM5D8|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For the first 30 minutes I thought that Bee Movie had a chance to become a classic like \\"Toy Story\\" but as the minutes ticked away, I realized it wasn't going to happen. Unlike Toy Story, Bee Movie does not have a central antagonist. Remember \\"Sid\\", the psycho kid who terrorizes the toys in Toy Story? What a marvelous creepy kid! Bee Movie offers up a number of limp opponents to Seinfeld's Barry B. Benson. There's the completely unfunny macho tennis player boyfriend in the beginning who is constantly trying to smash Barry to a pulp and an odious obese attorney who ends up having an allergy attack after he's stung by Barry's sidekick, Adam (couldn't understand why Adam was still alive after he stung the attorney--wasn't it established early on that bees die right away after they sting their target?).<br /><br />Ultimately it's Barry's own misguided idealism which becomes the \\"villain\\" after he successfully sues humankind for stealing the bees' honey. It's good for an exploration of Barry's 'inner journey' but a movie still needs an actual real world antagonist to root against. In Ratatouille, a rat speaks to a cook in a restaurant but he's the only one who can hear the rat. And there's a purpose to the relationship--the rat helps the cook to become a great chef. In Bee Story, there are awkward romantic suggestions between Vanessa (Rene Zelwegger) and Barry and obviously that's an idea that doesn't work since it cannot be put into practice. It would have been much better if Vanessa is the only human who can hear Barry. And perhaps the character could have been some kind of 'pet psychic' now branching off into the insect world.<br /><br />I felt there could have been much more done within the 'hive' itself. A great opportunity was lost when nothing was done with the idea of a QUEEN BEE character (there was one lame joke about a cross-dressing 'queen bee' halfway through the movie). And Chris Rock's Mosquito should have been Barry's sidekick throughout most of the movie (not Adam!).<br /><br />In Toy Story, the toys leave the 'ordinary world' of a child's playroom and end up in the dangerous real world. The scenes where Barry leaves the hive and must confront all the dangers of the NATURAL WORLD was the best part of the movie (most people have alluded to the tennis ball scene as a particularly strong visual scene). The writers should have kept Barry outside the hive for most of the movie but should NOT have pitted him mainly against human characters. A threat from the insect world (such as a king of the roaches modeled on some kind of contemporary madman like the Iranian president) would have been a much better threat to the bee world then the idea that their honey was being taken away from them by humans. That idea doesn't really make sense since in reality bees continue to make honey despite human encroachment. I'm not suggesting that the whole lawsuit idea had to be jettisoned but it should have been a minor story line. I also found the climax of the movie to be unsatisfying--the bees guiding a jetliner to the ground seemed ludicrous. What's more, with great sentimentality, all the bees seemed to be elevated to a saintly status at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The writers should have emulated Pixar who know how to successfully anthropomorphize their non-human characters (displaying the gamut of human foibles). There were many witty lines in Bee Movie and you can thank Jerry Seinfeld for his clever humor. If only more thought was put into the overall plot, then this could have been a classic!throughout most of the movie (not Adam!).

B003PIUC02|5.0|I'll concentrate mostly on the blu-ray disks than a movie review.  As an amateur of Roman history, I'm aware that few movies capture real Rome, its usually sanitized.  The HBO series 'Rome' captured wider elements of Roman life that was just as sexual and brutal as Spartacus.  However, Spartacus amplified it more, and focused on one man and his immediate surroundings.  Just as 'Saving Private Ryan' introduced audiences to a less sanitized version of WWII and its horrors, Spartacus does the same to an ancient Roman era.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />The video transfer is 5/5 superb, better than the broadcast version as its 1080p versus 1080i, and the difference shows.  The sound too, is 5/5, very crisp and clear.  If you liked the series, the blu-ray is a must.  The colors are very vibrant, the contrast and sharpness superb, the facial details and skin tones are life like, you are there, for the most part, as part of the scene.  In some gory lacerations, the anatomic detail can be seen as accurate, and can be bothersome to those unused to it.<br /><br />Several episodes are longer or extended.  It doesn't add more to the spirit of the episodes but mostly prolonging visuals that are shorter on the broadcast version.  There are nicely done popups of Roman history and interesting commentary by the producers, directors, and actors, so you can watch each episode at least twice, first as a show and then as a 'making off' the show.<br /><br />Cons [Minor]<br /><br />Ads<br /><br />Disk 1 is preceded by 10 minutes of advertising of upcoming movies, and they can't be bypassed on my BD player; you can speed play or jump to the next track, but you need to do this 4x before getting to the main menu.

0786956291|4.0|So, I'm coming at this review from the perspective of a dad who got roped into being a DM when his kid decided to play.    The starter kit is actually pretty good. It walks you through creating some simple characters (more on that below). It contains a starter adventure and a dungeon, with a paper map. I've seen reviews of the starter kit complaining that the encounters are too easy; that may be true if you already know the ins and outs of D&D, but if you are new to it, I think they are plenty difficult enough.     However, unless you read the materials end to end _and_ have an encyclopedic memory, you will have problems remembering some of the details (saving throw? opportunity attacks? etc.) And there, the materials are deficient -- they are neither well-indexed nor laid out in a way that makes it easy to find answers. The Rules Compendium is much better for that, but that's a separate product.    The starter kit doesn't cover all the possible character types -- for that, you will need to buy one or more player's handbooks. Also, by the end of the dungeon, your characters will be level 2, so you'll need the player's handbooks to know what options become available at level 2.    So, it's OK for getting started, but it is a long way short of what you will need. What it really deserves is 3.5 stars, but I gave it four because at least the starting adventure is serviceable.
B003A9WLCS|3.0|Sade's voice is as beautiful as ever, but this album is weak. It's extremely mellow, almost painfully so. The music might as well have been programmed. I'm a big fan of Paul Denman, her bass player. Even though he's listed on the credits, it's very difficult to tell when he's even playing, honestly. No wonderful bass lines like \\"No Ordinary Love\\" or \\"Mr. Wrong\\", and forget solos like \\"Smooth Operator\\". There's nothing on this album that shows off the band like \\"Is It a Crime\\" or \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\" of the past. It's all just, well, boring, which is really sad. Her band is so solid, but they're not present on this release. Very sad. They're such a good compliment to her amazing voice.

It may be irrational to draw strong conclusions on a study of 20 MIT students.<br />- His writing style is too verbose / repetitive.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Despite its flaws, we could learn about the overall point of the book - that humans are not always perfectly rational creatures and to learn about the moments when we tend not to be.

B001UV4XFG|3.0|Eclipse is the third film in the wildly popular Twilight Saga. As of this writing it's the fourth highest grossing film of 2010, yet holds a 4.8 on imdb and a 50% on Rotten Tomatoes. No matter how hard they try, critics can't stop this franchise. I found the first two films abysmal in almost every way, but I did feel New Moon fleshed out the characters a bit more than the first film. With that said, Eclipse stands as the best film in the series...But that's not to say it's particularly good.    Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) are now officially a couple and Bella is determined to have Edward change her into a vampire after graduation. Edward, meanwhile, is determined to have Bella marry him. Bella's father Charlie (Billy Burke) wants Bella to spend less time with Edward and more time with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who feels Bella is in love with him and would be making a mistake letting Edward change her. While the film's main focus is the love triangle between the three, the plot this time revolves around Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, replacing a no-name actress) assembling an army of vampires to seek revenge on the Cullen clan.     The latest director to tackle the franchise, David Slade, handles this material much better than his predecessors, particularly the action scenes, but he also reinforces my opinion that no director could make this dreck convincing. Slade achieves in the film's main battle scene what Catherine Hardwicke and Chris Weitz failed to in their films, which is achieve a genuine sense of excitement and suspense even. Ah hell, it's an entertaining scene. Slade achieves something unheard of in directing one of these films, but even he can't overcome the poor script and insipid dialogue.     Nearly all the characters in these films are caricatures of people I hated in high school. Bella is such a childish, selfish protagonist you have to wonder why a vampire who is over 100 years old would even bother with her. Evenmore remarkable is that Jacob, despite actually being Bella's age, seems much more emotionally intelligent than Edward. I can't fathom how people take this plot seriously as a \\"love story,\\" when not a single moment seems natural and not a single aspect of the \\"romance\\" seems poignant. I noticed in the previous film that Stewart and Lautner had more chemistry than Stewart and Pattison and even offered a hint of credibility for a brief moment. While Pattinson and Stewart seem more comfortable around each other than ever before, there's still awkwardness between them that isn't there between her and Lautner.     Melissa Rosenberg (who has no business calling herself a writer) seems to have lightened up slightly on the melodramatic, repetitive drivel that's supposed to serve as dialogue but having not read the books, maybe that's because Stephanie Meyer did. With that said, there's still enough gag-worthy dialogue to complain about. Jacob's description of \\"imprinting\\" to Bella is so juvenile and clichéd, I won't even bother typing it. With that said, the film lightens up a bit when it skates close to self-parody; I'm not going to lie, I giggled when Edward blurts out \\"Doesn't he own a shirt?\\" upon seeing Jacob.     After watching all three of these films I began to notice how cheeky the Twilight films can be sometimes, as if they know and expect the stupidity of their audience. An example; when Rosalie (Nikki Reed) is explaining to Bella that once she's changed, there's something she'll want more than Edward, something she'll kill for. I know she means blood, you probably know she means blood. Why then must she elaborate on it further by saying \\"blood!?\\" If they don't know the stupidity of their audience, they certainly share it: When Bella's mom notices the \\"intense\\" connection between Bella and Edward; she remarks \\"You're different with him. He moves, you move. Like magnets.\\" Oh, what a cute piece of dialogue. Except it makes no sense, because magnets f****** repeleach other!     As for the acting, it has improved over the course of three films. Pattinson doesn't look nauseous in every scene, which I applaud him for. There's actually some convincing acting between Pattinson and Lautner when discussing what's best for Bella inside a tent, if one ignores some of the ridiculous dialogue between the two. However, the confrontation between them after Jacob kisses Bella is laughably unconvincing until Lautner's hilarious delivery of \\"I kissed Bella. And she broke her hand. Punching my face\\" makes up for it. Bryce Dallas Howard, a capable actress, doesn't do anything miraculous as Victoria, but she doesn't embarrass herself either. Finally, I must give credit to Billy Burke. He has such a likeable presence throughout these films and he comes off so naturally as a caring father, he's one of the only actors to emerge from this series unscathed. Lastly, the wolves look more realistic in this film. The special effects are still not particularly good, but don't remain in the realm of a live-action Scooby-Doo film either.    I've heard people say about this film \\"it's better than the other two, but it's still Twilight.\\" In many cases, this would be an unfair critique indicating a bias. In the case of this film, it's an accurate assessment. Eclipse is much better than the previous two films, but it's still a part of the poorly written, lazily acted mess that Twilight is. I will admit that Eclipse is more entertaining and more capably made than the previous two films and as Eclipse is much more of an action film than the previous two, I can actually see a bit of the appeal that has previously escaped me. With that said, Eclipse is still not a good film by any means as it's plagued with the problems of the first two. Yes, each film has been somewhat better than what came before it but it's like saying the stomach tumor was better than the brain tumor.     GRADE: C-

0553805371|5.0|Very surprised by the visceral reaction that so many readers seemed to have; this book doesn't seem to wear religion on its sleeves to me. Instead I found it to be a well-balanced, very informative overview of physics and a well needed review of opening the mind to the behavior of waves. Although light is immutable to our day to day lives we so often think physics as the behavior of particles. This book helps shed some insight in the area.     I tend to think most well-read and educated readers will find this to be a very interesting and unburdened book with far less controversy than appears on these review pages. The graphics are fantastic and the authors don't go overboard with esoteric formulas. If there is one criticism, some of the examples in the `real-world' scenarios are a bit childish and almost take away from the seriousness of the subject.     Highly Recommend.

The day is not long off when we will all be carrying around ID cards and using them to get into all buildings/conveyances so the government will always know where we are....a frightening thought, but it IS coming.  People have become like sheep in letting their governments get away with all they do.  The youth of America and the UK are becoming conditioned to accept all of this as \\"normal\\".  I feel sorry for them as they will never know the freedoms that we experienced as kids.  They should make the viewing of this video mandatory in every school in the US and Europe.

B0000DZ3EN|3.0|I've always had good memories of seeing this movie as a kid.  It scared the crap outta me, but I still liked it.  I was surprised that my wife had never heard of it, so I thought it would be great to get it for Halloween.  It was pretty cool to see it again... for about the first 30 to 45 mins.  But, wow.  It was not as good as I remembered.  We did laugh pretty hard at the talking chicken.  But, after a while my wife said, \\"Do we have to watch it all?\\"  It was hard to finish the movie, but we slaved thru it.  Afterward, I felt like my childhood memory of the movie was better than the movie itself.  Maybe I should have left it that way.  However, I do own the disc now and will probably let my future kids watch it.

For the quality cast to have read the treatment and still signed on to this mess - i feel like they were either tricked, blackmailed, or replaced with robots.    There is a god-forsaken hockey monologue from Denis Leary, delivered by a character in full hockey gear in a dream sequence right after he gets shot and killed. Every single action scene tries to recreate the awesome shots from the first movie, and the sidekick is a \\"blackface\\" Mexican (I think?!) who says the Mexican equivalent of \\"dayum\\" every scene. They have to bring back the dead characters in order to make you give even one damn let alone an actual \\"dayum\\".     Everything is wrong in this movie. Even the FBI agent, who is a beautiful and talented actress in real-life, manages to get the worst lines, terrible direction, and horrible emotive cues for every scene she is in.     I feel so bad for you if you end up watching this movie.

0375842209|5.0|This is an amazing book, which a ton of other people have already written. So I will just tell you what I liked about it.     After moving to the new town, Leisel and the reader are introduced to some interesting new characters including Leisel's new best friend Rudy.    Rudy is one of my favorite characters in the book, more than Leisel even. He has one wish in his life after he meets Leisel, and he constantly tries to achieve it. He is kind to the people he knows and honestly cares for his family and friends.    But Max, who we meet almost halfway into the book, is my favorite. He is wonderfully written and you as the reader feel for him. He is trying to survive in a dangerous and lethal world. And he must rely on others to keep him safe which is not a concept he is familiar or comfortable with.     The one thing about this book though, is that it is a book about a girl and the people around her who are so greatly affected by reading and words. The power of words has the greatest impact on Leisel, and Max, and even the other members of her new town. It has the ability to calm, to make people brave, and to heal.    I have recommended this book to everyone I know, and it is being passed around my circle of friends.

B00004Z459|5.0|At first, I was hesitant about rating this album 5 stars because of how over played it was when it was relased and i grew very tired of all the songs. But then several years after i first heard this album i revisited it. Man how did i forget on how smooth all the song flow on the album. How did i forget how well written the music was.  its not often you get an album that lives up to the hype. nothing else like it before it, and a million times other bands tried to copy their style. And just like NIN the downward spiral, every time you listen to it, you can find new sounds that you never knew were there before.
1439177783|5.0|Portia de Rossi tells an honest, sometimes gruesome story of her battle with anorexia/bulemia and details her years of low self-esteem.     As someone who struggled with similar battles, I praise this book for being brave and brutally honest.     Some details are truly gripping (e.g., when she details how she ran up and down several flights of stairs until she could barely walk).     Not many books hold my attention but I couldn't put this one down. You find yourself being her biggest cheerleader and simultaneous hating her for being selfish.     Great story for anyone struggling with self-esteem or weight issues. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.
0307388921|5.0|So I got this book out of the library, not having high hopes for it as I had read a lot of reviews saying its absolutly TERRIBLE.  But I can tell you that it is the complete oppisate, once you start reading you are hooked!  For a lot of people, myself at first included, the first few chapters will have you feeling a bit..I dont know..odd? ,   as a lot of the content is sexually graphic and explicit - as a lot of people have said, this book is not for the light hearted!  But I urge you to continue reading as the book is brilliantly written, and develops a fantastic storyline that holds your interest from start to finish.  If you can look past the sexual detail, you will just adore this book. But don't worry, the book isn't COMPLETELY sex fueled!  If you liked weird, quirky, humerous and edgy sorts of stories, I strongly suggest Choke.  I found it very very enjoyable and finished it within 2 days.   I will certainly be buying this book.  Give it a chance!!
1400052173|5.0|Excellent book.  Interesting slice of the history of medicine. Even more interesting picture of American racism. Very, very sad. Would have been easy to go for cheap outrage.  Better not. Subtle, sensitive, intelligent. You don't find a white author talking clearly and naturally about racism very often. When I finished the book I sat there with it in my lap, thinking about what the author didn't say. This is the best nonfiction book I have read this year.  For months I have been recommending it to friends.  I'm not surprised to see it rated highly by Amazon.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Dream Within A Dream is one of the largest concerts Britney has put on and one of the most sucessful concert tours in the industry. Britney played to a completely sold out crowd in Las Vegas for her HBO special and it was just a spectacular feat of dance, production, and imagery. All of what you can always expect from the queen of pop herself, Britney Spears. This concert is also one of the best productions put on for a live show. It won an Emmy for HBO and was seen by millions of homes as one of HBO's most watched programs. It's still classic today to watch Britney move to the beat and become a \\"Slave\\" to the music as she performs all her hits. This is a def must have for any Britney fan!
0316077054|1.0|As a fan of Beautiful Creatures I was looking forward to Beautiful Darkness. After I started reading this book I quickly started questioning what I enjoyed so much about the first one.<br /><br />I realize this review isn't completely fair because I didn't actually read the whole thing but nothing in the beginning of this book made me want to continue reading. Sure, Ethan was a nice guy but Lena was lacking in character... or maybe she was just misunderstood...(*eye-roll*)<br /><br />Other reviews mentioned that Twilight fans would love this book. Perhaps that is because there are some similarities. Lena was distancing herself from Edward oops I mean Ethan and then she told him her family had to leave. This is when I shut the book pg 82. As a Twilight fan I would rather reread New Moon. Again, I didn't read very much of this book and this might have been where the similarities ended but I didn't feel like waisting my time trying to find out.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Unbearable Lightness is an honest memoir.  Portia de Rossi writes well and explains her struggles with having eating disorders. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever felt less than. The difference between what one sees on the outside and what one feels on the inside is exemplified in this book. It's a tale of acceptance and a lesson about being who one is no matter what.

B002ZG98PA|3.0|Disney animation certainly hasn't been what it used to be. After a share of mediocre to bad animated movies, they churned out an instant classic with the traditionally animated THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG. But that film didn't catch on with the public as much as it should have (of course being released around the same time as the mega-super hit AVATAR didn't help matters either). Blaming the underperformance of their film on an assumption that boys were turned off by the phrase \\"princess\\", Disney decided to rename their subsequent feature, RAPUNZEL, a similar fairy tale in digital 3-D CGI. This name change is something that I still can't shake my head over. I realize the motivation was to try and attract more people, but c'mon, TANGLED? Sounds more like self-parody if you ask me!<br /><br />As expected, RAPUNZEL -- OK, OK, TANGLED -- is a very loose retelling of the famous Brother's Grimm tale. The title character is a young woman with the largest amount of golden hair imaginable shut away in a tower deep in the forest. Her only guardian is Mother Gothel, who stole the child away from her parents when she was very young. Rapunzel's hair has magic powers; it can heal cuts and make even a centuries-old being still appear young. It is for this latter reason that Gothel keeps Rapunzel captive, although of course our blonde heroine is told by her \\"mother\\" that the world is a dark and scary place and that she should stay in the tower. (If this doesn't give you echoings of Disney's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, then what will?) Of course, Rapunzel years to explore the outside world, namely to attend the \\"festival of lights\\" held once a year on her birthday. One day, Flynn Rider, a runaway thief who has just stolen a jeweled crown, sneaks into the tower to hide. Knocking him out cold with a frying pan, Rapunzel forces Flynn to take her to the Festival in exchange for the stolen crown. At first Flynn tries to weasel his way out of the deal, but as he falls in love with her, his motives naturally change. But Mother Gothel wants Rapunzel back at all costs....<br /><br />There are many moments when TANGLED truly shines, mainly anything involving genuine heart or magic. In the latter half of the film there is a breathtaking moment where glowing lanterns literally float up into the night sky while Rapunzel and Flynn sing the obligatory love song, \\"I See The Light\\". This is a truly colorful and imaginative sequence that ranks among the best at Disney. Similarly inspiring is when Rapunzel uses her enchanted hair to heal a cut on Flynn's hand. And the last half hour offers some powerful drama and heartbreaking emotion on the way to its happy ending (surprise).<br /><br />Arguably the triumph of the film is Mother Gothel, who ranks as one of Disney's finest villains in a long time. She has shades of Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but there is also a little bit of Frollo from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. She's selfish, manipulative, greedy, and deceptive in every way imaginable. The dynamic between her and Rapunzel is both one of the strongest points of the movie and reminds one of the Witch/Rapunzel relationship from Steven Sondheim's dark fairy tale musical INTO THE WOODS. In fact, Gothel's signature song, \\"Mother Knows Best\\", one of many to be written for this film by Alan Menken, is strangely reminiscent of a Sondheim song. (The score is another highlight of TANGLED; Menken's songs are very pleasing to the ear, with some emerging as true stand-outs.<br /><br />Unfortunately TANGLED falls short of Disney classic status for the following reasons. One of them is the overemphasis on slapstick comedy for much of the first two-thirds of the film. Most of this consists of Flynn getting whacked around by Rapunzel's frying pan, comical sight gags, and Looney Tunes style goofiness. This gets pretty tiresome quickly after every five seconds. Other sources of comedy comes from Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick, Pascal, as well as a gang of burly bandits who break intosong at one point in the film. Both are absolutely useless in that they don't contribute anything valuable to the plot. The bandits, in particular, only show up in one scene that by the time they reappear again toward the finale, I forgot who they were! Pascal seems to be mostly the typical Disney cartoon sidekick intended to provide laughs and/or lure kids into the theater, because that's exactly what he functions as. He doesn't even do anything during the finale.<br /><br />As far as the lead characters are concerned, Rapunzel is an appealing enough heroine, free-spirited and alternatingly schizophrenic (her various mood swings when she ventures out of the tower for the first time, for instance), while Flynn starts off as a smug, self-centered rogue who has a change of heart as he learns about Rapunzel's past. But while they both have a solid chemistry, there isn't enough of it in the film to emerge as emotionally impactful as it could have been. (Consequently, the climactic moments of the film, while otherwise very strong, don't resonate as dramatically as they would have with better realized leads.)<br /><br />Had the comedy level been cranked down by several notches and the story much tighter, TANGLED would truly be worthy of being Disney's 50th animated feature. THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG was a much better production to earn that status. I did enjoy TANGLED overall, but I don't think it's one of Disney's greatest.Both are absolutely useless in that they don't contribute anything valuable to the plot.

0374158460|4.0|I think it would be hard for any book to live up to the Oprah level hype that Freedom has received.  While at times I found some of the plot winding and unnecessary in whole this book was quite enjoyable.  It touches on so many of the issues that the modern family goes through today.  The division of the same story told from different perspectives (although this has been done many times before) is well crafted and organized.  In the end Franzen has created a unique tale that allows the reader to identify with all the characters while still addressing many of the larger societal issues of the past decade.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend and even urge them to continue should they get stuck in one of Franzen's lengthy diatribes.
0440238609|5.0|I did not expect to enjoy these books, but they were great - not hard to read, but with some more \\"grown up\\" subject matter - scientific theories, ties to religion, etc.  I found them to be a great mix of fantasy and actual interesting content and have since recommended them to many people.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|A friend who I never knew as an avid reader recommended \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" to me.  I now should take her recommendations more seriously as I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  \\"Let The Great World Spin\\" tells a number of tales that all take place on a sweaty New York August Day in 1974.  The tales center around the tightrope walker making his famous walk between the two World Trade Center towers.  The stories are all individually interesting but their overlap and cleverly thought out touchpoints is what makes this book great.  McCann allows you to see from the viewpoint of all the characters and identify with all of their lives.  I would definitely recommend this book for the unique style alone and for the way it brilliantly recreates that odd day in 1974 through the eyes of a number of interesting New Yorkers.
B004132HZS|5.0|A superb accomplishment in every possible way:<br /><br />* By the writers for re-imagining and freeing Sherlock Holmes from the Victorian period;<br /><br />* By the \\"creators\\" Moffat and Gatiss for casting the perfect actors;<br /><br />* By the two main actors, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, for their wonderful portrayals of Holmes and Watson.<br /><br />* By the music composers for the great theme.<br /><br />This is superb entertainment for intelligent adults. I once thought no one could be a better Sherlock Holmes than Jeremy Brett. I was wrong. Benedict Cumberbatch is a better Holmes -- younger, 21st century, tech-savvy, and most importantly, conveys and convinces the viewer that Sherlock Holmes indeed is a genius whose mind works at lightning speed, way faster than ordinary mortals, including the intelligent Dr. Watson. One added plus for me: Whereas Brett's Holmes was fey, Cumberbatch's is decidedly masculine, even sexy.  ;-)<br /><br />The DVD set is well worth the price, especially for its Special Features that include the pilot that never aired. I love the pilot because it conveys better than Episode One (\\"A Study in Pink\\") the genuine friendship between Holmes and Watson. Buy it! You'll want to watch \\"Sherlock\\" again and again.
0375842209|5.0|Liesel Meminger is a frightened ten year old girl being sent to live with a foster family in Nazi Germany.  Her younger brother dies during the journey, and at his funeral, Liesel finds a book lying in the snow that she picks up and takes with her.  This is \\"The Grave Digger's Handbook\\", an unusual subject matter for a young girl, but she becomes obsessed with wanting to learn to read it.  Once she conquers this book, her love of books doesn't stop and she finds more to steal along the way, including one off of a Nazi book burning pile, a dangerous move in the times of World War II.  Times for her family are about to get even more dangerous when they take in a Jewish man.    This is a fantastic book told by a most interesting and unusual narrator.  Each one of the characters leapt off of the page for me and I felt for every one of them.  The theme of the power of words in Nazi Germany and the way it was worked into the novel was outstanding.  I wish there were more than five stars to give this book.  Highly recommended!
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|THE SOCIAL NETWORK<br /><br />STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Rashida Jones, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Max Minghella, Rooney Mara, Joseph Mazzello and Brenda Song<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Aaron Sorkin; based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: David Fincher<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 01 October 2010<br />Review Date: 26 October 2010<br /><br />David Fincher is without question, among the top five best directors out there. Alien 3, Seven, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room, Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and now The Social Network, have all proven my theory through glamorous redundancy.<br /><br />Not only does he catapult himself to the top of the list for potential nominees at next spring's Oscar ceremony, but he brings Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Timberlake, Andrew Garfield and Kevin Spacey along with him. Kevin Spacey? Yes. His company produced it, so naturally when it's nominated for best picture of the year, Spacey will be there.<br /><br />Unless you've been living in a hole somewhere, you already know the premise. For the sake of any recent hole-dwellers, I'll go ahead and fill you in (no pun intended). The Social Network is the true story of the founders of the internet phenomenon, facebook.com. It descriptively tells the story of how they formed friendships and business partnerships while attending Harvard, which led to the formation of the site... and then it also shows how they nearly ripped one another's throats out in court.<br /><br />Rather than spend a third or so of the film in a courtroom, the filmmakers cleverly have us spend that time in private boardroom meeting segments, spliced neatly throughout the film. This allows for our characters to feel free to be a little more creative with their witty dialogue and personal slanders to one another and their attorneys. Good stuff, I promise.<br /><br />Which brings me to my man, Jesse Eisenberg. He plays Mark Zuckerberg, who according to Wikipedia, has a net worth of roughly six billion; give or take a few million. This is the strongest performance Eisenberg has given, and he's delivered plenty of good ones. You can find it in his outlandishly clever and abusive dialogue for sure; but more subtle than that, you can find the character of Mark Zuckerberg in his eyes.<br /><br />We meet Zuckerberg in college as he is dumped by his girlfriend at a bar, for being a jerk-off. Those aren't the exact words she uses. What she delivers not only sets the tone of the film and hurls Mark onto his revengeful conquest, but it is one of the film's best one-liners; so I'll let you catch that one first hand.<br /><br />Whether or not this girlfriend existed I do not know, but in one form or another it's probably safe to say that facebook was brought to us because of a girl. Zuckerberg isn't exactly a ladies man; then again he isn't a real people person in general. Think Jack Nicholson in As Good as it Gets: he may not be aware of the pretentious butt that he really is.<br /><br />Not handling rejection very well to say the least, Zuckerberg is motivated by the need of attention. He lashes out online about his newly-ex and what is both humorous and sad, is that he still cares for her; even by the film's end.<br /><br />The success he earns from his little online bashing rant puts a little rose on his cheeks to say the least. What can he do to gain more of this new found attention? Why, create another site of course. This is his area of exquisite expertise, after all. Here, the story tends to get a bit debatable.<br /><br />Mark may or may not have had the idea at the time to create facebook, (I'll leave that up to you to decide) when he finds himself propositioned by a couple of rich twins. They appear to have been born and raised at Harvard, and they want Mark to build a site for them that resembles the current facebook.com, pretty much to a T. Mark launches the site behind theirbacks, gains obvious notoriety, and before he knows it, is facing lawsuits from the rich snob-twins as well as his best friend and business partner, Eduardo (Andrew Garlfield).<br /><br />One of the best subplots in the film is brought on by Justin Timberlake's character, Sean Parker. If you're thinking his name sounds familiar, that's because he's the guy who created napster. Parker approaches Mark and Eduardo about their facebook site. Being the businessman that he is, he quickly takes note that Mark is the brains in the operation and Eduardo is merely the pockets. Timberlake and Garfield both give riveting performances, and we can feel the heat that burns from their character's dislike for one another. Parker has all the contacts Mark needs to take this thing to the next level so why should they keep Eduardo around?<br /><br />Business and ethics classes at Universities will no doubt cite this film in their lessons for years to come. In addition to that, it will also be marked in history much like films such as The Shining and The Graduate are, for their cinematography and classic commercial moments. Look for the shot of Zuckerberg with a blissful smirk in his PJ's, about to crash a meeting; and the dramatic boat rowing sequence in Europe. We will surely see these again, paid with either homage or parody.<br /><br />The film is complex but easy to follow, and moves forward beautifully and effortlessly from scene to scene. A lesser director and writer could have made this material mundane, but we never lose interest even for a second. The Social Network has made its mark in cinema and will be a film that hangs around in a timeless fashion. In regards to college films, it could be viewed as the dramatic parallel to Animal House.ob-twins as well as his best friend and business partner, Eduardo (Andrew Garlfield).

0470638842|2.0|Qualman shows a great deal of knowledge about social media, but very little about business, and even less about how to incorporate the two. His ideas are hypothetical and short-sighted, including cases where businesses could have done a better job of utilizing social media, but leaving out the financial ramifications to the corporation. While social media is important, it is not the be-all-end-all of business, and making money and protecting your products/investment is still #1 in the minds of the corporation.    He draws very bold conclusions with very little support and then credits them to social media. For example, Boston College stopped issuing e-mail addresses to its freshman in 2010. Qualman concludes that this means that e-mail is going by the wayside and becoming a thing of the past; meanwhile, more than a 250 billion e-mails are exchanged per day. He goes on to conclude (without a quote or statement from BC) that the college will rely on social media channels to contact their students. He doesn't even consider that when college e-mails were invented, students didn't have an e-mail address of their own. Today, every student has an e-mail and rather than create new addresses, the college can just use the current addresses to contact their student base.    In the case of the music industry and the Facebook game Scrabulous (among others), he scolds the holders of the copyright for \\"not understanding\\" social media and taking legal action against it, rather than going with the flow and trying to capitalize on it. In reality, it is he that \\"does not understand\\" the value of intellectual property and that a person who illegally profits/distributes your personal property is not only the law, but stealing tens of thousands of dollars from your company. Social media is great, but the point is still to make money, not lose it.    Save your money, watch his videos: [...] . You'll get the point, some the time, and save yourself some frustration as well.
B003Y2XI8W|5.0|I originally purchased this CD because I loved Sweet Disposition so much, I really didn't care what the other songs sounded like. I figured there might be one or two other decent ones, and for me, that was worth the price of the CD.  I was surprised at how much I love the whole thing.  Sweet disposition is definitely the stand out, but all the songs are strong, and it is reminiscent of the somewhat underground music of the 80s, done modern.  Great stuff.  I highly recommend!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|All too often we find products that when a simple part wears out, one has to throw that product away because there are no replacement parts. For those who own the [[ASIN:B0043EV20G Plantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headset]] or the other Voyager PRO Series geadsets, this is not the case, as when the eartips wear out, they are easily replaceable. In my case the [[ASIN:B002QBS9KE Medium Eartips for Voyager Pro]] were the perfect fit.<br /><br />My first eartips lasted for about a year, but since the headset came with three soft gel eartips and two foam eartip covers, I had some backups. Found that the other sizes didn't fit as well as the medium versions, so I ran with the medium foam eartips until I received another full set. You may prefer the foam eartips; for me the soft gel versions did a better job, both in terms of comfort and noise cancellation. That's a personal choice.<br /><br />They're easy to install. Just hold the headset in one hand and with your other hand, gently push in on the eartip as you turn it counterclockwise almost 180 degrees. To install a new eartip, it's just the reverse: turn the new one clockwise.<br /><br />And if these don't fit your ears, try the ones that came with your headset for the right size. You can get [[ASIN:B002OKS0M4 Small Eartips for Voyager Pro]] or [[ASIN:B002QBWUCW Plantronics Large Eartips]] to fit your individual needs.<br /><br />My earlier comment about some products having no replacement parts goes back to when another (very popular) Bluetooth headset that I own had a behind the ear hook-style earpiece that broke off after just under a year. I was only after a number of conversations with a dealer that I got him to order a replacement for me... and it cost half the price of a complete Bluetooth headset.<br /><br />[UPDATED 10/3/2012]<br /><br />For those of us who own the Plantronics Voyager PRO (and see my 5-star review), we don't have that problems, as they're readily available here, and at quite a reasonable cost.

B0013FSXT6|2.0|I ordered blu ray as i was expecting some lush and eye popping visual Conversion but there was nothing special as compared to dvd that played in center of screen and this HD upgrade played on full screen.Reviewers here praise for blu ray quality may be they don`t own dvd version as i don`t see any difference except one i mentioned above.Felt like much cheap HD conversion rather then true blu ray conversion.Menu Features looks so bad that its insult for my UN55C8000 samsung LED TV .Special feature include paragraphs that they want you to read just like FBI warning and included some time constraint interview by Tom and Nicole not about movie but about director.i didn`t feel any difference in music or voice quality on my Bose 48 IV Home theater system.Wait for another conversion if you can  as i`m sure i`ll be done after a while just like Gladiator/Rocky and many others who been done wrong in first place but fixed later on.<br />About Movie :<br />This movie kinda love it or hate it and overly rated as sexual Life experience and a philosophical.its true or not it depends how to view movie.Its NC-17.I just felt director being hypocrite .He started movie with Kidman naked butt and showed many ladies undressed and sexually exploited along the way but main lead actors Tom,Pollack,Todd kept their cloths on.If you want to create work of art as this movie boasts then be fair not to use your sexual preferences as there is already enough soft porn available in market .This movie fails you to tell the difference between love and lust .To experience that in better movie setting i`ll prefer you to watch \\"Original Sin\\"  this movie deliver this subject matter superiorly .
B003YOZNBK|2.0|The production is of poor quality considering that it is in blu-ray. The sound system is just like any other ordinary dvd movie. It is definitely a cheap production movie. Amazon should make good if such cases is made know to Amazon. However, to be fair to Amazon, I have no complaints on all the other dvd and blu-ray movies that I have bought from Amazon.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B0034G4OUO|3.0|Read other reviews for in-depth analysis of the plot.  I just want to give a few thoughts.<br /><br />I saw this movie at the theater last night.  I give it 3.49 stars, rounded down to 3.  There are lots of bullets flying and just violence in general, some of which is very disturbing.  The acting was pretty good.  I thought the best acting was by Billy Bob Thornton, with Dwayne Johnson in a close second.  The story was somewhat predictable at times and unpredictable at other times.  To me, this movie had some elements of The Terminator and The Running Man and other action movies.<br /><br />If you like violent action movies that have lots of gunfire and high speed chases, then I recommend this movie.  It's not a great movie, but it's not bad, either.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie really is amazing. Excellent concepts, some action. It's sorta like a puzzle. I love movies where you have know idea what to expect next. And that's really hard to pull off these days. Nothing is predictable. I struggled a little bit with the movie in begginning and then decided to give in to the movie. And just let it take me where it wants to go. I really enjoyed and so will you. Buy this movie and support good movies instead of bad movies with sandra bullock. Yuck. she is gross.
B004498KPU|5.0|Definetely the best collection of videos ever...in chronological order, great menus, instant acces. And the best of all that gets you to experience the real vision of one of the most importants entertainers of all time. The King of Pop, Michael Jackson. You will be amuse by great coreographies and concepts, amazing visual effects, and specially all the carisma that this man had.    An excellent collection of 42 ground breaking videos. That's how he changed history of music.
B0044KU7KU|4.0|Complete reverse from the ultra dark Black Parade, but still hard hitting, DangerDays provides a much needed adrenaline shot. I admit when I first heard Nanana I was like... what? But the boys have never wanted to do the same thing twice and they again prove they are artists as well as musicians. Even if you dont like the music of MCR, the lyrics ring a cord in just about everyone. I cant stop playing this CD, its totally insidious in its infiltration of my mind, so BE WARNED! And listen with an open mind. Also I just want to say the guitar work again blows my mind :-)MCRmy rulz!
B0044E9LW6|4.0|Disc 1, exelent great gig offered for the dio's original line up, good songs good sound quality, obviously the diference between vivian campbell and craig goldy is like the ocean between america and asia, so sad that roni supported goldy for huge time.    disc 2,  good songs but the guitar is the question, did craig goldy was the right man for dio? i think he was not.
0810997827|5.0|This book set was ordered for my granddaughter for her 8th birthday.  She loves the 'Wimpy' books and wanted hardcover copies so she can read them over and over again.  She originally borrowed the books from the library.  The set is very nice and in a very suitable container.  Good gift!
0439023521|5.0|Let me start off saying that I am a 38 year old mom that picked up this book only because my 12 year old son recommended it.  Imagine my surprise when I couldn't put it down!!  I loved this book even though I was unsure if I would like the plot.  I usually prefer the adult mystery/romance books.  Through this book I have discovered I like sci-fi genre now.  Never saw that coming!<br /><br />Without giving anything away I will share the plot with you.  It all starts with a girl, Katniss, and her friend Gale.  Katniss lives in a place that use to be called North America before it were destroyed by people in great wars and natural disaster.  Now it has been taken over by the capitol who has established \\"12 districts\\" instead of colonies or towns.  To keep control of these districts the Capitol host every year the Hunger Games.  These Huger Games pick (supposedly from random selection) a boy and a girl between the ages of 12-18 from each district to participate.  So the bad news for these participants???  It is a fight to the death, so only one victor will remain at the end of the games.  Obviously  Katniss is picked or there wouldn't be a story.<br /><br />In the book Katniss is a character you really come to love.  At times you want to reach in and strangle her yourself and other you feel deep sympathy for her plight.  It was such a good book that I ordered the rest of the series before I finished the first so I could keep on reading.  I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11.  I say 11 not because of the text used but the subject matter.  In the book it does talk about Katniss having to use \\"romance\\" with kisses to acquire some things.  It never gets into it like the adult books, but enough that if your child isn't mature enough to deal with it or you haven't had any \\"The Talks\\" yet, it might raise some questions you don't want to answer.  While there isn't a lot of detail in romance it still leaves a lot for the imagination (okay so maybe I just havea dirty mind. LOL!).  Over all great book!!!
0307473473|3.0|The characters are ok, but the story is really not that great.<br />Family issues with sexual abuse and sadism.  Hmm, I guess sex sells...<br /><br />Most likely will not read the other two books in the trilogy.
B000SSPL0I|5.0|This recording is a virtual mircale - in 1955, when singers like Renata Tebaldi, Mario del Monaco, Ettore Bastianini and Cesare Siepi, as well as Giulietta Simoniato and Fernando Corena - are ALL in their absolute prime!<br />Simoniato and Siepi passed away earlier this year. It is very difficult to get accoustically good recordings of them, and this Decca 1955 stereo re-mastered complete studio recording is nothing short of a miracle.<br />I am Asian, and have not been born early enough to witness the grand Italian operatic era.  In this recording, I eventually realise why Italian opera was so acclaimed and loved.<br />La Forza del Destino is one of Verdi's most tragic pieces and mature work. Verdi has by then threw away virtually all of his predecessors (like Donizetti)'s influences, and cultivated an unique style of his own. The theme in the Prelude, like a sweeping force of fate, carries through to the very last great aria of the heroine Leonora di Vargas, portrayed here by Renata Tebaldi in a 'listen to believe' grand performance.<br />As a combating duo, Bastianini and del Monaco are peerless here. The heroic tenor Mario del Monaco sounds fresh and virile in this 1955 recording, and in a grand rebuttal of the nonsensical remark of his being unable to sing soft, he rendered a solo aria in the second Act so lyrical and sweet as to rebut the most die-hard of his critics.  The Verdian baritone Ettore Bastianini is similarly dramatically alert.<br />Renata Tebaldi as Leonora simply blows away any competitor, especially in the last Act's great aria before Leonora's being stabbed by Don Carlos di Vargas.<br />As the two Franciscan monks, Cesare Siepi and Fernando Corena are both superb.  Corena's buffo bass baritone contrasted with Siepi's basso cantante lent much artistic weight to an overall sweepingly grand performance. Padre Guardiano is, together with Filipo II of Don Carlo, one of Siepi's core Verdi repertoire, and he sang his role well into the 1970's.<br />Conductor Molinari-Pradelli is able to conjure the necessary drama and pathos of Verdi's masterpiece.<br />In a grand remembrance of Simoniato and Siepi, together with all other lead roles.s able to conjure the necessary drama and pathos of Verdi's masterpiece.  In a grand remembrance of Simoniato and Siepi, together with all other lead roles.
0440245915|3.0|It's kind of funny that in recent books Grisham obviously has problems with the death penalty but he thinks it WAS ok for this book's main character to kill two men in cold blood.  Yes he was justified, I can see that, but the death penalty is justified for a large portion of today's violent criminals.    Wake up and smell your own coffee Mr. Grisham!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I still Avatar, but it's a tie! And if I don't feel like fantasy, Avatar's a problem. Enter Inception, my other favorite! Plus I know there'll be Avata 2 and 3, and I could easily see Inception 2 (those of you know how it ends). I haven't loved Leo since Titanic, but his passion's finally back in this movie, and I must say that Titanic's but a memory now. Jack Dawson died, so meet his excellent replacement Dom Cobb!
0823015033|5.0|This book covers every phase of the figure.  Quite impressive.  Covers all available materials and the pros and cons of them.  Very detailed.  Worth the price.
B0000640SA|5.0|This Collector's DVD is an awesome piece to add to your Christopher Nolan collection. The bonus DVD has the chronological edition, though you have to go through a series of questions to access this portion of the DVD (do a google search for the answers if you lose your patience!)
B001QOGYFO|1.0|Typical teen scream horror movie, except set in the South Pole. But, unlike good horror movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, this one is implausible in a bad way. C'mon, face masks would be a minimum, snow would stick. None of the characters is likable. I wanted to like it but just could not. If you really have nothing better to do, you can yell at the screen with a friend -- otherwise don't bother. Watch one of the original Jason, Halloween, or Nightmare movies for more fun.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|love this movie it is great action and then great jolie tattoos i had the repair bath in my home
B002ZG976U|5.0|Burlesque is awesome! Its pure entertainment. Singing, dancing, acting, romance - oh my! The cast is wonderful! A classic story told again in a throwback to the musicals which is a formula that always works with the right people and the right music and in the right setting and it works here. I am bias to Christina Aguilera. :) She's an amazing singer and I am pleased to say in her acting debut she is terrific. I adore her with the very handsome and sexy Cam Gigandet. :)     Who by the way can offer me a box of Famous Amos cookies ANYTIME! lol         Anyone who likes musicals and romance or just wants to get away from movies about gangsters, pyschos and dead bodies will definitely enjoy this enjoyable movie.     I love it!

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Truly an amazing piece of work. I watched this after I had Watched David Attenborough's The Living Planet, and it was good to see that most of the breathtaking animals and locations are still here after 30 years. I definitely recommend this series to anyone who loves David Attenborough's documentaries. He may only narrate this one, but there is a lot of his influence in it.
0525951652|1.0|This book is full of explicit sex.  The plot itself is compelling, but I have to skip at least a page every chapter because of all of the nasty.  I don't intend to purchase any more Follett novels until I have researched them and am sure that he has abandoned the filth.

B001I0T92Q|5.0|First off, some of marketing for the CR-5400 is misleading because it may have been written before the PSP firmware supported 32 GB.  The CR-5400 does support 32 GB as does the PSP so long as it is at or above the firmware version where 32GB support was added.  Unfortunately I don't know what version that is, but that happened several years ago.  It is likely that any PSP running 3.0x or above will work.    I am using the PhotoFast CR-5400 with two [[ASIN:B001L1H0SC SanDisk 16 GB Class 2 microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-016G (Bulk Packaging)]].  The device I am using it in is a PSP model 2001 installed with custom firmware 5.00 M33-6.  After formatting the card in the PSP and connecting the PSP as a USB drive, Windows reports a total capacity of 29.6 GB.  This isn't unexpected as actual capacity is often slightly smaller than advertized, especially with discrepancies between actual binary data size and the user friendly \\"Literal\\" data size.  (29.6 binary GB is 31.78 \\"Literal\\" GB so this is close enough to advertized capacity and in line with the expected capacity.)    The microSDHC cards installed easily, but there was some difficulty installing the CR-5400 into my PSP.  The problem appeared to be that the contact board for the CR-5400 was slightly misaligned.  After some careful wiggling of the CR-5400 card I managed to insert it without damaging it or my PSP.  The card now slides easily in and out of the MS Pro Duo slot.  Just be careful if your card does not insert easily as you could break something if you force it in.    I purchased this card for Homebrew software and to play backups of the UMD games I legally own.  The game backups in question appear to load faster from the CR-5400 and SanDisk microSDHC combo than from the 4 GB Sony MS Pro Duo I was using previously.    There is a possible problem with the CR-5400 and putting the PSP in Sleep mode, but I have not adequately tested this to be certain.  My PSP has locked up twice coming out of Sleep Mode sinceinstalling the CR-5400, but I am not entirely certain of the cause.  Some homebrew or plugin I am using may be causing this problem.  If you have any doubts, always save your progress before putting your PSP to Sleep.    Other reviews mention data corruption when copying multiple files.  Even under normal circumstances I would not recommend running multiple concurrent file transfers to a Flash device.  Multiple concurrent file transfers to a Flash device actually take longer and may cause errors in the data.  Always run one file transfer at a time.  However, you can highlight multiple files and folders to copy in a single file transfer and they will be written one at a time using the maximum speed possible.    I will update this review after I have used this product for a few months.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|We bought this pool for our son's 3rd birthday party. It was a total hit! All the kids enjoyed playing in it! We love the option of having the 'sprinkler' part on or off. The slide works fine, however we stuck a plastic slide into the pool and the kids used that also. Lots of fun. My sister bought one for her children, and I know others at the party who were interested in getting this one also.     On a side note- My husband accidentally punctured the pool with a nail but they provide patches. We haven't tested it out yet. We'll have to wait for the summer....
B004498KPU|5.0|This video showcase turned into a really wonderful surprise.  I had totally forgotten how a lot of these videos started. For years I've seen just the \\"main\\" dance of these videos and had totally forgotten that there is a complete story with each video. It was so enjoyable watching the whole story and dance.  The only thing that I felt disappointed in was that disc one is only in 2.0 and also the Blu-ray option would have been nice.  I've only watched the first disc so far.  I also liked the packaging.  I'm not sure what you call that effect of the pictures that are on it, but it is really special.
B00171LFFK|5.0|Having the complete collection of Van's official releases,including the original release of this CD, I had decided to purchase this Japanese Remastered copy to \\"complete\\" my collection.    To say that this version is stunning in it's clarity (on a quality hifi system) would be to make a major understatement.    While this Japanese Remastered version is shorter (by seconds) than the original release it is sonically superior with greater definition between the voice and instrumentation. The difference between the highs and lows are more accurate.     The original album artwork is substantially retained, and an additional booklet is included with the full lyrics (in Japanese and English).    Following the release of the Live Astral Weeks CD and DVD last year, this remastered eddition of a seminal album is now the cornerstone of my collection.    Even my partner on hearing both versions was amazed at the obvious differences, she coined the phrase that \\"Van's in our living room\\".    I now look forward to obtaining a remastered copy of \\"Moondance\\".
B003YUC2FE|1.0|LOVE the SHOWS - all 3 of them, Disney/Pixar ROCKS !!!<br />However, in this particular (very CHEAP and SHODDY Toy Box Edition) the Blu-Ray version of Toy Story 3 is DEFECTIVE (starting at Scene 25)  I have returned the product THREE TIMES, the final return was for a REFUND.

142313494X|5.0|While Percy Jackson,our hero,is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he discovers his friend Grover is half man and half goat.  The adventure begins. Grover becomes his guide. The book takes us through Camp Half Blood and into Greek mythological places as Percy and Grover try to rescue Percy's mom from Hades. Along the way they encounter many people including Anna Beth that helps them on their search to save his mom. The final meeting comes when Percy finds out that his father is Poseidon. This book is filled with fun and adventure that all boys and girls will enjoy. It involves his school, camp and finally the place that the Greek gods live, Mount Olympus.I highly recommend this book.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I do not understand when I hear people say \\"the critics did not like it\\"  It was exactly what it was supposed to be.  There was action, good and evil and good chemistry between the leading man and lady.  I loved it.  It reminded me of the feeleing I got seeing the Indiana Jones movies (the good ones).  And my 8 year old is getting it for Christmas.  It is good AND apporpriate for almost any age.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan's Texas Flood album is one of my favorites, and hands down one of the greatest musical statements of that decade. My review is simply to inform buyers of any differences between this version (1999) and the older original version (1983). Basically, the only reason to buy this newer version is for the bonus tracks. The newer version is not very sonically different than the older original version, which for a CD released in 1983 had better than average sound quality including good bass response and a decent output level. It was mixed and mastered just like a vinyl record using no discernable compression. This newly \\"remastered\\" version sounds very similar with just barely a perceptible amount of a higher output level. Also, for those that hate remastered discs that use too much compression to make them seem louder, this version is NOT a victim of the loudness war. I checked the level with a Denon CD recorder and the levels did not even hit the -0- Decibel mark. Hope this helps in making your buying decision.
0307454541|1.0|I was traveling and wanted something compelling, and even though I usually agree with the negative reviews of best sellers, I figured, How bad can it be?  I read about 20 boring, annoying pages over the course of four days, and then picked up an Agatha Christie, which took me a day to finish.  I just don't think this was well-written, and I don't mean the translation.  I mean the narrative.  Fiction 101 tells a writer to SHOW, NOT TELL.  Instead of making there be anything vivid, let alone convincing, about these people or the pathos of the situation, Larsson tells tells tells.  Additionally, as many have commented, Larsson spends so much time in exposition, there is no forward momentum.  As stated, I couldn't go beyond 20 pages.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Some people think that BBT is the \\"nerdy version of Friends\\" but, though the show is just as funny, it is not the same show.  Each of the quirky characters is a genius creation that is difficult to categorize into a standard role.  I love the show because it is not terribly complicated yet the jokes are witty and not the same old stale sitcom fare.  You can watch just about any episode and get all of the jokes without having seen a single other episode.  If you are a fan, though, you laugh even harder by knowing the characters and their back stories.  Every episode is hilarious and some are downright side splitting.  Other shows I really like are Scrubs, How I Met Your Mother and Friends.  I do not like slapstick humor like The Three Stooges or I Love Lucy.  I also don't care much for tasteless humor like Dumb and Dumber.  Hopefully, that gives you an indication of my tastes.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|I recently heard of this movie, saw it, had to own it!  Maggie....ah!  She's wonderful in this film!  Her subtle transformation is subtle and speaks to her level of talent.  She's a bold and brave actor.  James Spader...he's the man.  He's always the man.  As a matter of fact, where the heck is he??      Great film, 4 out of 5 stars because I would have liked more story telling of the actually dominant/submissive orders, but that's just my opinion...still a fab story!
0439023491|5.0|After I finished The Hunger Games and before starting Catching Fire, I was worried that I would be disappointed because what I loved so much about the first book was the action taking place in the arena of the hunger games. when i brought this up to a friend (who had finished the book already), she responded with, \\"well i don't think you have to worry about that.\\" and she couldn't have been more right.<br /><br />Catching Fire was an incredible sequel to The Hunger Games. It doesn't lack any of the action, adventure, and romance that had me hooked to Hunger Games. I disagree with some of the reviews saying it was too repetative. Collins puts in new twists and introduces you to a new group of characters. You also learn more about some of the characters from the first book such as Gale, president Snow, and Haymitch.<br /><br />I really enjoy Katniss's personality. She is very human to me; strong and caring but with faults too. She questions her motives and isn't always sure of what she is feeling, which makes her very real. She is in no way portrayed as a perfectly good person.<br /><br />It is hard for me to find faults with this book. Perhaps that the writing  sometimes sounds less mature, almost, then the topic itself. But the wonderfully constructed world, real and enjoyable characters, never ending twists and surprises, and Collins's ability to end each chapter in such a way that you're either starring open-mouthed at the page until your brain has processed what you have just read, or your fingers are flipping to the next page so fast to find out what happens next easily makes up for it.<br /><br />The final touch to this incredible book is the unbelievable last sentence. This cliffhanger will leave you waiting in agony until the third book comes out. I will definitely be getting The Mockingjay as soon as it is out.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|Daft Punk have created history for themselves. Not only is this their first official credit for musical score of a major motion picture, they have honoured the pioneers of the electronic music genre and have defined 'legacy' with this soundtrack.    I am still an avid listener of the likes of Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Orbital to name a few. Daft Punk have borrowed from the soundscapes, layers and repetition of the past and have added depth, orchestral and modern tones to create a world of danger, mystery and unknown in a time where technology is now ever more advanced.    I think if one recognizes the talents of the pioneers of the genre and appreciate the early electronic sound, you will appreciate this soundtrack. Daft Punk rose to the occasion and succeeded.

1597801585|3.0|A dystopian thriller set in post-oil Thailand following environmental meltdown that pits Western trade influences against Eastern environmental isolationism. Is this the future of genetic food modification?      Paolo Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl has been gaining considerable critical acclaim. Set in a future version of Thailand, it's an interesting take on the environmental meltdown scenario that has garnered it a couple of science fiction awards (the Hugo and Nebula awards) and was named as the ninth best fiction book of 2009 by Time magazine.    Like William Gibson, Bacigalupi sets his work in the near future and at the heart of this science fiction tale is a thriller story.  For me, this isn't in Gibson's league in terms of writing. At least not yet. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot that's right with this book, but it doesn't have Gibson's panache yet although there is promise of an interesting writer and I would certainly read future works by him.    The scene is a dystopian Thailand (why Thailand, I'm not sure but it lends a pleasing level of exoticism to the book) set somewhere in the not too distant future. Our current age is referred to as the Expansion. We are now in the Contraction. Energy resources are used up. We don't seem to have mastered solar, wind or wave energy now and power is largely provided by genetically modified elephants (have you ever noticed how obsessed science fiction writers are with elephants? Keep an eye out for how many have some kind of trunked animals) who wind battery-like springs. Sea level has risen - the city is only afloat thanks to a system of dykes - and food supply has been ravaged by genetic engineering with agri-businesses from the West blighted with frequent horrible diseases. It's not all together clear if this is intentional or not. It's not a nice place. It's a well thought out scenario though and there's power battles going on between the Trade department who want to deal with the outside world and the Environmentdepartment who favour an isolationist stance.    The book features plight of several people. There's the Western Anderson Lake who secretly works for one of the hated agri-businesses who wants access to a stored government seedbank. Throughout the book he's referred to as Anderson - OK, that's fine as an editorial choice, but there's no consistency. Another Western character Richard Carlyle is referred to throughout as Carlyle. A minor point, I know, but irritating (to me at least).    We also follow the journey of Anderson's (or Lake's) plant manager at the spring factory he uses to hide his real intention. Hock Seng is a Malayan Chinese and therefore an illegal immigrant. He's kind of in it for himself. Then there's the two Environment agents, at least one of which may not be all that they seem. And then, of course, there's the Windup Girl. What's a Windup Girl, I hear you ask? She's a Japanese New Person - a genetically engineered being created to serve who has been left behind by her former master and now hides out in a gentlemen's club (I use the term loosely) where she is ritually abused. Of course, she's beautiful and subservient - she's a science fiction cyborg for goodness sake! And so, needless to say, she will have a big part to play in the outcome.    There are a few strands that don't quite follow (who is responsible for what happens to one character's wife is still a mystery to me) but for the most part it's well thought out and cohesive, if a bit dark. Perhaps that's the reason for my luke warm reaction to the book - there's very little clever humour that is a feature of people like Gibson. Christians are now known as Grahamites (in a humourous reference to Billy no doubt) and there's a species of genetically modified cats known as Cheshires. These have no relevance to the story and yet there are constant references to them throughout. In fact there is a fair bit of repetition, particularly in the first half of the book - perhaps a slightly more aggressive edit would have tightened this up a bit to the benefit of the book.    My biggest frustration was the stories that weren't told though. Anderson remains fairly enigmatic throughout but I wanted to know more about the agri-business shenanigans in the West. Yes I get that they want to trade, and want new gene pool material, but what else is going on there? How did Anderson get here? And then there's the fantastic character of Gibbons who is some gene hacking guru hidden away by the state having fled the West. Now he has a story to tell, but we learn next to nothing about him, other than his new-found passion for Lady Boys.      It's a good book, and entertaining enough, but it's one of those books that is frustratingly close to being really very good indeed, but it doesn't quite get there.
0385528752|5.0|I read this book and then I was lucky enough to hear Dan Heath speak twice so I'm not sure if I'm really reviewing the book or the material - no matter - it is excellent.  The Heath brothers provide truly direct, concrete information to understand how to approach change.  This couldn't have come at a better time for my work  - especially shrink the change, focus on emotions, make the issues visual (e.g. read about the gloves), and highlight the bright spots.  The example about fighting childhood malnutrition is one I have repeated numerous times.  Definitely worth reading!
B000W10AEI|3.0|The second book is probably my least favourite and I think this second movie also comes off second best after the first. The plot is certainly simpler and translates well to cinema, but it lacks the excitement and magic of the first movie. If I wasn't such a Harry potter addict, I'd probably give this film a miss... but it's a must for all Harry potter marathons, and I guess I'll just have to smile and endure it. Like the first movie it is reasonably scary - so be watchful when watching with small children.<br /><br />Introducing Dobby (the house elf), flying cars and an opened chamber of secrets. The second movie doesn't waste any time with introductions - it just gets straight into it. It is still pretty idiot-proof in terms of plot, but lacks a bit of the happy-magic from the first movie. Snakes and spiders galore makes it possibly my least favourite film. Magic ink and ghosts that lurk in the toilets make for a clever plot line that all can enjoy. As I said before, too many spiders and snakes for my liking - but if these animals don't scare you like they do me, then you'd probably love it.
1400052173|5.0|For me, this book has it all - A story that needs to be told, well researched, a very personal story about a family with many struggles, and a lens on a disturbing side of society.  Having never studied the sciences, I did not know anything about HeLa cells, but I heard the author on NPR and I was intrigued. However, I am interested in social justice issues and this book helps the reader understand many effects of racism. This really is a book that is hard to put down and a must-read on many lists.
B002GJT4XW|3.0|So as is often the case, this movie isn't as good as the book, but it is still a must buy for the DVD collection. I watched it again recently and was surprised just how young the actors are in this film, compared to later films. They really do a great job and the director is reasonably true to the book. I'm still not convinced Harry potter is actually a kids movie. I think I would have been freaked out as a child. However this first movie is pretty slow moving and has loads of lovely scenes and ideas that kids will just love. Be warned it does get scary in patches.<br /><br />This is a great introduction to the land of magic. We meet Professor Dumbledore, Hagrid, Harry Potter (and his Muggle family), all within the opening minutes; And of course Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger aren't too far behind once Harry gets to Hogwarts. The magic of the first book is brought to life in this first movie, and the best thing I think about it is that it is virtually stand-alone. No previous knowledge is required and nothing but a vivid imagination is needed. It is exactly the sort of movie I would have enjoyed watching as a kid, and it has the same appeal to me today as Disneyland does.
B0000U5RO4|3.0|I'll give it to you in a very short simplistic way. It's not worth $20.00 of your money, so that said; why would anyone charge $172.00 unless they really don't won't to sell it??    Personally the casting department could have done a better job such as adding Liz Hurley to be the female agent, she's better known for her roles in movies like Austin Powers, International man who shagged me, another Austin Powers movie, but since this was a lower budget film I guess they got what they could.    That said, this film doesn't really suffer from dry British comedy; but there just aren't enough scenes to keep the audience laughing, only the middle of the film where we find Johnny English unsuccessfully trying to be like Tom Cruise in \\"Mission Impossible\\" and working undercover while injecting himself with a nerve agent is the best selling point of this film.  Too sum it up, it's like The Naked Gun & Austin Powers rolled up into a moderately low budget film.    So I gave it three stars.
0451228375|5.0|World with out End is an exellent sequel to Pillars and can also be read alone. It takes place in the same town as Pillars about 200 years later, so you have a whole diferent cast of charactors and series of events taking place. This book has it all....love, war, betral and triumph. This is the first book of Follett's that i've read and I am now a fan of his work. This is one of my favoret book of all time, next to The Pillars of the Earth. Five stars!
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This turned out to be one of those books that you think about long after finishing the last page.  I have recommended it to many friends.  I recommend it to you, too.
0345409671|5.0|In my opinion, this is Anne Rice's best novel yet. I love the vampire chronicals but this book can stand alone. It is a book that will keep you thinking for some time after. This book is a novel, not a book to base your faith on or a supposed true historical account of heaven and hell or God and the Devil. If you keep that in mind I think you will enjoy this book.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|We were very disappointed in this version with Jim Carrey.  It was quite boring.  We like the original Christmas Carol and even the Muppet Christmas Carol.  We felt no Christmas Spirit in this movie.
B004498KPU|3.0|Michael Jackson's Vision should be called Michael Jackson's Incomplete Vision the video's look remastered for most but who in their right mind would box in top bottom left and right of the screen seriously who wants to see this quality of video from a perfectionist? if your going to release something use complete videos and fill in the whole screen the audio sounds good but definitely not perfect on some videos my biggest complaint of all if an uncensored version of Scream exist I am sure They Don't Care About Us included uncensored offending lyrics the problem here is it's on dvd we can choose which videos to watch or skip if we are offended he faught his whole life for freedom of speech and for causes he cared deeply about so give him that freedom back do not censore him like this it is completely uncalled for and disrespectful if your offended by his lyrics your obviously not listening to the messages he was trying to get across in his music it wasn't to offend it was to express his feelings towards racism hate biggotry and the mistreatment of kids and other people of the world this is worth buying if u have a zoom option on your dvd players. also as many others point out there are videos missing on this set how can it be his true vision if u censore him and leave off some of his best videos the problem here in my opinion has got to be the money hungry vultures at SONY it is sad as well known as sony is they release something like this which unless u people been sleeping since the early 2000's mistreated him very badly and even went as far as not promoting invincible whats even sadder I also purchased The Jacksons An American Dream [[ASIN:B00005TQ44 The Jacksons - An American Dream (The Complete Miniseries)]]which was released by Motown and was also originally a made for tv movie and the image quality on it was excellent so why not do Michael Jacksons music videos the same way???

B002XTXG1G|5.0|Amazing movie...I purchased this as a gift for my lover. We both watched it and it was riveting! The fact that its an autobiography, they captured the life of the main character so well, I thought.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan is a one of a kind directors, and his movies have a way of making you question yourself as well as your own world view. The visuals were stunning and imaginative to say the least, but the main character (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio)was so engrossing that you get lost in his story and find yourself wondering what great secret he is hiding and how it will affect the movie in the end. And long after the credits have rolled You will catch yourself wondering who's dreaming, and whether your the dreamer or the dream.
0316776963|5.0|How I wish I really knew David Sedaris.  After reading this book in little more than an afternoon, I'm convinced he's the most lovable, most interesting, most entertaining companion you could hope for.  The book is a collection of essays, reminiscences of his life here and there and then and now.  He describes a family of eccentrics, and as different as David is from most of us, he is far from being the most eccentric. Odd folks, but people who love each other.  David also treats us to uncommonly honest self-appraisals without weighing it down with justification or motivation or judgment.  And, oh yes, it's funny!  Not every page, though every page is interesting, but lots of pages are laugh out loud hilarious.  I suspect not everyone would find it so, maybe only those of us who think we're more sophisticated and subtle than everyone else.  But those who enjoy a good snicker and the occasional guffaw will love this book.    From Gretchen Craig, author of [[ASIN:B00475AUEK Crimson Sky]], which is wonderful, but really not funny.
B003TML0VO|1.0|First off, I have to admit I rarely see the point in any cover tune albums. What makes this much worse is the selection of songs. How on earth can 'Photograph' by Def Leppard ever be called a great guitar classic. There are several on this cd likewise. In addition, why would you cover Led Zeppelin's 'Whole lotta love'? Ditto for 'Smoke on the water'.You can't possibly improve on some of these originals. They are what they are (were), from decades ago. That's probably why I generally don't like recorded cover tunes. Songs should be just left alone. My mind is too engrained with how the original is. Sometimes, I think live performances are interesting. There are many Led Zepp tribute bands out there that do a far better job than this attempt anyway. Misleading because there are simply so many better examples of 'great' guitar songs out there. If I could give zero stars, I would.
B0043N9D76|5.0|Marron 5 made an awesome album with this....plain and simple. The songs are catchy, melodic, upbeat, and Adam's singing reels you in and makes you want to play this again and again. This band plays to its strengths so well. They really know exactly what they are doing and leave no doubt that Maroon 5 is a memorable and great band. There are no weak tracks on this album....it's just that good!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|My Grand daughter has been a Twilight fan for years. So, back in Oct when I found out that the release date for Eclipse was Dec 4th, I promptly ordered it. Her 16th Birthday is Dec 9th, I was sure I would have it in time,since I had pre ordered other DVD's and had received them on the release day. I received this DVD on Dec 11th a full week after the release date. My husband has pre ordered Despictable Me (release date Dec 14th) He received an e mail today that he will receive his DVD next week. Looks like we'll be going to Wal-Mart, Target, or Best Buy on the release days to buy or DVD's

160094048X|5.0|I got this book in October 2010, a couple of months ago.  I have made 6 different recipes so far and two of them I have made more than once.  For the most part, the cookies came out looking and tasting great with a perfect texture.  I shared the results with my office and people were shocked that \\"they have no eggs?!!??\\"      My favorites so far are the chocolate crinkle cookies and the chocolate peanut butter pillow cookies.  (I used almond butter.)  Even the pillow cookies came out looking just like the picture, which means to me something about \\"truth in advertising\\".  In other words, the authors really made their own cookies and took pictures of the results.  I've made both of these cookies twice, so the first great results were not flukes.    The book size/dimensions are ideal for a cookie cookbook.  The paper size is nice and small, but the text is not.  The color photographs that exist are wonderful.  HOWEVER, I do wish that all the recipes had color photographs.  Beware that they do not.  Also, there were a couple of places where I had wished for a photograph of an intermediate step.  The only photographs in the book are of the finished product.    While the instructions are clearly written, there were a couple of places where I would get to a recipe and think, \\"Why didn't they order the ingredients a more logical way?\\" \\"Why didn't they think to say such and such?  It would have made the recipe easier to make\\".  In a world where you can get so many recipes off the internet for free, to ask people to pay for a cookbook should be to provide excellence.      That said, I do believe the book deserves the 5 stars I gave it.  None of the drawbacks are very serious.  All of the positives are significant.  I keep flipping through the pages and wanting to try everything right away.  I have confidence that the results will be good, and that after the cooking, I will get to enjoy a fabulous cookie, cruelty-free.
B00008XEOI|5.0|this is a must buy if you are a major fan of lion king like me. this is the best Disney movie in my opinion.
B00009ZYC1|2.0|I just saw Shrek for the first time. I had heard tons of positive comments on the movie, but I'm that impressed. Animated movies like Ice Age or How To Train Your Dragon are way better than this movie.<br />It wasn't that bad, but I'm not sure why everybody likes this movie that much. I found a lot of the characters kind of irritating, and the storyline was too simple (ever for a children's movie).
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We saw this version at the movie theater at a sing-a-long and loved it so much we wanted a copy to have at home and enjoy over and over. We liked the fact that it includes an option to view the lyrics to the songs so you can have a sing-a-long at home. The restoration is truly brilliant. I was very happy to get it for such a great price. Thank you.
B002ZG98CS|5.0|With great action and over-the-top sequences, nice plot and great aesthetics of an exploitation film. Robert Rodriguez makes another outstanding, cult movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a great series.  It is the wild west in space.  The characters are well developed and the story lines are great.  It was a shame that the networks cancelled the series after a year. The series has a large following amoung the young and old.   It is well worth the money.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Very gritty and honest book, I think men and women alike will find this book touching and engaging. A very honest in the moment look at eating disorders, sexuality, and family issues. A rare find to peer  into the mind of a famous actress with these issues. I couldn't put it down.
B002VPE1PW|5.0|Great product - with room for netbook and mouse, plus a small notebook, this small case protects my notebook and is the perfect size to slip into my purse. Wraparound zipper makes it easy to cruise through airport security without having to pull on the netbook to get it out of the case. Recommended!!

B0037KMHRY|5.0|I'm a big fan of the soundtrack to 'The Bourne Supremacy' (the second Bourne movie). This reminds me very much of it, but is of course unique. Graet job!
0446679089|3.0|This book sat on my shelf unread for years.  I got it cheap and had better things to read.  I finally took it down and started to read it, solidly questioning that decision for about the first 200 pages.  Lead character John Corey came off as a cartoonish caricature of a tough NYC detective like the production of a lazy writer who'd been beaten up in school a few times and who'd seen too many bad movies.  Sadly, I can't say Corey ever improved as a character - he's a testosterone driven, rule-breaking, wise-cracking d-bag solving crime with his fists.  About halfway through, though, the plot turns sideways.  Using one of the most ridiculous and cliched reasons possible, somehow DeMille turns what appears to be an idiotic parody into a pretty decent read.<br /><br />It's clear that a good amount of research went into the book and that is reflected in the writing.  I can't say the rest of the book is believable or that the ending is quite what it should be, but how it gets there makes for a solid page-turner.  As mundane and silly as the first third of the book is, it really is necessary for the plot, so try to bore through it as best you can.
B002ZG97RY|2.0|Story aside (which is bad), I'll only review the quality of the Blu-ray and sound.  Considering 66% of the movie is night scenes that look like they were recorded on VHS, I place this Blu-ray up there with the picture quality of \\"28 Days Later\\".  GRAINLY!!!  Barely DVD acceptable.  DTS 5.1 is weak, but this may be because of the visual chaos is hard to associate the sound to.   I feel bad that Matt Damon was the star of this movie.  As an actor, he's a perfect soldier.  But the poor story line in addition to the poor cinematography is the death knell for this movie, no matter how good of the acting.  Good luck next time.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I thought it was a good storyline, got confusing in areas but I worked through it. If you want pure entertainment don't watch it, but if you want a movie that makes you think then this one is for you.
030745455X|3.0|Whats up with all the boxing references? Felt like I was at a Mike Tyson fight, LOL! But really, this was just VERY AVERAGE, nothing special at all. Your typical book where murders get resolved at the end. The first 150 pages were slow as molasses. So much that I put the book down for 8 months until cajoled into giving it another try by several people who promised the story would pick-up. The story did eventually get underway but not enough to make amends for all the shortcomings: It's much too long, the villain Niederman is much too superhuman and Lisbeth's skills are much too exaggerated. I was totally outdone when she dug herself out of a grave after being shot THREE times! One bullet lodged in her skull!!! I don't get all the fuss?? Just your average book, really.
B001QHERB4|5.0|A wonderful, warm book!  I discovered it several years ago to share with the children in my licensed day care and am now purchasing it for all my grandchildren - marvelous!
B0042MEQVG|3.0|I`ve ordered new release movies from other vendors and NEVER had lousy delivery like this. The relese date was December 4th. Other vendors ship the movie 2-3 in advance so you`ll receive it ON the release date. Not Amazon! I pre-ordered it, and it wasn`t shipped until the 4th, and I didn`t get it until the 8th! UNACCEPTABLE!!!! ALL vendors actually have the movies in stock DAYS, and even WEEKS before they are oficially released to the public. There is no excuse to make the customer wait. And to top it off the price was the same as in the stores! I`ll never order a movie from Amazon again, and unless you like to wait, I`d advise you to do the same.
B0045XICB2|1.0|I'm really only writing this review to praise Amazon. The Twilight movies are awful, the acting is horrible and awkward to watch, however, I watch them just to see if maybe they will get less awful as the series progresses. So far they haven't gotten much better.  Anyway. I had a promotional code for a free video on demand rental, and I rented Eclipse just so that I wouldn't have to pay to see a movie I knew I wouldn't enjoy. The video quality sucked, I'm not going to lie. It was very choppy and it kept pausing and loading; it took forever to get through the movie (as if the storyline isn't slow enough as it is). However, I didn't bother filing a complaint, because it was a free rental, so since I didn't have to pay for anything, why should I complain? A few days later, I got an e-mail from Amazon saying they noticed the quality of my rental sucked, so they refunded it. I was very impressed. Now I can see a better movie, and it'll still be free. :) Thank you, Amazon.
B002ECJZ76|3.0|Filming beautiful. Dubbing awful. Watch extra feature making of (with subtitles) to see how character emotion is lost in translation. NO original language feature which is a MAJOR OVERSIGHT.
0810982862|2.0|I collect quite a number of 'Art of' books and I purchased the Art of Avatar thinking it was going to be of the same caliber as the Disney/Pixar and Dream Works books. When the book arrived I was disappointed with the quality. The book is about 1/4 the number of pages, the hard cover looks cheap and the content is a little commercial. It's like they've just printed the book to simply nab a little bit more of your money - not to celebrate the creative process of a technologically leading-edge film.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|Robert Rodriguez, you are the man! This is my favorite movie. Hell with all AvP's! Alien movies were the best and the first predator was amazing. Now this movie! Predators got upgraded, finally more than just one race, more alien creatures, even predators themselves are different. I absolutely love it. All starting from the story, the atmosphere, the alien planet, ending characters cast! I wanna more from you, man! This movie must be seen! Please continue your fabulous work with your movies! I want to see more movies like this one! And I want more aliens and predators. Plus you just created new species! ; ) This is one hell of an awesome movie. I'm in absolute love with it! Thanks dude!
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Sky Blue Sky is the ghost of John Lennon.  This album has the catchy tunes of a Beatles record with the honesty/sometimes sadness of a John Lennon solo album all with excellent production and wonderful musicianship.  This is Wilco's best album and one that takes a bit of patience to appreciate, but once you give it the time and understand it; wow, it's really remarkable.
B00327LEN0|5.0|Slaughterhouse-five        The ingenious author Kurt Vonnegut's book Slaughterhouse Five is about Billy Pilgrim and the Tralfamadorians. The book includes the fire bombing of Dresden, and Billy's ability to jump to different points in his life.      In the introduction, Kurt explains his life in the army and how he wrote the novel then explains the story(like how he got most of the ideas and the children's crusade). He then brings us to Billy's earlier days in the war. Vonnegut is quick to explain Billy's full life, and explain both of the plots (Dresden and Tralfamadore/after the war) and opens with Billy writing a letter to bring publicity to his experiences at tralfamadore and the tralfamadorian's ability to see in the 4th dimension. Billy then jumps to the war and Ronald Weary is introduced. Billy and Ronald are then captured by Germans after the two scouts they were traveling with are shot, and are sent with a group of Americans to walk to a train. In the process, Ronald Weary sustains injuries to his feet and starts to complain about how it was all Billy's fault. When Billy then jumps, it talks about his children, how he owns a very successful optometry company, his bed, and how his son becomes a member of the Green Beret. Billy jumps back to the war and finds himself boarding a train going to a prisoner camp. He then hears that Ronald Weary has died from injuries in their feet. After a long trip with many jumps in time, Billy arrives at the German camp, where he meets Edgard Derby, whom is pronounced to be shot by a German firing squad for stealing a teacup from the ruins in Dresden after it was firebombed(Kurt also pronounces that this actually happened to someone in his squad when they were in Dresden). Billy also meets a man named Paul Lazzaro, who promised Ronald Weary that he would kill Billy Pilgrim for getting them captured by the Germans. They go to a play put on by the British prisoners(who happen to be the favorites of the German guards), then eat food cooked by the other prisoners of war. Billy lights his arm on fire and is sent to the prison's clinic. Billy falls asleep and has some more time jump, including his time on Tralfamadorian zoo and meeting the movie star Montana Wildhack, and some of his life after the war back on earth. Billy wakes up in his bed in the clinic, drowsy from all of the morphine that the Englishmen have given him. He sees Paul Lazzaro in the clinic with a broken arm and a British person apologising to Lazzaro, to which Lazzaro promises to kill him after the war is over. Billy walks around for a while, and sees Kurt Vonnegut (yes, the author) in the latrine. Quoting this scene: \\"An American near Billy wailed that he had excreted everything but his brains. Moments later he said,'There they go, there they go'. He meant his brains\\" Vonnegut then talks about Dresden and Billy's work in \\"Schlachthof-fûnf\\" German for Slaughterhouse 5. The book finally reaches the firebombing of Dresden, and comes to a conclusion with how Billy goes on a radio station and talks about Tralfamadore. The story reaches conclusions to both of the plots, and talks shortly of death. As stated in the beginning the book end with birds chirping at Billy with \\"poo-tee-weet?\\".      Throughout the book, Billy is a somewhat static character, but instead of Billy, the people around him change, which is a better alternative than the . I say this because he doesn't change much throughout the Tralfamadore plot(of which most of isn't included in this review), and Billy is different from the tralfamadore plot line but doesn't change in the Dresden plot-if that makes sense. The overall challenge that Billy does face is his jumping in time. The reason that Dresden isn't overall problem(even though it is the most climactic part of the book)is because it is known that Billy will face this problem throughout the book.       The overall themes that Vonnegut seems to make are generally about how people can drift through life, and howwar is a terrible but sometimes necessary thing. This is a somewhat repeated theme, but Vonnegut shows it with very good style and an imaginative story, making the book very much worth reading.      The book is overall a very good book, with references to Vonnegut's other characters (ie. Kilgore Trout) and his own life in the war. He also includes a very vivid reality on Tralfamadore and the way the all seeing Tralfamadorians see in the fourth dimension. The very imaginative book \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" about Kurt Vonnegut's time in Dresden and his character Billy Pilgrim's time on Tralfamadore.      Works cited    Vonnegut, Kurt. Slaughterhouse-five. New York: Dial Press, 1997.

I completely understand that artists move in different directions, grow and try new things but I feel like her voice was under utilized.  That's my major complaint.  I felt her voice was better and they didn't let her soar.  None of the songs hit me like Rockferry or had the emotion or power to the lyrics. The only one that came close was \\"Hard for the Heart\\". I do like \\"Well, Well, Well\\", \\"Lovestruck\\" and \\"Breath Away\\" I gave her 4/5 because I know she'll knock it out of the park next time. We all know it.

0061537969|5.0|\\"Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass........It is about learning to dance in the rain.\\" This quote covers the essence of this wonderful book. There are very few novels that I have read over the years that captured my attention like \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain.\\" Garth Stein was a race car driver in the SCCA Racing Series and he brings a lot of his knowledge of racing to this novel.     This is written from the point of view of the main characters favorite pet Enzo the mixed breed dog. As Enzo prepares to move on, too Mongolia he also looks forward to getting a pair of thumbs, he looks back on his life. Garth gives you a look into what Enzo thinks, feels and the observations of his life and the lives of his people.     Weather you are a K-9 fan, a race fan, or just fan of a great book, this Novel is for you. I personally bought 3 copies of this and I've passed them out to my friends. The feed back from all of them has been all positive.
1589795474|5.0|This book tells how some people became millionaires.  It does not tell how to become a millionaire as one needs to have a good income to begin with. People who want to get rich quickly will be disappointed. From my experience, the statistics ring true.     I am a retired bank officer and financial analyst.  I worked in Los Angeles and found that many high earners such as physicians and actors tended to spend every nickle they had as quickly as they got it.   I received a loan application from a singer/actor who is long dead.  He wanted the bank to loan him $100,000 but he only had a net worth of $23,000 because he spent his millions and millions in earnings rapidly.  I declined the loan.      One of my customers was a \\"knighted\\" actress.  She couldn't balance her checkbook. She had someone manage her money and lived comfortably.       My husband and I are multi-millionaires. I had a good laugh as I viewed my coupon-clipping self in this book. My husband's car is a late model Pontiac because it is big and he is tall.  My husband and I have everything we want and we are setting aside money for the education of our grandchildren.  We are also gifting money to our children, periodically and in small doses, so that they learn to live within their means.      That's the lesson of this book. Live within your means and put some money aside for the long-haul. . .and yes, one has to have money left over after paying the bills so not everyone can become a millionaire.

The zoo sends various animals, in crates and boxes (presented as a flap in the book), but none of the animals are suitable for the child. An elephant is too big, a giraffe is too tall, a lion is too fierce, a camel is to grumpy, and so on. Until they send a perfect pet - a puppy!<br /><br />Kids will love guessing which animal is inside the box, since each drawing reveals some details to give just a little hint. Also parents can imitate the animal sounds to help children remember their names!<br /><br />Julia Shpak<br />Author of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

B00428ZRFE|3.0|Now let me say she is not the best singer!  If that is what you want this is not the person.  What she is is a person that will have a few big song on each of her albums.   She always has a few big number one pop hits that you hear every place.   She is fun and one of the it girls on now.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series is awesome.  Besides relying on true events, the accuracy of the weapons, uniforms, and tactics used during the War make Band of Brothers impossible to stop watching.  On Blu-Ray, the images are even clearer and more realistic.  I highly recommend this product for anyone.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|this movie is full of action.this movie is awesome.its cool how ninjas battle.i wonder why snake eyes brother killed his master.how do you make those missles desolve cities and destroy the eifei tower.how did rex survive the explosion four years ago.

B002JVWR54|5.0|I was skeptical at first about this series but after watching the first few eps i was hooked so i ended up buying the blu-rays season 1 and 2, i've only bought one other series i thought was worth it. Dollhouse and Firefly both on blu-ray.<br /><br />Love the characters and the situations they're faced with as an 'active'. Living in their abode 'Dollhouse' and summoned or activated when needed, the dolls are faced with real life missions or preferred 'engagements'. Each doll has their flaws even when so called programming them with professions to be the perfect companion for clients which can sometimes land them in sticky situations.<br /><br />Plot twists are mind guessing having you thinking about whats going to happen in the next episode and to whom.<br /><br />The supporting cast all play their characters well particularly 'Echo's' faithful handler 'Boyd Langton played by Harry J. Lennix (season 1) and Olivia Williams as 'Adelle DeWitt', the 'don't mess with me' underground facilities manager.<br /><br />Enjoyed the series overall and it was a nice fresh idea from all the over rated crime and medical series we're force fed. Dollhouse was sadly cut short of its time not allowing the series to grow to it's full potential.<br /><br />Season 2 contains 3 disks which includes all 13 eps plus extras such as deleted scenes, out takes and a short doco with Joss Wheddon and the cast.<br /><br />Its a nice transfer to blu-ray although not a perfect one, but clean never the less and is in 1.78:1 widescreen format and 6ch DTS-HD audio.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|It's unfortunate, but Dan Brown's novels are becoming formulaic and predictable. The Lost Symbol is a perfect example of this!
0525423273|5.0|I am a francophile and romantic, so admittedly this review is a little biased, but I couldn't put this book down.  I wanted to be Anna, and I completely fell in love with Etienne.  I still think he must be out there waiting for me...    Seriously, though, I thought this was a great book for ages 14+ - great character development and real-life drama.  Such a fun read!!
0399536108|5.0|I am now a total fan of Chris! If you were on the fence about this book, buy it now!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|This was the second Richard Castle book I've had the pleasure of reading. I enjoyed reading a book based on the characters I watch on tv...with a little twist. I would recommend the book to anyone that enjoys watching Castle on tv.
B002HNAAZ8|5.0|This is a great CD and I have played it over and over since I purchased it. This is probably the best CD Danger Danger released. A lot of good guitar rock songs and a couple ballads.
0451228731|5.0|It is very unusual to find a book that can combine such plausible, accurate depictions of technology and good writing in the same package.  This is that book.  By the end I didn't want to skip even a day to get to the sequel.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I watched the show in the 70s but was too young to appreciate it as I do now.  This is, simply put, a great buddy  cop bromance action show, with big cars, cool Huggy Bear, hot-tempered Dobey, and the adorable Starsky and Hutch. The theme song is rather dark and grim, but that's okay....There is plenty of humor and pathos and adventure to compensate for it with every episode.  We also get a glimpse of the unshakable bond between the two guys in such episodes as \\"The Fix,\\" \\"Shoot Out,\\" and \\"A Coffin for Starsky.\\"       There is some memorable dialogue as well, and feast your eyes on those 70s fashions: plaids, synthetic jackets, bell bottom pants, a cable knit sweater, and more.    Great stuff!
0142437611|5.0|I would love to give this book to all of my friends--under the condition that they read it. But since I make no such demands of my friends (having my own backlog of unread books, and not always liking the books I am given), I can only hope that people will come to it on their own.<br /><br />Seize the Day reads like a poem--taut, inevitable, every detail propelling the story and meaning. It is hilarious up until the end, but with brooding sadness mixed in. It plays with the preposterous and possible, the phony and genuine; the elusive (but \\"present\\") psychologist Tamkin is a mixture of them all.<br /><br />Tamkin's ridiculously bad (but sincere) poem gives me bellyaches. I will quote the first four lines.<br /><br />If thee thyself couldst only see<br />Thy greatness that is and yet to be,<br />Thou would feel joy-beauty-what ecstasy.<br />They are at thy feet, earth-moon-sea, the trinity.<br /><br />Tommy Wilhelm is overwhelmed by his losses and cannot even find the right words for them. There are hints of Job throughout, but an American, adolescent-middle-aged Job, whose laments are as profound as they are silly. (One of my favorite parts is where he uses the phrase \\"a question of morale,\\" and his father suggests that he meant \\"moral question.\\" He becomes flustered and tries to justify his word choice.) At the end Wilhelm finds a place--but how, and what this means, I won't say here. It is worth reading the book in order to find out.
B003L20ICE|4.0|This is one of those modern, unconventional California families: two lesbian moms who have given birth to a son and daughter by way of a sperm donor, whom the kids choose to meet when they get old enough to do so.  Conflicts ensue as the couple's problems surface with a vengeance, one partner has a fling with the donor daddy, and the kids are caught up in the turmoil.    The actors turn in very strong performances here, and the script and direction are good as well.  It is not suitable for everyone; the very traditional or strictly religious will be put off by the lovemaking between the women, although it is not graphic; and by the whole arrangement of their family.  Others, though, may enjoy it.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|As a former marine I felt the series is produced in a way that gives a non marine a little insight into the corps and the bantering that goes back and forth. It is very graphic, but halfway through (part 5) shows them in Austrailia during some R&R - this may give guys who are watching with thier girl friend or wife some relief from all the action.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Initially I had an issue where a screw was missing from the packing. A quick chat to the manufacturer and I was able to get an overnight shipment for that piece. They were very helpful and accomodating, took 15 minutes to generate the RMA.<br /><br />This product is excellent and very flexible. It can gromit mount, or clamp to the side of a desk. I have tried both and they work great. The arm is very flexible and can be worked to fit almost any desktop it would seem. I'm also very happy that the clamp and other mechanisms have adequate padding/safety as to not damage my new desk. They fit gracefully and require minimal assembly know-how.<br /><br />Great arm, especially for the price range... a steal!!!

B0028KCH5G|5.0|There are only a few series in TV history that have had me 'hooked'.  This is one of them.  The series gives us a great mix of cop/crime/serialkiller/narration/plot-twists.  Superbly written, and well edited into a great mix of continuing storylines.  There aren't that many books or movies out there, that have us feeling good about an 'antagonist'.  You have to have compelling character development and great writing to achieve this.  One of the best and accessible 'character studies' that I know of.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The Pacific is another masterpiece from the team that created Band of Brothers.  It has the same format, length, and is even packaged the same.  But it doesn't feel the same.  Clearly, the intent was to let the differences between the two theaters of war speak for themselves, and they do.  If the war in Europe was intense and filthy, the war the marines fought on a series of little Pacific islands was even more so, but with less acclaim.  Even today, the war against Japan is more apt to evoke Pearl Harbor and the ensuing naval war than the grinding and miserable experiences of the marines.<br /><br />BoB was based on an exceptional book of the same name by historian Stephen Ambrose.  He had painstakingly dug out the stories of a group of men who had trained and fought together, and wove them into a cohesive account of a single company of the 101st Airborne's experiences in the ETO.  The focus is on the group, and through the magic of film-making, the viewer comes to feel quite attached to the individual men in it.  And while it is not the focus of the story, the devotion of his men as earned by Capt. Winters emerges as an inspiring sub-text.  I have watched BoB several times and believe it is one of the most emotionally satisfying mini-series ever produced.<br /><br />The Pacific is outstanding, too.  But it is largely based on the memoirs of two men, Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie, who did not serve together.  The focus is less on the group than on the common, brutal experience of those who fought in those island campaigns and, frankly, even by the end of the series I did not feel I really knew who the other marines were apart from Sledge and Leckie.  (There is a third, Medal of Honor-winner John Basilone, whose story is followed until his death on Iwo Jima.)<br /><br />The result is a somewhat less cohesive series that, while serving as an honestly told piece of needed history and deserving of great praise, is harder to watch and somehow falls short in terms of dramatic arc.  Ironically, I suspect that the series would have been stronger if it had been based entirely on Sledge's account and the Leckie/Basilone stories had been jettisoned.  Nonetheless, despite these few reservations, the Pacific is a mini-series that can't be missed., I suspect that the series would have been stronger if it had been based entirely on Sledge's account and the Leckie/Basilone stories had been jettisoned.  Nonetheless, despite these few reservations, the Pacific is a mini-series that can't be missed.
030746363X|5.0|I've been looking forward to this since I first heard Tim talking about it, and expected it to be amazing, but when it arrived this week I was blown away by the size and depth of the book. Tim covers everything, in detail, and explains clearly how to try things out yourself. Without question I can say this is the best exercise/body-tech book I own.
030746363X|5.0|Tim is a modern combination of George Plimpton, Evil Knievel, Don Herbert, aka \\"Mr. Wizard\\", and Dr. Frankenstein. He is a dilettante, daredevil, gee-whiz educator and an experimenter who goes where no one else has. He's crazy. He conducts all these experiments on himself. Tim compiles copious amounts of data and collaborates with world class experts to accomplish goals we would all like to accomplish but don't know how. Even if you follow none of his advice, it's an enjoyable read and it's fun to accompany him on the journey. However, there are things I ended up wanting to try.    At 592 pages, your overall strength will increase just by carrying the book with you. It's also the kind of book you don't need to read from beginning to end; it's organized you so can read what interests you - which in my case was all of it.    The whole \\"4 Hour\\" idea, just like his previous book, \\"The 4 Hour Work Week\\", is a brand, not an accurate account of the time it takes to do what he says - just like \\"For Dummies\\" books aren't actually for dummies.
0307577589|4.0|I listened to the audio version of this book.  I think if I was trying to read it I would have been totally confused by all the characters!!  I am amazed at how the author kept them all straight!!<br />There were parts of the book I enjoyed and parts that were very disturbing!!  This is not a book for the \\"sensitive\\" reader.<br />Overall, I would say I liked it.  It was \\"a challenge!!\\"
B00192IV9U|5.0|Michael - Its a peak at what is left and if this is whats left then it sounds like  \\"You ain't seen nothing yet.\\" - Michael Jackson upon receiving (The Artist of the Millennium  Award). I honestly feel that way about the entire collection its gives us all the reasons why the world love and miss Michael Jackson so much. There is a little for everyone in this collection. I appreciate what the Estate, all the producers and Sony did in order to bring this collection for us his beloved heart aching fans . I love Invincible but I believe that there were too much songs on that CD that it hid the gems on it. In MICHAEL, this is NOT the case the hits stare you in the face.    Michael - is a cohesively amazing record. From \\"Hold my Hand\\" ft Akon - Touching ballad with everything MJ all over and accompanied by a stellar video this song has a beautiful message. 5/5 Stars    Hollywood Tonight - Love the beginning of this record. Feel good groove/ New Jack Swing dance-able just damn good funky Pop music. Love it!!! 5/5 Stars     Keep Ur Head Up - Very inspirational tune .... I love it 5/5 Stars     (I Like) The Way You Love Me - Excellent track 5/5 Stars     Monster ft fiddy - A little to much auto-toned Michael but this works in the club its banging man... Love it 4/5 Stars     Best of Joy - I can really appreciate MJ vocals here but its a little too mushy for me. I still think its good. 4/5 Stars     Breaking News - This track works but it think its oddly placed on the tracklisting. 4/5 Stars     (I Can't Make) Another Day ft Lenny Kravtiz - When this track leaked i have it on my Ipod and this version is so much better. The clarity in Michael's vocal range (awesome!!!!!!) and a superb track ..Love it 5/5 Stars    Behind the Mask - Wow ....thats all i have to say ....Love it 5/5 Stars     Much Too Soon - You left us much to soon Michael ... 5/5 Stars     Even Michael Jackson left overs are gems. Get it and add it to your collection you will not regret it. Long Live the King of Pop....
B002GO856E|4.0|And so it begins...Clark Kent, our hero...is never recognized as such.  It's amazing to see how young this cast was when they began and how far they've come in their acting abilities...especially Tom Welling and Allison Mack who were together for 9 years.  I like seeing these young people who, essentially become super sleuths, develop their skills.  It's actually funny how they were so brave venturing out trying to figure out which freak of the week was about to destoy someone or something.  It's also wonderful to see how far the story has come once Clark got out of high school.  I'll always look at these early episodes with fondness even though they aren't always my favorites.
0307346609|5.0|This book was an extremely fun and fast paced book to read. It makes the zombie appocolypse more believable than any book or movie i have come across. It explains the little details that you wouldn't always consider in a world wide epidemic movie or book. A must read for any zombie genre fan. Makes a great gift.
B00192IV9U|5.0|The standout tracks are so good, they more than make up for the weaker ones. Maybe it's not the masterpiece Michael would have wanted but a great collection of his unreleased material that you'll play on repeat for weeks. Every Michael Jackson fan should own this - there's something for everyone. Let's get MJ back to Number One where he belongs!    1. HOLD MY HAND - 6/10 (Feels more like Akon than MJ but a really good beat and features completed vocals by MJ done in a different style from what we're used to. The end is especially great. A true MJ anthem.)    2. HOLLYWOOD TONIGHT - 8/10 (Despite the over-processed vocals, this is a brilliantly catchy and energetic track. It combines classic MJ beats with contemporary ones. Michael would have been proud. The spoken word bridge by Michael's nephew is disappointing, however. It's one of the Cascio tracks so it has that same slightly claustrophobic, over-layered feel to it. Still one of my favorites on the album.)    3. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP - 6/10 (A sweet and catchy, inspirational song which would have been better with just Michael's stripped vocals. It's a Cascio track so the vocals are again over-processed and slightly tacky in its production which is what keeps it from feeling like a timeless MJ classic. But definitely one you'll have on repeat.)    4. I LIKE THE WAY YOU LOVE ME - 6/10 (A smooth retro-sounding ballad with a little Lauryn Hill instrumentation. Way better than the version available on the MJ box set. If only they had followed Michael's introduction to the track this could have been a classic in the vein of BUTTERFLIES. But it's amazing to hear him introduce the track.)    5. MONSTER - 7/10 (Aggressively catchy - the tune feels contemporary and the 50 Cent rap is fun. The chorus is a little repetitive but given what they had to work with, the track works. It's banging. Again, it's a Cascio track so it unfortunately has that over-filtered MJ vocal).    6. BEST OF JOY - 5/10 (This is the last song MJ ever recorded and it feels the most unfinished on the album. A nice, if overly simple, vocal melody. Not one you'll have on repeat but kind of beautiful in its tone. The audio quality feels more 'open' and pure than the Cascio tracks.)    7.  BREAKING NEWS - 3/10 (The least successful track on the album. The Cascio-recorded vocals are more processed than ever and while the song has great energy it falls short of feeling like classic MJ. It's just an over-produced mess. This is the track that made everyone doubt the album and they should have just left it off in favor of the leaked ALL I NEED produced by Mark Ronson or DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILDREN ARE which is one of Michael's best unreleased tracks.)    8. I CAN'T MAKE IT ANOTHER DAY - 7/10 (Michael's voice has always been best against guitars, acoustic or electric - and this song is great and features clean un-processed Jackson vocals. Kravitz over-does it a little with his guitar, especially since the 'leaked' original snippet featured a more subdued guitar that matched the song better. Listen to the lyrics, they have an unexpected meaning now.)    9. BEHIND THE MASK - 10/10 (Wow. This is the stand-out track on the album. Retro but amazing. You can feel the energy emanating from Michael. It will bring a smile to your face and make you want to dance! It's right up there with Michael's greatest songs. An instant classic. Totally perfect vocals.)    10. MUCH TOO SOON - 9/10 (Simply beautiful and poignant. This is another of the best tracks on the album. It was written during the THRILLER days but recorded for the HISTORY album. If only they hadn't added so much production and that distracting accordion. Look for the Bruce Swedien mixed version it's much simpler and even more beautiful. Again, pristine, unfiltered vocals.)
030746363X|5.0|As a life long fitness junkie, I have have spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on training and information.  I have a 4 year degree in Exercise Science, and work as a personal trainer.  That said...    This is THE ONE BOOK that I recommend to everyone.    The information itself is invaluable. Also, its delivered as a story, in a way that is GENUINELY ENTERTAINING.  I laughed out loud regularly while reading it (especially during the Doubling Testosterone chapter).    Any one chapter has the power to change your life.  My current focus Occam's Protocol: The Minimalist Approach to Mass. I use principles therein during training with clients.  Effortless Superhuman is my next focus, and a must read for ANY aspiring athlete.  Want a sports scholarship to you favorite college? Start here.    I'm very happy with my purchase of this book.  So far I've bought 2 extra to give away to friends!
031603438X|5.0|This book was well written and kept me captivated for a couple of days.  At times it was like going down a memory path of things that happened from the '50s to now.
0156027321|5.0|I enjoyed Yann Martel's witty straight forward show don't tell style very much and his story of Pi. The story is very informative/enlightening as well as entertaining. I appreicate his universal attitude toward spiritualism, recognizing after all taht 'religion' is a mand made concept OF spiritualism.  I especially appreciate the author's illustrations of the many myths/ misperceptions regarding animal behavior and human/animal relationships.    While Pi's story seems to be hard to believe, he is ever so believable anyway. It's the best book I've read in a long time.. on my Kindle.
030746363X|5.0|I couldn't believe how huge this book was considering it was 15 bucks.    Normally I don't like huge books, but this one isn't required to be read front to back. It's all split up into topics like losing weight, having great sex, increasing testosterone, building muscle, and other topics. So it's pretty cool, and I've never seen anyone publish such extensive data about their individual experiments!    Everyone thought Tim was going to flop after his first bestseller, but I highly doubt that's possible. This book has what millions want and need. Check it out :-)
030746363X|5.0|I've bought countless health, nutrition, fitness and self-improvement books but this one is in a class all by itself. Why? Because unlike all too many other books, the author doesn't rely on mere theory or anecdotes about what works when it comes to losing weight, becoming stronger, improving sleep and more. Rather he advocates only what he's been able to PROVE works through careful experimentation. In fact he actually provides the raw data for each experiment so the reader can draw their own conclusions.  At the same time, he has a flair for writing and kept my interest with compelling stories throughout the book.  Highly recommended.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Given the circumstances of the prior season, the writing and acting of this season, reflected a sensitivity and wisdom that duly honored the 1st stage of Dexter's healing process.  And it comes \\"full circle\\" with it, very beautifully. (Of course, the fun entertainment of all the other Dexter's seasons was also there! :-D)<br /><br />Everything about this show is excellent.  Thanks to all who participate in this production! :-)
B003ZSH606|5.0|Again a great band is massacred by the critics, not even worth talking about it, it seems that is a sport. Why do consistently critical of albums that do not like? Let's leave aside please. I want half of the albums that were currently out even half as good as this record is.<br /><br />Leaving that aside, again I have to say (and feel) that I have a deep respect for the band Jamiroquai, with that energy so positive, so creative, so beautiful with the inherited spirit of great things done in the 70's and 80's (early). I would say that in my very personal opinion is one of the best albums made by Jamiroquai, much more introspective through its great moments, J Kay delights us (again) with beautiful music that makes us laugh and have fun, that makes us dance happily (which we all need in these difficult times), beautiful melodies, dramatically assembled, recorded live instrumentation, an album full of feelings and experiences.<br /><br />Rock Star Dust Light is a spectacular album, we are again with renewed and regenerated Jamiroquai, by staying still as fresh and exciting as ever. Jamiroquai has always walked his own way, made from a beautiful job all these years, writing and performing music that transcends the sound of a specific date or time. This is a great attribute that is rare in most bands today.<br /><br />The 12 tracks here are further testament of their excellent talent. If it's fun, here would find all, if you want to dance, you'll find it here, if you want to relax and cool, with this album you will feel satisfied, if you want to feel and vibrate with the warmth and sound quality, then here's your answer.<br /><br />In general, a great comeback album with an interesting variety that makes you good at putting a positive vibe and delicious.<br /><br />Listening to music without prejudice, you can experience and feel better, let your limitations behind and enjoy to the fullest, according to your tastes and parameters feeling respect for your environment.<br /><br />As an additional recommendation, I advise you get the single of \\"White Knuckle Ride\\" where you find two amazing remixed versions (Penguin Prison Remix) a vocal version and the other instrumental (which is very beautiful).<br /><br />Enjoy it !vise you get the single of \\"White Knuckle Ride\\" where you find two amazing remixed versions (Penguin Prison Remix) a vocal version and the other instrumental (which is very beautiful).

B001VNB54A|5.0|I had not seen any episodes on HBO, and went ahead with my BluRay purchase knowing that anyting Speilberg and Hanks put together was worth having.  This is one of the very best films I have seen on the \\"real life story\\" of our Marine Corps and the horrors of the conflict in the Pacific.  Not for the young at heart but I do hope many of our Generation Y will watch and undestand what sacrifices were made to make this county what it is today.  War is not a video game ..... this is the price paid for our freedoms so litely taken for granted!
B00008PX8P|5.0|It worked. It was divine - they strutted, Rob, John and John Paul, whilst Jimmy more rolled with the punches,   guitar strapped low to let his dislocated fingers dance on the fretwork of his double axe fender acoustic string machine, tickling unheard of combinations of notes, chords, slides, plucks, taps and bent notes whirring and gliding from that mysterious place where his sweat trickled down the length of his hair, smiling whilst his digits found the spaces, like a squirrel playing tag in a winter tree - leaping and diving in almost random directions, yet always finding that perfect branch that would just support the note's weight and allow the spring/twist or glide to the next twig, fret and then off again.  John Bonham shouted at the stretched skin of the mambo goated tub drums, crashed the sticks into the fabric of the bass, his singlet vest drenched with the joy of his exertions, hands rumbling in perfect harmony whilst the roadie behind lit a fag, realising that, other than to tighten the bolt on the bells, John was in the seat, moby dick in the north atlantic, explosive warheads bouncing off his shiny triceps, dragging the audience, the band and the fans along with his syncopated brilliance.  JP is the glue - the mandolin clucking briefly, huge keyboards blasting charm into tracks, understated - the bassist - trundling up the train tracks of the neck of his axe, rumbling thunder underpinning the joy above, the basement, the foundation, the lead lining to the soul of the Zep. No expression, just performance, only support for the frontman.  No mere man, here ie is, the strutting god, shirt open, hair flailing, smooth skin exposed to the world, a transient smile ghosting on the lips of the plant, the aspidistra, the peace, anenome, mesebrianthemum pitcher plant Robert. Cut glass, acid souled high-tenor shrieks of blissful expression, taking in the crowd with his eyes and knowing, just knowing that when he said yeah, they would say YEAH, crotch etched into thefront of his jeans like a middle aged mans back wallet pocket - you can all have me - all of you, but you have to come with me first. Then suddenly the shriek is soft, melodic, gentle with a twist of irony, expectation, joy, disappointment... t'was in the deepest depths of mordor, I met a girl, so fair... but Gollum,,, the evil one................ does anyone remember laughter? How many chuckles had he inspired from '70's virgins pony trekking on the saddles of his groin?    And then there was the economy of effort, the surefootedness, the integration, extra sensory understanding of adjustment when to dive in, when to stay out - extend, contract, blend like a fruit smoothy - as if it were invented then - maybe iced coffee of harmony. My god these guys knew each other. They were incredible. Outstanding. Hyperbole is lost on the perfection of some of those moments. Thank god they have been captured for all time. Lost they would have been a travesty of global proportions. Now they have been shipped out, piece by piece to the people of the world to watch in comfort or love.

0066620996|3.0|This book is a very detailed study, with useful data, which one expects from a large group research project with many graduate students.  However, the basis on which the study was founded runs counter to a basic principle of Finance theory - their assumption that an increased stock price reflects an improved company.    Basic finance theory is that the expected future performance of a company is already accounted for in the current price.  See \\"efficient markets\\" for more info.  The question that bases the research should not have been \\"why did these companies improve?\\", but rather \\"why did these companies perform better than analysts had predicted?\\".  The latter question means that a company could have gotten worse, but less worse than analysts predicted, so the stock price increased.  Or on the flip side, a company could have greatly improved, but still less than analyst predicted, so the stock price dropped.    Rephrasing the later question - \\"why did professional analysts underpredict the performance of these companies over the given time frames?\\".  Anyone who has spent time on the shop floor and with customers - i.e. the engineers, technicians, salesmen, and support people who keep the world humming can answer that in most cases.  The analysts sitting in NYC reading financial statements haven't a clue.  In most examples in the book, the company had spent much time developing a product or system and was ready to stamp out the design.  The development costs were \\"water under the bridge\\" at that point.  Think of Nucor who developed the mini-mills they could stamp out across the country, similar to the Big Box mini-malls you see everywhere.  The analysts didn't know and couldn't have appreciated the design and organizational effort it took to get to the that level, and thus under-priced the stock.  Most of the other company examples in the book are similar.    I do believe the book reaches the correct basic conclusion - that flashy and clueless CEO's bring negativevalue and most improving companies are run by hard working individuals of small ego who worked their way up by extreme dedication to the company.  The analysts didn't price that value correctly either.

B002ZG981E|5.0|[[ASIN:B002ZG981E Inception [Blu-ray]]]  I first saw this movie when I rented it over the xbox live marketplace. It was amazing. Then; I decided to get the blu Ray DVD digital download. I must say, they did a excellent job formatting this onto the blu Ray. Extraction mode is amazing; basically, it allows you to watch the movie and when there is a specific scene, it will prompt you to press the enter button. This allows you to see the conception art and the way it was made. The only problem is the bd live features: somnacin. There is absolutly no way to get this to work on the ps3. I think it was made for a normal blu Ray player. Other than that, I highy recommend this movie to everyone because after you watch it a couple times; you start to wonder if your life is all one big inception; and your waiting for your \\"kick\\" so you can come back to reality.

B000JML7YC|4.0|Begun in 1798 and finished in 1803, Northanger was one if the first novels Austen completed, as well as her first sale, though it did not appear in print until after her death. She had already written Lady Susan and had started both Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice, however.<br /><br />The novel follows 17-year-old Ann Radcliffe enthusiast Catherine Morland on a visit to Bath. Under the guardianship of complacent childless family friends, Catherine visits the pump room and attends public balls, making new acquaintances. She quickly meets and befriends the lovely but manipulative Isabella Thorpe, and it emerges that the two girls older brothers know each other at Oxford. When the young men pay a visit to Bath a dual brother-sister match seems eminent, or at last intended. Catherine, however, dislikes Mr Thorpe and remains blissfully unaware of his blundering attempts at courtship. She's much too interested in Mr. Henry Tilney, a clever and handsome young clergyman. Just Catherine's visit draws to close, she is invited by Henry's sister to visit the Tilney family at their home, (you guessed it) Northanger Abbey.<br /><br />Northanger is perhaps the least sympathetic of all Jane Austen's satires. Though all have their comedies, ironies and follies, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion, also have the benefit of compelling heroine and at least one honest romance.<br /><br />Catherine, on the other hand, is, in many ways, a foil--a nice girl, honest and not too bright, but with a healthy imagination where melodrama is concerned. She is Harriet Smith, with a better family and a stronger character. Her romance with Henry Tilney also lacks the weight of the relationships in Austen's other novels--it's funny and frequently charming, but, like Catherine herself, not too deep.<br /><br />The real pleasure of the book comes from Austen's language, her frequent tangential diatribes on the nature and import of novels, and her many hilarious digs at Ann Radcliffe--who as far as Austen is concerned, seems to have been the Stephenie Meyer of her day (only pro-woman, a better writer, and a different kind of crazy).s Austen is concerned, seems to have been the Stephenie Meyer of her day (only pro-woman, a better writer, and a different kind of crazy).
0545123283|5.0|I will not repost my entire (lengthy) review here, but I will say that this sequel to Shiver was worthy.  I loved each and every chapter.<br /><br />Grace's Chapter 47 gave me chills.  I so badly want to quote the whole thing.  I can't say anything about it, because I would ruin the whole book for you.  So beautifully written, I could hear Grace's voice, just the way she would say it, I can even imagine the music playing in the background.  Oh, I just loved it!!<br /><br />Only after I read Linger for the second time did I take the time to contemplate the name of the book.  The first time through, I was too absorbed in what was happening to appreciate the subtle intricacies, and beautiful language for which Maggie Steivfater is so well known.  The word \\"linger\\" will never quite mean the same thing to me.
1401228801|5.0|The \\"Witches\\" arc restores FABLES to its status of bloody awesome. With our reality secure at last against the meta-workings of Kevin Thorne - who, if you recall, is the literal embodiment of storytelling - the Fables once more turn their attention to Mister Dark, that awful neighbor, that dark thing haunting Bullfinch Street, in the ruins of what was once Fabletown. And when I say \\"turn their attention to,\\" what I mean of course is that there's a lot of hemming and hawing and, eventually, one spy deployed on an aerial reconnaissance over the enemy's camp (which doesn't end well). Beware what you wish for. The Fables fought a war to depose the Adversary, but Mister Dark bodes to be more terrible and insidious than the Adversary had ever been. Dude feeds off your concerns, gnaws at your fear. No one's quite ready to brace him just yet. For now, most everyone's content to hunker down, safe on the Farm.<br /><br />Power vacuums, power plays. Frau Totenkinder is perhaps the Fables' most formidable figure, except that she's up and gone to chase down a whisper of a hope of how to beat Mister Dark. Her departure sets up some surprising reveals about her nature. Her absence leaves the Fables' coven of witches and warlocks without a leader, and here's Ozma, that ambitious little girl (except, in this series, we don't go by appearances). Or as Reynard the Fox remarks when summoned by Ozma: \\"You called, young lady (with disturbingly old eyes?\\"). Ozma has been raring to assume the mantle of leadership for a while and she leaps at the chance. Somewhere, L. Frank Baum is perhaps marveling at the changes Bill Willingham had wrought in her.<br /><br />Geppetto, that arrogant old puppeteer, the Adversary himself, and having been granted amnesty, is still pulling his strings, never mind that, in the Fables community, he's more shirked than Hester Prynne. Not one to learn from his recent defeat, Geppetto demonstrates big cajones as he extends an offer to the Fables. This puts a crimp on Ozma's day in the sun.<br /><br />Meanwhile, despondent and not giving an ef, Rose Red still won't get out of bed, despite serious urgings from that clairvoyant, bloody pig's head on a stick. Still, since the next FABLES arc is titled \\"Rose Red,\\" I'm thinking things more monumental than extended naps are in store for her.<br /><br />\\"Witches\\" isn't just about what's been going down with the dislodged Fables and the tug-of-war politics brewing down on the Farm. The destruction of Fabletown has jarred loose the various enchantments which had held the terrible monsters in check, imprisoned. And now the Woodland Building's Business Office has gone missing, its mystical anchor to this world shaken off. Bufkin the blue flying monkey is trapped in the Business Office, but he's not alone. Somewhere in the shadowy corners and extended chambers of the office lurk the released demons and witches and sundry horrifying things. Baba Yaga, for one. The genie from the Arabian Nights (And Days) arc, for another. If you like Willingham's penchant for elevating mild supporting characters like Boy Blue and the Frog Prince into epic heroes, he takes a stab at doing the same for Bufkin. But with, y'know, sillier results. I grinned a lot reading Bufkin's arc. Bufkin marshals his ridiculous forces which consist of disembodied heads, wee barleycorn brides, and the magic mirror. His waging war on Baba Yaga comes off like preschool play time gone horribly off the rails. It's big fun.<br /><br />FABLES: Vol. 14 WITCHES collects issues #86-93. Issue #86 reveals how Mister Dark was captured those many ages ago and also introduces the rumored Brotherhood of Boxers. Issues #87-91 cover the \\"Witches\\" arc. The trade ends on a two-parter as Willingham turns away from a cliffhanger on the Farm to tell a tale of baseball and murder in the Kingdom of Haven, and I laughed out loud at the common sense spin put on the fable about the Scorpion and the Frog. We also get a resolution between Ambrose and Little Red Riding Hood. Jim Fern and David Lapham drop in as guest artists. But Mark Buckingham and Steve Leialoha are still holding it down, and they do remarkable work on the \\"Witches\\" arc. Bufkin's battle with Baba Yaga looks stunning. After a weak previous arc (\\"The Great Fables Crossover\\"), Bill Willingham comes back really strong, stirs things up again, re-immerses you in the huge cast of characters, builds for a hell of a crescendo and a ripper of a reckoning for Mister Dark in issue #100 in the next trade. Issue #100, by the way, just came out the other day; it's absolutely worth its ten dollar asking price. FABLES, hands down still my favorite comic book.ttle Red Riding Hood.

0316077054|5.0|Amazing!  THIS is the way a sequel should be written!<br /><br />The perk of being such a latecomer to Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl's popular YA paranormal series?  I didn't have to wait for Beautiful Darkness!<br /><br />I gobbled up all 500 pages of this book in a very short amount of time.  Both books are lengthy, but very fast-paced.  Each time I reached the end of a chapter, I couldn't wait to find out more, so I would turn the page - before I knew it I had devoured 6 chapters and it was well past my bedtime!<br /><br />In my review for Beautiful Creatures, I raved about the audiobook and how well done it was, especially by the reader, Kevin T. Collins.  As much as I loved the audio, and found myself \\"hearing\\" Kevin Collins' voice as I was reading Beautiful Darkness, I was able to really appreciate the writing so much more this time around.  When I came across a particular passage I liked, I was able to stop and re-read it, soaking it up, truly appreciating the way Garcia and Stohl put their readers inside Gatlin.<br /><br />There is one mysterious new character in this book that you can't miss, as he reeks all sorts of havoc on our favorite couple, but we are blessed with all our old favorites as well - Link, Amma, the Ashers and the Snows, Ridley, and the Sisters.<br /><br />I have to take a moment and talk about Ridley.  She's baaaaack.  I love complex, dark, twisty, sometimes-evil characters, and Ridley is so well drawn, I couldn't help but get completely caught up in her scenes.  If there was a movie, which I hope there will be, I would want to play Ridley.<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness lives up to its title, and was darker and even more mysterious than the first, but at the same time , it was much more emotional.  Some questions are answered, especially about Ethan's mom, but more questions arise.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, as there are so many different twists and turns to keep the pages turning, but my favorite part of the book is this wonderful scene between Marian and Ethan in the cemetery - when you read it, you'll know which one I mean.<br /><br />Find yourself a quiet, comfortable spot to read this amazing sequel - you won't want to put it down, and you will NOT want to be interrupted!d Ethan in the cemetery - when you read it, you'll know which one I mean.

0439023513|4.0|Darker and much more mature, Mockingjay manages to convey the horror of war and the manipulation of the media during wartime while breaking our hearts for a teenage girl torn apart and broken by both.<br /><br />Mockingjay is the third book in The Hunger Games trilogy by author Suzanne Collins.  This is a Young Adult series that has not only the ability to cross over between boys and girls, but it is a series that parents, teachers, and students of all ages should read and discuss.  There are themes of government, love, loss, family, friendship, war, rebellion, strategy, and survival.  If you haven't read The Hunger Games...go to your library, your local bookstore, or your neighbor and get yourself a copy.<br /><br />Now, I will try my best to break it down...while keeping my review spoiler free.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has outdone herself with our heroine, Katniss Everdeen.  There are times when I rallied for her, and drinking in her every moment; but there were other times when I cringed at the awful things she would say or do.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't cringe at the writing.  Quite the opposite.  I tip my hat to Collins for making Katniss so utterly honest and tragically flawed, while allowing her to change and grow with each book.  The first book in the trilogy showed Katniss to be somewhat innocent, naive even, while Mockingjay presented a scarred, tougher Katniss. Even though Katniss may have been conflicted in past books, she was never as unlikeable as she was, at times, in Mockingjay.  There were times her behavior completely confused me, but who am I to judge the words and actions of a girl who had been so tortured, bruised and used?  I think this was the point of Collins making her so ugly in Mockingjay.  She was a part of someone else's game, and when her only confidants are essentially stripped from her, she has no one to trust. Her actions on the outside were representative of what was going on on the inside.<br /><br />As much as readers hated to imagine the grotesque voyeuristic display of the hunger games in previous books, Mockingjay is much more violent, and the media spin is brought to an entirely new level.  While children killing other children in an arena live on TV is horrible, there are too many different ways Collins has come up with for people to kill each other...most of which, once again, takes place in front of the cameras.<br /><br />The line between what is real or not real was one of my favorites in the book, and was explored on so many levels throughout, but the most obvious and poignant of these is what comes across on the television screens.  Propaganda from both sides, no one is sure what to believe.<br /><br />Every single chapter left me breathless.  Before I picked up Mockingjay, I promised myself that I would read this book as slowly as I possibly could, savour it.  Suzanne Collins made it next to impossible not to tear through these pages!  I felt like each chapter, she dropped a bomb that compelled me to turn the pages!<br /><br />In one way, though, Mockingjay was not as easy to read as The Hunger Games and Catching Fire were.  In the first two books, Collins found a way of taking a horrific bloody scene and delicately balancing it with a tender, even loving, scene.  Mockingjay was harsh and dark and emotionally draining. There were not many victories, there was a lot of death, and there was not much hope.  No, I didn't expect Mockingjay to be all hearts and flowers, as too many families can tell you there is nothing pretty about war, but even the end of the book left me wanting more \\"light\\".<br /><br />I read the trilogy from start to finish consecutively, so I could get the full effect of the final book, and I am incredibly glad I did.  Mockingjay was quite a ride. Twists.  Turns.  Excitement.  Surprise.  Love.  Loss.  Despair.  Betrayal.  I look forward to taking this trip again, as this safely remains one of my favorite books sitting on my shelf.<br /><br />Parents' Note:There is much more blood and violence in Mockingjay than in previous books.  There are also more references to drugs, addicts (morphine), suicide pills, and depression.  I recommend that if you have a child under 15 reading this book, you read it along with them and discuss the personal, social, and political themes.revious books.

B000MR28MY|5.0|This Keen sandal is a real favorite of mine and my wife enjoys her pair similarly. This purchase replaced the identical sandal bought three years ago, with the older pair now (finally) showing some signs of wear. We wear ours in the worst of conditions, and don't hesitate to wear the sandal in lakes, creeks and on rugged dry surfaces. We wear our sandal too long into the winter season honestly, simply because we enjoy the fit, comfort and utility so much.

B001IA96Q0|5.0|I really like the packaging. The Photo Book is inside a nice cardboard sleeve, and it pulls out from the left side. The book is a good quality hard cover with a plastic tray for the two discs. The tray is located inside the left hand cover, and on the right is the 80 page Photographic Chronicle with pictures taken by Unit Photographer David James.    There is also a preface by Steven Spielberg, where he talks about the importance of Still Photography on the set of a movie, a forward by Harrison Ford, and an introduction by David James.    The photos in the book are really nice. Included are shots of scenes from the movie, production shots, promotional shots, etc. Every chapter begins with a brief description by David James about what was being shot and some facts about the films production    VIDEO & AUDIO:    \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition and right off the bat, this film looks incredibly gorgeous on Blu-ray. The film sports vibrant colors, detail is just amazingly clear, everything about the film showcases detail. May it be the surroundings of the Mayan jungle, the skeletons, the clothing, the people... You name it, detail is clear and the transfer is just amazing. Definitely one of the best looking Blu-ray video transfers among the many Blu-ray releases of 2008!    As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1. and the lossless track is just as equally incredible compared to the picture quality. With the number of action sequences included in \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\", audio is immersive as front channels showcase the action sequences and musical score, center channel showcases the dialogue which is nice and clear. LFE showcases the booms from the many explosions seen in the film and gunshots and vehicles whizzing and featured through the surrounds are also in abundance.    Personally, for a film of this caliber, I was not expecting anything less than magnificent for picture and audio quality and Paramount delivers with this awesome Blu-ray release. Audio and Videophiles should definitely be happy with this Blu-ray release.    As for subtitles, the film is featured in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

B001E75QGG|5.0|\\"How much of a man's life is lost in waiting.\\" laments one of the key characters in the return of Dr. Henry (\\"I named the dog Indiana\\") Jones Jr. For the record, it's been nearly a decade since Messrs. Lucas, Spielberg and Ford rode Indiana Jones into the sunset for his (next-to) Last Crusade. So, does the latest installment featuring our favorite near- indestructible professor of archeology make the grade? - For every minute of its all-too-short 123 minute run time -- trust me.    Seconds after the Paramount Logo once again morphs into scenery (in this case, the mound over a prairie dog's burrow), you know you are entering Dr. Jones' territory. In this case, nuclear-test-site Nevada in 1957 - a time when America was an I-like-Ike, I-hate-commies, Howdy-Doody watching, Elvis is here-to-stay kind of place. Our first glimpse of our hero shows us a man already in trouble. The Soviet bad boys outnumber him about fifty to one, and for a twist, the baddest red boy is a red girl - Colonel Irina Spalko. Indy's unique skills are forcibly put to use to find an artifact (of sorts) that will lead both good and bad (a few of which are ugly) on a quest for more than fortune and glory that ends at a place where living Mayan folklore forces the science out of archeology and makes fiction fact.    Sound familiar? - You bet it does. In fact, this film goes out of its way to make the viewer feel comfortable with not only the present characters and quest - but also gives more than a passing nod to characters and quests that have already been. During the film's opening encounter in a top-secret army hangar where the government crates its most valuable secrets, we conveniently catch a glimpse of Indiana's prize from his first great adventure. Photographs, both of Marcus Brody, Indy's museum curator associate and father Henry Jones Sr. are framed on his desk at home. During a moment when Dr. Jones first meets young Mutt Williams, who looks to him to help a mutual friend, Sean Connery's Oscar-winning take from The Untouchables, finds itself nicely rescripted, \\"Looks like you've brought a knife to a gun fight\\". Better yet, Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones quotes Harrison Ford as Han Solo! - \\"I've got a bad feeling about this.\\" - during one of the film's several exciting set pieces.    Talking about excitement, this film should leave no doubt as to Stephen Spielberg's unparalleled brilliance in staging action sequences. I'm not going to nit-pick about when and where the digital world begins and whether it was under or over used - but I will say that the cliché \\"edge-of-your-seat\\" is exactly what an elaborate chase through the South American jungle generates. This nearly twenty minute thrill-ride is packed with moments that bring us the best of no less than three actioners - Zorro, Tarzan and the Great Escape - all for the price of one ticket to the Amazon.      To its credit the film takes none of the magic away from Indiana Jones while keeping him almost as mythic as the antiquities he seeks. Yet, the film does not try to overlook the nature of growing old. \\"We've reached an age where life stops giving you things and starts taking them away\\" remarks a colleague to Dr. Jones early in the film. Lucky for us, Harrison Ford breathes new life into Indy and he is no less than equally supported by the skill of all the film's key players. Cate Blanchett's take on Russian-spy-nastiness never goes over-the-top to \\"Boris and Natasha\\" parody. Shia LaBeouf is more than adequate as Mutt - in fact, he's good - there, I said it. Ray Winstone plays a fellow relic-hunter with enough mystery that keeps us guessing as to his character's loyalties almost until the film's end. Unfortunately I thought that both John Hurt and Jim Broadbent - although well-cast were much underused in the proceedings. Then there is the return of Karen Allen - More than twenty five years since her first appearance as Marion have done nothing to diminish the twinkle in her eye and the sincerity of her smile. Her performance once again puts the chemistry ahead of the archeology in Marion's screen time with Indy.    This chapter in the saga of Indiana Jones series secures 2nd best. Youll enjoy it to bits with more action than ever good humour and good ending with good use of the new age and times eg fords age and the cold war. It does act as a tribute and youll only moan at it if your a really annoying picky critic admittedly a bit much cgi.

Many people can benefit from this book, from those looking to simply lose a few pounds to professional athletes and body builders, or anyone who simply wants to understand how the body actually works without getting excruciatingly bored in the process.

031237593X|5.0|First, let me say, I could not put this book down. I was immediately engrossed in the story, which is fast-paced and full of extremely compelling characters.  I have always been facinated by this period in English history - from an art historical perspective, but was a little fuzzy on the politics. No more.   This book was educational for me - I now have a clear concept of who all the major players were at this time and how they were interelated. I also fell in love with Penman's Richard III. If Richard was even half the man she paints him to be, he has been shamefully and cruely abused by the authors of history books. What a tradgic and heartbreaking story. I know I'm not the first to say this, but I knew how the story ended and yet, I kept hoping, somehow, it would work out differently.  This story is full of wonderful detail and the characters are well concieved. The dialogue is clever and rings true. I absolutely loved this book. As soon as I finished it, I started rereading it.
0143034901|5.0|Great book! Very complex, very detailed, lots of twists and turns! Pay lots of attention because you never know how important each detail is...keeps you guessing till the end!
B003ZTQN1I|4.0|I like most of the songs.  Some were a little too twangy, but I loved everything that Gweneth sang as well as Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Sarah Evans, Chris Young and Patty Loveless, etc.
030746363X|5.0|I very rarely review books, but I feel very strongly about Tim's two books, and a handful of others (fiction and non-fiction) which have helped me view life differently. This book is even better than the first one--and the key reason for me is the research. Not just Tim's own research on himself, but he talked and worked with renowned experts in every field that he addresses--from sex to fitness to nutrition, and everything in between. As a former Journalist, I have to say I appreciate the effort in this book to unveil many myths on diet/health/fitness, and just the well-rounded approach with expert views.     This book is massive--it is impossible to read in a week or even in a day--and while I was lucky enough to receive an advance copy, I know I'll be reading, and flipping through this, as a reference book for many years.     This is better than the first book, to help you take into practice the most important start-up: you. It's worth the purchase for that alone. I hope this becomes another \\"movement\\" book, for something we can all agree is the most important part of life, your own wellness. Without that, nothing--not a four hour workweek, not happiness in a relationship--nothing matters.
1608870081|3.0|All the reviews gave it a 5 on 5. Maybe I expected too much from the book.  Compared to the other pop up books I have where images change, move ,there are real threads and other fancy things, this book did not have many things expect 5 giant, but beautiful pop up books. I expected more.<br /><br />M.Ravi<br />10 year old girl.
B002SVBDYQ|3.0|I was highly surprised by how good the first soundtrack was.  I thought the movie royally sucked but the soundtrack was great.  Won't even bother with the second or third movies after the first but I was excited when I saw the list of bands on this second soundtrack.  Unfortunately, the music was very lackluster.  The bands on this album have done some amazing music, but I'm sorry to tell you that none of it made it to this soundtrack.    Nothing on this album that I'd give higher than 3 1/2 stars.  Probably also not much that I'd give less than 3 so at least it's consistent.  But nothing I consider great here.

B00192IV9U|4.0|\\"Michael\\" is the first of several posthumous releases promised by Sony. It comprises 10 tracks, two of which most fans had heard before; lead-off single \\"Hold My Hand\\", an anthemic duet with Akon and swirling keys, a lilting paean to love and friendship with hints of Bob Marley (especially \\"No Woman No Cry\\"), and the retro-sounding \\"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\\" which appeared on \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" titled \\"The Way You Love Me\\" and without the voicemail message/human beatbox intro.<br /><br />The cover art is a painted collage of Michael's life from \\"Off The Wall\\" including scenes from videos like \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\". Musically, the album also recalls the eighties. If you liked songs like \\"Smooth Criminal\\", \\"Another Part Of Me\\" and \\"PYT\\", songs with a funky Pop sound, you'll love this. Another good thing is that the songs are not over-long, a problem with a huge chunk of \\"Invincible\\".<br /><br />For upbeat songs, we have \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" (with harmonies remniscent of those on The Jacksons \\"The Hurt\\"), the haunting \\"Monster\\" (a look at the tabloids view of Michael, it features a rap by 50 Cent), \\"Breaking News\\" (with an intro comprising sensational headlines concerning Michael), the Lenny Kravitz-penned groovy rocker \\"(I Can't Make It) Another Day\\" (which alternates between gentle and fiery), and the spectacular \\"Behind The Mask\\", a sax-sprinkled groovy number laced with crowd cheers and a Disco-tinged bridge. It reminds me a wee bit of brother Jermaine's \\"Do You Remember Me\\".<br /><br />For ballads there's the inspirational \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" (with a Gospel choir), and the guitar/finger-snap driven \\"Best Of Joy\\" with both finding Michael digging out his vulnerable falsetto. Closing is the absolutely spectacular \\"Much Too Soon\\", a piano/guitar/accordion/string-swathed song with angelic harmonies and the wistful lyrics \\"I hope to make a change now for the better\\". It was apparently written during the \\"Thriller\\" sessions and features the best vocals on the album.<br /><br />\\"Michael\\" might be a motley collection but it does work much better than one would expect it to.chael\\" might be a motley collection but it does work much better than one would expect it to.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Thank you for sending me the DVD after I contacted you explaining that I never received the first one. You responded back by email and sent the DVD quickly. Thank you for not charging me again!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I loved \\"24.\\"  The BEST thriller on television...ever.  I will definitely buy this one.  Here.  I want to watch it again from the beginning...in fact, I will begin with Season 1!<br /><br />This provided a satisfying end for Jack.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an intense workout! However, with 20 minutes a day for just 2 weeks, all my 'wobbly bits' are firming up. This is well worth the cost. If I were to recommend any one workout DVD, of all the dozens I've tried, this would be it! Don't get me wrong, you suffer through those 20 minutes the first few times, but when you can complete it Level 1 for the first time, you'll feel invincible! I sure did! Also, for being such a thorough workout, I can still walk/function after it, which you don't always get from an intense, effective workout. I'm so tickled pink to have found it and for the first time ever, I have abs, shapely calves, and no more saddlebags! Overall, it's fast, effective, and totally worth the cheap price!

0807014273|5.0|This is an excellent book and everyone should read and then read it again, as it will change your life.      However, when I ordered two copies recently, one was for myself and the other as a gift,  I was very surprised and disappointed to see that the front cover had been bent back during the packing process on one of the two copies.  Naturally I gave the perfect copy as the gift, and kept the damaged front cover copy for myself.  I was really surprised, as normally everything that comes from Amazon is very well-packed and protected.      Nevertheless, I have just ordered quite a few more copies to give as gifts, as did my friend who was received the book from me, and so I am hopeful that better care will be given this time.  Happy Holidays to everyone!
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The unit itself is fine, but definitely not compatible with larger cellphones and would not work with very small phones either. On the plus side the part which holds the cellphone can screw into a standard tripod mount. The phone is held with a spring loaded arm which would probably work pretty well if I had an iPhone.
030746363X|5.0|What makes this book different from other weight loss, physical fitness, or health books is that it covers so many angles.  From \\"storage of genetic material\\" to a variety of methods for losing weight and a lot of unexpected places inbetween, the information Tim Ferriss provides is succinct, interesting, and contains the lessons learned of a guy who's tried it or knows someone who has as well as the scientific or psychological principles at work.  I'm loving reading this the same way I loved reading the encyclopedia as a kid.  I hope the audio book has the same narrator as THE FOUR HOUR WORK WEEK did!
082221718X|3.0|This is not the actual book: Diary of Anne Frank.  It's a play version.  Don't buy it if you are looking for the Diary.  That book has a different title.  It's called:  \\"Anne Frank, Diary of a Young Girl\\"
030746363X|5.0|Tim's 4HB starts off breaking EVERY possible myth about calorie-counting, dieting, and the usual 3x10 workouts seen on magazines.    As usual, Tim's writing style is magnetic and even though he clearly recommends you NOT to read the book cover-to-cover, it's hard to stop once you get into it.    I'm now looking for a DEXA or BodPod scan to start applying the principles, and they really do seem simple enough not to fail.    Thanks Tim!

030746363X|5.0|The work behind that obviously went into this book far surpassed what I expected and expectations were high after reading 4 Hour Work Week.  Tim Ferriss did a great job giving all kinds of unconventional tips on fitness, working out and sexual performance.  What separates this book is that he gets into the why's of why it works.  It was almost like reading a doctoral dissertation on the human body except a lot more interesting.  I can't recommend this book strongly enough.    Mike Zenga - Middleton, MA

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I'm not a sci-fi fan at all. No Star Trek, No Battlestar Galactica even if I tried. The only reason why I spent money on Firefly is because it carries the all holy name \\"Joss Whedon\\", which us Jossverse fans know him \\"GOD\\". Which he is. So I decided to look into it.     I was afraid it was going to be another \\"hyped show that didnt live up to its expectations* type of thing, like my most recent purchase in \\"The Wire\\"...that is another story. But I shouldnt have been surprised in Joss. Firefly is a wonderful hybrid of almost all genres rolled up in one, and sometimes its so seamless you couldn't even tell. I felt like I knew the crew on Serenity. They were hard working people with flaws just trying to make it and that is the hallmark of Joss Whedon's shows. No matter how bizarre the plot, they're always about the characters.    Although, I wouldn't rate Firefly above his other masterpiece, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", which is the greatest piece of entertainment ever created, it is a worthy addition to the wonderful Jossverse. I guess I'm officially a Browncoat.....LOL....I always wanted to say that.
B00192IV9U|4.0|Michael Jackson's MICHAEL<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I've never been that much of a Michael Jackson fan ... or, at least, it's safe to say that I think his early solo stuff (up through BAD) was exceptional, but I think somewhere along the way he kinda/sorta lost his way musically but NEVER as a performer.  As others have already said elsewhere, there'll only be one Michael Jackson in many a generation.<br /><br />Still, in my opinion there's little earth-shattering here, despite the fact that this may be a large part and parcel of the last music Michael ever performed for his fans, and that may not be a bad thing.  For Michael, it was always about the music as much as it was about performing, and so much of his life was spent exploring his sound that I found much of MICHAEL just pleasant `listening music.'  For a master of his craft, MJ deserved to write and perform what he wanted, and that's largely the impression I take from this (possibly) final album.<br /><br />If anything, MICHAEL presents a bit of a historical throwback in Michael's career, perhaps back to a time when it was more about `the sound' than it was `the career.'  Much of this comes across as soft rock - the kind of territory Michael staked out early in his work - and that came as a welcome surprise.<br /><br />Hollywood Tonight: (2.5 out of 5)<br />Shades of THRILLER as Michael resorts to a spoken word bridge in `Hollywood Tonight,' the musical story about the search for fame and fortune.  Not the best choice as, outside of his backing vocal sounds, there isn't much here to distinguish itself from other superior tracks on this disc and elsewhere.<br /><br />Keep Your Head Up: (5 out of 5)<br />Vintage Michael vocals as he swoons lyrically - complete with a chorus - across this tale of musical inspiration, though a fair amount of it is a bit clich&eacute;d.  \\"Gimme your wings so we can fly.\\"  Still, this is the kind of stuff he could easily hit out of the park every time he sang.<br /><br />(I Like) The Way You Love Me: (3.5 out of 5)<br />There's a bit of an opening vocal story of Michael telling you what the song would sound like as opposed to the instrumentation comes across as a bit bizarre, but it finally gives way to the music and a adult `soft rock' vibe that's easy on the ears.  \\"I thank the heavens above that I met ya.\\"  Again, a bit clich&eacute;d and not nearly as strong as other tracks, but it's a harmless confection for your ears in Michael's gifted hands.<br /><br />Monster (Feat. 50 Cent): (3.5 out of 5)<br />Hate the softer, thoughtful-sounding refrain paired with the driving and fist-pumping main verses. Musically, I don't think it works as well as it could, especially given the message of fame corrupting and haunting the individual spirit.  Clearly, this is intended as a warning label about the dangers of celebrity. We make our own Frankensteins these days, and Michael was as much a victim of celebrity as any has ever been.<br /><br />Best of Joy: (1.5 out of 5)<br />Way too clich&eacute;d, way too disconnected, & way too predictable to really achieve much, `Best of Joy' is probably the weakest track here.  \\"We are forever\\" repeated over & over again sometimes is nothing more significant than \\"we are forever\\" repeated over & over again.  Michael will live forever, but, hopefully, this song won't.<br /><br />Breaking News: (2 out of 5)<br />Another personal statement from Michael, `Breaking News' opens with a montage of reporters and pundits announcing the latest bit and byte about the King of Pop. This is undoubtedly intended as an indictment of paparazzi destroying celebrity, but haven't we heard this message before, arguably even on this album? I give it a few props for the jazzy horns backing up the instrumental part, but, otherwise, it's still much too tame to be memorable.<br /><br />(I Can't Make It) Another Day (Feat. Lenny Kravitz): (5 out of 5)<br />OK, now this ROCKS, and I mean it's hip, groovy and magical in the way only Michael could ROCK.  Great soft verse rises to a powerful refrain backed with a soft Lenny Kravitz accompanying a masterful Michael.  \\"I can't make it another day ...\\" is a much more relevant lyric for Michael at this point in his life, and I'll always recall tune when I think of his final days.  An instant classic that can stand alongside anything Michael's done.<br /><br />Behind the Mask: (3.5 out of 5)<br />A synthesizer-infused Motown rhythm about life and love behind the mask.  \\"Who do you love?\\"  Again, the track is lifted by some great sax work and that certain toe-tapping appeal that distinguished Michael's craft throughout the years.<br /><br />Much Too Soon: (5 out of 5)<br />Beautifully soft guitar backed by a simple but wondrous musical arrangement, `Much Too Soon' is pure Michael ballad.  \\"Would you like to go with me, and she answered no to me, but I guess I learned my lesson much too soon.\\"  It ends as magically as it began.  This one deserves to stand the test of time, and it'll no doubt be found and appreciated by others for quite some time.<br /><br />Hold My Hand (Feat. Akon): (5 out of 5)<br />\\"This life don't last forever, so tell me what we're waiting for ...\\"  Is there any more relevant an opening line for a Michael Jackson song given the tragedy of his passing?  \\"The nights are getting darker, and there's no peace inside, so why make our life harder by fighting love tonight?\\"  Happiness is found together - between two lovers, between a singer and his song, between a performer and his audience - and that's the significance of this closing tune.hael.  \\"I can't make it another day ...\\" is a much more relevant lyric for Michael at this point in his life, and I'll always recall tune when I think of his final days.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I've had the book for two weeks, and I'm down 10 lbs.    In fact, I've started a small revolution in my family.  My brother in law has bested me (being down at least 12), and my sister is down a good 7 (she cheats).    I love the format of the book.  The chapters are broken out (excepting the first two) so that you tackle them out of order, but with the intention of actually changing your life.  This is not a book to read and ignore.    This is a book that will help you change your life.
B003BW0CB6|1.0|this book was horrible. the characters were ok and somewhat interesting. hower, there was no suspense or thrills. this book was very boring. i kept waiting for it to turn and it never did. i will not be reading another book by mr. connelly.
B00377V6J2|5.0|The other night I was changing channels and caught sight of Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughn on PBS playing guitar. Everything came to a screeching halt. I was totally transfixed by these two blues guitar legends.<br /><br />The next day I opened my Amazon page and the CD/DVD was already in my recommendations. I instantly ordered it and the moment it arrived put it in to watch just one song but again, transfixed, dropped everything and watched it from beginning to end. If you love the blues you will love the give and take between the two guitar geniuses.<br /><br />I understand the complaints about the missing selections on both the DVD and CD but I just can't bring myself to complain about anything. This package is a gift for those who love the talent of both men. The DVD picture is clear and the sound is great, as is the CD. The Albert King/Stevie Ray Vaughn version of Pride and Joy is the one I've been listening to for years and to actually see the performance adds another dimension to the experience.<br /><br />I saw SRV when he opened for Bonnie Raitt at Red Rocks and it is a concert I will never forget, but to watch King and SRV, both in prime form, is nothing short of pure magic.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out.  I personally love it!  I do enjoy the \\"tradtional\\" christmas music, and other types.  This is definitely different from what I am used to listening.  If you taste is more the tradional/gospel music, this is not for you at all.  If you like Enya, you will like this.  I find this very relaxing and soothing.
030746363X|5.0|This book isn't for everyone. If you are unpersuaded by experimental data or if you don't enjoy great writing, I say go elsewhere. For everyone else, Tim Ferriss has compiled a remarkable collection of highly effective approaches to getting leaner, stronger, and getting more enjoyment out of life. I found his insights on applying the concept of minimal effective dose (MED) to exercise refreshing and unique. It will give you a new take on how to approach your own physical fitness (more is not necessarily better). He introduced me to several new exercises including the kettle bell. The advice on diet is well researched and quite specific to whatever your goal may be. And, certainly not least, the sections on enhancing sexual pleasure are also new and unique. In short, there is a lot of stuff in here that you can't get anywhere else and it is stuff that you will find not only interesting but also life enhancing. Bravo Tim and thanks for devoting so many years of your life to researching this so meticulously and sharing that with the world.
B003ZYU3T6|5.0|Charlie Chaplin's cinematic comment on the machine age and arguably his greatest film, MODERN TIMES has been given the boost to blu-ray with outstanding results. If you're already familiar with this wonderful, bona-fide classic, you'll be quite impressed with how it looks transferred to 1080p resolution. Absolutely stunning. There's also a wealth of extras, idncluding the entire short subject by Chaplin and Alistair Cooke filmed during a yachting excursion. For such an enduring, enjoyable film the upgrade is definitely worth it.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.
B00081U6EG|4.0|All in all this is a good concert. Video good but audio could have been a lot better. Back up guitarist Phil Palmer (Dire Straits) and his good work is lost in the mix. It's beyond me why Cullum & Winehouse are in the lineup. Wasted time for a guitar tribute night. Highlights for me were Gary Moore's \\"Red House\\" (awesome blues), Paul Carrack's \\"How Long\\" and a nice job by Paul Rodger's two kids. Anyone interested in some vintage guitar songs will enjoy the first few performances.
B000N4S9ZG|5.0|Although Mika's music can verge on corny, his youthful joyful style is bound to bring a smile to your face. As mentioned elsewhere, there are some resemblances to Queen and Elton John, but Mika stands on his own. Life in Cartoon Motion is pop as it should be; fun and uninhibited. I particularly like his use of the piano in some of the songs. The only weak song on the album is \\"My Interpretation.\\" Note that some editions of this album have an excellent bonus track titled \\"Over My Shoulder.\\" If you like Life in Cartoon Motion I strongly suggest you check out Mika's follow-up album The Boy Who Knew Too Much, which offers more of the same (minus a handful of weaker songs.)
B0044430H8|5.0|The thing I love most about this soundtrack is that it completely stands on its own.  Every time I listen to it my ears are left tingling and my brain is buzzing.  It's not just good sound, it has a good feel to it.  The mix between gentle piano, synthetic drums and classic Techno sounds are thrilling and captivating.  I love the old Atari sounds, too.  This soundtrack is packed with awesomeness!  I actually downloaded the Tron soundtrack with this.  The two side by side, I feel like Social Network is more epic than Tron . . .which is weird, because Hans Zimmer actually had a lot of influence in the Daft Punk score.  Don't get me wrong, Tron is amazing, but I would definitely get this soundtrack . . .and if you have any doubts, push them aside and look at the price! It's only 5 bucks! It's a steal! Get it!

B003L20ICE|5.0|In recent cinema, actors have failed to bring me to a sense where I genuinely cared about their characters. Even when they do a technically good acting job, they don't leave a sense of emotion, beauty, and enlightenment with you. They don't stay with you for long. They don't give you a reason, or a desire to return to the cinema and see their film again.     In The Kids Are All Right, Lisa Cholodenko paints a canvas of thoughtful characters, an insightful script, a beautiful Californian setting, and even though it's no special-effects laden, CGI-heavy typical summer entertainment, it brings you more than any film you've seen over the summer. It has fantastic acting from its adult and younger actors alike. As of the very moment, I have seen this film twice. And both times, I laughed my ass off, I cried, I felt the emotion of the characters, and I left the cinema with a true sense of enlightenment and optimism.     The film follows a married lesbian couple, Nic and Jules (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) who have been together for many years. Their children, Joni and Lazer (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson) are very happy, except they've always wondered about their biological father. They find their sperm donor, or father in Mark Ruffalo's Paul. Ruffalo seems somewhat typecast in the \\"idiot\\" parts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering how well he plays it. The characters become bigger parts of each other's lives and butt heads, and without saying any more, people love, people hate, and they make mistakes.    Julianne Moore has certainly been on the top of her game in her recent work. With the few scenes she had in last winter's A Single Man, alongside powerhouse Colin Firth, and this spring's Chloe, alongside the surprising powerhouse Amanda Seyfried, and in this spring's season of Tina Fey's 30 Rock, great, even with a ridiculous Boston accent, she's been in top form. And Annette Bening, who I haven't seen for a while, also is fantastic in this film.You can believe that the two are a couple who have made it through the thick and the thin. The two ladies compliment each other very well.    However, the real heart of this film lies in Mia Wasikowska, who plays Joni, the older daughter. Her face really tells the story of the film. She says so much, without really saying anything at all. The recent Tim Burton remake of Alice In Wonderland being the only thing I remember seeing her in, I can tell you that she flexes her acting muscle more here. A scene near the film's end where her character leaves for college, you can see the emotion flooding her face, and it's a beautiful thing. Considering I'm a student who's about to leave for college in less than a month, perhaps I got more out of it than the average person would. Either way, it's an astounding performance.    One thing that sets this film apart from competing indie tragicomedies, is its mind. It has quite a bit of intelligence to it. And it's the perfect blend of comedy and drama. It may very well be this summer's equivalent to last year's (500) Days of Summer. A mix of wonderfully eclectic acting, an undeniably realistic feel, amazing acting from all of its cast, with a rockin' soundtrack, these Kids are more than all right.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|When I first saw the promos for Spartacus, I couldn't help but laugh. I ended up skipping the show, until reading several positive raves from TV critics I respect. At first I thought the effects were as cheesy as advertised and the story wasn't all that compelling. However, I pressed on. By the fifth or sixth episode I was completely hooked. There is a major turning point that drives the rest of the season and each episode gets better and better. There are some truly shocking developments and by the end of the finale, I was cheering out loud.    Absolutely, the effects are low budget, the sex gratuitous, and the dialogue sometimes laughable, but Spartacus is such a fun, guilty pleasure that it's easy to overlook all of these things. If you dig the action of 300 and Gladiator, the Shakespearean wordplay of Deadwood, the conniving and backstabbing of Melrose Place, and the sort of soft core porn you might find late at night on Cinemax, you'll probably dig this show.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|i loved it.............watched it several times.........will watch it many more i'm sure.......didn't mind the absence of the special effects feature--just wanted to see the movie.........
030746363X|5.0|I've been reading pieces of my advance copy and I think that's part of the real brilliance of the book.  It's written  in sections that can each be taken on its own.  I may never dig into the piece about bulking up, but I immediately read the section on losing weight and I'm now going through the section on improving sleep.  It is a truly amazing read so far and I'm looking forward to using it as a reference for years.
0307272702|5.0|I think a lot of people (myself included) who have struggled with weight gain and attempting to lose it for a long time keep hoping we'll pick up a book and the magic answer will be there on the first page in one paragraph and we'll finally know that THIS is what we need to do.  It's not spelled out in this book on the first page in one tidy paragraph, but I've never felt closer to a genuine explanation as I did while reading this book. There is detailed information on why we get fat that I feel is very accurate and informative.  You can't fix a problem if you aren't truly aware of what the problem is and this book is about gaining that awareness.  He explains the why part of it very thoroughly.  The final chapters are more centered on what to do about it.<br />Anyone who has struggled with weight loss knows that it is not just a matter of calories in calories out.  There are thin people who eat 5000 calories a day and never gain weight.  Their are overweight people who eat 1200 a day and can't seem to get any weight off.  It does matter what we are putting into our bodies as well and genetics play a huge part in it.  He goes into this in depth in the book with studies and comparisons.  There is a ton of information packed into this book, covering hormones, insulin, myths out there regarding diet, metabolic syndrome, exercise, meat or plants, etc.<br />This book is well worth the money it cost to buy it and the time spent on reading it.  It doesn't feel like a gimmick or infomercial when you are reading it like so many in the field do, it feels educational and you come away from reading it with genuine knowledge about your body and what it will take to change it.

B002ZG97E2|5.0|Saw this in the Theater with a friend who is more of a \\"see it on DVD\\" kinda gal... We both agreed we'd go back and see it again and again.  Difficult to feel sad or bored during this movie. I am not one to get sucked in to a movie about poor little kids, but was cheering for them at the end and LOVED it all. Steve Carell and Russell Brand were brilliant and Julie Andrews as \\"Gru's\\" Mom was a Dysfunctional FUN role as well. Jason Segal continues to amaze me with his versatility and timing.  Great job. Wished I had seen it in 3D but friend could not do that. Good sequence during the Credits at the end of the film.  Good for kids and adults both.  Pixar did it again. Can't wait to \\"gift\\" this to a few friends.  Enjoy!!!
B003954I9C|5.0|I ordered the CD a few weeks ago, and before I put it in, I was apprehensive to listen; it seems that I tend to expect greatness of certain artists and/or albums only to be disappointed upon listening to the music. Needless to say, this album did not disappoint me in the least - not even once.     As  other have mentioned, A.J. has a distinctive voice, but a beautiful voice is not enough to create a solid album. A.J. is one of the few singers that has the whole package - lyrics, production, instrumental arrangements, catchy song, and amazing vocals. This is one of my favorite albums that I have ever bought, and I would gladly recommend this album to anyone with a fraction of good taste in music.     I will be anxiously awaiting a second solo album from him! A.J. delivered on this one, and I have been listening to the whole album on repeat. Love love LOVE.

B00447G29S|5.0|Enough has been said about the movie.  The 3D on this movie is excellent.  I am not a fan of the movie, but watching this in 3D was enjoyable.  The reviewer that wrote about the ticket was dead on...that was some of the best 3D work I have seen.  I understand why they are asking $26-$34 for this 3D movie. I'll be glad when we can rent 3D movies!

0784010927|5.0|I know VHS is like records today but I could not pass up a great deal of .49 cents plus 2.98 for shipping to get Dirty Dancing 10th anniversary twin pack with the Live Concert. It is the original movie in A 1 condition. Nothing ships for less then 3.99 for anything bought usually on Amazon but this was the deal of a lifetime. Cudo's to the vendor.  The movie brings it all back including special inserts from 1995. Dancing with the Stars this year reminded me of Dirty Dancing when I knew Jennifer Grey was going to be a contestant. The DVD would have been OK for 15.00 plus shipping but I had to try to see if this offer was close to good. I am sure glad I saved my VHS player. Give this product a 5 out of 5 or a 10 out of 10.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I can only say that I would love to meet Temple Grandin in person.  She lives in the same state that I do and if it's possible I do want to meet her one day. I admire her for everything that she is, a great person who had an over abundance of opposition, still prevailed with determination and strength.  I applaud her as one of the greatest of Americans ever.  If we who do not have obstacles to stand in the way could just learn from her, the world would be such a wonderful place in which to live. Thank the Lord for her wonderful mother who upheld her and encouraged her.
B004132I20|5.0|I am not going to review the actual story of Sherlock because there are many of them on Amazon already, most of which I heartily agree with. Rather, this is a review of the Blu-Ray discs because if you're going to be buying a Blu-Ray of Sherlock, I am going to assume that you've already seen the show and just want to know if the Blu-Ray is any good.    Well, it is (\\"obviously\\", says Sherlock). Other than the three 90-min UNCUT episodes (you'll know what I mean if you've seen the edited PBS Masterpiece Mystery versions), there are special features, such as the 60-min A Study In Pink, commentary on A Study In Pink and The Great Game, as well as a documentary on the making of Sherlock. I haven't seen the commentaries yet, but I have seen the documentary and while shorter than I would like, I savored every moment of it. The 60-min unaired A Study In Pink is also very interesting to watch. I won't give anything away here, but it's VERY different from the end result. It's not bad by any means, but let's just say I'm very glad BBC made the decision they made (that is, asked the creators to make the 90-min version).    I am glad I bought the Blu-Ray of Sherlock because I wanted the UNEDITED versions of the episodes. I don't know why PBS had to delete some scenes, probably to make it within the allotted time slot, but some of their editing decisions were horrible--they cut out some pivotal scenes! Anyway, I suggest getting the Blu-Ray over the DVD at the cost of only $5 more. The only thing I didn't like was that you had to go through lots of previews and logos and advertisements before getting to the actual menu for Sherlock. They're skippable, but it's very annoying that you have to do it every time.
B002ZG980U|5.0|first off this plot is one of the best of all time you can tell that it was well thought through before being put together for filming Nolan really did a great job with this one. the actors in this movie are very great too, ive been a big fan of Dicaprio since the Departed and am a fan of Page, Watanabe, and Gordon-Levitt as well also becoming a big fan of Hardy and cant wait to see some more of him in films. by far my favorite scene is the hotel fight scene that is a must see by far. this is a MUST SEE buy or rent just see the movie.
0393051587|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories.<br /><br />Not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness. And the annotated edition is a brilliant supplement to the story.<br /><br />Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.<br /><br />And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.<br /><br />So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.<br /><br />You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.<br /><br />Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.<br /><br />He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.<br /><br />So what is the annotated edition like? Really beautiful -- sturdy spine, smooth pages, beautifully reproduced pictures and photos, and LOTS of annotation to explain anything that might not be clear to modern readers. Um, almost too much annotation, since sometimes it seems longer than the actual text... but very enlightening if you don't know what inspired Marley's ghost's chains.<br /><br />Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all.

030746363X|5.0|I'll admit - I was very skeptical.  I kind of have a love-hate relationship with Tim Ferriss' work.  He often uses attention grabbing headlines/titles to lure me in and sometimes I resent that (Four Hour Work Week, c'mon).  You know the saying - fool me once shame on me...but despite having been lured in, the content keeps me coming back.  And this book delivers again - big time.      True to form - it's replete with the attention getting hooks - they almost look like a collection of spam headlines - but don't fear, there's nothing about buying foreclosures or refinancing your mortgage for 0% - but there is an encyclopedic amount of great information.  I have yet to get through the book and I'm not in a hurry either.  I think it is meant to be consumed and enjoyed over time - perhaps for many years to come - much of the information appears already to have withstood the test of time.    It is a thick reference book that I will put on a shelf and refer to frequently - and you should too.
0517548232|2.0|The arguments in this book are hugely plausible theories, but they run into a brick wall of fact.  In the second half of the 20th century, every government in the world that adopted Keynesian economics became enormously prosperous.  Every time a government tried the so called \\"free market\\" economics Hazlitt recommends the result was high unemployment and a concentration of wealth.  The sad fact is that some people are much, much better at making money than others, and that absent some government control, the rich wind up with everything and the workers with the bare minimum necessary to sustain life: the Iron Law of Wages.  There is no doubt that free-market capitalism is the best economic system in every arena where there is a profit to be made.  But the free market capitalists have to harden their hearts against the children, the elderly, the sick, and the victims of natural and man-made disasters, off whom no profit can be made.  If money is your most important value, Hazlitt is right.  But if you care about people, then Hazlitt is wrong.
1582701709|1.0|I saw the DVD version first, and then read the book.  To an educated reader, its premises could sound unbelievably simplistic.  Optimism is one thing, but this entire book as an ode to human selfishness and greed.  Your women got raped during war, well, you didn't have the right mind set, Blackwater made millions through wars, well, Erik Prince had the \\"right\\" mindset.  What a load of rubbish.  For those professing religious beliefs in Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, you might find the book also problematic on moral grounds, as it never does account for events in everyone's lives, where other people's actions have directly impacted yours.  It basically blames the victims.  Going through Jim Crow and lynching, well, change your mindset and the oppressor class will automatically calibrate their behaviour towards you.  Donate the money to a soup kitchen instead of buying this book (oh wait, the homeless actually want to be homeless according to this book!)
193413712X|5.0|This is a beautiful, beautiful book.  The simplest review:  if you are all about plot, you won't like this story.  If you are all about beautiful prose and imagery and objectively written characters, you will love it and want to read it again and again.  Different from anything else I've ever read.
0525951652|5.0|I bought Fall of Giants and wanted to start reading it ASAP.  Unfortunately for me, my husband (also a Ken Follett) got his hands on it before I did.  This book has kept him up reading till the wee hours of the morning (once until 4AM).  He absolutely loves it.  Follett does such extraordinary research with all of his novels that you find you've not only enjoyed this book but come away learning a great deal of history during this difficult time.  Both Pillars of the Earth and World Without End were written the same way -- with solid research.  We can't wait for the 2nd and 3rd books in this trilogy to come out.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|This movie was a blast! Much better than I ever expected a runaway train movie could be. Good acting and fun dialogue help a lot, with Denzel Washington and Chris Pine proving an effective duo, and Rosario Dawson hitting the perfect note as their connection to the rest of the world. The action starts slowly but quickly gets intense and really never lets up until the very end. I like the way the story builds as one mistake compound another mistake until events are completely out of control. Takes awhile for the rush to wear off after you leave the theater. Very well made. Who knew a train could be so menacing? Definitely recommended.
B00192IV9U|3.0|I know that Michael is gone, so anything posthumous from him will not have the same quality as when he was alive.  I know this. However - lack of \\"that quality\\" should not be so glaringly apparent, as it is in this CD. The producers of \\"Michael\\" should have known better.  They WORKED with Michael.  They KNOW what a perfectionist he was.  As a fan - I feel that he would not be pleased with this release.  All those involved in this project should have put more into this, for real. And so - I am only going to talk about 4 tracks that I like on this CD..I am not going to even TALK about the other ones...and the fake ones...uhm, no.  1.(I Like) The Way That You Love Me - the best song out of the 10  2. Best of Joy - Michael's vocals really elevate this song into a sweetness that only Michael could bring. 3. I Cant Make It Another Day - with Lenny Kravitz....I can only imagine how great this song could have been..if this song would have had that MJ polish...*sigh*  5. Behind the Mask. Last, but not least.  This song could have been a MONSTER.  I loved this song when Greg Phillingaines did it in the 80s..i thought it sounded like Michael then.  But, to have MJ re-do it?!!  For REAL?  However.  Kill the \\"crowd cheering\\" sound effects, and the dated saxaphone solo....and then we could talk. But - for some reason...someone decided that those things made this song better.  Uhm, no.  So in summary...smash up artists, DJ's...please remix Michael's tracks...and put it on Youtube. Im begging.  Maybe you will do the job that the producers of this CD FAILED to do...and that is to let Michael shine with a production worthy of his talents.  And, as far as the FAKE songs go - and YES, some of the songs on this CD are FAKE... I am only concerned with Micheal's TRUE works.  Sony should be ASHAMED that they even thought to insult the intelligence of his fans to even try to fake us out.  Like another poster said - buy the singles individually.  Do NOT support the phony Michael songs.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|Tangled is a fun movie for all, both boys and girls and parents too. It is a kid's action comedy, with very funny dialogue and situations, but it has a nice story with a classic feel and a modern twist to some themes. It's also a musical to some degree as the characters break out into song a number of times. In the end it's a great combination that makes for a movie that everyone can enjoy. The voice actors are flawless, and the character named Maximus steals every scene he's in by using classic Looney Tunes moves. There's also at least one scene that's gorgeous to look at. Overall an excellent kids movie.
B0041T52S6|1.0|Pandering hype that might appeal to someone on lots of dope, including alcohol, who wants to hitch a ride on someone else's fictitious life. The filmmakers are trying to force their belief-systems on the unsuspecting children who will watch this trashy movie and they should be ashamed but let's leave that to people with consciences and valid value-systems. This movie is one of many that are produced out of desperation because EVERYTHING interesting has been done already several times over. Read Ecclesiastes! It's much more interesting and valuable than this hype garbage movie.
030746363X|5.0|I bought the book to see what Tim has tried and what worked.  The various strength and muscle building sections are generally in the HIT (high-intensity training) camp where you work out hard in very little time (minutes) and infrequently (1-2 times per week in order to allow recovery) for maximum results (sort of the opposite of P90X which is too much work for the result).  The fat loss part is similarly easy to follow;  you won't go hungry (I felt surprisingly full all the time);  the main challenge is to only stock approved items (requires a little re-training of personal habits which takes a few days).    I've read a few of the negative reviews, which broadly fall into two camps:  1)  Tim has nothing new to say, just re-hashing existing material;  or 2)  the stuff can't work.  If it's nothing new, then it probably works; and if it doesn't work, then it's probably not well known existing material.  You can always try it and see if it works for you.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|As part of his program to inspire François Pienaar, played by Matt Damon, the captain of the South African rugby team; Nelson Mandela, played by Morgan Freeman, inculcates upon him an piece of literary wisdom that had inspired him to endure his 27 year imprisonment. During that time, Mandela learned all he could about the white people who had put him there by mastering their language and reading their books. In the process, he found a 19th Century poem which embodied the \\"unconquerable soul\\". This famous poem, from which the movie derives it's name, ends with these lines: \\"I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul\\". The power and conviction of this poem moved Nelson Mandela and helped direct his life and goals.    In the movie, as apparently in life, Mandela, now as President of South Africa, develops an equally unconquerable passion for the national sport of rugby, which he uses to unite his country. The Springboks, a mostly white team, are cheered on by the white South Africans, but soundly \\"booed\\" by the blacks because of what they represent. However, Mandela sets about to change all that. His obsession with the sport and modus operandi tend to bewilder both his staff as well as his fellow black countrymen. Yet it is revealed it to be a brilliant move for Mandela, the struggling team, and for the whole country, both black and white. His impressively forgiving attitude toward the white power is demonstrated when he, for example, invites François Pienaar to the presidential office for tea and takes him under his wing. Will he have the power to set this poetry in motion and lead to victory? That is the question that this film answers.    I give this film 4 stars for the inspirational story, yet I personally find it to be rather syrupy, predictable and lacking in depth. For example, none of the real racial tension which could have made it more believable and powerful is seen in this movie. Nelson Mandela himself was no Mahatma Gandhi, but there was only one slight hint in this movie that he was less than a saint. Morgan Freedman played this role masterfully, though I found the Matt Damon character to be rather bland. So if you are just looking for a feel-good movie, without all the ugly reality, this is a good choice.

B004B8RXQQ|5.0|First off, I must admit to being a huge fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work. I can understand that many find the introduction of Holmes into the 21st century somewhat disturbing in contrast with Doyle's representation of 19th century London. Certainly Doyle's original works are masterpieces. However, this series is far better than some of the reviews I have seen.    Yes, there are modern tools that we all use such as Google, smart phones, automobiles, guns, and other such gadgetry. However, the deductive reasoning employed by Holmes is timeless. This series illustrates that.    This is by far one of the most accurate portrayals of the Holmes epoch I have yet to encounter, although I will admit that Robert Downey Jr. did a very entertaining Sherlock, as did Jude Law as Dr. Watson. Their production was too much in the way of Hollywood explosions, naked women, and a Holmes character with a love interest that should not have been. Definitely not a mirror of Doyle's product. This series is all the more accurate even with being transcribed to our time. It is all the more true to the original design and to the motivations and intentions of the main characters.
B004132HZS|5.0|I loved this version of Sherlock, mainly because of the interaction between John and Sherlock.  Their banter is hilariously intriguing.  Both John and Sherlock are very developed characters, they have a past that is revealed in bits and pieces.  The mysteries keep your interest, but I believe at the end of the day the partnership between the two men is what carries the show.  Highly recommended!
0385512058|4.0|Keith made this book interesting for me. I got to admit that some parts were pretty boring, but for most of it, it is pretty interesting. Keith tells you about a lot of his experiences and how he works his way up into being a more successful person. It is quite interesting to read about the people that he meets and how it inspired him. His family background will surprise you. I don't want to give anything away, but I thought this book was pretty good and it is definitely something worth reading. This book was recommended by a company owner and he said he told his employees to read this. Therefore, I gave it a shot.

030746363X|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with Tim Ferriss will not be surprised to find that \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" is everything you would expect from him. It's entertaining, useful and, perhaps most importantly, takes a topic that's been dissected countless times over the years, turns it on it's head and delivers powerful information that could change your life. And, when I say change your life, I don't mean in a year or two, or even six months, but, rather, that this book could change your life today.

B0002EXH54|4.0|Not much to say about this album that hasn't already been said. It's a classic of the thrash metal genre, and although imperfect, it showed Dave Mustaine's potential as a guitarist and a songwriter. Overall kind of a mixed bag, Peace Sells, Wake Up Dead, Devil's Island and Black Friday standout as thrash classics while a few songs manage to be somewhat forgettable, this albums overall quality and excellent production value merit 4 out of 5. If your into thrash, than you probably already have this album, and if your looking to just now get into Megadeth, this is an album to pick up,although a word of advice to the initiate, Rust in Peace is decidedly Dave and the boys best work.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Let me say this is the first movie from the line of National Lampoon's Vacation movies that I've seen. I saw this with my family the year it was released with my family at the Cinema 12 in Muskegon which is now called the Cinema Carousel and we've watched it every December since. Having said that I watch this movie on my own any month of the year I want to as I now own it for myself. Teenagers will relate to the charachter of Audrey, pre teens will relate to Rusty, and many adults will relate to the stress Clark Griswold has at being such an everyman who tries to keep the family together while having a few disasters commited by him or herself plus the rest of the goofy relatives.       Now that I'm old enough to do so I also own the original Vacation which came out the year after I was born as well as European Vacation which came out not so long after but Christmas Vacation was and still is the best of the series. It's good for laughs at Holiday time or any other time of the year. My favorite scene? The squirrel and dog chase. My reason for that is a squirrel got into our house the year before the movie came out and our family's comments at that time were like lines out of the movie. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that young kids or easily offended people should steer clear of it but for those of us who understand the humor and relate to it it's an absolute must have.
006109594X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Very gripping.  My Dad gave it to me and said \\"when you're done, pass it on to someone else to enjoy.\\"  Someone on our team at Microsoft picked it up pretty fast.  The submarine details teleported me right into the heart of  modern submarines.  It absolutely is fiction (although it \\"could\\" feasibly happen), so some of the heavy-military readers make no sense with their nerdy criticism of the details.  Read it in 1998.  Patrick

B002VWNICW|5.0|*** REVIEW FOR THE 2010 BLU RAY VERSION ***<br /><br />In order to have this movie in High Definition, I've had the HD-DVD format of it for a few years now - but it's an America issue and has the controversially modern US ending. Now at last it arrives on BLU RAY in the USA (January 2010) and in the UK (May 2010) and it's just as gorgeous a transfer. It uses exactly the same elements that the HD-DVD did - even the same menus - and the extras from the DVD are all intact also (with the US ending tagged on as an Alternate).<br /><br />The improvement in picture quality is immense over the rather blurred DVD experience. As it opens with a misty dawn and the twitter of birds, we see the young and feisty Elizabeth Bennet (played with a magical touch and staggering assurance by Kiera Knightly) walking with a book. But it's not until she crosses the courtyard of her home that the real quality kicks in - and it's a wow. The picture takes you aback - it wasn't this good in the cinema I can tell you...<br /><br />It isn't perfect throughout by any means though. Because they were going for authenticity, a lot of the early evening and dark night sequences are shot in candlelit rooms (as they would have lived), so you get fuzziness in the definition... But once you get out into the countryside or inside one of the great halls of stately homes - where proper lighting prevailed - the picture quality is beautiful. There is one famous dream sequence where only Kiera's closed eyes fill the screen - she is dreaming of standing on the cliff edge - the clarity is gobsmacking. You also notice the weave of the clothing, the dirt on the hemlines, the ever so slightly unkempt hair - the attention to detail is great.<br /><br />Directed by Joe Wright and released in late 2005, the film version was living in the shadow of the legendary 6-part BBC production from 1995 - so the movie had a lot on its shoulders and admirably rose to the task. Another trump card was Dario Marianelli's lush piano score (Oscar nominated) swirling around the scenes like a graceful swan.<br /><br />In the cinema, it was a delight to look and experience - but sitting at home and watching it in real definition is a far more rewarding and illuminating experience. The acting chops on display is right across the board and apart from a slightly jarring ending, it had the hallmarks of a shoot that was fun and supremely confident in its delivery. I know others will cite the BBC production as definitive - but I think there's more than enough room on my shelf for both.<br /><br />Matthew MacFadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan, Judy Dench, Tom Hollander - they were a cleverly chosen cast - and Rupert Friend won the heart of the lovely Kiera (which might explain the ethereal beauty of her performance). But it's the stunning adaptation of Jane Austen's novel by DEBORAH MOGGACH that is the real hero of the day. There is a sequence when Elizabeth and Darcy finally face off against each other in the rain - the dialogue is to die for - and should have been Oscar rewarded. As a dabbler in screenplays myself, I can't stress enough just how good the work here is - dazzling stuff.<br /><br />It's under a tenner, the DVD extras are all intact, the picture quality is much improved and in some cases unbelievably so - and its eminently re-watchable.<br /><br />To sum up - if you're a fan of the film, Jane Austen or both - then you must own \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" on this format. A Blu Ray gem and highly recommended.around the scenes like a graceful swan.

0312117337|5.0|I recently purchased the Osho Zen cards and I love them.  This is my first deck of tarot cards and I am a beginner, having never read my own cards.  The cards are absolutely beautiful.  They are easy to read and interpret.  The book includes a description of the card and how to interpret it - I almost prefer the description and insight to the card part of the book versus the interpretation side!  It also has about 7 layout spreads in the back of the book.  I would definitely recommend :)
030746363X|5.0|I was lucky enough to get an advance copy of this book. I was like a kid in a candy store going through the Table of Contents...and what contents! I love the way he drills down as far as a reader wants to go with the science, or the reader can skim over the clearly marked technical sections. Believe me, it is all here. If you want to get stronger or just larger, if you want much better sleep or just cure injuries that have been nagging you for years, Tim has made himself a human guinea pig for YOU! BUY THIS BOOK!
B000002L99|5.0|This album delivers optimism, fantasy, and appreciation. I give it a 5-star rating even though it had to grow on me. Most of the tracks are infectiously upbeat. The lyrics on \\"5150\\" are at least acceptable. You hear spasmodic screams or yells from Sammy Hagar. Otherwise, the album's booklet offers the lyrics, even though there are words said that differ from what's sang at times, but they're not nuances.<br /><br />\\"Good Enough\\" was one of those songs that had to grow on me and that I had to bang my head to in order to enjoy it. I like the line, \\"Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs.\\"<br /><br />\\"Why Can't This Be Love\\" offers a funky rhythm and was a radio hit. One of my favorable tracks.<br /><br />\\"Get Up\\" is a crazy fast song with plenty of drums. It's a fighting song that delivers optimism.<br /><br />\\"Dreams\\" was another radio hit. By the title of the song, you can already tell its about fantasy and optimism. The captivating vocals mingled with the instruments used make this song amazing.<br /><br />\\"Summer Nights\\" is a bit of a mellow but flirtatious track. Yet another hit.<br /><br />\\"Best of Both Worlds\\" has favorable guitar riffs, and when the drums collide with the cymbals, it makes the hit outstanding.<br /><br />\\"Love Walks In,\\" a radio hit, has a phenomenal rhythm that lures its listeners into what the song is about. A unique way to describe the power of love is expressed in this tune.<br /><br />The title track is awesome. I liked the way the lyrics were brought out being harmonious with the pace of the melody.<br /><br />\\"Inside\\" is the only song that I didn't like on \\"5150,\\" yet the lyrics are decent. It seemed like Van Halen just played around and threw this track on here.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a keeper. The energetic drums, the brilliant guitar work, and the delivery of the vacillating vocals all mix to make this album a lasting impression to its listeners.

B003L77GRO|5.0|i just finished watching the final episode of season 5 again. this is magic. when my wife and i watched it for the first time on sunday night, i was so tense i could barely stand it. i believe what made this season so great, and what grabbed the viewer even more than in the past, was the really \\"true\\" connection that dexter had with lumen.julia stiles was wonderful in her role. this wasn't a kind of faked, is it real or not relationship dexter had with rita. this was a true connection for him. it was the first real connection we have ever seen for dexter. i think that brought us closer to him. i was hoping against hope that lumen would survive, but with the darkness of the show, could never really be sure. i was even expecting she might fall off the front of the boat as they made their way back to port! i kind of figured the ending for lumen by the time it got there, and it made perfect sense. she was a situational killer. it was not in her dna as it is with dexter. through the horror that lumen experienced and the bond she shared with dexter we almost got to think that dexter could be human. kind of ironic that through lumen becoming a cold blooded killer dexter became more human. but that is the magic of connection. connection that we all seek. i guess for dexter to become too human will be time for the show to end. that's kind of ironic too. because i think we all root for him to make his way through this world and for him to find some reasonable life for himself. to quell his demons....but like i said....that would be the end of the show.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Let me first send a shot out to Movieweb for letting me know about the free screenings on Monday night. I didn't see the link until almost 345pm. And luck had there was a screening in Portland OR. It took me a nearly a hour by bus to get to the theater from where I live but the movie was well worth the time. So again thank you Movieweb for letting me know. Now onto the review.    Story: Was the worst part of the movie for me. The theme had been down many times before. Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell are the first two that come to mind. Sure the first Tron was headed that way but that was over 25 years ago. The idea is machines coming to life creating a new life form and existing in our world. It's nothing new but still the writers did a good job telling the story of a father and son finding each other again after many years apart. The other problem was the character Castor(Michael Sheen). His character was pointless except to movie the story forward. I will be contradicting myself on this point in the next paragraph.    Acting/Characters: The acting was really good in this film and it seemed everyone was enjoying their work. Now it's time to contradict my self. Sure Michael Sheen's character was really pointless you could still see he was halving fun playing the character and it won't bother you so much. Olivia Wild(Quorra) show she's so much more than her good looks. Garrett Hedlund(Sam Flynn) I've never heard of before and was the first time I've seen him. He did a really good job and his chemistry with Jeff Bridges was excellent you could just see the emotion when the two characters meet after so many years. Of course I saved the best for last. That being Jeff Bridges(Kevin Flynn/Clu) a truly great actor. I can't remember a bad film I've seen he's been in. From White Squall, Tron, Iron Man to Blown Away, The Big Lebowski and Arlington Road. I'm sure he's been in a bad films  I just haven't seen them. He is perhaps the best thing in this movie essentially playing two characters. Even Clu a CGI character is brought to life by him. He is really is just one of my favorite actors.    Special Effects/Visuals: The effects and the world brought to life I believe it were done by Digital Domain, Quantum, and Mr. X Inc. The world they created was beautifully done and will blow you away.    Music: I feel like commenting on the music done by Daft Punk. I might have heard the music before but I've never heard of the band until I saw the trailer for Tron. They are really good and their music brought live to the CGI world.    Overall: A great film whose only problem is a decent to good story. Well worth spending your money on. And I hope you do. I will be seeing this again. I have read that they plan on making one more after this if it makes money and I hope it does because I want another film.    On a side not. I'm not a fan of 3D movies but the only opinion for my showing was in 3D so I had to. And to be honest it works for this film really well. So I might give it a chance in the future.
B002XOTPU2|5.0|Simon`s cat is one of the most adorable cats I have ever seen!!! But the only thing is that, I don`t like it on the Kindle. I rather get it for real instead. The pictures on the Kindle are sometimes to small or if you turn it sideways, it will go to a white screen before you get the actual image. I am not saying to not get it. I think in my opinon you should get it in paper.

This is a big score for, James Cameron, he certainly out did himself.  I not only rooted for the Na'vi people, I wanted to become one of them. Great performances by, Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana.  It's too bad that the people in the world don't get along as well as the Na'vi people.  We could all learn from them.  I purchase all of my videos through Amazon, but this one is a real winner.
0553386816|5.0|This is a great book! I picked it up accidentally in Athens airport and was surprised no end! It is not that I did not expect a fine read - Grisham's books are always a fine read - it is just about how Grisham could create a vivid picture of a small town's life! In my opinion this book can compete even with Miss Read's books!  All in all, it is such a page turner that I decided to keep it for my home library - which very seldom happens!
B0043EV774|2.0|There are very few reviews of this so I thought I'd add my two cents worth. I received this movie in the Sony 3d starter kit with my Sony 3d television. Maybe I expect too much but I wasn't very impressed with the 3d quality of this movie. 3d quality, in general, seems to vary quite a bit with content. I've played some 3d video games that cause you to jump because you feel like you're about to be hit with something (with no ghosting), and then this. It's my belief that since this movie wasn't created in native 3d(like Avatar), the 3d was an afterthought. Furthermore, there was signifigant ghosting at times and the 3d effect consistently broke down. To add to all of this, though I'm a Tim Burton fan (Sleepy Hollow, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure et cetera), the movie itself really has a \\"been there, done that\\" feel to it.
0440422973|1.0|So poorly written that I couldn't get beyond the first third of the book -- and I was on 10 hours of plane flights with little else to do. I was disappointed in the plodding, unrealistic plot devices, the cardboard characters, and the awkward prose. And I'm very sympathetic to the subject matter... I wanted to like the book. Alas, I couldn't. Skip it and find something you'll actually enjoy reading.
B004498KPU|5.0|My first MJ video purchase online. Satisfying with a few reservations as to the content (as it concerns Blod on the Dancefloor [the remix was played instead] and Ghosts) but I'm so glad I own it. Love the cover and the effects it comes with. Only something that has MJ on it could turnout that good.
B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|My four youngest children said this about the movie...<br /><br />\\"It was funny.\\"<br /><br />\\"I liked it.\\"<br /><br />They described it as \\"enjoyable\\" and \\"entertaining\\" and \\"humorous.\\"<br /><br />My pre-teen daughters said that they didn't like how the film made the fairies responsible for the seasons and other things that God has created.<br /><br />The film definitely skews toward a female audience. It's innocent entertainment and fun for young girls especially. It's nice to take a well-loved character like Tinker Bell and provide some additional stories for her.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|If you're interested in the complexities of the nature of the human, you'll find this fascinating.  If you're interested in becoming a therapist, you make rethink your position.     Sometimes watching a patient dump his pain on Dr. Weston is startling; when the doctor is able to look past the obvious and see the person's problem or propensities, there's something secure-feeling about experiencing it with that person as if he's just been tended by a kind, clear-intentioned father.    After experiencing all of that with doctor and patient, we are exposed to the doctor's own problems and insecurities when he himself is undergoing therapy, making his ability to separate his own issues from his treatment of others even more remarkable.     If you've experienced therapy yourself, you will see more clearly the art involved.    Sometimes it may make you wonder whether anyone should have children.

Things I had heard seemed more realistic after watching this show, not like movies 'Sands of Iwo Jima' , 'Marine Raiders' , 'Gung Ho'; which I understand were propaganda to raise morale in wartime.

B002O5M4SA|4.0|This movie is a BIG break for Natalie Portman. Leon has superb cast, intense story and lovable characters. Gary Oldman presents his one of his best performance, of all time. Natalie Portman rose as an actor, not a child actor, but as a child actor who played in an mature movie.
0385523912|2.0|If you are looking for insight into the normal lives of North Koreans I recommend this book.  However, please don't consider the 2 stars and my recommendation as a reflection on the author's ability to understand her own surroundings.  It seems like she does a fine job telling the stories of others, but the personal observations that she includes are so off base that I wonder whether I can trust her description of a place she has never truly laid eyes on.  Frankly, this book is only interesting when the author leaves her own impressions out.  I found myself completely annoyed every time the author tried to interject her own impression of Korea into the narrative.  Listening to her description of South Korea as rows of ugly boxes and KFC knock-offs really proved to me that she has the typical westerner's superficial knowledge of Korea, i.e. what a first time visitor sees on the cab ride from the airport.  Furthermore, she compares the traditional Korean attire for women to the Burka, which is absurd.  I felt as though she was stoking the flames of an ignorant fear ubiquitous in the United States.  The romanization of Korean words in the book are awful.  They follow neither the McCune-Reishchauer nor the Revised Romanization forms (Abeoji is spelled Abogi in the book...).  Thankfully when the writer simply conveys what she elicited from the interviewees, and leaves her personal observations out, this book is rather informative.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I wasn't too sure I would like Mumford & Sons after hearing one or two of there tracks.  I thought they were going to sound \\"too Irish\\" for my taste. I was certainly wrong. On my first listen of this album I knew I was going to love it and every time I've listened to it from then I've loved it more and more. Just about every song fits within the scope of the album and all of them have the bands heart and soul layed out for you to grasp on to and feel the emotion of the song. Just a gripping and beautiful collection from beginning to end.
0784011680|5.0|I love this movie - it's what made me both a Chaplin and Robert Downey Jr fan (as it came out when I was 7 years old). It's well done, great acting, and funny and dramatic when appropriate. It's a great tribute to the life of a great artist.

B0032JTV6U|4.0|I love this show, and ordered it for my mother with two day shipping so I could get it to her quickly, as she had an abdominal surgery and needed something to watch to pass the time. It took over two weeks to arrive. I'm very unhappy with this. Two day shipping costs extra, and there's no excuse for it to come a week after an item I ordered with standard shipping several days after ordering Glee.

B002VPE1OS|5.0|These screen protectors have to be one of the best I have ever applied. They basically apply themselves with minimal bubbles. I first tried to use the cleaning cloth that was included, that wouldn't create bubbles. Once the screen was cleaned properly and I applied the film, it did everything on its own. Minor bubbles on the corners which I pushed out. Great price for an excellent product. To say that I am pleased with this item would be an understatement. I love it!
0061730335|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind was full of events that can be applied in parallel to teaching. William Kamkwamba's practice of staying focused on his goal without giving up, believing in his own power to change the world, and taking important risks are all important things to apply in my career as a classroom teacher. William's story taught me that I cannot be afraid to try something new.     William left everything he knew to get on an airplane, attend a TED conference and even went up on stage and said a few words. The ability to deal with that much change in such a short amount of time is inspirational. William worked as hard as he could, and relied on his own inner strength and knowledge to get him through. He never tried to blame anyone else. He approached each problem knowing that it could be solved, and he could be the one to solve it. This attitude was crucial to his success! This is a great story!

0399156577|3.0|A friend recommended this book to me because she knows I love dogs. The last time I tried reading a Nora Roberts book I gave up. It was so poorly edited. At least that issue seems more resolved here, although a better eye would not have let pass such phrases as \\"empty coffee cans full of nails\\" or \\"a Lab-retriever mix\\" (a Lab *is* a retriever, after all).      The story is good, although it kind of loses enthusiasm toward the end, and the characters are generally likable, but the book is far too long. If I had wanted a dog-training manual, I would have gotten one. Yes, dogs are central to the story, but there is such a thing as Too Much Information.
B00004TS0E|1.0|The 1947 Miracle on 34th Street is probably the best Christmas movie ever.  This remake tries hard, way too hard, in fact, but is utterly devoid of the charm and wit of the original, and adds a bit of sleaze just for good measure.  It also misses one of the central points of both the book and the original movie, the very carefully unresolved ambiguity about whether the central character is actually Santa Claus, or merely a slightly crazy old man.  Not worth the time to watch, much less the money to buy.  Get the original.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Extraordinarily well done.  Shows interweaving of deregulation, lax enforcement, and corrupting influence of money and lack of disclosure in big banks and markets.  Raises very troubling points about payoffs to economists -- whether money, jobs, or board positions -- and lack of disclosure of payments for supposedly objective advcocacy of positions -- with specific examples, resume summaries, and net worth.  And how such folks skate back and forth among government, universities, and corporate boards.  Highlights are Congressional testimony of Goldman-Sachs officers, interviews of European economists, and interviews of some arrogant, hostile academics.  Best aspect:  volume of information, images, and impressions in one place of orgins and aftermath of 2008 crash.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|Had a friend of mine that's been telling me for years that I need to check these guys out, I finally did. Now I'm an instant fan. Love how no two songs sound a like on this album.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I missed out seeing this in theater and decided to blindly buy the blu. That's the best $18 I've ever spent. This is the best movie I've seen in years. The story, cast, visuals and music are awesome. If you are going to watch this eliminate all distractions and just immerse yourself into this movie. I watched it last night and was thinking about it long after it ended. If you don't like this movie then you don't like movies.
030746363X|5.0|I've had many sleepless nights since getting my advnace copy of this book. Thanks Tim for the baggy eyes.    First of all, it's a monster of a book, don't hold over small children or animals. It sat on a table for a week because I didn't know if I should read it or start building my next home with it. I am glad I cracked it open. It certainly has changed my views on my own body and what it is capable of.    Unlike other diet or self help books, this one presents ideas and concepts in a language that is easy to read and comprehend. Also most importantly, everything seemed completely and totally doable and within reach. I mean seriously. What guy out there can't devote 4 hours a month to becoming \\"Superhuman\\"? Not only is the reading imformative, but some parts are down right hilarious. Expecially with Tim's writing style. You can absolutely picture Tim being his own guinea pig. Some parts of the book you cringe. Other parts your on the edge of your seat racing through pages to find out what happens next.    The science in the book also had me geeking out. I loved how he gets into the how and why of everything as well. I imagine some will be turned off by these sections, which Tim anticipated and sectioned off in the book so you can skip these sections. Brilliant.    Don't wait. You'll be amazed at how little it takes and how simple it all really is. Get this book and change your life and your body.
030746363X|5.0|Excellent book.  I received a pre-release copy of this book a week ago during finals week of my first semester of graduate school, and somehow managed to read a majority of it in that time.  Some of the chapters (those adapted from blog posts) have already made a significant impact on my life.  The most mind blowing one for me is swimming.  In a couple pages of text, Tim managed to increase my swimming ability 10 fold... I used to doggie-paddle my way around pools and lakes (which is probably the least efficient way to go about things), now I SWIM!  It's easier than ever, and all it took was a few simple tips.
0060936223|5.0|An utterly brilliant, fascinating book. I had to stop myself from devouring it as it was so good I wanted to savour it. When I finished it I wanted to start all over again. An intimate, honest account of a great love affair, set against the backdrop of  bohemian New York and the Chelsea Hotel in the 60s. Written by someone who was a part of it.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Love it! I specially love the scene with Cam Gigandet and the famous \\"Famous Amos\\" cookies. Yum! Makes me want to go eat cookies. It's also a cute scene. I can watch it over and over. Love the glitzy and the glam. Numbers are pretty awesome as well. 5 out of 5 :)
0316017922|2.0|I had great hopes of this book, but was very disappointed.  The experiments and tests were so open to bias and the conclusions sweeping or not grounded in what had been established by the \\"tests\\" that the book lost all credibility for me.  I give as an example - the experiment involving students' responses at being inconvenienced in their passage along a hallway.  The sample is too small in number, too narrow in population selection etc...also the interpretation of responses was entirely subjective and we aren't given the methods & benchmarks for measuring responses etc.  I don't remember anything else about the book except feeling irritated by the testing and conclusions. (If something doesn't interest you - you won't remember it!)  Maybe I'm hypercritical because I've supervised a number of PhD students etc, but I can think of so many wonderful authors (often unsung) from whom I continue to learn.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|A quick note: the following review contains only minor spoilers concerning returning characters and storylines and does not disclose any major revelations.     Previously on 24: For 7 seasons the thriller genre was redefined and the bar for drama and suspense was raised to a new high, and not just for television. The brilliant, subversive and fearless writing staff, the deep cast of memorable characters, the always atmospheric scores of Sean Callery, and the inventive real-time format made for the greatest thrill ride in television history. 24 was not always flawless, in fact, there were moments that threatened to destroy its legacy (see season 6 for an example), but for the most part, 24 ranged from great to masterful (see season 5). So naturally, us fans, who already had ridiculously high standards for our beloved series expected pure, unrelenting excellence from its 8th and final season...    Day 8: The POTUS is working with the president of the fictional middle-eastern country Kamistan (think Iran) at the UN to put forth an unprecedented peace agreement. Jack Bauer, now healthy and watching cartoons with his granddaughter is pulled back into the action when an old informant literally knocks on his door. All he has to do is survive one last day...     The change of setting to New York City was a wise choice. Not only does it make sense for a rogue agent like Bauer to be on the move, major changes of any kind seem natural for a show that focuses on its characters literally one day at a time. Also, after so many years in LA it would have seemed stagnant to have stayed in DC or to have returned to the show's original location. There isn't nearly as much on location work as I expected but the CGI backdrops are, for the most part, very well done and the new setting adds a nice refreshing quality to the series (much like DC did in season seven).     Though many fans were critical of the season's slower, season 1 style start, it allows the time for the stage to be set before the plot really takes off. Yes, season 5 started off with a bang and never let up, but it isn't necessary for every season to do the same. The Hassan family is a perfect example of how to not rush a storyline. President Omar Hassan gets the screen time that is usually allotted to the American president. This ends up being well worth it. His arc as well as the arc of his family and the peace treaty ends up being one of the most well written storylines in the entire run of the series. It is riveting, fearless, complex and in typical 24 fashion, it is edgy, unabated and is not prone to sappiness or contrived revelations. Again, like most of the season, it starts off slow, but it consistently heats up and eventually catches fire.    The threat that propels the first half of the story is pretty familiar, as are the villains. The difference is that the threat comes together after several episodes of building towards it rather than just out of thin air in the first hour, and the villains actually have some political motives and larger intentions rather than just being driven by the desire to destroy. These two things may sound minor but they are absolutely key in separating the threat/villains of Day 8 from the very, very similar ones of previous years. Hint: all the other evenly numbered seasons.    Season 8 sees the return of CTU, which in a way, feels like a regression. But it does provide a familiar, nostalgic feel for the final season, and more importantly it allows for Chloe O' Brien to once again be a series regular. The new CTU is visually impressive, making CTU LA look like a concrete garage, though its return does unfortunately come with some recycled subplots and generic characters. Brian Hastings, the new director isn't nearly as terrible as most fans claim he is, but he is very bland and could never be mentioned in the same sentence as George Mason or Bill Buchanan. Freddie Prince Jr. is actually surprisingly decent as Cole Ortiz, the head of field ops.Yet none of the new editions are even half as memorable as past CTU alumni like Tony Almeida,  Michelle Dessler, or Curtis Manning.   The Dana Walsh story is without a doubt the biggest flaw of season 8. An irrelevant subplot about a CTU analyst fending off blackmailing rednecks from her past sounds like an obvious bad idea but somehow it ended up with a disturbingly large amount of screen time. Ultimately, if you're incredibly patient, her story gains some momentum but it never redeems itself (going from annoying to unoriginal) and will always be analogous to the Kim's wacky adventures in season two.     As mentioned above, Chloe is once again a series regular, and not only does she get plenty of screen time, she also gets a good amount of character development and unlike some of the previous seasons, she's allowed to once again take center stage... where she belongs. Basically, season 8 is a great day for Chloe fans, second only to season 5.              24 has always done a brilliant job of adding interesting twists to their recurring characters in each new season; Renee Walker's return season 8 is no exception. Since the events of Day 7, when she was pushed from an honest, law abiding agent to a Bauer-esque renegade, she has fallen into a very dark place. In season 8 she is broken, vulnerable and at times, borderline psychotic. This makes for a string of shocking episodes reminiscent of those classic hours in Days 1 and 2 when we found out for the first time just how much of a loose cannon, badass Jack Bauer really is. Her involvement also adds a great deal of emotional depth to the season as her relationship with Jack starts to evolve.     President Taylor returns as well, though, for the first part of the season she is pushed to the background. Though it seems strange at first, it ultimately makes perfect sense... it allows the necessary room for the Hassan storyline to develop which sets the stage for later episodes, when the spotlight shifts to Taylor, setting up one of the season's most riveting stories, with a tremendous performance by Cherry Jones. It may take a while to heat up but her story arc in Day 8 ends up being right there with the best of 24's presidential storylines, and in a series that featured both David Palmer and Charles Logan, that's really saying something.     Speaking of 24's former presidents, Day 8 also sees the return of Logan, and this time its not just for a three episode long subplot. Gregory Itzin is outstanding once again and his presence alone takes the season to another level. His return is full of all the twists, drama and electric standoffs you could hope for. It doesn't matter how high your expectations are for the Charles Logan story, you will not be disappointed.      Some have criticized season 8 for not adding enough depth to Jack's role in the season's first half. Yes, even Jack going through the motions would make for a decent season, but it would be a real stretch to say that this is the case here. At most it could be said that Jack is a touch removed from the first half of the day's events, but part of this is because Jack really doesn't want to be involved in the first place; that is what adds depth to his involvement. He now has something to live for and it is interesting to see how that impacts his desire to plunge back into his old save-the-day lifestyle. It's also important to realize that much of Bauer's story arc in Day 8 is directly tied with the return of Renee. After Day 7 Jack was pulled out of his former world by his daughter, who saved his life and his new-born granddaughter, and aside from his loyalty to Chloe, it is only because of Renee that he ventures back into that world, and throughout the day it is mainly her presence that keeps him there. And to anyone that does feel that Jack is not featured to his full potential in the season's first half, you needn't worry. The last half of Day 8 is without doubt the most intense Jack Bauer story line we have seen. Itis Bauer completely off the chain, held back by nothing and no one, literally going against the entire world. It is shocking and spellbinding, even by 24 standards. A hell of a way to end the series.    Another positive quality of Day 8 is the feeling of renewed creativity. There is an energy to this season that is reminiscent of the early days. There are far less of the stale, predictable interrogation scenes and more opportunities for Jack to use intellect and creativity to track down suspects and get them talk. There are more moments that feel fresh and exciting rather than run of the mill. Yes, there are some predictable twists and a few revelations that seem a bit too familiar. But there are still moments when even the most seasoned 24 fan will be left shocked and speechless, still plenty of story arcs that will keep you just as addicted as you were to season one, and there are still enough 24-style emotional powerhouse moments that will leave you floored again and again. Even during some of the moments when you see what's coming you will be thinking \\"Yes, this is the 24 I know and love!\\" way more often than you'll be thinking \\"I've seen this before.\\" And even when you are thinking the latter you will at least have to give credit to the writers for finding an entirely new twist to put on it. Sure, there are many exceptions which I will leave to you to find yourself but they aren't nearly enough to put a damper on the entire season.     The scores of Sean Callery are also a must-mention. The music of series has always been an immensely crucial aspect of the 24's atmosphere and intensity. Day 8 is no different. The scores are as atmospheric and fitting as ever.    So, how does Day 8 work as an end to the series? Well, unlike other shows, 24 seasons work mostly as stand-alones. For this reason it is hard to judge #8 as a final season. The series finale may not quite have the emotional stopping power of the season 1 finale or the explosiveness of the season 5 finale but it is still epic and amazing all the way through. Classic 24 without a doubt. And though there may be a lot of differing opinions about whether or not it was a truly fitting end to the (television) adventures of Jack Bauer, no one can deny that the final few hours of the series are 24 at its very best. And for me, that alone is satisfying enough. The bottom line is that #8 lives up to the standards of quality and groundbreaking originality set by the previous years and though other seasons are debatably better, #8 is no more than a notch or two lower. Despite its many flaws, Jack Bauer's final day of mayhem is definitely in the upper echelon of 24 seasons.
B00192IV9U|5.0|A must have for ANY fan! This album is amazing! It's a Michael Jackson album not Michael Jackson's album. You can tell by the small imperfections that he would have never allowed his fans to hear. You can really hear the talent that this world lost. But, I'm sure MJ is rolling over in his grave knowing that Sony is taking advantage of his talent AGAIN!. Either way, I'm a huge fan and will continue to support the name. Rest Easy Mike~!
0385342047|2.0|I love the Shopaholic series but this new addition was not so good. The book was very hard to get into and I did not even finish. The first chapter was just about what a brat the child was and the book did not get any better, bad buy.
1400079144|5.0|Dan Brown does it again, with a novel rivaling his prior books \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" in scope, magnitude, and pure awesomeness! Dan Brown is only surpassed in bad-ass-ness by Robert Langdon!
B002ZG980U|4.0|As soon as I finished watching Inception the first comparison that came to my mind was William Gibson's [[ASIN:0441012035 Neuromancer]].  There's some superficial plot similarities between the two, but what struck me about both was how many really cool images and ideas both had.  It also struck me that despite all of the awesome action, elaborate set pieces and cool moments, both Neuromancer and Inception failed to connect with me on anything other than a purely visceral level.  Inception fails in the same way Neuromancer did.  It's too focused on the various plot machinations and rules that govern it's universe, and it fails to give the character side of the equation as much loving attention.       First with the superlatives.  This is a very entertaining and exciting movie.  I was particularly impressed with Christopher Nolan's staging of the action sequences.  I found a lot of the Dark Knight's big set pieces to be too messy.  There was a lot of quick cuts and choppy sequences.  Inception's action sequences didn't seem to have this problem.  I also found a few scenes incredibly imaginative.  The hallway scene in particular was very well staged and thought out.  Most importantly, the action felt much more clear and purposeful than in his Batman films.      The ideas in Inception are also very promising.  I enjoy films about dreams because they afford filmmakers the opportunity to get completely lost inside someones head.  Inception doesn't really use the dreams to examine psychology too deeply.  Rather they're used as elaborate staging grounds for mind bending action.  I liked the different take on dreams, and it made for some very good action sequences.      Now for some criticisms.  A lot of sci-fi seems to focus to much on the world it's building and not enough on the characters who inhabit the world.  Cobb is given a tortured back story about his wife, but the relationship between the two never moved me in any kind of way.  It's seemed typically Hollywood to me, and it felt out of place among all of the unconventional ideas and set pieces.      And what about the rest of the team?  Besides Robert Fischer, who gets quite a bit of back story and motivation, the rest of the team are basically cyphers.  I would have appreciated a bit more characterization of Arthur or Eames to flesh out why I should care about these folks.      Inception is an entertaining movie with a lot of great action sequences.  Technically, it's a brilliant piece of film making.  Nolan knows how to entertain and please a crowd.  You should see this if you're at all a fan of action films.  I've avoided any interpretation here, but it's worth checking out online some of the theories and explanation about how the film works.      I have one minor quibble about the DVD.  I got the bear bones DVD edition at a gift exchange, and I believe that the dialogue is mixed too quiet while the music and the sound effects are mixed to loud.  I had to turn up the volume to hear the characters talk but turn it down when there was an explosion in an attempt to not piss off my neighbors.
B00192IV9U|3.0|No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson, let's just call this album what it is...a rushed, stitched-together cash-in.  Just about everything in this album reeks of that. The album is really short...Jackson's albums since Dangerous have contained between 14 and 16 tracks.  The packaging is painfully bland as well.  And finally, the music.  These picks are clearly not up to par with what Michael Jackson would've released.  And dare I say, some songs require some imagination on the listener's part to even admit it's Jackson himself singing!  The rest of the songs sound like third-rate outtakes.  The polish that Jackson carefully gives to his records is missing completely here.  There is no coherence, no concept, and no spirit.  Probably the best song on the album is \\"Behind The Mask\\", which was recorded during the Thriller sessions!  The worst thing is that now this album tarnishes what is an incredible music legacy.  It might provide some decent listening, but ultimately it is utterly forgettable.    1. Hold My Hand (featuring Akon) - This is a decent enough track, but Akon overpowers it entirely.    2. Hollywood Tonight - This would be a fantastic song if it wasn't for the questionable vocals.  Jackson's voice is really deep...it doesn't sound like him at all, and you wonder just how much trickery is involved.    3. Keep Your Head Up - A pretty uninteresting song with obvious studio meddling.  Jackson's vibratto sounds way off.    4. (I Like) The Way You Love Me - This is basically the same exact song you heard on Jackson's Ultimate Collection box set with an excerpt of Jackson in the studio added at the start.  Why this was included here is beyond me.    5. Monster (featuring 50 Cent) - Like 'Hollywood Tonight', this doesn't sound like Jackson.  It's also a chock full of vocal samples edited haphazardly together.    6. Best of Joy - One of the more genuine-sounding songs on this album.  Supposedly this was one of the very last songs he recorded in his life.7. Breaking News - There is nothing interesting or redeeming about this song.  It is awful in every way.    8. (I Can't Make It) Another Day (featuring Lenny Kravitz) - Another decent song.  One of the highlights here.    9. Behind The Mask - This song is awesome.  Plain and simple.  Jackson sounds youthful and full of energy, and the production is really excellent.    10. Much Too Soon - This song bored me to tears.  An awful way to end a record.    I'm sure that the Michael Jackson Estate, who actually released this album, is busy readying another one.  There are scores of unreleased Michael Jackson songs being leaked to the internet, many of which are infinitely better than the ones on this album.  Hopefully they'll do a better job with that one...
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I had wrote a bad review complaning about the quality of the DVDs and I thought that it was missing a DVD. I checked and all the DVDs were there (I guess there was an empty space). I apologize for the bad review, as the quality of the filming cannot be responsibility of the vendor; I guess it's because it was filmed in the 80's. I appreciate that the vendor quickly replied and offered to replace the series with a new one, which was not necessary.    Good customer service. A+++    Marie
B002FOQY04|5.0|Kid CuDi's album Man on the moon is very good. CuDi has good lyrics and good beats to go with them. The deluxe version comes witha dvd where you can see Kid Cudi on tour and playing some golf. Its pretty hilarious.
030746363X|5.0|This book is simple, direct, geeky, fun and interesting.  This is truely hackers guide to the human body. I have always been interested in hacking my various electronic devices, but I never thought of hacking how my body works. I am looking forward to putting some of Tim's ideas to the test.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Eminems cd Recovery is very different from his cd's of the past, but this cd is very good. Eminem always has lyrics about life and not cars, money, and other things. He has a lot of celebrity guests that help make this cd even better. This is definitely a cd to buy.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Although some reviewers have rated this CD song by song, that's a waste of time. Also one reviewer gave the impression that it was an album of Mr. Groban merely playing the piano.      Glad I didn't listen to the naysayers.  This is a beautiful album (CD) beginning with a stunning nonvocal piece and proceding with haunting heartfelt music accompanied with Mr. Groban's magnificant voice.
B002ZG9968|3.0|I was really excited to see this movie from the previews. It was not what I expected though. It was slow and very predictable. I did laugh a couple of times, but I deffinately wish I would have just did the $1 redbox rental instead of buying this one.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Before buying this please note that for quality results you need to buy a gaming mouse that has a high DPI (i recommend the G9X).  Then when you have that you are going to need to configure it for awhile to get it just right.  Improper configuration will make this thing work terrible, but doing it properly results in AMAZING performance.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I just bought this album from bestbuy on the day it came out, and I think it's an excellent album.  I keep reading all of these reviews on various sites saying that it's not Michael's voice singing.  I strongly disagree.  I am A HUGE FAN OF MICHAEL JACKSON and have listened to him sing in many many different songs, and this is him!  I think what people are missing is that Michael had SO MANY different ranges in his voice.  Some songs on this album he sings with his angel voice high, then some he sings with his somewhat raspy voice, and some sings normal level.  He is THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME and in my opinion, this is a excellent album!
030746363X|5.0|I've actually read this book twice now -- a pre-pre-draft a few months ago and the final copy more recently. I'm not a \\"fitness guy,\\" in fact I had never been to the gym in my life besides a few minutes on a treadmill, and when my friends would talk about running or biking I felt like it was some sort of club I should to have learned about when I was a kid but never did. But I was fine, I got by on a fast metabolism and a ready supply of bad puns.    The first thing that struck me in the book, besides Tim's signature anecdotes, was how there wasn't a \\"this is the one true way\\" tone to it. It was very matter-of-fact: here's what I learned from the research, here's what I tried, here's what worked and what didn't, here's what the experts said, here's something to try. Being a geek, and a skeptic, every part of that appealed to me and I did something I'd never done before in my life -- I started to pay attention to my physical well-being.    First I started with some measurements to get a baseline, then the diet parts of the book (man I love that cheat day), next I began doing kettlebell workouts. Before I knew it, friends and colleagues were starting to notice and I found myself shopping for some slimmer-fitting clothes. Even better, though, was I began to find day-to-day tasks just a bit more effortless, like carrying and lifting my bag in my frequent travel, taking the stairs instead of the escalators, and helping my parents put up their giant Christmas tree.    It's hard to summarize, but what this book did that nothing before it was able to do was just get me off my butt and away from my computer screen. I don't know if it was the volume of information, the way it took an analytical approach, or just the hooks of the counter-intuitive findings, but it worked. I now lead a much more balanced life, and even though I didn't (and probably will never) apply every chapter of the book, I like knowing that I have them as reference if I ever need them.    P.S. If you're ageek and want to learn how exercise improves your mental acuity, which I also found very motivating, check out the first chapter of [[ASIN:0979777747 John Medina's Brain Rules]].
B000YENUI6|1.0|This is a gangster thriller film? I cannot believe how disappointed I was in this film. There are so many ways how this movie could have been improved, but somehow it looks as though improvements were never looked for, at all... To me, this is like making a presentation at work using rough drafts prepared an hour before, or handing in a rough draft to a professor in college, etc.    Some reviewers said the film is too violent. I disagree. It's not overly or underly violent. Violence to me does not make or break a movie. The boring, slow moving, uninteresting plot is what ruins a movie. This movie is not too long to begin with (roughly an hour and 40 minutes)but it still very possible of being cut to probably an hour. This is how sad this movie is. I regret purchasing it. If you like any of the classic mob films, or even newer crime films like the departed, dont watch this junk. Forget about mentioning classic mob films in a review of this movie. I take mentioning classics back.    I will say Viggo does a good job in this movie. Perhaps he is the only thing good about this film. That surely does not make the movie any good, however.
142311339X|5.0|Riordan is a master at depicting realistic characters that readers care about and placing them in far-out, fantasy settings and situations. It's not an easy feat that few authors have been able to pull off (Robert Liparulo and his Dreamhouse Kings series is another good example of doing it right). The result is a story that's edge-of-your-seat exciting and easy to get lost in. Like some other reviewers here, I was skeptical of Riordan's ability to continue in the Percy Jackson world without becoming a bit boring. I shouldn't have worried. Obviously, he was aware of that possibility and avoided it with fresh characters and plot twists. Even his writing was fresh and once again I remembered why I like reading him so much. Great writer and storyteller. If you haven't read any of his books, you're really missing out. While I think you should read his previous series first, if this is your first, you'll still enjoy it and I predict you'll be going back to get all of his books.

B004132HZS|5.0|This is a wonderful retelling of the books. It is amazingly cast and the writing is fast paced and witty. Benedict Cumberbatch is Mr. Holmes incarnate and Martin Freeman does a wonderful job as his partner (not sidekick!) If the modern setting puts off Holmes purists, please don't let it. The spirit of the books is perfectly maintained! I'm impatiently waiting for August 2011, and until then I will definitely be rewatching.
030746363X|5.0|I, like many of the other reviewers, received an early copy of the Four Hour Body because we participated in a sale last year around the release of the Four Hour Work week, where buying 3 or more of that release earned the buyer a pre-release copy of the Four Hour Body. I received the book a week before the official Dec 14 release. I have read just at 300 pages. The content is well written, and seems to offer interesting, if unconventional, advice and instruction. While I would not fully endorse every recommendation in the book, especially not without consulting a doctor or other qualified professional, many of Tim's recommendations or challenges are low risk, small time-frame (1 to 3 weeks), challenges that could have amazing results. 2.5% of the effort for 95% of the results. I'm already on the no-white meal plan to try to drop 15-20 lbs. I recommend this book to anyone needing to drop weight, firm up, improve strength, and potentially improve your love life (or at least the sex!).
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have to admit, when my friend first tried to get me to play this game I was very skeptical. In an age of video games you don't often think about playing board games anymore, but this game really has changed my mind. It really makes a fun and challenging experience for everyone involved and is a game that really makes you think. Without a doubt the best part about the game is the fact that it is always changing so you get to continuously try out new strategies trying to beat your opponents. The only problems I have is the construction of the boundary pieces. They are just cardboard, and when you play the game as much as my family does it really starts to wear down so I think I am going to try to figure out a way to laminate it or something. Also the pieces in the game are really small and are easy to loose to be careful! Defiantly get this game if you are looking to have a fun night!
B002ZG999U|2.0|I grabbed this movie hoping for some good, fun, over-the-top action, but I have to say that it failed to deliver. The biggest reason why is that there are just too many characters! While Stallone and Statham are clearly \\"the stars,\\" there are also over a dozen other \\"supporting stars\\" -- and The Expendables has to give each one of those stars enough screen time to establish his character, to make us like him enough that we care if he lives or dies, and to let him feature in at least one cool scene. That's a HUGE chunk of time spent doing nothing but rolling out characters. It didn't add anything to the plot (mainly because there WAS no plot), while it really cut into the action.<br /><br />And even when there was good action, the director filmed the biggest scenes in the dark, using shaky-cams. So I could tell that someone was shooting, but didn't have a prayer of figuring out who was shooting who. The introductory hostage rescue, and the assault at the end, both suffered from this. My TV has pretty good contrast, but I don't like having to rewind every 60 seconds to figure out what just happened.<br /><br />The remaining action scenes were good, mind you! A solid car chase or two, some nice martial arts action, and even an old-fashioned streetfight on a basketball court -- all the kind of stuff I expected. If the whole film were able to keep that level of over-the-top, cinematic action, it would've been great.<br /><br />(Alternatively, it could've had a good plot, instead of one that made absolutely no sense. \\"The villain kidnaps the girl before escaping -- why? Uh... because he's the villain and that's just what they do!\\" Heh. But that's secondary at best. No one goes into The Expendables expecting a strong plot -- we want crazy action! I just wish I'd gotten it.)
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|This is a terrific DVD, fun to watch and listen to.  I bought it because it has the Descriptive Video track option for the blind.  I would have given it 5 stars if it the track was more accessible.  Someone sighted has to start the DVD for the blind listener.  There should be an auto-code to do this.
030746363X|5.0|What a fantastic way to start 2011 with a clear vision of mind/body evolution.  We live in a time where our thoughtlessness is making us sick and bloated.  Better yet to be thoughtful about how we can be respectful of our bodies.  Ferris guides the reader on how they can take steps to be strong  well done
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I purchased this dvd series for my husband who really enjoyed the Band of Brothers.  This mini series was just as good as Band of Brothers and as graphic.  This is not for those with a weak stomach. This series depicts real life war and all the injuries, casualties that go along with it. If you have someone who likes history and enjoys war movies this series is awesome. I recommend this only to adults because of the graphic nature of the movies, but well worth every penny that you pay for it.  Never a boring moment, my husband watched it over a couple of days because he couldn't put it down.
B003ODL004|5.0|Wow! I just want to know how he developed on a theme of TWO NOTES... especially in \\"Dream is Collapsing\\". ABSOLUTELY brilliant in the true sense of the word. This soundtrack helped this film really capture me. And now I have the motif G... F#...G....F# stuck in my head. I'm having a hard time finding another soundtrack to buy because nothing is matching the intensity. MARVELOUS!
0802473156|5.0|This book couldn't be more accurate.  I've seen the concepts this book describes in so many other people I know.  I have purchased probably 10 copies so far to give to other friends I think would really benefit from getting it.  It's a great book for new couples to read together as well!
0307474275|5.0|The way Dan Brown makes the chapters makes the book a fast moving story.  I read this book in a little over 2 days because I could not put it down!<br />It's hard not to take what he is saying in the book as factual history (I guess its more fun that way), but you have to remember his books are in the FICTION section of book stores.<br />If you're a fan of history, art, or codes, this book is for you!

B00436GNVC|2.0|I really dislike what I've heard thus far. Duffy either tries to hard on this album or she's not suited for up-tempo tunes. Rockferry was a great record but this is a painful album to sit through. Come back brighter, eh?
0061251305|5.0|Not since I read the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People have I been so enlightened. This book has been my companion and my conversation with anyone in the company that will listen. The fresh look at real team work in an organization is groundbreaking. The observation of actual tribes that exist in organizations and the opportunities we have to help them  evolve is facinating.  Tribal Leadership sets the reader on a path of action. As intellectually stimulating as can be, the strength of the message is a call for leaders to step up to the plate.  Level 5 exists and  finding out how to get there is reason enough to invest the time and the money to buy the book and get ready to look at your business with new eyes.
0765326353|5.0|This book was one of the best books I've ever read. Every part of it is unique and different from other fantasy series, staying away from those cliches of the genre. The series is sure to be one of the best of the next decade. I can't wait for the rest of the story!
B000Y9Q59W|5.0|Wall Street is the Oliver Stone's classic. Best movie ever and watching it on blu-ray it is amazing. Amazing quality!!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|My grandson and I enjoy watching the Lion King over and over. The story line is heartfelt and the lessons to be learned are valuable.  My grandson is 5 years old and he told me he really likes the music. As he watches the movie, I really believe my grandson imagines that he is Simba (the baby lion) and his father is Mufasa (the daddy lion). I highly recommend this movie.
0061730335|4.0|This story is an inspiring book that is nice read for innovation and those who love to see the underdog win.  We often see only the negative come out of Africa, seldom are we shown the success and spirit of an emerging continent.  William Kamkwamba has a longing to become more than himself and sitting idly by does not suit him.  As a youngster trying to build toys, then taking the same ideas into creating a windmill to hopefully provide energy and to lift his village out of poverty.  The book gives a rich background to his life in Malawi, and it helps the reader -most who are unknowlegable about true life in an African nation, a better understanding of just how difficult his task and achievment was.  At some points it was a slow read, but it got better towards the middle and end.  I found the beginning to be a bit jumpy.  Nevertheless, it was a fine book that seems to join the current list of \\"moving true stories\\" about education that are flooding the book market.  This would be a good book for a high school English class.
030746363X|5.0|I read 4-Hour Work Week about three years ago.  It was full of great ideas and the net result was that I started an internet business.  I loved the ideas that Tim presented.  Tim offered advance copies of his book 4-Hour Body to purchasers of multiple copies of 4HWW.  I received my book about a week ago.  It is well organized.  I especially like the suggestion to not read the whole book cover-to-cover but rather to target your own goals.  Many of the ideas in the book will be considered \\"far out there.\\"  Just like so many other brilliant ideas have in the past.  I highly recommend this book.

1453624910|2.0|It was so pleased to see such a range of fanart in all styles, from the classical to the whimsical, and that was my primary enjoyment in this collection of short stories. Otherwise, I see that Flewelling yielded to the recent influx of female demands for m/m fiction.<br /><br />What I've always enjoyed about the series is the tasteful and loving way Flewelling presented Seregil and Alec's growing love and eventual relationship. I am quite open-minded, being a writer of gay fiction myself, but these rather spoiled my view for the most part. The sole one I really liked was the greater depth and background information provided for Alec's connection to his father.<br /><br />I was excited to see this volume and purchased and read it within a couple of days and sold it immediately after. It would not be one I'd reread. The last two books of Flewelling I didn't particularly care for but I remain a fan and look forward to the sixth installment yet I would definitely prefer it not in the realms of m/m fiction. There is enough of that on the market these days, and the majority not done very well.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|Since Arrested Development I haven't found a comedy that makes me laugh continuously from episode to episode.  There are a ton of reviews here so I'll keep it short - witty, comical, great timing, great character development...all-in-all a well-rounded funny show.  Love the different families and how they interact.  Love Manny.  Will you love it?  If you love modern, sarcastic, not-just-slapstick comedy - YES.
B003HN7BYA|3.0|I was dissapointed because I thought I was going to get the posters and t-shirt that I saw when Phil Anselmo was opening the box set in the video. I already have that cd, I already have the new songs. I was ordering it because I wanted all the stuff in the video.

B003VQQG8K|5.0|The author has done a very fine job and it is hard to decipher between the facts and the fiction in many instances. It is exciting to read and awaiting the outcome is suspensful.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This was ordered as a gift for my grandson.  It arrived in good time and in good shape.  I took him to see this in 3D and was excited to get the movie for him for Christmas.  Merry Christmas!
B00063F8B2|5.0|This CD is not only fun, it also contains a mix of traditional Christmas music with some new holiday favorites. It's fun, upbeat and is something to certainly add to your mix of holiday music!
B00008WT49|3.0|This SACD seems to be an after thought.  I have the LP version of this album, it is a very good recording album on LP.   The SACD, on the other hand, lost all the dynamics, as if it sounds somewhat muffed.  I don't understand this. The recording engineer who produced the SACD should be fired.  What a shame.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|who cares it got 48% in rottentomatoes?    great film     good story line    you will never find out what happen in the end      but If you watch this film again    it might not be entertainment as first time    but you might find some interesting scene
030746363X|5.0|Halfway through the first chapter of the Four Hour Body I realized what I was reading.  Sure - this is a book about fascinating ways to transform your body in little time.  The content is valid and will help MANY people.      But what Tim has really written is the most cogent and powerful manifesto on self-experimentation and body-tracking that exists today.  Wondering if latest technique X and Z will help you gain energy?  Don't wait for medical research to catch up - safely and effectively TRY IT and MEASURE THE RESULT.  You are your own laboratory - and Tim gives you the techniques and most importantly gets you EXCITED ABOUT changing your own life through the power of quantification and experimentation.  Get ready for a world where citizen science and quantified self are on the rise - and look to Tim's book as a key opening volley.
B002ZG981E|3.0|well  is good but still  away from best    a good movie should still interested audience when audience watch it on DVD    you should watch this movie   but don't expect high      even though a smart visual complicated movie might suprised audience                   but this movie won't have a hope about Best movie in 2010   It won't work
030746363X|5.0|I've been glued to this book since I got it. With paper clips and highlighters close by, I have been learning so much. Tim has taken the time, energy and personal sacrifice (if you call it that) to make himself a human guinea pig and be more than descriptive in noting his findings.    All the results that are talked about in this book are backed by raw data and solid proof so you know it works. I've been following his \\"Slow Carb\\" diet plan ever since I heard him talk about it years ago and it is truly effective.    Awesome book to say the least!
B000N29G5A|4.0|great story & great  twisted<br /><br />but the directer poorly explain the plot and character<br /><br />and the main character develop in a wrong way<br /><br />sure is a good movie that fit in Saw Series<br /><br />but also gets annoying when Jigsaw talking too much
B00192IV9U|5.0|I've been awaiting this release since it was first announced,I have not been let down. This is an amazing release, Michael was a perfectionist and thus he didn't find these songs fit for release,but one listen and you can hear the magic that is Michael Jackson.It is so sad that we had this gentle, supremely talented man amongst us and many of us did not appreciate the gift GOD gave us. Hats off to SONY for this CD and I look forward to future releases. The King of Pop is still here with us and his music will live on forever. Those who hate can keep on hating,we who have always cherished the talent of Michael are not swayed by your negativity. Sony, get busy on the next Michael Jackson relese. Every song on MICHAEL is a winner.
B00192IV9U|2.0|HEY! YOU DON'T SAY A REVIEW ISN'T HELPFUL JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED!     If you're reading this, please go to youtube right now. Look up all these unreleased songs by MJ RIGHT NOW!!    \\"Cheater\\" \\"Got the Hots\\" \\"Sunset Driver\\" \\"Do you know where your children are\\"  \\"In the Back\\" \\"She Got It\\" \\"Beautiful\\" \\"I Want to Stay\\" \\"Fall Again\\" \\"Blue Gangster\\" \\"Scared of the Moon\\" \\"There Must Be More to Life Than This\\"  \\"You Can't Win\\" \\"Work that Body\\" \\"Trouble\\" \\"Slave to the Rhythm\\" \\"Slapstick\\" \\"Serious Effect\\" \\"Niteline\\" \\"Love Never Felt So Good\\" \\"If You Don't Love Me\\" \\"Hot Street\\" \\"Get It\\" \\"For All Time\\" \\"The Way You Love Me (original)\\" \\"Someone Put Your Hand Out\\" \\"On The Line\\" \\"We've Had Enough\\" \\"We Are Here To Change The World\\" \\"One More Chance\\" \\"Carousel\\" \\"Someone in the Dark\\" \\"Street Walker\\" \\"Fly Away\\" \\"Xscape\\"      Look them up and see how much we've been swindled by Sony with this worthless excuse of a MJ album. If it were up to me I would have released a 3-disc box set with all those tracks over this piece of crap! I'm a true MJ fan and I refuse to accept that MJ would have wanted this material released like this. Any fan could have burned a CD-R that would have been better than this pathetic album.    Let me start off my review by telling you all how much I hate how Sony ruined an amazing song on this album, the one entitled \\"The Way You Love Me.\\" This song was originally released on the \\"Michael Jackson Ultimate Collection 4 CD Box Set\\" back in early 2004 and it sounded 100 times better than how they butchered it on here. They took out a whole other melody that played and changed the piano sounds into ones that sound like they came from a cheap Fisher Price toy. The original song sounded like a tribute to the old 50's Doo Wop loves songs but the one on this album sounds like something these contemporary R & B clowns of today make. I am completely devastated by this horrible and unnecessary change because the original HAD MJ'S OKAY WHEN HE WAS ALIVE!! Whoever thought that this version was superior to the one that was released on the original box set should be shot.    I see the same thing happening with Michael Jackson that happened with the rapper Tupac Shakur after he died. Before there were any Tupac albums released after he died (except for Makaveli) there were hundreds of songs that were released in the underground scene. These songs became classics among the unreleased/underground crowd and when they were finally released on CD they were completely butchered from their original states!! They kept the original vocals but replaced the original music with contemporary crap and it sounded very awkward and horrible. They teamed him up with artist he never met or knew (like that idiot Eminem) and basically ruined songs that were masterpieces. IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT!!    A lot of songs on here don't sound like MJ's flavor particularly \\"Monster\\" (50 Cent? someone kill me please! They teamed the greatest with the worst) and \\"Hollywood.\\" The music doesn't sound like something he would condone as it sounds like production from amateurs. This album makes \\"Invincible\\" sound like \\"Thriller\\" in my eyes as far as production because here it sounds so mediocre. There is even reason to believe that MJ isn't even on some of these songs!!! Because of this half-ass effort from Sony people can relish in the \\"Invincible\\" album, which is very under rated in my opinion and with time will age like wine. Someone like my mother, who loves MJ, would listen to this album and say, \\"This is Michael? Doesn't sound like it.\\" Even I could produce a better album than this!! If i were in charge of this album, i would have gotten Babyface, Jimmy Jam, L.A. Reid, Timbaland, or another legendary R & B producer on the boards. Sony has the power, they just went cheap on this.      That's not to say that there aren't a couple of good songs. The album ends strong with the last two songs being the best of the new offerings I reallylike the song \\"I Can't Wait Another Day\\" with Lenny Kravitz and \\"Behind the Mask\\". That is the MJ we know and love right there. \\"Hold My Hand\\" is okay too but I had to get use to hearing Akon because ultimately it sounds like an Akon song, not an MJ song. Overall this album is a disappointment because of Sony. It really hurts me because I want to support MJ and show these talentless and disrespectful low life rappers like Lil' Wayne and Eminem that MJ is still number one but this album isn't worth buying. I shouldn't have to buy an album out of principle; I should be buying it because I actually like the songs!! I recommend previewing it first or downloading only the songs you like. Me, I'm buying \\"Thriller\\" again instead, upgrading to the remastered edition so I can boost his record for greatest selling album of all time. The best thing about this album is the cover and the song with Lenny Kravitz. I miss you Michael...and screw Sony!!
030746363X|5.0|I got an advance copy of this book and am already loving it!    Something here for everybody. It is a monster-tome of a book, but the author says to just read the first two chapters as a foundation (super exciting in themselves), and then just pick and choose what immediate subjects interest you most. Highlights for me included:    \\"Building the Perfect Posterior\\" - all with less than an hour per WEEK. (Intense, but convenient on the schedule). Mainly a chapter with women examples. My girlfriend is super excited about building more of a bubble-butt with this.    15 minute guaranteed female orgasm. Obviously her and I both are excited to read this chapter together.    Tripling male testosterone with a few super simple things to incorporate into my diet. Can do.    Funny as hell to read as well.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|the cd is amazing, i would have given it 4 or maybe even three stars if my review included the case quality (there where A LOT of scratches on the front and back even though it was new and in packaging)but im not going to be the idiot that ruins this band's reputation. only 1 more a7x cd to complete my collection. RIP The Rev, you will continue to be missed
030746363X|5.0|Well, I have had the book now for less than 12 hours and already, I am loving it!  The ideas in this book are simple, they don't require a lot of work or being 100% healthy all of the time.  It is about living our lives, but focusing on just a few things that really make the difference - the 2.5% that make up 95% of the results.    Love it and absolutely suggest it for anyone who is looking to feel better, who is done with fad diets, who wants real results!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|first it has the epic cover for the case then the cd is amazing, only 1 more a7x cd to complete my collection
6300208591|5.0|This film represents Fellini at the pinnacle of his success.  8 1/2 is autobiographical and considered the companion piece to this film.  The main character is caught up in a web of late nights and early dawns, and there is much symbolism within to ponder.  Anita Ekberg's performance and parody of herself is worth the price of admission.  The video was in good condition and plays beautifully as well!
030746363X|5.0|A few months ago I attended a BIG fitness event in Austin TX, where I excitedly met Tim Ferriss, the author of one of my favorite books (and probably one of yours!), \\"The 4 Hour Work Week\\".    As you'd expect, Tim is a great guy and a sharp individual, so when he told me all of the unusually odd fat loss and fitness tips he was working on for his NEW book, including this new method of dieting he was using that had folks losing up to 20 pounds in 1 month with NO exercise, you would imagine I became VERY interested...    Luckily I was able to pin Tim down for an interview and forced him to spill the beans about many of these unique fat loss tricks he is revealing in his NEW book (just released TODAY!), \\"The 4 Hour Body\\".    Head over to my site here for the interview... [...]    In \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" YOU WILL LEARN (in less than 30 minutes each):        * How to lose those last 5-10 pounds (or 100+ pounds) with odd combinations of food and safe chemical cocktails.      * How to prevent fat gain while bingeing (X-mas, holidays, weekends)      * How to increase fat-loss 300% with a few bags of ice      * How Tim gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, without steroids, and in four hours of total gym time      * How to sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested      * How to reverse \\"permanent\\" injuries      * How to add 150+ pounds to your lifts in 6 months      * How to pay for a beach vacation with one hospital visit    And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  There are more than 50 topics covered, all with real-world experiments, many including more than 200 test subjects...    You know that I share a lot of resources with you that can help you get and stay lean, strong and healthy, but rarely do I insist... well, this time I insist... GET THIS BOOK!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|There is nothing new with the story of this movie. It's simple. But the way it was done is mind blowing. The 16 minutes extra scenes is worth it. I was actually jerking my feet and hands in a lot of scenes in reaction to the movie. Really awesome bluray. Must buy even if you are not a sci-fi fan.
B00004BZ16|5.0|December 12, 1980: The morning after the historic release by The Clash of that out-of-the-park grand slam called London Calling at the fag-end of 1979, a bargain-priced double-LP in which \\"the only band that matters\\" from UK punk's Class of '77 stretched out and into an at least half-dozen further genres (rockabilly, roots rock, reggae, ska, calypso, honky-tonk, rhythm-and-blues) because they could and knew it, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, and Topper Headon must have asked themselves, Wot now for a bleedin' encore, lads? before decamping to NYC, land of historic ballparks, the better for yet another pointing-armed Bambino swing for the fences - where London Calling ran to 18 songs (19 with the unbilled closer \\"Train in Vain\\", a favorite of many a fan), Sandinista! saw them and doubled them to 36.    Though the stuffed-to-burst trifection - on the aptly-labeled CBS offshoot, Epic - did, like its deathless lead-in a year prior, top the annual \\"Pazz and Jop\\" critics' poll at the Village Voice two months after its December 12 release (though with three-eighths fewer distributed, proportionally-represented votes), much of the critical consensus ever since was summed in the thumbnail review penned by the paper's greybeard rock critic Robert Christgau, who in his monthly Consumer Guide roundup dropped The Clash from the A+ he gave London Calling down to an A-minus:    \\"...note...that the many good songs aren't as consistently compelling as on previous Clash albums...and conclude that if this is their worst--which it is, I think--they must be, er, the world's greatest rock and roll band.\\"    From the first track, \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", a driving bass-fueled forward-marching rap cut, the band's determination to claim yet more generic territory was plain and not in vain, as was Strummer's immersion then and there in the early works issuing from the then-new rap genre of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and The Sugar Hill Gang. The song stands as the firstexposure of the mainstream rock audience to rap, and in its spoofing of wage-slaving consumerism on levels both serious and playful, has served countless Clash fans as the Platonic jolt of audio caffeine with which to greet each new day bidding them shuffle their sleepy way toward the Man's punch-clock:    Ring ring! Seven AM  Move yourself to go again  Cold water in the face  Brings you back to this awful place  Knuckle merchants and you bankers too  Must get out there and learn those rules  Weather man and the crazy chief  One says sun and one says sleet  AM the FM the PM too  Churnin' out that boogaloo    In training their trademark lyrical obsessions upon the worldwide subordinations of class and race, with the aid of their love of the larger-than-life imagery of the Hollywood western, the Jamaican outlaw mystique and the boasting royalism of calyp-synched nomenclature (all hail Lord Strummer!), the band became the sonic CNN of the early 1980s, exulting in the recent and externally-unmolested Nicaraguan revolution of the year before, and scoring along the way imperialisms western and Soviet (\\"Washington Bullets\\"), the stubborn longevity of English class prejudice (\\"Something About England\\", a likely seedbed for Mick Jones' stirring immigrant-friendly anthem \\"Beyond the Pale\\" off No. 10, Upping St. when later fronting Big Audio Dynamite),    There was masters an' servants an' servants an' dogs  They taught you how to touch your cap  Through strikes and famine and war and peace  England never closed this gap    the squalid murder of hope of council-block housing (\\"Up in Heaven [Not Only Here]\\"), police brutality in the inner city (\\"Corner Soul\\" and \\"Police on My Back\\", the latter an Eddy Grant cover), the devaluation of individual life by street criminals (\\"Somebody Got Murdered\\"), the cold hypocrisies of the holyroller-than-thou (\\"The Sound of the Sinners\\", a respectful gospel parody), and America's nightmare history with race (\\"One More Time\\"):    Yeah, you don't need no silicone  To calculate poverty  Watch when Watts town burns again  The bus goes to Montgomery    By now, Joe Strummer was, in his family-of-man decency, well on his way to becoming \\"the George Orwell of rock, a delicate mix of unforgiving skepticism for both sides and honest empathy for the downtrodden.\\" And along with the globe-girdling scenes of social struggle of the sort that had marked like songs on London Calling, came a newer warmth of tone audible in each of the songs just mentioned, deepening the emotional range of a band that had just a year before, on an album projecting exhilarating defiance on the public face of a quartet of implacable world-conquering centurions on the march, managed to carry its softer domestic habits of the political heart fairly well concealed (\\"Guns of Brixton\\" was not exactly Music to Tickle Baby's Chin By). In a like vein, the injection on several tracks (\\"Hitsville UK\\", \\"Corner Soul\\") of vocal estrogen courtesy Mick Jones' then-partner Ellen Foley, previously best known for backing vocals on \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\" by Meat Loaf, and later for such among her Hollywood roles as Billie on Night Court, does have the otherwise-rare effect of rendering a band best thought of hitherto as deserving of comradely fraternal handshakes, or perhaps, after a Red wine or three, Brezhnev-meets-Honecker cheekpecks, positively squeezeworthy.    The divers genre-bending bonfires of the novelties across Sandinista!, from dub to disco to jazz, do vary as much as the album-cubed's reputation well indicates, and there will always be across its three dozen tracks lulls in relative affection, from Jamaican dub star Mikey Dread's interstitial*    *[And indecipherable, as on, e.g., \\"The Crooked Beat\\":    \\"I had always wondered who the dog, Weinstein was.\\"    \\"And why they named a lane after him.\\"]    singsong rasps to Paul Simonon's monotone trudge through what some have thought of as the aptly- if \\"unwittily\\"-named track \\"The CrookedBeat\\", when even the most bunkered Clashman and his dragon will echo as one Joe's cry toward the end of \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" - \\"It's [...]' long, innit?\\"    But no matter. Whether or not it was your sprawling intro to the band, as it was for me 29 years ago next March on the Michigan-to-Manhattan spring break of a life-changing-time, Sandinista! has had a way for thirty years as of Sunday of, in one way or another, becoming an event in the lives of all of its listeners, however much we might, er, Clash among ourselves on all other matters nonmusical, calling to indelible memory where we were at the time and what we were about, scratch our heads bald though we might as to the whys and the wherefores.    Not bad for a foursome that, the year before, when not otherwise engaged making musical history, was getting nicked for shooting pigeons on London rooftops. And though Joe may have met \\"Death\\" far too soon, he and his, er, Clashmates managed to leave the rest of us enough \\"Glory\\" to slip all risk of wearing out its groove this side of Rock and Roll Heaven - and the Vinyl Judgment.
0141036257|4.0|The book I received was pretty much like new with a bit of wear on the back cover...nothing that concerned me greatly as overall it was in great condition. Outliers is a great book! Gladwell is a great writer. I recommend the book to anyone as I think anyone can be motivated by the examples and the concepts presented by Malcolm Gladwell.
B000YGFGD6|5.0|This DVD is one of Michael Jackson's best performances and I rate it more than 5 stars. I remember watching Moonwalker on VHS with my son when he was about 6 years old and he is now 22, and we still love it. Thanks Amazon.com for having this item for purchase.  We Lost the VHS copy and was devastated. Now we are enjoying this DVD even the more.
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|I'm not big on writing reviews, so I'll keep this short.  Where most zombie movies dissolve in to \\"campiness\\", Walking Dead uses them to show what makes us human.  Each episode treats zombies not only as a threat but also as the dead, and by that I mean, we, as humans, have a need to respect the departed.  We need to reconcile what we've lost with how can we survive.  This show illuminates that struggle, some characters succeed, and some fail but it's all good.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|Finally, a teen movie made today that's funny, intelligent and makes all those 80s teen movies look quiet lame.    For some reason Hollywood struggles when it comes to handling a teen movie. Screenwriters seem to think that keeping things on a dumb-downed level is a way to make them. You know, those where you don't need to worry about your brain being injured with some engaging and brisk dialog.    Well, \\"Easy A\\" fixes that gap and interestingly, Emma Stone's character had pretty much all the lines and she delivered them without skipping a beat. Would not be surprised if some of those lines you'll hear again and again.    This is an entertaining movie. The only reservation I have is that I think toward the end I would have liked to see the more unconventional ending (thus 4 stars) but instead, it felt like a cookie-cutter kind of resolution.    P.S. Why out of so many possible last names for Olive, they went with 'Penderghast'? Anyone?   I have a weird association with this last name after reading some of the Preston and Child novels with the special agent Penderghast (or maybe Pendergast?)
1449389627|5.0|[Disclaimer: I got this book for free as part of the Oreilly blogger review program]<br /><br />If you are keen observer of speeches given by CEO's or anyone from upper management in your organization, the word \\"innovation\\" will come out often. But whether, the real meaning of the word \\"innovation\\" is understood or not is a different story, and this is the central theme of \\"The Myths of Innovation\\" book.<br /><br />The Myths of Innovation starts from the history of innovation and takes the readers through the fundamentals, methods of innovation, human side of innovation, that is how people will receive any new ideas and how to be successful in reaching out.<br /><br />Author also debunks the idea of one super man or woman creates something really good and saves the world every innovation is the combination of existing ideas but seen differently buy an innovator and when the puzzle fits together, new solutions emerge.<br /><br />The second part of the book concentrates on the myth of boss knows everything. But  the truth is no one can think through that much in future. Management concentrates on controlling and getting the job done, and one cannot innovate in such an environment. This point is very loud and clear, if your organization wants to encourage workers to identify problems and find innovative solutions then, this type of command and control management style will not work.<br /><br />This book also goes in-depth on why certain ideas flourish and easily adopted but others fail. The key here is, instead of changing the status quo, if the innovative solution builds on top of what people already know, adoption will be much faster. Example, mobile phones. People were already using telephones and cordless. The learning curve to use a mobile phone is also pretty straight forward, this lead to their adoption a great success.<br /><br />Then there is problem and solution.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|The problem with many (most?) contemporary-artist Christmas albums is that the artists just pump out a collection of Christmas standards in order to have one--there's seldom any real artistry involved. They may sing perkier, up the tempo, or add instrumentation (all well-covered by Anne Murray in the '70s and Amy Grant in the the '80s), but there's little to distinguish them above the many fine recordings of those same songs from the '60s, '50s, and earlier. One notable exception is this album by Sarah McLachlan (released in 2008), which includes standards, one original piece, and some contemporary covers (including some unexpected choices).    Among the standards, \\"What Child Is This?\\" is particularly well-refreshed, with decending minor chord progressions in the verses (as opposed to the original ascending major chord progressions) and smaller variations in the chorus, both of which are strikingly beautiful and flattering of Sarah McLachlan's atypical vocalization. \\"The First Noel\\" is given a similarly-original treatment, again to very pleasing effect. The other standards (I'll Be Home for Christmas, O Little Town of Bethlehem, Silent Night, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, In the Bleak Midwinter, Christmas Time Is Here) are closer to the traditional arrangements, but with tempo variations and vocal arrangements that make them sound equally fresh and enchanting.    The original contribution, the title cut \\"Wintersong,\\" is more of a winter-themed love song rather than a Christmas tune, but is pleasant-sounding and sufficiently sentimental to fit in well on this album.    Of the contemporary covers, \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" is presented pretty much as John Lennon originally recorded it (though I find Sarah's voice easier to listen to); if you liked the original, you'll like this rendition. One unexpected selection is an updated version of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" (since included on other contemporary Christmas albums); the connection to Christmas is rather oblique (references to skating on a frozen river; what's next, a cover of Jethro Tull's \\"Skating Away\\"?), but if you like the song, you'll appreciate this arrangement.    Of greater interest in the realm of the unexpected (at least to me) is the hauntingly beautiful presentation of Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Song For a Winter's Night\\" (from the '70s, for those of you who aren't old enough to have heard the original). I had never thought of this as a Christmas song (nor is it any more so than \\"Wintersong\\"), but this track about brings me to tears every time I hear it, so I'm so glad it's on this album! It's also heartening to me that Sarah McLachlan would think to include such a tender, well-rendered tribute to a fellow Canadian singer-songwriter from an earlier era. Do yourself a favor, and listen to the original for comparison [...]
B00007KWHG|2.0|After watching Jersey Boys and listening to the original cast CD I decided to try the original tracts. Great music but this CD is what gives CDs a bad name in audiophile circles. Bright (and not in a good way) glaring sound with hard left-right mixing of channels. Pretty unlistenable. I cannot imagine the original pressings sounded this bad. Rhino should be ashamed of themselves. This disc will probably not sound too bad on most audio systems but on a high resolution system ear plugs are recommended.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought this with the idea that my wife and I could enjoy some HiDef video of our planet and its oddities and beauty. When our grandchildren (ages 6&9) showed up in the middle of watching the Caves episode, they sat down and watched with us. Then they wanted to watch the Deserts episode. Two weeks later we are taking them to the Lost Sea (a cave with a large lake in it) at their request. Bottom line for us was my grandkids were learning more about the world around them (getting an education) and loving it! Great price and quick delivery from Amazon.
0553381687|5.0|I won't bother to repeat what all the other reviews say. They are right. The book is great.<br /><br />I resisted reading these books for years. Why? Because I don't like floofy doofy magic and armor books. Give me historical fiction, gritty crime or comedy. Maybe even a little sci-fi. But not fantasy.<br /><br />This one is the exception. I got pulled into this book and didn't escape until the last page was turned. So do yourself a favor and read it, even if you don't like this sort of thing.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|When we tried to see this, every showing was sold out -except for the very last one of the evening. So we bought our tickets, strolled around a mall, and waited eagerly to view the film. It was worth the wait even though the movie had some significant flaws (more about that soon). I do understand why Natalie Portman has gotten much acclaim for her role as Nina, a young ballerina who seems to be on the rise to stardom. She might even win an Oscar for her performance. The role is extremely demanding and it is clear that she worked hard to get her body to fit the part, looking particularly thin (as many ballerinas do, almost anorexic). She also stretched her acting chops and took significant risks, including some fairly graphic sexual scenes as well as a believable depiction of a young woman with an unhinged mind.<br /><br />However, I felt very ambivalent about this film and wasn't the only one. Audiences leaving the theater were either talking positively about the film or giving it a thumbs down. Portman is superb when revealing how she tries to dig deeply within herself to portray both the White and Black Swan. The part of the White Swan comes easily to her but the darker, riskier role of the Black Swan taxes her emotionally. Nina is assured that she has the moves of an experienced ballerina. But she is criticized by the ballet company's director for her inability to bring passion to the role of the Black Swan.<br /><br />Dance fans will find a wealth of stunning choreography and insight into some parts of the world of ballet. Even those who aren't fond of ballet should be entranced by the dance scenes. I certainly was. But there seemed to be too many stereotypes. Barbara Hershey is usually a reliable actress but she seems to be off kilter here, being the overprotective mother. Nina's desire to be \\"perfect\\" resonates beyond the movie and serves as a reminder of how dancers often turn to self-destructive acts to stay in shape - throwing up, being anorexic or bulemic and more. In that regard, Nina could be at an extreme end of a spectrum of mental illness that may be all too prevalent in the dance world...although not as over the top as Nina (or let's hope not).<br /><br />Suspense is definitely created during scenes when it is hard to separate Nina's truth from fantasy. What is Nina actually seeing and what is an illusion? In some parts of the movie it is clear that she is hallucinating...in others, not so much so. In the end, I couldn't quite buy this as a psychological drama but thought it veered closer to a horror movie. Parts of this film were extremely painful to watch and if you have trouble watching someone in physical pain, including plenty of blood, consider yourself forewarned. There were plenty of gasps and moans from the audience during the particularly gruesome scenes.<br /><br />In the end, I couldn't help wondering: will this movie stand the test of time? Odds are high that viewers will always be entranced by the very lovely Natalie Portman. But will the movie's theme and plot development seem credible during repeat viewings? Only time will tell whether this becomes a classic dance and psychological/horror film or simply a temporary sensation.that regard, Nina could be at an extreme end of a spectrum of mental illness that may be all too prevalent in the dance world...although not as over the top as Nina (or let's hope not).

There is one limitation about turning objection in the game , that you have to switch back to the PS3 controller for, but I see it as a minor inconvience.  If you want to play console FPS games like a PC this is what you want.  It works as advertised and then some...buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
030746363X|5.0|Tim's writing style is distinct. WIth a matter-of-fact way of explaining, each chapter begins with a story introducing the subject through Tim's own experimentation and examples from test subjects that have shown the desired results. This works well if you are dipping in and out of chapters, as is recommended. Indeed, this method of reading is ideal if you are looking to get quick results and experiment with the methods laid out. However, this results in rather anecdotal evidence unless you decide to drill down further into the science which is more often than not provided in sufficient detail.    That said, make sure you read with a healthy level of skepticism. Tim is not a doctor but his claims are supported in the best possible way - experimental evidence. Of course, this is limited to Tim's personal experience and that of a handful of test subjects but the types of things explained in the book lend themselves to quick and easy experimentation for oneself. This means you can easily find out if the tips and tricks actually work.    This is a great complement to other more medically detailed books such as the Protein Power Plan (although there are some contradictory statements that would need to be tried and tested on a personal level). It is a fun read that provides a great way to make some large and some small changes to improve your overall health. The book itself is a lot thicker than I was expecting and contains more than enough content inside the book and through online links.    Bare in mind that links to products or medical tests may not be available or relevant outside the US. This is not unique to this book.    It is certainly a title that I'll look forward to updated versions of as readers report success (or failure).

0688172377|5.0|The very moving story of the horrors Waris went through as a girl is amazing.  No one knows poverty and deprivation like a Nomad woman! It's been many years since I first read this book and I still think of the physical and mental hardships she endured. Next time you're in line at Starbucks, think of Waris and all the day to day things we have the privilege to take for granted.  This should be mandatory reading for all.  The authors, Waris Dirie and Cathleen Miller, vividly bring the story to life.     This book led me to purchase other books by Cathleen Miller.  I loved, \\"The Birdhouse Chronicles: Surviving The Joys of Country Life.\\"
0316077054|5.0|Beautiful Darkness is the highly anticipated sequel to Beautiful Creatures by Kami Garcia & Margaret Stohl.  When I read Beautiful Creatures last year, I had mixed feelings about it.  I loved the Southern setting and the gothic atmosphere.  I loved that it was a paranormal romance told from a boy's point of view.  I loved how Lena was constantly writing on her hand as she counted down to  her dreaded sixteenth birthday.  I cared about the characters and I wanted things to work out for them.  However, the end of the book left me feeling a little flat.  I felt like, in a way, the characters were right back to where they started, and that so many questions had been left unanswered, particularly when it came to Ethan's mom and her connection to the Caster world.  I worried that the sequel would end up being more of the same, counting down to her seventeenth birthday this time.     I was pleased to discover that Beautiful Darkness answered many of the questions that I had after reading the first book.  We learn more about Ethan's mother, Lila Wate, as well as Macon Ravenwood, and what really happened the night of Lena's birthday.  Secondary characters like Link and Ridley become more prominent (which makes me happy), and new characters are introduced who stir things up a little.  The ending of this book left me feeling much more satisfied (although, since this is only the second of four planned novels, don't expect things to come to too much of a conclusion).     If you are a fan of this series, then this book will not disappoint.  If you, like me, were left feeling a little underwhelmed by how the first novel ended, I would urge you to give the sequel a try and see if it might change your mind, because I am officially hooked.

B004FEWYXS|3.0|Big fan, I love all his albums, but this just sounds like straight up b-sides.  It's definitely okay and enjoyable straight through, but despite some higher points the album fly's pretty low the entire time.  I think there is a reason this material was never released while Michael was alive and that reason is that it's a far cry from his \\"a\\" game.  If you're a fan like me you'll enjoy it, but it's not converting anyone, and it's definitely not adding anything (or detracting from) his musical legacy.  It's really just okay.
0740797719|5.0|It answer me all the questions other books had let me open. Some things i figure out on my own with practices, but wasnt sure if i was right or wrong. Like if light saturated colors, for an example, or how light actually works, what color should be the best for underpainting. And tons of practical things i didnt knew.    Been working in comic books for the past 7 years, and because i was a self tought , there were lots of things i didnt knew, even a friend of mine that has been a painter for 12 years, there were some concepts he didnt knew, and many things that the school teach them but never told why?    Been tired of books that tell you HOW? This is a book that tell you WHY?, and thats the real question that you need to figure out to become a great artist.

B00192IV9U|3.0|Foreword<br /><br />The Noughties were a sad and strange decade for the King of Pop. Bookended with two extravagant artistic endeavors- the release of his tenth album `Invincible' in 2001 & the announcement and run into what would have been the `This Is It' comeback residency in London- 50 record breaking sold out shows beginning on 13th July 2009. For the most of the decade MJ did not release any new music nor perform any shows. This was partly enforced by his court trial and recovery from it, but also due to his monetary problems and continued need to secure financial backing from outside sources. Of course we now know the greatest entertainer who ever lived also had a very serious drug problem.<br /><br />One thing that was clear over the last eight years of MJ's life- despite the absence of a new album he continued to write & record music right up to and including the time of rehearsals for This Is It. Most notably with Black Eyed Peas head honcho will.i.am in Las Vegas & Ireland circa 2007. In interviews of the time the pair spoke of their aims for the collaboration and Will, of how the material sounded like an `Off The Wall for the new century'. It's worth noting that Michael was never one to release anything less than what he viewed as perfect. Unlike his most notable contemporary- Prince who adopts a much less constricted mindset and continues to release 10 x the amount of music that MJ did. Of course it was this type of restraint & artistic focus that had a part in creating Michael's legend and made his album releases landmark global events.<br /><br />After the below par performance of `Invincible' in the west (partly due to Sony not supporting it, partly due to a decrease in MJ's US fanbase) the follow up would have to be no less than a masterpiece. Not only that but in typical MJ style; - its arrival bigger and more extravagant than what had gone before. Unfortunately that day never came. Following Michael's death he once again became the highest selling recording artist of the year and went on to sell a staggering 35 million albums worldwide in the 12 months after his passing. In light of this Sony struck a deal with the Jackson estate paying them a record breaking 250 million dollars to retain the distribution rights to MJ's music and together with the estate periodically release 10 new projects including compilations of previously unheard material up until 2017.<br /><br />Aside from the tragedy of the world losing an artistic visionary, musical genius and an often misunderstood but gentle soul who cared about the preservation of the planet, Michael's passing could not have come at a worse time. This Is It did not make the opening night yet it would appear from the film he was in good form and that the gloved one combined with the OTT stage show would have made for something truly spectacular. Whether or not he was in good enough shape to complete 50 shows is another matter. The concerts would likely have been followed by a new album which at the time of the singer's death fans had already been patiently waiting eight years for.<br /><br />It was not to be but MJ did leave behind recordings of many new songs in various states of completion - some of which would have been used for that 11th album. For the release of `Michael' the Jackson estate and Sony worked together to compile an album of material ranging in vintage from 1981-2009, claiming fans would `hear the songs he most recently created along with tracks that Michael had a desire to bring to fruition.' Various musicians were hired to perform on some of the unfinished songs and the final mix was executed by longtime MJ collaborator Teddy Riley. At long last, the album that never was is finally here... or is it?<br /><br />Review<br /><br />Hold My Hand (Duet with Akon) (3:34)<br />Written by Aliaune Thiam, Giorgio Tuinfort, Claude Kelly<br />Produced by Akon, Giorgio Tuinfort & Michael Jackson<br /><br />Originally recorded in Las Vegas circa 2008 with theintention to be included on Akon's then upcoming album `Freedom', HMH was leaked to the internet the same year. The estate now tell us MJ actually intended this song to be the lead single for his next studio album. Whatever the case HMH is a laid back anthem with a simple message of love, unity and peace. Essentially a sing-along ballad intended for mass appeal which despite being a duet actually features more of Akon than MJ with the only lead vocals from Michael being the first verse. Despite MJ taking the backseat to Akon this dynamic actually works quite well. Akon went into the studio late this year to finish up vocals on this new version and the track climaxes with a choir sung chorus & hand claps. 8/10<br /><br />Hollywood Tonight (4:31)<br />Written by Michael Jackson, Brad Buxer/Spoken Bridge Written by Teddy Riley<br />Produced by Teddy Riley, Michael Jackson/Co-Produced by Theron \\"Neff-U\\" Feemster<br /><br />Invincible leftover the estate claim MJ resurrected in 2007 to work on again. This one's a banger that demands you blast your speakers and is all about a girl who leaves behind humble origins to pursue dreams of stardom in Tinseltown. HT starts off with MJ beatboxing prior to delivering the first verse- `Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned, in her painted on jeans. She dreams of fame, She changed her name, To one that fits the movie screen - She's headed for the big time, that means...' then it's straight into a huge chorus that upon first listen becomes ingrained in your head. It all sounds great but in the absence of a bridge after the second chorus the song loses momentum and to fill the gap we get a spoken bridge by Riley that comes off slightly camp and ultimately detracts from the songs impact. Instead of the spoken bridge HT would have worked much better with a rap section. Clearly an unfinished track that shouldn't be on here, despite this it's still quite good and contains some of the old magic. 7/10<br /><br />Keep Your Head Up (4:52)<br />Allegedly Written by Michael Jackson, Eddie Cascio, James Porte<br />Produced by C \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, Angelikson, and allegedly Michael Jackson<br /><br />In the 1980's Dominic Cascio worked at regular Michael Jackson haunt the New York Palace Hotel managing apartment suites. Upon meeting Dominic, MJ enquired if he was married, if he had any kids and that he would love to meet them. This encounter created a secret 25 year friendship between MJ and the Cascio family where MJ would often visit the Cascios whenever near their home in New Jersey, referring to them as his second family. In 2007 MJ stayed over at the Cascio home as he often did, and it was reported he was recording at their home studio. Fast fwd to the days following the 25/6/09 and the Cascios registered a number of songs as the work of Michael Jackson. Let's get straight to the point here- THE LEAD VOCALS ON THIS SONG AND THE TWO OTHER CASCIO SONGS ARE NOT MICHAEL JACKSON. Instead the Cascios, the estate or Sony hired an imitator to sing on these songs as at the time of his passing, as one can only assume most, if not all of these songs he allegedly recorded with the Cascio's in 2007 did not feature vocals. Obviously done so the Cascios can profit & the estate / Sony can release as many `Michael Jackson albums' as possible by mixing genuine tracks with fakes. Here's an entry from Taryll Jackson's (MJ's nephew) Twitter page on Tuesday 7th December 2010--- \\"I remember when Teddy and I were at Encore listening to KYHU. We both knew it wasn't my Uncle. He stopped working on it because (and I quote) \\"it didn't sound enough like Michael. Michael doesn't swing like that.\\" He also said he was only working on the Cascio records in hopes that he would eventually be given a \\"real Michael Jackson song.\\" As he knows, I never agreed with that logic. I'll never forget when Teddy called me telling me, \\"I'm so excited, I finally got a 'Michael record.' It's called Hollywood Tonight and it's him.\\" ---There's nothing you canreally say about this situation except that it's a travesty that those in control of MJ's estate only care about money. Some fans will choose to believe that the Cascio tracks are in fact MJ, but they obviously don't know his voice well enough. Even the best MJ impersonator and likely guilty party here- Jason Malachi cannot fool the real fans. No one can sing exactly like MJ except the man himself. What is it the kids say these days... EPIC FAIL. 0/10<br /><br />(I Like) The Way You Love Me (4:35)<br />Written by Michael Jackson<br />Produced by Theron \\"Neff-U\\" Feemster, Michael Jackson<br /><br />Originally appearing on 2004's The Ultimate Collection in demo form, this version of the TWYLM sounds complete and features more instrumentation inc piano & flute and beefed up backing vocals. The demo was great but this new finished version is sublime and sounds finished. As such this is perhaps one of the rare occasions on `Michael' were the studio effects and wizardry of the producer, in this case- Neff-U, have made a considerable difference for the better and transformed a demo into a fully realized song without losing the demos original impact and flavour. A lot of this is probably due to the demo vocals being mostly complete. One of the albums standout tracks- a sweet, understated, romantic masterpiece. 10/10<br /><br />Monster (Ft. 50 Cent & Orianthi) (5:06)<br />Allegedly written by Michael Jackson, Eddie Cascio, James Porte/Rap Lyrics Written by Curtis Jackson<br />Produced by Teddy Riley, Angelikson, and Michael Jackson, allegedly<br /><br />Another Cascio penned abomination ft. the vocals of an impersonator Sony would have you believe is Michael Jackson. It sounds like a Lady Gaga cast off and the whole thing is a mess. The vocal impersonation is not even close this time- it's clearly not MJ and sounds EXACTLY like Jason Malachi- see youtube. 50 Cent is crap here and as `MJ' returns he sings `Why did you take it, why did you fake it' why indeed. Finally fans of guitar goddess Orianthi who hoped to hear her shredding a Beat It style solo on `Michael' are left scratching their heads as her contribution to the end of the song is mixed so low she is barely audible. Embarrassing for all parties involved, except of course the impersonator who got paid and remains anonymous. 0/10<br /><br />Best of Joy (3:03)<br />Written by Michael Jackson<br />Produced by Theron \\"Neff-U\\" Feemster, Michael Jackson<br />Co-Produced by Brad Buxer<br /><br />One of MJ's final recordings which he planned to continue work on in the summer of 2009 whilst in London for This Is It and debut during the shows. In light of this and the quality of the song itself, this is undoubtedly the albums most potent track. Some rumors suggest that in his final years MJ intended to move away from writing angry songs that focused on his frustrations and more towards tracks that simply expressed the joy of music like this one. You wonder how many complete vocal tracks MJ left behind from his final years. Assuming there is more than just Best of Joy, had the estate put out an album of material solely recorded in last few years and in this vein we'd possibly be listening to the greatest Michael Jackson album ever right now. Vocally, when you put this next to the Cascio songs there is just no comparison;- it's like trying to pass off a chocolate coin wrapper as solid gold. Pure MJ magic. 10/10<br /><br />Breaking News (4:15)<br />Allegedly Written by Michael Jackson, Eddie Cascio, James Porte<br />Produced by Teddy Riley, Angelikson, allegedly Michael Jackson<br /><br />This was the first track from `Michael' to be streamed online. Monday 8th November was the day the s**t hit the fan. Prior to the song going live members within the Jackson family claimed some of the tracks on the album were not sung by MJ and instead featured the vocals of an impersonator but no one in the fan community really took them seriously. Once the song was posted it became clear we were not hearing the voice of MJ and the Jacksons were telling the truth. In contrast to the other two fakes, these lyrics actually sound a lot like something MJ would have written and musically the songs falls within familiar New Jack Swing territory. The vocal trickery is more cunning here;- the lead vocal is sung by the impersonator- most say Jason Malachi, some James Porte, whoever it is it's not Michael Jackson. But real MJ vocals in the form of breaths and ad libs from previous albums have been cut and pasted in amongst the main vocal in an attempt to trick the listener. What we are left with is a song that is clearly not sung by MJ, but not only that- sounds strangely synthetic and overly processed. Additionally the production is uninspired and it sounds like there is a glitch at 0:44. The song itself is not bad and the best of the three fakes. Had MJ actually recorded this he would have made it 10x better but as this is not him the song is worthless and should not be included. We know they are lying about who is singing these songs, so why should we even believe that MJ wrote them unless they can produce hand written lyric sheets which can then be verified by independent forensic handwriting experts? These songs were not registered until after the singer's death so it's possible that they were entirely written / recorded after his passing.<br />0/10<br /><br />(I Can't Make It) Another Day (3:55)<br />Written by Lenny Kravitz<br />Produced by Lenny Kravitz<br />Co-Produced by Michael Jackson<br /><br />Invincible leftover that leaked in January of this year. Written by Lenny Kravitz AD is a rock track about MJ's relationship with god, tho it can be interpreted in more than one way. Lenny re-recorded a more subdued take on the song with Jay Z entitled `Storm' which appeared on his 2004 album Baptism, needless it does not compare to the MJ version. This year Lenny headed back into the studio to finish the song adding new guitars, drums & vocals. It was clear upon first listen back in January that AD was a great song, but sadly this final version is not as good as the original. The funk styled Bass lines on the verse sections are good but the new guitar parts on the chorus detract from its impact and the riff sounds like it is ripped off from Led Zepp's `Moby Dick'. This aside, the power and quality of the song still shine through and AD stands as a modern MJ classic. 9/10<br /><br />Behind The Mask (5:03)<br />Written by Michael Jackson, Chris Mosdell, Ryuichi Sakamoto<br />Produced by Michael Jackson, John McClain<br /><br />Originally appearing on Yellow Magic Orchestra's 1979 album Sold State Survivor, BTM is a cute Electropop track ft. robot vocals and cryptic lyrics. During the Thriller sessions MJ recorded a new version of the song with extra lyrics he had written about a two timing woman but legal difficulties prevented the songs release. Gregg Phillinganes (MJ/Eric Clapton keyboards) released a cover of the MJ version on his 1985 album `Pulse' and later Eric Clapton released the second cover of the MJ version on his 1986 album `August'. Here for the first time the original MJ version is unveiled with an updated sound that retains a 1980's flavour (robot vocals/saxophone) while still sounding current. The track begins with crowd chants of -Michael- from the live broadcast Bucharest date of the Dangerous world tour on October 1st 1992. The crowd sounds bring a nice ambience to the start of the track, but when they return later on as MJ interacts with the audience they are unnecessary and spoil the song a little. Overall this is a pretty good but of the 7 genuine tracks this is the weakest and there's no way MJ would have released this on a future album. 6/10<br /><br />Much Too Soon (2:49)<br />Written by Michael Jackson<br />Produced by Michael Jackson, John McClain<br /><br />Ending on a Thriller outtake, Much Too Soon is a tender acoustic ballad ft. a string section, accordion and gentle backing vocals. Coming in at under three minutes this one is short and sweet. On MTS the introspective/sensitive side of MJ's personality is on display similar to She's Out of My Life. Like BOF & TWYLM this one is another beautiful track but one minor complaint is that at 1:58 a slight crackle can be detected which really should have been removed and suggests a lazy production job. 8/10<br /><br />So what are we actually getting here? The answer is- 2 new songs, 2 Invincible leftovers, 1 previously released song, 2 Thriller era leftovers and 3 songs that feature the vocals of an impersonator. Are we to really believe that MJ was at one point working on this set of tracks as his next studio album? This is what the estate are telling us in the `Michael' press release, but since they are also telling us it's The King of Pop who is singing on the three Cascio tracks I think this can be safely dismissed as fantasy. It was well known that it his final years MJ had been working with modern day Pop/R&B hitmakers such as Akon, Neyo & will.i.am and was always re-iterating to them how the music they created together had to represent an new level greatness and be bigger and better than anything that had previously been done. MJ was always the guy who wanted to scale new heights and break boundaries to create something unique and spectacular. Why then would he want to resurrect a one dimensional, Thriller era leftover such as BTM? There's no way MJ intended this set of songs or anything similar to this to be his next studio album if for no other reason that as a collection of tracks `Michael' is nowhere near as strong as any previous album.<br /><br />Considering the absence of stronger unreleased noughties material such as `Xscape', and the inclusion of a previously released song & discarded early 80's tracks, it's clear that Sony had no intention of compiling the closest representation of MJ's next studio album, or even the best album of unreleased material they could. Instead it would appear their plan is to drip feed us what new music MJ did leave behind over as many releases as possible alongside 20 yr old leftovers & songs which MJ may or may not have written featuring the vocals on an impersonator (word has it the Cascio's turned over 12 songs to the estate). Not collecting all the strongest unreleased Noughties material on one album was to be expected, but the fact that several of these songs feature the vocals of an impersonator/s which the estate claim to be Michael is one step too far. It is an insult to the fans and MJ's legacy. In light of this latest seedy development it's no wonder MJ himself had such disdain for Sony, but I don't think anyone would have thought they'd sink this low.<br /><br />Sony and the estate claim to have hired audio experts who analyzed the tracks fans accused of featuring an impersonator. These experts supposedly confirmed the vocals on the tracks to be MJ. But since Sony have issued no proof of this occurrence we can consider this news as worthless as the Cascio songs. Even without the multiple testimonials from the Jacksons claiming the Cascio songs to be fake, the vocals on these tracks are instantly recognizable to any longtime fan as not belonging to MJ. OK, let's talk positives. The good stuff that is on this release is very good. Best of Joy and the finished version of TWYLM stand as two of MJ's greatest ever songs. Another Day is great as is Much Too Soon but I'd preferred to have seen these on ultimate editions of Invincible & Thriller respectively. The sheer diversity of all 7 tracks showcases MJ's amazing talent so despite this release being a rather contrived compilation of odds and ends mixed with a couple of genuine new songs it still makes for compelling listening.<br /><br />For those wondering what became of the highly anticipated songs MJ created with will.i.am from 2006-2008, Will decided that since MJ was a perfectionist, and since he can no longer grant the songs his blessing he will not release them. Interestingly Will holds the music for these songs, while the estate now holds the vocals. Let's hope Will changes his mind about this in the future. MJ is now dead and what new music he did leave behind should released the RIGHT WAY- for the benefit of his children and the fans, else I fear the estate will just build new music around these vocals and release an inferior product. Back to `Michael'- It's a crime that the whole experience is soured by three songs that feature the vocals of an imposter. Buy the seven authentic songs as downloads from amazon- don't buy the CD because if you do you're telling Sony it's OK for them to continue lying to everyone and conning the fans. Despite the few amazing tracks on offer the overall feeling after listening to `Michael' is one of being slightly underwhelmed. Discounting the fake tracks, if any other artist put out this album I'd rate it much higher just by token of how exceptionally good a few of the songs are. But for a `Michael Jackson album' it is simply not good enough. Of course, this isn't really a Michael Jackson album.<br /><br />A side note about the artwork- award winning artist Kadir Nelson was approached by MJ several years ago to create a piece that detailed his career. The project was never brought to fruition but after MJ's passing the estate contacted Kadir and the mural was completed. Like the album itself, the artwork is brilliant in parts but overall a bit of a mess. The focal point of the piece- a 1980's MJ wearing gold armor being crowned by two cherubs is great, but the background collage of the gloved ones adult solo career is cluttered and unorganized. The saddest aspect of this release is not the fans getting screwed, or even MJ's legacy being tainted, it's that long time friends whom MJ had known for decades-Teddy Riley, the Cascio family & others have sold him out and endorsed a bunch of fake songs for financial gain. These people have no honor - no integrity. I'll leave the final words to the King of Pop his lyrics to `Money' from 1995 say it best-<br /><br />I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...<br />If you show me the cash<br />Then I will take it<br />If you tell me to cry<br />Then I will fake it<br />If you give me a hand<br />Then I will shake it<br />You'll do anything for money...ngs falls within familiar New Jack Swing territory. The vocal trickery is more cunning here;- the lead vocal is sung by the impersonator- most say Jason Malachi, some James Porte, whoever it is it's not Michael Jackson. But real MJ vocals in the form of breaths and ad libs from previous albums have been cut and pasted in amongst the main vocal in an attempt to trick the listener. What we are left with is a song that is clearly not sung by MJ, but not only that- sounds strangely synthetic and overly processed. Additionally the production is uninspired and it sounds like there is a glitch at 0:44. The song itself is not bad and the best of the three fakes. Had MJ actually recorded this he would have made it 10x better but as this is not him the song is worthless and should not be included. We know they are lying about who is singing these songs, so why should we even believe that MJ wrote them unless they can produce hand written lyric sheets which can then be verified by independent forensic handwriting experts? These songs were not registered until after the singer's death so it's possible that they were entirely written / recorded after his passing.   0/10     (I Can't Make It) Another Day (3:55)   Written by Lenny Kravitz  Produced by Lenny Kravitz  Co-Produced by Michael Jackson    Invincible leftover that leaked in January of this year. Written by Lenny Kravitz AD is a rock track about MJ's relationship with god, tho it can be interpreted in more than one way. Lenny re-recorded a more subdued take on the song with Jay Z entitled `Storm' which appeared on his 2004 album Baptism, needless it does not compare to the MJ version. This year Lenny headed back into the studio to finish the song adding new guitars, drums & vocals. It was clear upon first listen back in January that AD was a great song, but sadly this final version is not as good as the original. The funk styled Bass lines on the verse sections are good but the new guitar parts on the chorus detract fromits impact and the riff sounds like it is ripped off from Led Zepp's `Moby Dick'. This aside, the power and quality of the song still shine through and AD stands as a modern MJ classic. 9/10     Behind The Mask (5:03)  Written by Michael Jackson, Chris Mosdell, Ryuichi Sakamoto  Produced by Michael Jackson, John McClain    Originally appearing on Yellow Magic Orchestra's 1979 album Sold State Survivor, BTM is a cute Electropop track ft. robot vocals and cryptic lyrics. During the Thriller sessions MJ recorded a new version of the song with extra lyrics he had written about a two timing woman but legal difficulties prevented the songs release. Gregg Phillinganes (MJ/Eric Clapton keyboards) released a cover of the MJ version on his 1985 album `Pulse' and later Eric Clapton released the second cover of the MJ version on his 1986 album `August'. Here for the first time the original MJ version is unveiled with an updated sound that retains a 1980's flavour (robot vocals/saxophone) while still sounding current. The track begins with crowd chants of -Michael- from the live broadcast Bucharest date of the Dangerous world tour on October 1st 1992. The crowd sounds bring a nice ambience to the start of the track, but when they return later on as MJ interacts with the audience they are unnecessary and spoil the song a little. Overall this is a pretty good but of the 7 genuine tracks this is the weakest and there's no way MJ would have released this on a future album. 6/10    Much Too Soon (2:49)  Written by Michael Jackson   Produced by Michael Jackson, John McClain    Ending on a Thriller outtake, Much Too Soon is a tender acoustic ballad ft. a string section, accordion and gentle backing vocals. Coming in at under three minutes this one is short and sweet. On MTS the introspective/sensitive side of MJ's personality is on display similar to She's Out of My Life. Like BOF & TWYLM this one is another beautiful track but one minor complaint is that at 1:58 a slight crackle can be detected which really should have been removed and suggests a lazy production job. 8/10    So what are we actually getting here? The answer is- 2 new songs, 2 Invincible leftovers, 1 previously released song, 2 Thriller era leftovers and 3 songs that feature the vocals of an impersonator.

0786868724|4.0|The story Have a Little Faith by Mitch Albom is an inspiration novel that takes you through Mitch's own personal experience of re- finding his childhood faith.  The plot carries us through his travels as he makes a life time friend in his old Pastor who kindly asked Mitch to personally write his eulogy.  With some resentment, Mitch decides to overlook the struggles of his past, and takes on the challenge.  Through the stories told of the Pastors life experiences, and the other people Mitch meets on the way, he is able to rekindle the faith that he had lost at an early age.    This book is very well written and easy to follow.  It carries you through the pages as though it was being read to you by the author himself.  The characters are well developed and the readers begin to develop a personal relationship as their hearts are warmed and opened by the Pastor's experiences.  At one part of the book, Mitch explains a spiritual experience that he had that is also easy to connect with as you feel his change start to develop in your own heart.  He said,     How can I describe how I felt that day? I have since discovered, in the book of  Isaiah, a passage in which God states: `My thoughts are not your thoughts;  neither are you ways my ways. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so  are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than you thoughts.'  That was how I expected to feel-lower, unworthy. This was one of God's  messengers. I should be able to look up, right?       The book jumps from past to present, and can come across as difficult to understand if the reader isn't paying close attention to the titles of the chapters.  I would have liked if the different tenses could have been better organized and more clear to understand.    I overall truly enjoyed this book and the peace and comfort that was felt in my heart as Mitch shared this special life changing time in his life.  I plan on reading this book again and searching for more that can be foundin-between the lines of this touching novel.
B000002B7M|5.0|At the end of the 70's things were looking pretty bleak for Ozzy Osborne.  He had been kicked out of the band he had founded, Black Sabbath, and was having some major substance abuse problems.  It appeared that his career might be finished.  So it was a bit of a surprise when he emerged at the beginning of the decade with this album that would be come to be thought of as one of the great metal albums of it's time.  The discovery of guitar wizard Randy Rhoads propelled Ozzy's music and lyrics to new heights enabling him to carve a new direction away from the more plodding heavy music that Black Sabbath had been making.  Every track on this one is an Ozzy classic with many of them remaining concert staples to this day.  The two leadoff singles \\"Crazy Train\\" and \\"I Don't Know\\" get as much airplay today, 30 years later, as they did back in the day.  Along with the better known songs, the album contains one of my all time favorite Ozzy tracks in \\"Revelation (Mother Earth).  Everything about this track is great including some incredible guitar work by Rhoads.  For me it is a toss up between this one and \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" as to which is Ozzy's best work, but either way \\"Blizzard\\" managed to resurrect a career thought to be dead, and push Ozzy back into the limelight as one of the gods of heavy metal.
B003102JDM|5.0|If Coen brothers can choose to make a movie about suburban middle-class alienation, why not have a physics professor at the mediocre local midwest college pose as a main protagonist?  This film is a black comedy, set in 70s dreadful neighborhood of Minneapolis.  It is a very \\"Jewish\\" humor kind of film and to some degree it reminded me of Woody Allen's \\"Radio Days\\".  In any case, I truly enjoyed this film that provides an original story about a middle aged man who totally gets blindsided by so many things going on in his life all at once: he is due for tenure at the college where he teaches undergraduate physics degree, his wife is ready to leave him for another man, his children are struggling with their own pre-adolescent angst and his students are a whole another story....<br /><br />This is one of these movies that may be an aquired taste for Coen brother kind of black comedy that is both entertaining and disturbing at the same time. Acting assembly is fabulous and pictures of 1970s lifestyle quite authentic.  It is a must see movie.  Definitely.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Guido is a director who can't make a film.  Meanwhile, he's the subject of a great film.  Others have given the story, so I won't recap it here.  I will say that watching the film as a woman is a strange experience. We are obviously supposed to identify with Guido for most of the movie, and yet his view of women is warped, as it is always filtered through two foundational experiences, linked to two senses: the bath and talcum powdering given to him by his mother while a child, which is associated with touch, and the dance of Saraghina, linked to sight.<br /><br />He divides up the women in his life according to these experiences, with his wife (who is explicitly linked to his mother in more than one scene) standing for the sense of touch, while his mistress and most of the other women, are there for - in his mind - his visual pleasure.  While a child, he watched the prostitute Saraghina dancing on the beach and was caught and punished in his Catholic school.  This imprinted on his sexual self, and now desire is linked to shame for him.<br /><br />The compass rose of his feelings toward women is the following: fear, disgust, longing, and desire.  Usually more than one will be present.  For his wife: fear and longing.  For his mistress: disgust and desire.  For Claudia, his ideal woman: longing and desire. His compass is always spinning around as he encounters other women. Note that love is not one of the options, but then again, neither is hate.  This is not a man who hates women, but also one who doesn't know how to love them.<br /><br />Note too, that the verbal is missing from his two foundational experiences.  Sight and touch are key, but hearing and words are, for him, a sort of false arena of exchange, where lies are traded for lies in order to allow him to make films.  In his relationship with his wife, who he does long for (although I'm not sure he loves her), he is unable to speak to her in a real way, which drives her away from him due to his constant lies.  I really liked Luisa, Guido's wife, who is a strong character even in this very male-dominated movie.  The scene where Guido is showing his (awful) screen tests is a particularly interesting one, as it shows that Guido is being unfair and cruel to his wife. This scene is one of the few where I believe we're supposed to identify with someone other than Guido -i.e., with Luisa.  If the movie-in-a-movie is unfair, it opens up the possibility that Fellini knows that he has problems and issues with women.<br /><br />The dance of Saraghina has many echoes in the film. Guido is constantly trying to control and reshape this experience, which showed the power of women over him. Note that Saraghina is older and shown almost as a giantess on film, as she would have seemed to the young Guido.  When he \\"directs\\" his mistress in fantasy play, he draws big eyebrows on her, like Saraghina had, and he says it's to make her look like a whore. In another long scene, he combines his two foundational experiences and has his wife, along with all the other women in his life, wash and powder him.  An old showgirl dances before them all.  This is a particularly cruel scene, and is another attempt to defuse the power of Saraghina's dance, as the old showgirl is old in a powerless way and her dance is grotesque.  In the end, she is sent upstairs with the other women who are too old for Guido's desire.  But because Saraghina's dance is imprinted on Guido's sexual template, no matter his treatment of other women, it cannot be contained and any victory over it will be a temporary one.<br /><br />The ending is very powerful because at the very site of the failed transcendence of the spaceship scene from his failed movie, a scene of human collectivity is enacted.  All the characters come out holding hands, as in a parade, thus combining the senses of of touch and sight. Even his wife is connected to the whole, and we see a moment of togetherness.  And yet the secret of a happy ending is knowingwhere to stop, and the last shot of a lone performer suggests that when this moment is over, Guido will still be alone with his procrustean sexual scenarios.  But then again, he's been in one of the greatest movies ever, so art can redeem life, if only partly and imperfectly.of a lone performer suggests that when this moment is over, Guido will still be alone with his procrustean sexual scenarios.

142313494X|4.0|\\"But I don't believe in gods,\\" [Percy said.]  \\"Oh, you'd better,\\" Mr. D murmured. \\"Before one of them incinerates you.\\"    Percy Jackson is attending middle school when he discovers that all the gods and monsters from Greek mythology are still around in modern America, and he is right in the middle of it all.  He learns how to navigate this new aspect of his world, and is just figuring out how everything works when Zeus's master bolt is stolen, and Percy has about two weeks to get it back.      Overall, this book is of a fairly high quality.  The vast richness of Greek mythology is given an interesting and modern twist, effectively mixing parts of several specific genres: school story, action/adventure, with a little romance and humor thrown in for variety.  The plot moves fairly quickly, but without feeling like it's jumping from main event to main event.  The different characters and plot twists were woven together rather skillfully.  Rick Riordan has truly created the next big young-adult book series.      One of this book's main weaknesses is its plot's similarity to that of many other young adult fiction books, such as Harry Potter.  Many of the story's elements are strikingly similar, making the plot distractingly predictable at times.  It is true that, to a certain extent, books in the same category will have many similarities, but an author should examine previous works in their desired genre to make sure their own story is not built too similarly to another work or too heavily on anyone else's work.      Although it was a bit predictable and the plot wasn't anything brand new, Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief was a very enjoyable read, and was worth the time it took to read it.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, fast adventure.

One day while watching HBO this movie came on. I decided to give it a try. My perceptions of this movie was TOTALLY wrong. This flick kept my interest from beginning to end. The suspense was major. And the twist was great. This is well worth the purchase.

I live in a large city and can honestly say that even Whole Foods did not have the ingredients these recipes called for.<br /><br />I have made four recipes from this book - the apple toastie, banana bread, sugar plums and red velvet cupcakes.  All were not worth the effort and the sugar plums were the absolute worst. The book provides no guidance on how the mix \\"should\\" look. Although it has pretty pictures and testimonials by celebrities, it really does not make the grade for a good baking book. I looked through the pictures of the other reviewers, yeah, they look horrible and mine came out the same way.<br /><br />I bake vegan always and will be sticking with \\"The Joy of Vegan Baking,\\" a much easier guide to follow.
1423113497|4.0|This is such a vividly written story, no way a movie could live up to what was in my mind. While the movie did a good job, the book is so much better. I love the creative entwining of mythology with today's youth culture. The teen characters are realistic and likable, the mythical characters either cool or despicable. So many ways this could have turned out bad, but didn't because of the skills of the author.
0553212621|5.0|I heard a lot about Lady Chatterley's Lover, mainly because many people found it pornographic. Then I happened to see the movie in TV. That brought me to the conclusion that I wanted to read the  original. I am about half through by now and I am stunned by the narrative and psychological quality of the novel. A captivating description also of social and industrial situation in England at that time  between the two wars. I can only warmly recommend to read the original text to anyone interested in real literture.

B003ZTQN1I|5.0|After seeing Gwyneth Paltrow perform on the 2010 Country Music Association Awards I had to purchase the soundtrack to the motion picture of the same name. In the film Gwyneth plays a washed-up country music superstar on the decline with hopes of resurrecting her career. However, a younger and talented woman waits in the wings in hopes of replacing this former #1 female singer.<br /><br /> Platrow has the pipes to be a country music performer. You wouldn't think so after her splendid movie performances as socialites in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" and \\"A Pefect Murder\\", and Nashville is a long way from \\"Shakespeare In Love\\", Paltrow's Oscar-winning film. However, her performance in \\"Country Strong\\" is what makes a great actress. Being this wonderful former singer is what the role here is all about and she pulls it off in spades. I will not be surprised if she is nominated for another Oscar!<br /><br /> The soundtrack of \\"Country Strong\\" is doing what the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" soundtrack did for country music in the early eighties; giving the industry a new image. With this music it is showing the general public country music is no longer an industry filled with women who play second fiddle to their male counterparts. These women are not wearing hair as high as a brick wall (sorry Dolly...circa 1968 LOL) and are not being costumed in calico dresses (sorry Loretta Lynn...circa 1971 LOL). Not only does a character like the one Gwyneth portray have talent (not as much as Dolly and Loretta have mind you), but when you see her on stage you could mistake her as a pop star.<br /><br /> The music is what really makes the film. Paltrow's performances on the four tracks are superb, especially her beautiful duet with Tim McGraw called \\"Me and Tennessee\\". The rest of the album is filled with performances by some of the best artists in Nashville including Sara Evans, who performs \\"A Little Bit Stronger\\" (about a woman who leaves her partner to start a new life). This song fits Sara perfectly after having a very bitter public divorce a few years ago. Other standouts here include \\"Give In To Me (Faith Hill, Tim McGraw's real-life wife), \\"Liar's Lie\\" (Leanne Womack), \\"She's Acting Single\\" (by Ronnie Dunn of Brooks and Dunn fame), and \\"Timing Is Everything\\" by Trace Adkins.<br /><br /> The only problem I have with the soundtrack is the fact that Tim McGraw only appears on one track. McGraw is one of the biggest singers in country music and it would have been nice if he had been in at least one solo. But, perhaps this was a conscious decision on his part as he is hoping to garner an acting career and maybe he felt the singing was taking away from his acting performances.<br /><br /> \\"Country Strong\\" has hit as high as #16 on the Billboard Country Music Charts and #73 on the Pop Album Charts. These are not high numbers, but once the film is released nationwide in January, 2010 I am sure those numbers will climb. The single \\"Country Strong\\" by Palrow has hit a peak of #37 as a country music single as of Decemeber 14, 2010.itter public divorce a few years ago. Other standouts here include \\"Give In To Me (Faith Hill, Tim McGraw's real-life wife), \\"Liar's Lie\\" (Leanne Womack), \\"She's Acting Single\\" (by Ronnie Dunn of Brooks and Dunn fame), and \\"Timing Is Everything\\" by Trace Adkins.     The only problem I have with the soundtrack is the fact that Tim McGraw only appears on one track. McGraw is one of the biggest singers in country music and it would have been nice if he had been in at least one solo. But, perhaps this was a conscious decision on his part as he is hoping to garner an acting career and maybe he felt the singing was taking away from his acting performances.     \\"Country Strong\\" has hit as high as #16 on the Billboard Country Music Charts and #73 on the Pop Album Charts. These are not high numbers, but once the film is released nationwide in January, 2010 I am sure those numbers will climb.

B003R0MF1C|5.0|I too am looking forward to the release of Season 7.  I understand this entire program is based on a real person's life.  I do hope she is still alive so we can be surprised to find more \\"seasons\\" coming and this cancellations being just another advertising ploy.  So many of us are quiet followers but do loyaly LOVE this story line!

030746363X|5.0|The 4-Hour Workweek is one of my very favorite books; I'm a HUGE fan of Tim Ferriss! So, I was super excited to read Tim's new book, The 4-Hour Body. I was not disappointed. In fact, I now have a new favorite - Tim's new book is AWESOME!!    I've been in the fitness industry for nearly 20 years, so I've read a lot of health, weight loss, and performance books. But this one is different - VERY different. It's a perfect balance and a vast collection of (valid) scientific studies and unique personal experiences that have this book jam-packed with interesting and helpful tips, strategies, and inspiration.    But beyond the practical, useful information ... what makes it such a masterpiece, is how fun and interesting it is to read. You get to take a journey through Tim's own personal experimentation and learn how to lose fat fast, gain muscle, improve athletic performance, prevent injuries, enjoy a more enriched lifestyle, and on and on.    I couldn't recommend this book higher and I'm confident you'll enjoy it as much as I did. Get This Book!!!
030746363X|5.0|Tim is a self professed madman but I think he's basically a smart guy with a boatload of curiosity and OCD put to good use. But this book is not what you think. Uncommon it is from the examples to the prose. And just like Tim himself, this book is unlike anything I've ever read. He is a self proclaimed guinea pig. And obsessive he is about data, results, stepping outside the box and little health gadgets. I loved it! And while others have asked for it, I can't give it up because it's such a valuable reference. I'll be getting the kindle version as well.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I went to see Eclipse in the movies and just couldnt wait until it came out on dvd. This is defently my favorite Movie of the series!! A must have for any Twilight fan.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|I really don't see what the problem was with these DVDs; they were fine with me. Slim packs are better because they are eco-friendly, you really dont need all of that excess space. Some of the movies need improvement though...like episode i needs to fix Yoda, and episode ii needs more action with Count Dooku and the droids and Jedi, episode iii was fine except it needs a little more character implementation. That's all i have to say!
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|On what other artist's album would you be able to hear a spectrum of hip hop artists as diverse and strong as RZA, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Raekwon, Kid Cudi, and Nicki Minaj?  If you're a fan of hip hop in the least, that combination has to pique your interest at least a little bit.  I'd say the best thing about this album is the dark concept of it, and every single song's beat adheres to that dark and twisted theme.  Another notable about this album is the samples, I think it's ideal that Kanye belongs to a big name label, because an artist like Kanye uses samples to their fullest effect and a big record label would best be able to secure the permissions to use them.  The best examples of this are on \\"Dark Fantasy\\" (RZA-produced, awesomely dark and funny track with the chipmunk choir) and \\"Monster\\".      I also can't review this album without mentioning Nicki Minaj's verse on \\"Monster\\", I'd have to say that's the most entertaining verse I've heard on any album in a long time.  If I said she was Beast Mode on that verse, that's literal, considering the song's context.  Not only does that song have Rick Ross, Kanye, and Jay-Z on it (all with respectable verses), but Nicki Minaj gets on the track and slays ALL OF THEM with her persona-switching flow.  I would've loved to see what she looked like in the studio while she was recording that.      I thought Big Boi's Sir Lucious Left Foot album was going to be hip hop album of the year 2010, but My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a hugely strong contender.
044654759X|2.0|This book is no more than a re-creation of Sleeping with the Enemy. It follows the same story line. So much so that I knew how the book would end just because I know the movie. Nicholas Sparks makes a lot of money to write these books. In this case he has just stopped being creative and took a movie to make into a book. I'm very disappointed that he would stoop to this level to put out a book.

030746363X|5.0|When 4 Hour Body arrived at my doorstep, I was pretty sure it was not a book and likely something that I had forgotten I ordered. Nope, it was 4HB... but the book is HUGE! 600 pages at this price alone makes the value worth it but I'll go through and explain why the content is great.<br /><br />As a note I have not yet read the entire book (did I mention it's 600 pages?) but I have read several chapters so far. The first few setup how and why Tim is the master of his domain. He's consulted with tons of doctors, been tracking all of his workouts since he was 18, even knows intimate details about his own DNA that help him adjust his health and fitness regimen.. and this book is all about him distilling this into something that he's proven but other doctors may not want to share and put their careers on the line. Tim's not one of those. He just wants to show you what he's seen has worked for him and many that he's followed. There have been several points in the book where he clearly says it like it is -- how supplement companies can lie, or how professional body builders can achieve 4% body fat.<br /><br />I describe myself as highly-motivated yet unskilled in regards to health and fitness. I can motivate myself to stick to any diet (lost 40 pounds in a few months earlier this year) but I have to get pointed in the right direction about what to eat or do in the gym. This book is helping with that. Several sections of the book clearly layout certain meals -- even going so far as to list various options if you don't like the first -- as well as many, many examples of exercises.<br /><br />And the best part for me at least, is that there is a TON of nerdy, scientific stuff. You just will not find that in any other fitness/health book, such as the one by LL Cool J I was flipping through at a book store last week. Yes, I really really want to know exactly what some of these supplements do pre-workout. I want to know why high intensity training compares to low-intensity training. If you want to learn some of the same, pick this book up! And Tim was right when I asked him about the book before it came out - you will want the actual book and not the Kindle version. I am the biggest Kindle lover in the world, but a book such as this is meant to be flipped through and experienced.<br /><br />I've only had 4 Hour Body for a week and I have already tossed some bad supplements I used to use, replaced them with better ones (can't believe this is the first time I've heard about micellar casein protein) and have done the calculation necessary to see how much protein I need to eat per day to gain muscle during HIT activities. I wasn't eating anywhere near enough!rn some of the same, pick this book up!

B0015AARJI|4.0|This is basically a required accessory when purchasing a PS3 system.<br />Having a rechargeable controller has several pros and cons<br />As another reviewer stated, this does NOT come with the USB charging cable. If you don't have your original anymore, you're going to need one, such as the [[ASIN:B001TH7GUK AmazonBasics  USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B Cable (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters)]].<br />Playing the game while plugged in/charging is no fun - nobody likes to be tethered these days to their game systems.<br />The lithium ion battery inside holds its charge well.  I can go 1-2 weeks (depending on frequency of playing) between charges.<br />One drawback is that, like other lithium ion batteries (such as cell phones, gps batteries, etc), you'll end up with about 2-3 good years of life<br />before it bites the dust.  It's not easily user-replaceable, either.<br />So, you're going to need a new controller down the road, but rest assured that for the next few years, you've got a great one.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Zoolander is such a hilarious movie....at times it can be a bit dumb but the performances are superb tho. Toke one down, take some shots, whatever your preference and this movie becomes golden.  Not that any one needs to be enhanced to enjoy the film...it's a goodin as a big shake friend of mine would say.
030746363X|5.0|This is a great book that is definitely large and full of data. Mr. Ferriss has done so many tests and recorded so much, it's hard to know where to start. It definitely has been hard to stop reading, though, as it seems like I just keep finding little nuggets of information that are going to be helpful. For example, I pulled my hamstring last fall, and it was the worst I have ever pulled it. Tim has a section about hamstrings in his \\"Hacking the NFL Combine\\" chapters. Great stuff I will definitely be using.    All of this is actionable stuff that will be helpful to me in the coming months, and I have no doubts  that with this information I will be able to tranform my body to what I want it to look like. Thanks for writing this book!! Top notch.
0142004413|2.0|I bought a new paperback and am very disappointed by the quality of the product. While the story is really good, I just wish the book was better made. Seriously, a used copy would have been much better!
030746363X|5.0|As someone who has kept up with the authors work over the last couple years and someone who has been into health and fitness my whole life I was very excited to get this book.  I am so thankful that Tim was \\"brave\\" enough to write this book.  For anyone who has been a serious student of physical performance and/or been subjected to the medical establishment should know, very little of what is officially fed to us is helpful. The suggestions in this book apparently have been tested to deliver the maximum amount of results with the least amount of effort.  The writing is also done in such a way that even if you don't plan to use the information provided it is still fun to read.      I'm not sure who the author has made enemies with but the negative reviews seem to be aimed at attacking Tim personalty. His work is clearly sensationalized for marketing affect but the substance of everything he has written that I have read has been thoughtful and accurate.  Furthermore putting his recommendations into practice has benefited many peoples lives, mine included.

0385738757|4.0|Plot Summary:  Thomas, Teresa, and the other \\"Gladers\\" busted out of the sadistic Maze at the end of book one, and were taken to a dormitory.  Their rescue was nothing but an illusion before the next phase of the trials, and their tormentors have dropped their cloak of secrecy... somewhat.  The mysterious organization known as WICKED is indeed behind the experiments, but to what end, the teenagers can only fathom.  Their next trial will take place in an area known as The Scorch, and it will make their time in the Maze look tame.  Thomas starts to remember glimpses from his past life, and each one reveals that he had some part in setting up the trials themselves.    (The Maze Runner Trilogy; Book Two)    I don't think I've ever read a story that managed to introduce a new twist to the plot with each chapter, but The Scorch Trials is nothing but a tortured, twisting tale of knots.  Surprisingly few answers were revealed in this bridge installment between the first and third novels, so James Dashner is obviously saving it all up for the next one (btw, I was poking around on his blog and it sounds like the last one will be titled The Death Cure).      I love the trilogy format, but the sad truth is that middle novels often suck.  This one was a page-turner, but after so much non-stop action, danger, rinse, repeat, I almost became numbed to the adrenaline rush.  I wish this novel had built in a little more downtime so that the \\"We're gonna die!\\" moments would have more impact.  When this happens every single chapter, it's kind of tedious and exhausting to read through.  The nature of the horrors is spectacularly creative and brutal, and it kind of reminded me of the violence in Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games trilogy.  The violence is equally gruesome and graphic.    Because none of my questions were answered, I'm determined to read the last installment when it comes out.  I have no doubt that it will be a long, torturous path to get those answers, but Mr. Dashner has hooked me good.

B003HARV3Y|2.0|Another series of children's books, and another attempt at a big-screen flick.  And just like Eragon, Golden Compass, and Inkheart before it, Hollywood produces another clunker.  The special effects are good, and the dialogue is believable, but the overall movie just does not carry thru.  Maybe the biggest failure is the acting, of which there are many.  For example, Uma Thurman's Medusa seemed a little forced; her lines a little too rehearsed.  Another example is Grover, who seems to be in the movie for comic relief, as if the only role for black actors in sci-fi movies is comic relief; think Chris Tucker in the 5th Element or Eddie Murphy in Pluto Nash.  And then there is Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean playing key supporting roles.  Funny, why is a movie about Greek myths using Brits to play Greek roles?  The only good thing about the acting was that it did not try to play to little kids or even teenagers.  It was a movie made for families, both adults and children.  Overall, an OK movie.
B000002P2W|4.0|The three bonus tracks are all from the 1976 Swansea concert.  Dreaming From The Waist was previously released (officially) on the Thirty Years Of Maximum R&B boxed set.  The Swansea concert is a must for Who freaks and should be released officially (you can easily find it online).  There's also a nifty little booklet in this CD with an essay by John Swenson and lots of photographs and memorabilia from the 1975-76 tour.  Why oh why don't The Who release official versions of the great bootlegs that exist?  Zappa, ELP, and many others have.  What's the problem? I'd gladly $upport them.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I got an advance copy of this book over a week ago.  The subject matter it covers is common fair for fitness magazines and women's magazines: losing weight, better sex, strength training, what to eat, etc.  These are things that affect all of us and at some level interest all of us.  As a result, these subjects are splattered all over every magazine cover month after month, and it's very hard to come up with something new to say.  Yet Ferriss, has done it.  The writing is unique and crisp.  The data he brings I haven't seen.  His conclusions are often counter-intuitive and contrary to conventional wisdom.  This book has a lot to contribute to the debates, and I believe it will influence what you read in magazines for years to come.       It's also the case that my wife can't put the book down, and keeps thinking of people to give it to for Christmas.  When friends come to the house, she'll find the book, wherever one of us has left it, and show it to the guest, pointing out places and quoting from it.  It's a unique piece of content.  We haven't had a book as captivating and universally interesting in our house for years.
037571457X|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is a novel that can be learned from as well as related to. The true story of the authors experience is one that many foreigners can relate to. The hardship and personal issues that the author experienced over the course of her childhood are told with gripping images of what the Iranian War was like. The graphic images in the novel may not be suitable for younger readers. However, the graphic novel does depict its detail story through those images. This is a graphic novel that I would recommend to readers who are of an older audiences,preferably teens and also those who are seeking to understand what the Iranian Revolution was like.
0316010669|5.0|Malcom Gladwell's exploration of our initial subconscious reactions is an incredible read for both experts and laymen alike. I am especially impressed at the examples Gladwell presents in the book. He begins each chapter with a new example of the main point for the section. These examples are not rooted in higher learning but rather reach topics any of us can relate to. He writes about marriage, dating, art, elections...even his primary example to introduce the Blink concept is about a stature.  Throughout his explanation, he constantly refers back to his original example, fleshing it out as he teaches us more and more about the details of the \\"Blink\\" phenomenon. The result of tackling this information piece by piece is an easy to follow guide through the otherwise confusing concepts and the creative examples help keep one interested even if s/he wasn't looking to read an academic book.    I also thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's voice throughout the book. Blink is filled with academic research to support Gladwell's claims but the writing is a departure from the often droll college textbooks and articles. Instead, Gladwell's narrative often sounds like he is telling a story rather than explaining a theory. He is not an impartial narrator but rather provides examples from his own life and writes like he is leading us through information he himself just discovered. In short, his writing provides clarity and doesn't sacrifice creativity in lieu of scientific research.    In conclusion, I throw in another recommendation for this excellent book. Some of the concepts tackled in Blink are taught in University Communication, Psychology, and Sociology classes so nothing can beat a creative and effective piece of college education without the expensive tuition fees. Furthermore, Blink will persuade you to take a look at the way you react to others and what kind of messages these reactions send.
0446402397|5.0|Found this book for a great price and decided to take a chance with it. Im really glad that I did because as soon as I read probably the first 20 or so pages I was hooked because the story was just a really cool one for me because it took place in a country that I have always wanted to travel to. this book is a great read and if your like me you will stay up real late reading this one just because you dont want to put it down.
1439152780|5.0|So, I have raved to anyone and everyone about how much I loved Kate Morton's The House at Riverton. Seriously, that was my favorite book for 2009 and one of my favorite books ever. I also loved The Forgotten Garden, though I didn't rave about that one quite as much as I raved about The House at Riverton. However, The Distant Hours deserves the most praise out of all three books. Why? Well, because it takes what's amazing about The House at Riverton (the moodiness, the atmosphere) and what's tremendous about The Forgotten Garden (the airiness, the enchantment) and puts it together into one fantastic novel.<br /><br />I loved every single word of The Distant Hours. Yes, the book is long as hell, but every single page was worth it. Book lover that I am, I loved the character of Edie and could completely understand why she would be so enchanted with Milderhurst Castle (as I am also a Gothic Literature Lover or GLL as I like to call it) and her fascination with the written word was something that I could relate to. I was so connected to everything in this book. MILD SPOILER: LIKE VERY MILD: During one part, Edie is talking to Saffy and Saffy is concerned that Percy will catch her doing just that, and I felt just as worried as Edie that Percy would catch the two conversing and Saffy wouldn't be able to tell her story. I just didn't want them to be interrupted. END OF EXTREMELY MILD SPOILER.<br /><br />I was so enchanted with The Distant Hours. One of my favorite things about it was the whole history of The Mud Man. It came to the point where I really wished that book existed because it just sounded so utterly fascinating and captivating. (And since we're being truthful, if J.K. Rowling had written The Distant Hours, The Mud Man would be a published best-selling novella by now. So, maybe it's foolish, but I want The Mud Man published.) The same thing happened in The Forgotten Garden. I found Eliza's fairytales enchanting and just as enjoyable (if not more) than the overall story.<br /><br />There were a lot of twists and turns in The Distant Hours. And no I'm not going to mention not even one of them. However, I will say that I discovered one of the twists before it had been revealed, but there were many more were that came from (but not in that annoying \\"mystery writer\\" type of way. Each of these twists seemed necessary and weren't necessarily red-herrings). Every time I thought that I had something figured out, Morton would throw a curveball at it and everything would unravel again (again, not in the annoying mystery writer way).<br /><br />So, I definitely, whole-heartedly, recommend The Distant Hours. It was an amazing, enchanting, captivating read that just flew by since you're desperate to figure what really went on. Read it if you want a read with any of these things. Also, The Distant Hours is best read in the evening in the middle of a storm (rainstorm, snowstorm, sandstorm, it doesn't really matter), just to feel the full effect. I read some of it yesterday in the middle of a snowstorm, at night, and ended up creeping myself out just a little. Anyway, read The Distant Hours. It was amazing and Kate Morton is an amazing writer.ere were a lot of twists and turns in The Distant Hours. And no I'm not going to mention not even one of them.

0439023521|4.0|This is not the type of book I normally find myself reading. The fact that I enjoyed it so much and have consequently recommended it to both friends and students alike took me by surprise.  I don't typically enjoy science fiction, especially when the society is as cruel and hopeless as this one.  However, the bond between Katsa and Po kept me reading until the end.  My favorite character by far, however, is Haymitch.  He's really the best written and most well-rounded character so far.      It's not a book that hooked me at first.  If you find the same to be true for yourself, I would recommend staying with it until you reach Part II: The Arena.  That is when the action picks up, and things get really interesting.

B004AKCME8|4.0|Background:<br /><br />This movie is based on the first three books in the series, of 15 books that were written by Ms Kathryn Lasky. She finished this series in 2008. So don't be surprised if in the next year or so a sequel to this movie shows up. Ms Lasky has written about 100 books for children and young adults (fiction and non-fiction). However, make no mistake, this is not just a kiddie film, in fact it has been given a PG rating.<br /><br />Storyline:<br /><br />When two young owls fall from the safety of their tree they are kidnapped and forced to join the evil Pure Ones that have their base at St. Aggie's. Soren (Jim Sturgess) and his new found friends then journey to seek out the legendary Guardians (Jedi ??) to stop the evil plans of the Pure Ones.<br /><br />The plot is not overly original, defeat the evil empire, and may the force be with you. The evil leader wears a black iron mask (although there is no deep breathing noise) reminds of an owlish version of Darth Vader.<br /><br />Cinematics:<br /><br />The graphics are simply awesome, there are a lot of sunsets, seaside scenes and massive trees that are wonderous to behold. The owls are also beautiful to look at the feathers move individually with the wind and the mechanics of flight are accurately portrayed. The slo-mo effects are wonderfully done, the final battle is quite dramatic.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This film is among the best animated full length movies for 2010. It is very strong on its technical aspects. Although there is a lot of fighting, you are spared the blood and the gore. It is a great family film that everyone can watch and be entertained.

B0013N7AD8|5.0|I bought this set for a christmas present, and it came a day early. Totally worth it, especially since this is well over $100 in stores. Will buy from here again :)
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferris always amaze me. In one of my trips to US I purchased the 4 hour workweek. I felt in love with the general philosophy and the strong concepts I discovered within.<br /><br />Since that purchase I am an avid follower of Tim's Blog.<br /><br />You know sometime genius only appears in their first work, but with his second book Tim DID IT AGAIN!<br /><br />3 important areas:<br /><br />- Fat Loss<br />- Muscle Gain<br />- Sex Improvement.<br /><br />Radical tricks and powerful concepts you can start applying inmediately. Thanks TIM.
B001ED7C58|4.0|My wife loved the CD. She could pick out every scene that he songs came from. Highly recommended for fans.
0312323867|3.0|So after reading \\"Something Borrowed\\" (and LOVING it in spite of myself), I figured, well now I have to read \\"Something Blue\\".  The freakishly obnoxious b*tch from the first book is obviously going to get what's coming to her in the sequel and frankly, the devil in me is just in the mood to read about it.  Unfortunately this is not how \\"Blue\\" plays out.  To be fair, any book that is published with the chick lit logo is going to have an impossibly perfect, Bridget Jones becomes the princes bride ending so I should've managed my expectations accordingly.  But  Giffin does such a perfect job of creating the quintessential character everyone loves to hate (Darcy) in the first book, that my cup of loathing runneth over  upon starting the second book and no matter how much Darcy grew up, I still wanted her to end up deformed and talking with a keyboard a la Stephen Hawking.  But like I said, this is chick lit so obviously this does not happen.  Rather, in \\"Something Blue\\" we get the rest of the story from Darcy's perspective, which ends up being one of the more irritating and whiney narratives I have ever read.  For 200+ pages the reader is treated to a diatribe of \\"poor me poor me, I'm Malibu Barbie\\" only to be followed up with 100+ pages of incredulous poppycock that quite honestly had my eyes rolling into my head so often I've memorized the pattern of veins in my lids.<br />Ugh...honestly.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|This has to be the worst movie ever. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Only the insane would rate this movie anything but terrible. It is made for someone with the mind of a child and even most children would see this flick is cheesy.
030746363X|5.0|Tim's talent is finding those small, key moves that give you outsized results.    He did that with 4-Hour Workweek, where he introduced people to the productivity time-savers like hiring a virtual assistant.    In 4-Hour Body, he's doing the same thing for health.
0316077054|5.0|I read contemporary paranormal fiction because I love imagining the possibilities of other worlds -- not in the great beyond of outer space, but here, right alongside our own, existing exactly where we exist in ways that most of us just don't or won't perceive. In the Caster Chronicles world of Beautiful Darkness (and it's predecessor, [[ASIN:0316077038 Beautiful Creatures]]), authors Garcia and Stohl have created a place that's so familiar -- the sweltering heat of the south, the endless chorus of cicadas, majestic willow trees, suffocating yet comforting small town familiarity, pie (of course) -- but shift your perception just a little, and Gatlin, South Carolina is *so* not the good ol' American south. Secret tunnels connect an entire magical world beneath the city, bending time and space and blurring the natural order of things. Stacks of dusty books hold ancient, life-and-death spells. Even an old house cat has dangerous secrets. The writing is so evocative and lush that the two worlds of the story -- the familiar and the magical -- blend seamlessly into the kind of strange and wonderful possibilities that transport me from the world of what *is* into the world of what *just might be.*<br /><br />One of the things that allowed me to fully appreciate the intricate, authentic setting of Beautiful Darkness was the pacing. Sometimes with longer paranormals, scenes either drag with repetitive detail or they're so action-packed that we never get a chance to catch our breath, to soak up the setting, or to really bond with the story's often larger-than-life characters. In Beautiful Darkness, the writing never felt slow or unnecessary to me, but at the same time, I was able to unclench my jaws and relax a bit between the intense action, to reflect and process events as the characters did. It allowed me to spend more time with them where they live and breath, to fully appreciate their feelings and fears, and to understand (and believe) the importance of what they were fighting for, whether it was literally the survival of the world, or something as close and intimate as a new love, a best friend, the chance to swim at the lake on a hot day. I was immersed in their world and their lives, one hundred percent committed to seeing them through to the end, whatever that ending held.<br /><br />After devouring [[ASIN:0316077038 Beautiful Creatures]] last year, I was anxious to see how the consequences of character Lena Duchannes' choices would play out, how they would alter her relationship with narrator Ethan Wate for better or worse. Again, because of the spot-on pacing, I was able to really watch their internal saga unfold, piece by piece, understanding the whys of their behavior even when I didn't agree with the whats. Lena was frustrating and selfish, no doubt about it, but I got it. I believed it. My heart ached for her in every scene, after every explosive misunderstanding between her and Ethan. Revelations and secrets surfaced through all of the characters (not just those who walk among the living), weaving more layers of mystery into the series as a whole (and of course, totally setting us up for the next installment -- hello, can 2011 get here fast enough?!).<br /><br />I typically read paranormal and fantasy books in the winter. There's something exciting about curling up under a blanket, sipping hot chocolate, and scaring myself silly on a dark, cold night. Now, Garcia and Stohl have earned a permanent place on my curl-up-under-a-blanket, books-I'll-never-give-away shelf, right next to a select few timeless winter's night faves: [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter]], [[ASIN:0385732317 A Great and Terrible Beauty (The Gemma Doyle Trilogy)]], [[ASIN:0312608667 Eyes Like Stars: Theatre Illuminata, Act I]], [[ASIN:0316027413 Prophecy of the Sisters (Prophecy of the Sisters Trilogy, Book I)]], and [[ASIN:1442409525 The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones; City of Ashes; City of Glass]]. If you enjoyed these paranormal series', you'll likely devour Garcia and Stohl's Caster Chronicles, too. I'm leaving just enough room on my shelf for the next in the series, one that's destined for the top of my TBR pile the moment it hits the shelves.ohl's Caster Chronicles, too.

0316069485|5.0|Loved it. Read fast and smooth like Connelly's best. I can see where some folks might not like it as much. Didn't have quite the courtroom impact or finale that other's of his have had. But still, way better than most writers outings. Still entertaining and easy to get into. Being a reporter in another life seems to help make the reading more engaging I've noticed.
030746363X|5.0|I received my copy of 4HB last week. I'm not a journalist or writing a fake review as some people may state. There was an interview last year around this time where I first heard about 4 Hour Body. We were able to sign up for a copy back then. I've been looking forward to this book since then.     Since I've received this book, I've read it everyday. It is packed with awesome tips, step by step methods and lots of real life examples. This book is a great reference book but unlike most reference books, it's written with Tim's great sense of humor. If you like to learn about the science end of things (like me), then this book is a must have. I've been reading and studying lifting, exercise, diet, etc... for years and this has information I've not seen elsewhere.     I've already implemented the ab exercises into my workouts as well as a different cadence than I'm used to. Just bought all my stuff to make my \\"T\\" Handle, went to the store and bought more slow carbs, etc...     I've been mega happy with this book! I just ordered more Sunday for Christmas presents.
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss does it again! I ordered an advance copy and am pouring over the material. Tim once again breaks conventional norms to bring interesting ways to hack the human body to achieve outstanding results. I'm looking forward to getting started! Thanks Tim!
0440243688|5.0|This book rocks. Tough action and mesmerizing plot. Did I spell that right? Who knows, but this book was sweet. Like relish or a pickle. If you like those sorts of things. By the way, I just read some other turkeys review of 61 Hours and swear to God he went on for like 10 paragraphs outlining in detail all the problems he had with it. Go check it out. Its ridiculous. Who has the time to write that kinda criticism. And he directed it as a letter to Lee Child. Like Lee has the time to waste reading this bozo's critique on Amazon. I hate it when people do that. I always want to say to them, let's see you write a decent book.
B003XOAJ7E|2.0|If you are interested in Duran Duran, and probably are to a degree if you are reading this...buy the \\"Notorious\\" CD.  It is wonderful, sounds terrific with plenty of synth and impressive horn section.  However I do not recommend this \\"remastered\\" version.  Not for the price.  I placed it in my CD player and was expected to be blown away by updated sound technology, I was disappointed.  Doesn't sound much different than the standard CD released over 2 decades ago.  It does come with tons of remixes, live cuts, a DVD of a concert performance, and several postcard size color pics of the band.  That is why if you are a completist, or hardcore D2 fan I think you may actually appreciate the extra touches.  If you are looking for some music to listen to, save yourself 20 bucks and just get the standard CD.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|This is a good disc set with most of their best songs and it is hard to beat the live music feeling.
044024367X|5.0|Despite the poor reviews I thought this Reacher book was as fun as the rest. I've loved the last 4 of his. Each one has been unique and exciting to watch a one-man butt kicking machine take out the bad guys and make everything turn alright in the end. I wish Lee could write them faster. Like John Sandford. He's putting out two a year now. I like him as well, but he's no Lee Child. Maybe Lee could use other people to help him write like James Patterson. Then we'd have like 4 Reacher stories a year and he would make things right in all fifty states. Then head over seas and take care of people's troubles in Austalia, or India, or even Turkey. He wouldn't speak the language, but he could just punch them and be done.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|It's like being given something you never thought possible to experience.  The '78 Tour was stuff of legend....we talked about it in High School, but none of us saw Springsteen until the River Tour, 2 years later.  I never dreamed I could witness it.   The entire Darkness process is fascinating, on CD and DVD.  Even the casual Springsteen fan will freak out.  Run, don't walk, to get this collection.
030746363X|5.0|Body hacking, heightening sexual experience and becoming superhuman what's not to love. I have gone through about 80% of this book and I have loved every bit of it. I have found some really fascinating tidbits of information and I would definitely recommend to any of my friends or family.
0307346617|5.0|This is simply the best zombie book on the market.  The rest of the authors don't have the natural talent Max Brooks does.  Its well written, well thought out, well edited.  All other zombie writers seem like high school English students when compared.
0451213092|5.0|I read this book 20+ years ago and also saw the TV movie about the rescue of Ross Perot's employees from the hostage situation in Iran. I wanted my own copy to read again at my leisure ( rather than having to continue to renew it at the library). It's more exciting than fiction!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|This album has truly captured the essence of what this time of year is all about and Annie has done it in style. The production, the vocals,the choirs and the choice of songs has gone far beyond what I was expecting and I am delighted with the result.    When I heard back in August that Annie was planning to record an album full of Christmas Carols I was admittedly very skeptical. After all there are so many artists out there who do this each year ...go and record an album of festive songs except they come away with an end product full of lacklustre results.    Like 'Medusa' from 1995 this albums sounds as is if Annie had written these tradtional songs herself.  How she has the ability to make the hairs on your neck stand up just listening to these songs is sensational. 'Lullay, Lullay' is truly haunting and yet so beautiful. 'The First Noel' is majestic and yet timid starting off with just a piano and soprano backing vocals from Annie. This is then followed by the most beautiful encore of Annie and the choirs reciting 'Noel, Noel born is the King of Israel' until the song ends. Absolutely stunning.     'As Joseph Was A Walking' starts off in a rather unusual but yet cheeky manner which builds to the most majestic bridge forming another beautiful Cathedral like encore of Annie singing an almost operatic 'Hallelujah, Hallelujah' which just builds and builds with each line gaining more power and beauty, The ending of this song of Annie with the Choir is absolutely stunning. You just don't want this too end...sooooooo  beautiful.    'Silent Night' is another gorgeous number filled with tenderness, beauty and seasonal passion. The song starts almost like a lullaby with Annie and the piano in the 1st verse rising to to a choir and full orchestra in the second verse.  Absolutely wonderful, Annie!    This album for me has been the most perfect Christmas album I have ever encountered and will treasure for many many years to come.    All songs here are wonderfully performedand produced and I thoroughly recommend this to anyone.
B003NFM3JK|2.0|while the animation was superb, I still fell asleep- which rarely ever happens in movies.<br />i guess part of it was TOO over-the-top... perhaps TOO 3D heavy-handed...<br />the story isn't new- through, it is signature...<br />I'm sticking with the Muppets Christmas Carol...
0061766089|1.0|A book by the CEO of IDEO about design thinking comes with high expectations. Unfortunately, this book falls seriously short mostly because it blatantly promotes his company instead of discussing real problems, stories and solutions. All roads lead to IDEO. Done. But, is business innovation really so simple?    Tim Brown is not alone. Many CEO's write books to overtly promote their works, clients, and methodologies. I'd imagine that is why Peter Drucker, the management guru from Harvard University, gave a funny answer to a question asked by a journalist at FORTUNE Magaine - \\"What business books do you read?\\" Drucker - \\"I don't read business books. I read Shakespeare.\\"     If you want to read an excellent book about innovation, I found \\"The Victorian Internet,\\" well-written and researched. It discusses the advent of the telegraph and how its leaders came up with solutions to the myriad problems from the new technology. It provides a surprising parallel to the dot com boom of 1998-2001. By analyzing history, we are better equipped to look around corners and prepare for the future.
030746363X|5.0|Fortunately, I was able to obtain an early copy of the new book so I've already been able to write a review for The 4 Hour Body.  This book continues the writing style of 4 Hour Work Week with a dash of exceptional confidence from Tim as he's developed as a writer over the past handful of years.  You can tell he's more sure of himself in his writing and it comes out as quality entertainment value in a genre that is otherwise typically filled with stats and facts that might leave you dosing off; not so here.  While entertaining, the book is also a true guide in self-experimentation that only Mr. Ferris seems to be able to pull-off so well.  Most of the suggestions and tips are genuinely new to me, it doesn't seem to be the same old data rehashed which means I've already been able to apply some of the tips to great success!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album is so beautiful it brings me to tears almost every time I listen to it. Sufjan Stevens is a musical genius. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
B003JTHESA|3.0|When I saw the video for Final Frontier, I couldn't wait.  I went out and snatcehd up this album as soon as I saw it on the shelves.  I listened to it on the way home, and a few other places.  Unfortunately, this album just doesn't do anything for me.  I've been a Maiden fan since Seventh Son(I lost interest when Blaze took over lead vocals), and I'm just not feeling it.  I don't knopw if it's the way it's mixed or if the songs sound to much like some of their older songs, but this album just doesn't spark the fire in me that Iron Maiden should.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Fantastic Box Set at a wonderful price!  If you have been waiting to add CDs to your Beatles music library -- wait no more!  This is a great set and wonderful additions as well!
B000001FN3|1.0|After listening to the remastered version of an LP  that I just love ever since it was published, I was  truly disappointed. I threw the CD out.
B00272NH0Y|5.0|In 2005 the Rolling Stones proved once again that they've still got it. In their sixties they can rock as hard as they ever did. A BIGGER BANG is arguably the best album they've made since the 70's. It's truly amazing that they're still churning out new, vital rock n' roll in the 21rst century. This album is straight-up, grade-A Stones; their distinctive, funk-tinged rock n' roll swagger is in full effect. Mick sounds raw and dirty and he sings his heart out. Charlie swings and Keef cranks out loads of fantastic riffs. Mick's underrated guitar playing is all over the album as well. A BIGGER BANG is full of humor and heartache, sweet sentiment and raunchy sex. It's classic Stones yet it still manages to sound fresh and contemporary. No, there's nothing here that can match a song like \\"Start Me Up\\" or \\"Shattered,\\" but everything here is at least good and it all adds up to a great album. A must for any Stones fan!<br /><br />Breakdown!<br /><br />\\"Rough Justice\\" - kicks off the album in full-throttle rock n' roll overdrive. First impressions had me thinking it was a little forced to fit the bill, but now I just think it's great. The first line is classic: \\"One time you were my baby chicken/ Now you've grown into a fox/ Once upon a time I was your little rooster/ But now I'm just one of your c$$ks\\" ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Let Me Down Slow\\" - a more laid back rocker sporting some tasty slide from Ron Wood. Although it is indeed laid back, the tempo is relatively quick. Has a slight country feel. ****<br /><br />\\"It Won't Take Long\\" - rings out with a killer riff before the full band kicks in with the distinctive sound of interlocking Stones guitars. This crashing rocker finds Mick Jagger sloughing off a lover like a snake sheds its skin. *****<br /><br />\\"Rain Fall Down\\" - without a doubt one of the most impressive tracks here, this song finds the Stones in a whole new groove - sort of a quasi funk/raggae. It paints a vivid picture of intimacy and the guitars are atmospheric yet tough. Listen closely and you'll hear all kinds of interesting sonic touches including vibes and keyboard accents from Mick and a pumping bass from Darryl Jones. I've never heard them do a song quite like this one. *****+<br /><br />\\"Streets of Love\\" - a fantastic ballad with a surging chorus full of heartache. *****<br /><br />\\"Back of My Hand\\" - pure blues - old school. Mick plays slide guitar, harmonica and bass (!). As always, he blows a mean harp - simple and spot-on. And baby, he can sing the blues! ****<br /><br />\\"She Saw Me Coming\\" - cool, swinging rocker that finds another woman ripping Mick's life to shreds. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Biggest Mistake\\" - a melodic, mid-tempo rocker. I like it although it's a little tired sounding and has an ever-so-slight \\"adult contemporary\\" sound that every so often creeps into their later work. Possibly the weakest track - which is really saying something cuz it's still quite good. The guitar playing is excellent as it is throughout the entire album. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"This Place Is Empty\\" - the first of two tracks sung by Keith Richards, this is a sweet song. Nice piano from Don Was. ****<br /><br />\\"Oh No Not You Again\\" - a pumped up rocker with funny lyrics. ****<br /><br />\\"Dangerous Beauty\\" - killer guitar, killer staggered rhythm, this song is full of sexy swagger. *****<br /><br />\\"Laugh, I Nearly Died\\" - This is a compelling song, full of anguish and sorrow. It's bleak and it sounds so good. Mick pours his guts into this one. *****+<br /><br />\\"Sweet Neocon\\" - I don't think I've ever heard such an overtly political song from the Stones. This one is guaranteed to tee off Republicans. The lyrics are clever (if occasionally lazy) and the song is very catchy. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Look What The Cat Dragged In\\" - a fun rocker with more funny lyrics. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Driving Too Fast\\" - is a driving rocker with a particularly catchy bridge to the chorus and loads of great guitar riffage. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Infamy\\" - The last cut finds Keef on lead vocal again and it's good. Sports a spiraling guitar hook with an unusual tone. Mick once again blows some excellent harp. ****1/2<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!again blows some excellent harp. ****1/2     Highly recommended!!!
030745455X|4.0|This, the second in Larsson's trilogy, is a good read, as long as you are willing to suspend disbelief in a few places. I felt it was inferior to his first offering -- \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" -- but not by much.  In this sequel, we learn quite a lot more about the fascinating character Lisbeth Salander as she deals with her past and with her present as Sweden's Number One Fugitive. And crusading journalist Mikael Blomqvist is back as a constant presence throughout this book.  As you might expect, the book has a lot of action and features another one of Larsson's extremely creative and stunning plots.  As one reviewer said:  \\"Just forget about sleep\\" when you begin this book.  It's true -- it'll keep you engrossed from start to finish.
030746363X|5.0|Like what Tim did with The 4-Hour Workweek to question the 9-5 lifestyle, in The 4-Hour Body, Tim makes you question and truly think about the all the commonly held assumptions and misconceptions we have about exercise and diet. Like to reduce weight, it's not just about burning more calories than you take in, but actually focusing on what he calls the 'Minimum Effective Dose'. More is not always better when it comes to exercise and weight loss.     I just got this book a few days ago and am still reading through it. It is a massive book, but as Tim points out, you only need to read the areas of interest. Though whenever I read a few pages, I quickly turn to my wife, \\"Did you know that ...\\". This book has so many insights and talking points it really makes you question all the other information (i.e. marketing messages) on diet and exercise out there.     This is a fun read and is injected with Tim's great sense of humor. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in becoming 'Thinner, Bigger, Faster, Stronger' or who just wants to feel better physically.
B00192IV9U|1.0|I can say this as an music expert. This is him people, but the problem and also I understand where people say it's not his voice lies in the problem of cut and past. Basically in simple terms this is a rough draft. It is the the final cut period...... I can challenge anyone on that, trust me I work in the music industry where music is done, recorded,etc,etc. I have Masters Degree, I know what I am talking about. The best track in my opinion is the one with AKON period...... That is just my opinion, I am not going to argue on that, so this is the reason I give in a 1 rating.
030746363X|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy of the 4-Hour Body and was blown away!  I've worked in the health and fitness field for years and I cannot believe how many \\"real secrets\\" Tim actually reveals in his new book. From losing fat to gaining muscle their are tons of awesome tips and strategies in this book that will make a difference in anyone's physique. Get ready to take your body to the next level.
030746363X|5.0|I received this book early and can say that the advice is very unorthodox but extremely effective.  I run and lift all the time but I have always had trouble putting on weight.  Using some of Tim's recommendations on lifting and eating I've already put on two pounds in little over a week.  I've also tried two of the abb exercises and the definition I'm seeing now is better than when I was doing a full half an hour abb workout.  I've only implemented a few of the books recommendations and the results are impressive.  I can't wait to try many of the other fantastic ideas in the book. Thank you Tim.  Ignore the haters this is great.
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss has taken years to consider things that most of us only have a few minutes to think about.  With documented research and case studies, this book explains what works, as opposed to what worked for one person.  I will be keeping this book close by for years to come!  AWESOME!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is going to be a wierd review, but apropos, I think.    When I was a kid growing up in the 'burbs of Atlanta many years ago, there was a tiny white, clapboard fundamentalist church right outside our subdivision, rumours of snake handling, speaking in tongues, women without makeup, etc.    This album made me think, out of the blue after all these years, of that church. It sounds like what I imagined in my mind's eye went on in there, like how a fundamentalist camp revival meeting would sound like if the younger element took over. Heavy, building, unornamented harmony, organs, bluegrassy strings, and a little angry. I'm puzzled, because it doesn't come acrost as \\"rock\\" to me at all as some other reviewers have tagged it, but my coworker heard me playing the album, and said it reminded her of 60's music. Fascinating to me that we heard the same thing, but each got something different out of it.     It's a very unique and different sound, and darnit, I LIKE it. A very listenable, if curious sounding album, and isnt' that what we're all trying to find these days? And to reinforce the utter coolness, my daughter tells me she went to a party with a bunch of her artsy friends last week, and they had this album playing. I think I just went up a degree in uber-cool, natch.     I am shocked, though, that the band isn't from the deepest South. It just sounds so rural Southern influenced.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|2/5/11: Final postscript: Sent the SB700 to Nikon; had to wait a month (according to Nikon, they had to wait to get parts shipped); but - they did repair the flash at no charge.  Nikon's service has always been good.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />12/25/10: Update to my review - today was my first real tryout of the SB700; and unfortunately; I have to report the battery door fell apart as I was changing batteries.  The battery door design is different than past Nikon units.  There is an actual pushbutton that you need to depress to release the door.  As I was trying to open the door  - it fell apart into 3 pieces.  I'm not sure what Nikon was thinking; the old door designs seemed to work fine (aside from the SB800 w/ the removable door/battery chamber).  On a positive note; I did not have a problem w/ thermal shutdown - but - that said; I'm very disappointed in the door design and am thinking I'll probably stock up on some SB600's while they are still being manufactured.  While I hate the pushbutton setup on the SB600; at least I haven't had any reliability problems w/ the unit.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Just received the SB700 today from Amazon after a 3 month wait - I am not disappointed.  I have been a Nikon user since the 70's, and have owned every F and D pro bodies, and associated flash units.  I have seen all the reviews on the web criticizing Nikon for omitting the PC input and power input - they know if they included these features it would have killed sales of the SB900.  Like others, unless I need maximum power from my flash (which is rare); I can get by with the SB600 and most recently, the SB400 for most of my (fill) flash work.  I mainly use the flash for fill and have it on the camera 100% of the time.  For \\"walking around\\" the SB400 works great due to its size and weight.  When I need to use bounce flash, I typically use the SB600.  I still own the SB800 and SB900 but find myself rarely using them.<br /><br />The SB700 fills the gap - the best features of the flash are the smaller size and weight (vs. the SB900); easier to use controls (I hated the SB600/800 controls); and finally the hard plastic snap-on color correction filters.  Nikon needs to make these (hard) filters for the SB900 - trying to use their gels and holder in the field is crazy - you will either lose or damage the gels the first time you are working under pressure.  Also the bounce dome is also smaller than the large unit that comes w/ the SB900.<br /><br />The SB700 is the first Nikon flash I've used that seems to get the exposure right on.  Normally I have to set the flash exposure to -0.7 to get what I consider a normal exposure.  I do not have to do this on the SB700.  I also like the fact that Nikon has gone to switches (vs. menu) to switch from Auto to Manual exposure - I care less about the switch for the flash coverage as that's not a setting I change - but others who do change it will like the fact that it's easy to switch on the fly.<br /><br />Back to the power input and PC sync input - those who are fans of the Stobist are very unhappy about the inability to use their PC cords to their Pocket Wizards - most folks do not like using the PC - Hot shoe cords; one more thing to go wrong in the electrical chain.  Personally - I miss the power input for the Nikon battery packs - and although I'm sure Quantum will come out w/ a battery adapter to use w/ their packs, I haven't use my Quantum packs in years since I've converted to using the Nikon external packs that use the AA's.<br /><br />That said - think the SB700 will become the de facto standard flash; and the SB800 will continue to sell on eBay and Craig's list for more then they sold new (I'm keeping mine) for the Strobist fans.<br /><br />As to the overheating issue; haven't had the unit long enough to see if it reacts the same as the SB900 - another review said that the unit slows down on recycle time before shutting down - I've had my 900 shut down; so I have to carry a backup just in case.<br /><br />As of today (12/13/10) looks like Amazon isn't even taking orders for the unit; if you are in a hurry suggest checking your local camera store - mine told me they were getting some in periodically -<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are in the market for a Nikon flash - buy this one!0 - another review said that the unit slows down on recycle time before shutting down - I've had my 900 shut down; so I have to carry a backup just in case.    As of today (12/13/10) looks like Amazon isn't even taking orders for the unit; if you are in a hurry suggest checking your local camera store - mine told me they were getting some in periodically -     Bottom line: if you are in the market for a Nikon flash - buy this one!
030746363X|5.0|My wife and I were fortunate to receive an advanced copy of the 4 Hour Body last week and we have been reading it non-stop ever since.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br />What is the one thing I would say about this book?<br />---------------------------------------<br />I wish I had written it! This is the book I would have loved to spend three years doing research on... and I would have been proud of the end result if it turned out anywhere close to the product that the author has. I know that this book will be extremely helpful to millions of people.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br />Why do I like it?<br />---------------------------------------<br />The 4 Hour Body is a wonderful blend of practical \\"how to\\" suggestions and advice mixed in with entertaining stories. As someone who has struggled with my weight for the last 20 years, The 4 Hour Body connects with me on a level that no other book or program has done. Why? Instead of preaching, it provides a set of tools to pick and choose from and helps foster a productive way of thinking about one's body. 1) start with small goals targeted to MY NEEDS, 2) track everything, and 3) compare & challenge with a group.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br />My top 3 \\"likes\\":<br />---------------------------------------<br />It's practical:<br />The 4 Hour Body was crafted in sections so that if someone is primarily concerned with a specific goal (ie. weight loss, muscle gain, strength gain, well being) there are a group of chapters that are recommended reading just for each desired outcome. So even though the book is 550 pages, someone can read 150 pages and take away what they need for their desired outcome. It also focuses on the \\"individual\\". We are all different and we must create and test our own individual programs for optimal outcomes. He also includes great resource links that encourage immediate action.<br /><br />It's entertaining:<br />The 4 Hour Body is probably the most entertaining health related book I have read. It does dive into the details, but Tim has a wonderful style of weaving interesting and fun stories into each chapter, which makes reading easy.<br /><br />Better sex!<br />Ok, I confess. When we received the book last week the first chapter my wife and I dove into were the chapters on Improving Sex. The reality is that like everything in life, good sex comes with education, attention and practice... and we are always open to learning new things. Most people have no idea what they are missing and settle for sub-par relationships that include minimal if any sex at all. And, watching porn is not sex education. Even talking about the subject in any detail seems to have become taboo. In these chapters, Tim has done a great job of researching, laying out practical suggestions and then providing research links. We have been turning off our computers and TV and instead have been reading the chapters out load every night in bed - which in of itself has had a great bonding effect on us as a couple.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br />Conclusion:<br />---------------------------------------<br />I highly recommend The 4 Hour Body. I have enjoyed it so much that my wife and I have purchased another 5 copies (in different orders because of the 3 book limit!!) of the book and an audio copy to give to family & friends. I liked it so much that it compelled me to take the time to write this review - my first review ever.does dive into the details, but Tim has a wonderful style of weaving interesting and fun stories into each chapter, which makes reading easy.

B0042FZWC0|5.0|\\"You don't have to live the life that other people expect you to.\\" That is the central conceit of this book and most of Chris' writing. I've been a huge fan of his for over a year (reading much of the content and his site, under the same title). I firmly believe that the life I'm now living (working from my laptop anywhere in the world and purchasing one-way tickets for $5) wouldn't exist without the AONC guidance. I even flew to Oahu just to meet Chris, paying only $2.50 to get there! As others have said, \\"if you've ever thought `there must be more to life than this,' this book is for you!\\"

030746363X|5.0|Received my prerelease copy of this book back in November, thanks to Tim's team.  That put me in a tough spot, with a sudden wealth of fascinating and useful information available.....at the end of the semester.  Fortunately, I have been putting some of Tim's other tricks to good work and despite a courseload of 27 credits, some grad, some undergrad, I've already perused substantial portions of this book at my leisure.  It's an absolute goldmine of information.  Take what you like from it and happily disregard the rest, unless you happen to somehow be obesely flaco..  Gotta love the way Tim breaks things down to their simplest so we can rebuild them for ourselves.  Thank you.
0553805371|4.0|The text was written for the average reader which I am. I understand the concepts but is very hard to accept.
076790592X|5.0|I loved this book!  I loved it so much that I bought a few copies as Christmas gifts just today.  It teaches you about living even though one of the main characters is dying.  It is as spokend from someone who knows he only has so much time left and wants to make the most of every moment and every person in his life.  A must read for everyone!  Just a note, it is based on a true story and is a real character.  It makes all the more worthwhile reading.  How would you think in those last weeks of your life if you knew you only had so long left?  He handles it beautifully and teaches us so much through his thoughts and words.

B002NXSRVG|2.0|Remember how Michael Bay and Shia LaBarf dropped a steaming deuce on your childhood memories of Transformers?  Well, the crew responsible for the miasma lingering around this rendition of GI Joe have upped the ante.<br /><br />Starting off with the bad, this is a collection of some of the worst acting and casting in movie history.  Siena Miller and Rachel Nichols look gorgeous the entire movie, but their more serious roles were on runways and in Dumb and Dumberer, respectively.  Channing \\"Pinocchio\\" Tatum reprises his emotionless military figure from Stop-Loss while perfecting acting without facial expressions of voice inflection that he flawlessly pulled off in Dear John.  Others like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are all brought down by the rest.  To make matters worse, the guy playing Snake Eyes doesn't have any lines and he's the best actor.  The biggest travesty, however, is that Dennis Quaid was relegated to horribly predictable one-liners that serve no purpose other than to echo the mid-movie comments made by viewers who have figured out every storyline twist and turn eons before they occur.  His part may as well have been a holographic face in the top-right corner of the screen with a robotic voiceover.  Speaking of voiceovers, did I mention how horrible Tatum is?  My goodness, I feel like I just divided by zero, because the impossible has happened: there is an actor in Hollywood worse than Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />The flaws and plot-holes are so numerous they are not worth mentioning, but would it kill someone to remake a movie and stick even remotely close to the original storyline that everyone already loved?  The nonsensical side stories with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow didn't happen; there was no engagement between Duke and Baroness - and definitely wasn't a connection between Scarlett and Ripcord.  And what they did with Cobra Commander - making him a scientist with secretive ties to GI Joe members - is absolutely ridiculous.  None of these plot add-ons resonate with new viewers, much less attract longtime fans.<br /><br />As for the plot-holes, pick your favorites; they are too numerous to mention.  The overabundance of extras (e.g. nanotechnology, unnecessary background, underwater jets, strange energy rays, acceleration suits, multi-billion dollar facilities under the polar ice caps and the Egyptian deserts, etc.) is at times interesting and at others maddening.  It's just too much to be coherent.  The inclusion of multi-national forces in an organization that is supposed to be American (Hello! A real American hero...) is a slap in the face to the GI Joe canon.  Seeing soldier chums Duke (Tatum) and Ripcord (Wayans) wiggle their way into this ultra-secretive and best-of-the-best military commando unit because, you know, they really want to, is just too much to bear.<br /><br />If you're into this for the action and special effects (read: more CGI than Toy Story), and you loved the Transformer movies, then I suppose you'll like it.  I'd rather have the shade of gray that provides a bit more story, significantly better dialogue, and actors who can't be easily replaced by mannequins.  Overall it's just a little bit of good (i.e. Miller and Nichols in form-fitting, cleavage-producing outfits, and Snake Eyes' fight scenes) in a pile of garbage (i.e. acting, casting, CGI, plot, directing).<br /><br />Jason Elinns resonate with new viewers, much less attract longtime fans.

030746363X|5.0|I was fortunate to receive an advanced copy of \\"The Four-Hour Body.\\"  From the day it arrived, it did not disappoint.  Tim clearly put a tremendous amount of work into making this book ridiculously comprehensive and well-researched, but what was just as impressive was that he maintained a formal tone when writing it so that it was still very entertaining (which is key, because he has a TON of cool stories to share).    My only complaint is that it's a very long book that I couldn't put down - which, of course, is a good problem to have!    Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy; you won't regret it.
0307454541|5.0|I picked up \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" several weeks ago just out of curiosity. It looked like it would be a good enough read to kill a couple of hours. Hey, it's cheap on the Kindle--and if I didn't like it, surely the electrons are easy enough to throw away without causing me the same distress as dumping a book would.<br /><br />Wow, this is a great book--well written, complex enough to keep me interested, good characters.  It's the usual thing that a book falls into one of two categories--either a fun plot, but poor character development, or really good characters and poor plot development...and oh yes, mediocre everything. We all have experience with those, I guess.<br /><br />I imagine that this must have been translated from the Swedish. It could have been written by any Brit (there are British references--the \\"boot\\" of a car, for instance)but the language does not get in the way of a very entertaining story. I hate it when the sentences are either so garbled in the translation that there are phrases within phrases within sentences; the translation is transparent to the reader.<br /><br />This novel flows very well, keeps you guessing, has great characters that are reasonably well developed and can stand on their own.  You come in in the middle of the story, where each character has a full history of his or her own that makes sense in suggesting how the character will move in the tale.<br /><br />This novel is exceptionally well crafted and deserves success here. I understand that the movie has been cast.  I am distressed to hear about the demise of the author.
B002BI6SMI|2.0|Liam is an amazing actor that usually chooses roles that allow him to flex his acting muscles.  This is not one of them.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first book. LOVED IT. I really enjoyed the second, and was excited for the third (for the record, this series was recommended to me and I read all three books in about 4 days). And like many reviewers, when I finished Mockingjay I wasn't sure how I felt about it. I was disappointed in Katniss' character, in the ending, in the many chapters that ended in blackouts.    But what really bothered me was the things that were casually tossed around without much detail. The districts have united (we hear that 2 are in rebel control, then suddenly all but District 2 are against the capitol). Gale goes to 2 and their friendship is over (how do two people who are that connected just split without saying anything to each other? Although the character of Gale wasn't really fleshed out, it isn't in what we know of his character to just leave Katniss, even if she can't love him the way he wants her to, without more than two sentences spoken between them). Katniss shoots Coin (but with little to no reasoning). Katniss votes for the Hunger Games (again, we are in her mind throughout the series, and yet she doesn't think about this much at all and we're given little reasoning for it.) Peeta and Katniss 'grow back together'. (After all those 2 had been through, I wanted to SEE this, to HEAR them talk to see more of the small moments).    However, the first and second books WERE really good...so I'm left at a loss as to how to feel about this book. In fact, this book needed to be two books. A third book needed to focus on Katniss recovering from the second trip to the arena, district 13, becoming a soldier and working to unite the districts. She needed to make a choice instead of the running/hiding bit (which is understandable at first with what she's been through). She needed to play an active role in rescuing Peeta. All these things, with the proper pacing and action, with much more detail would have made a good book. In fact, a good place to end would have been with herblacking out after being attacked by Peeta.     A fourth book should have covered Peeta's recovery and Katniss' reaction to him, the attack on the Capitol, the aftermath (which we should have gotten to know more about instead of just the drug/prison bit) and her future. Again, with much more detail.    That is what is wrong with this book...it feels like a skimmed account, a summary of events instead of a conclusion of a good series. It could have been so much more. I wanted so much more! I feel a bit cheated...but the series IS worth reading!

030746363X|4.0|The volume of content in the 4-Hour Body is only rivaled by it's ease of reading. Tim Ferris combines a wealth of information with personal and easy to read anecdotes of his own experiences in his quest to hack his body. Many of the reviews here have already hit the hight points of the useful content so I will only add that what makes this book really amazing is that it would be a good read even if you desired none of the actual advice. Tim Ferris's style comes through the pages and makes this an fun and entertaining read. The reason that I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that although this book is chock full of info, it is quite broad. There were a number of instances where I would have loved to have gotten one level deeper in detail on how to do certain exercises or how certain diets worked.

1593272790|5.0|I've been playing, building, and teaching with LEGO (particularly Technic and Mindstorms) for years, and am familiar with most of the books either directly or indirectly related to the Mindstorms range that have been published over that time. I am confident that Isogawa's work is unique. I bought Isogawa's Japanese \\"orange book\\" when it was published, and have found it to be an invaluable resource, for both my own designs and in the classroom. This series goes further though, and is in English! (Even though the core of these books require no translation, it helps to have the table to contents in English - and more readily available in the west.) The models are colourful, clear and very easy to follow.     Nobody is going to have all the parts to make each and every model in these books (except, presumably Isogawa!), but that's not the point. The value of these books is in the ideas that the models convey. Whether you're looking for a solution to a specific design challenge (eg. \\"How could I convert rotational movement to linear movement?\\"), or just flicking through for ideas of what to create next, these books are a great way of overcoming \\"designer's block\\".    All in all, a great series!
B003Y58CKS|5.0|Performances of \\"Rigoletto\\" (both on CD and DVD) are plentiful, and there are so many out there that it's pretty difficult to decide on one definitive version.  Most opera buffs will have several versions.  I've heard and seen most of these CDs and and DVDs, and all of them have something to say in one way or another.  That said, I'm just about ready to consider this incredible DVD performance from Dresden as the best one of the lot.  The entire opera emerges as something fresh and new.  A portion of this success comes from the tautness of the drama that is achieved by conductor Fabio Luisi.  His pacing of the opera is compelling, dramatic, yet always beautiful.  The three principal roles are taken by three outstanding artists ---- opera superstars all.  Zeljko Lucic, who's already proven himself as one of the great Verdi baritones of the day (his Macbeth at the Met was extraordinary), is to me anyway, the greatest Rigoletto since Tito Gobbi (who recorded the opera with Maria Callas and Giuseppe di Stefano in the legendary EMI La Scala recoding).  He rages, he schemes, he contorts, and his love for his daughter Gilda is poignant and moving.   Gilda herself has rarely appeared as lovely as Diana Damrau makes her.  She's a top notch coloratura soprano, yet never resorts to the \\"pecking\\" and \\"coo-coo\\" bird sounds that have plagued so many coloratura sopranos.  She produces a beautiful legato line, especially in the beautiful \\"Tutte le feste\\", where she tells her father about what was perpetrated on her.  Yet at the same time, she has a florid technique which enables her to sing a perfectly controlled \\"Caro Nome\\", with all the coloratura embellishments.  It's a masterful performance to set alongside such Gilda interpreters as Erna Berger, Maria Callas, and Anna Moffo (all three of whom made Gilda far more than the usual cardboard coloratura songbird),                Finally, it's the Duke of Juan Diego Florez which puts the frosting on the this delicious cake.  Hesang this role first in Lima, and followed it up in this Dresden production.  He reportedly decided after these Dresden \\"Rigoletto\\" performances that he didn't feel \\"vocally comfortable\\" with it (this role is somewhat weightier than the Rossini-Bellini-Donizetti \\"bel canto\\" operas that he specializes in) and has not undertaken it since.  While I commend him for the care and attention he pays to his magnificent \\"tenore di grazia\\" vocal endowment,  I can emphatically say that he sounds as fabulous as ever without a hint of strain or effort.  His Duke is truly young, energetic, and superbly sung.   Florez may well again decide to sing this role at a later time, but how fortunate that he is captured here on this great DVD.          I cannot recommend this performance strongly enough.  Yes ---- it's THAT good!
030746363X|5.0|The Four Hour Workweek completely changed my life and the way I view work and my career, and in this book, Tim takes the same mind-bending, life-hacking approach to your body as he did to our time and our ideas of career.<br /><br />The book's divided into four rough sections:<br /><br />Losing the Fat<br />Gaining Muscle<br />Having a Hot Sex Life<br />Generally Amping Up Performance<br /><br />He suggests you start with two goals, one for appearances and one for how you feel and perform, and get started. Each chapter has a bunch of crazy stories of Tim testing out different techniques and blunt appraisal of what worked and didn't. At the end of each chapter are the main points of what exactly to do to lose fat, for example.<br /><br />Not everyone's going to want to take all the advice. He recommends a number of supplements and really odd techniques that some of us might not want to do. But the great thing is that there are tricks here for everyone, and different stages of tips so that if you're really serious, you can get serious results, and if you're just wanting a small change, you can take on some of the simplest tricks.<br /><br />The diet he espouses is a slow-carb, which is basically eating no grains, fruit, sugar or dairy, but plenty of meat, beans and veggies most of the week, with a cheat day once a week or so where you spike your calories and eat everything. I tried it for four months last year and it wasn't too painful, though I found that for me, a Paleo diet (similar only a heavier focus on natural foods with fruits and a few starchier veggies encouraged, no legumes, and no cheat day) works better long-term. I lost one pant size on the slow-carb, gained it back when I stopped watching my food intake, then lost it in a shorter period of time with the Paleo diet.<br /><br />The nice thing about slow-carb is you don't get grouchy or low-blood sugar. The thing I disliked about it was that the cheat day kind of threw off my progress each week and made me want icky foods again, though usually by the day before I was happily settled in my meals again with few cravings. I thought the cheat day actually made the diet harder to stick to, while with Paleo it's kind of the out-of-sight-out-of-mind principle. I don't miss what I don't eat.<br /><br />Beyond the diet though, he shows some unusual ways of hacking fat loss and other parts of your life. With fat loss, he shows evidence for using cold compresses on our one area of brown adipose tissue to speed weight loss thermogenically, shows the results of supplements he took and shows how well-timed bursts of 90-second exercise can get you more gains than a long grueling workout.<br /><br />If you've read other diet books and are feeling jaded, this one's different. You're not sure to love it, but you're sure to hear some weird hacks in here that you've never heard mentioned before. And he swears a lot and is extremely blunt and funny, so worst case scenario, you'll be entertained!<br /><br />I got this book early since Tim had run a special on his blog that anyone buying four copies of the Four Hour Workweek could get an advance copy of this, which is how I got to read it before the release date.was happily settled in my meals again with few cravings.

B003ZTQN1I|4.0|I stopped listening to country music after the genre became nothing but corny pop trash, but Gwyneth Paltrow gives me renewed hope in what modern country music can be. \\"Country Strong\\" is probably one of the best country songs I have heard in a while and it's a great blend of traditional country and modern country. \\"Coming Home\\" is simply beautiful and touching because it tells my story in such a simple way. \\"Shake That Thing\\" is the only uptempo song she offers, but its weak. Its still not a bad song, but its not stellar compared to her other songs. \\"Me and Tennessee\\" is the best song on this soundtrack. Tim McGraw is actually featured more on this track than Gwyneth, but their harmonies are beautiful together. Gwyneth should actually consider releasing a country-pop album. Faith Hill's song is both different and wonderful. Increasingly, her vocals are not limited to country. She has the ability to take a bad song and make it amazing. Sara Evan's \\"A Little Bit Stronger\\" is very moving and talks about a woman struggle with a broken heart. The other artists and songs are good, but its clear that this project is about Gwyneth!
B00127RAJY|2.0|When I bought this video, I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into.  I wanted weight training and core work to compliment my cardio workouts (swimming and running daily).  I got this video because it had highest rating on Amazon.  I was very disappointed.     I started at Level 1 as recommended and found that it was not for me. I promptly switched to level 3.    Pros: Short.  Good cardio and you will work up a sweat. Some arm work, but not likely to build many muscles.    Cons: Not good leg or abs workout.   There is a fair amount of jumping, which is NOT recommended for people who have bad knees, especially if you have a few extra pounds.  The warmup and cool-down are also a bit too short.      Overall I would not recommend this video for beginners or for experienced athletes.

I have to say this is a great instrumental album, while it's different from his early works like Surfing with the aliens, Extremist and etc you know it still has this Hard Rock and Blues feel to it. One of my favorites tracks on this album is Light Years Away, The golden Room, Wind of the Trees and Littleworth Lane I thought the LYA track felt like you where in Outer Space *laughs*, I thought the other tracks from this album had pretty cool solos and effects thats been added.  This Album will not disappoint at all, if your a Joe Satriani fan from way back...you'll love what you hear.
030746363X|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting!  Lots of very cool stuff.  But it's also got a lot of stuff that is not for everyone.  Even if you only read half the book, I feel like I got more than my money's worth.  Just pick and choose the parts that interest you most.  I definitely recommend it!
030746363X|5.0|This monster of a book could be used for resistance training. Seriously, tie a short rope around it for a makeshift kettlebell.    Despite the onslaught of facts, figures, graphs, and really-long-chemical-names-like-glycoribulastimate, Tim has found a way to make this book instantly useful. He very clearly gives you a methodology for jumping in and quickly \\"hacking the book\\" to get the basic information for your particular needs.     I like that there are a lot of small \\"hacks\\" you can put into action immediately. No need to commit entirely to an unwieldy, hard-to-stick-to system.    I usually hate books like this because they spend most of the pages saying, \\"and if you read on to the next chapter, I'm going to reveal the secret.\\" Not so with Tim-- he slaps you in the face with actionable ideas immediately.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|The Fountainhead has spectacular images and the story is well written. I recommend this movie for people who like to watch old classics. This movie has a wonderful message in it too. However, I won't say what it is in this review to not spoil the plot! However, I would definitely buy from this seller again off of Amazon. Thank you for sending it so quickly!!
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I really enjoyed Band of Brothers, and was looking forward to the Pacific. It is No Band of Brothers!! Horribly executed, poor character depictions, ridiculous story lines. It really was disappointing.  There was too much emphasis placed on how horrible war is, how terrible the killing is (as if anyone needs to be reminded of this), and not enough emphasis on the extraordinary accomplishments of the military in the Pacific. I wish the producers/directors had focused on telling us a good story rather than using the series to ineptly promote their political agenda. Really disappointing. Rent it from the library if you'd like to see it; don't waste your money.
0061730335|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind tells the story of William Kamkwamba from Kasungu, Malawi, Africa.  He is the oldest son in a poor but loving family.  When extreme famine (made worse by the country's governmental ineptness and corruption) comes upon his country, William's parents are unable to send him to school.  They have no money, no crops to sell, and are barely able to feed their family.  With time on his hands and no farm work to fill his time, William spends each day in the school library (a very small room that has only a few shelves of used books) and teaches himself about electricity and wind power.  He is successful in making a working windmill using discarded found items and a few items purchased with the monetary help of his cousin.  This windmill furnishes a small amount of electric power to the Kamkwamba family home, and becomes the inspiration for other village projects.      William's wonderful windmill brings attention to himself and fame to his village, and is the direct reason he was finally given the opportunity to further his education.  He gained more notoriety when he was invited to speak at the prestigious TED conference.  William wanted to attend school with a fierceness of heart.  He embraced learning and knew (just as his parents knew) that education was the way to better his life.  His story is a tribute to what the human spirit can endure and achieve.  This book is also an amazing window into another culture and shows us once again how much people are alike.
B0026LYM5U|4.0|Without a doubt replacing Anneke would be impossible, and finding a female lead that would fit the band would be nearly impossible.  When I first heard The Gathering back in 2000, I feel in love with the band and their Progressive Metal sound and love their more Trip rock/Progressive Pop somber sound.  While Silje Wergeland is no Anneke, she is a prefect fit for the more Progressive Rock sound of the band and this Album really shows this.  This album is yet just another must have for any fan of The Gathering.
0882847953|5.0|I love this book! Why? Because it works. I was first introduced to this book by my own teacher and mentor, Chuck Silverman; I use it every day in both my teaching practice and my own personal practice. My students soon realize that a book that looks simple at first glance can offer a multitude of skill building exercise when applying creative ideas to it.<br /><br />The book is broken down into two main sections, 1) \\"Note-Reading Rhythms/Exercises\\" which contains 12 lessons and with 16 bar, 20 bar, 40 bar or 48 bar exercises at the end of each lesson and, 2) \\"Syncopation\\" which contains two syncopation sets, nine exercise and five lessons:<br /><br />Section One: \\"Note-Reading Rhythms/Exercises\\"<br />1. Lesson One - playing quarter notes, quarter rests and half rests.<br />2. Lesson Two - playing quarter notes, quarter rests and half rests in unison.<br />3. Lesson Three - playing quarter notes, quarter rests and half independently.<br />4. Lesson Four - playing eighth notes and quarter notes.<br />5. Lesson Five - playing dotted eighth/sixteenth notes.<br />6. Lesson Six - playing eighth-note triplets and quarter notes.<br />7. Lesson Seven - playing eighth-note triplets, eighth notes and quarter notes.<br />8. Lesson Eight - playing eighth-note triplets, and dotted eighth/sixteenth notes.<br />9. Lesson Nine - playing sixteenth notes and quarter notes.<br />10. Lesson Ten - playing sixteenth notes and eighth notes.<br />11. Lesson Eleven - playing sixteenth notes and eighth notes.<br />12. Lesson Twelve - playing eighth notes, eighth rests and quarter notes.<br /><br />Section Two: \\"Syncopation\\"<br />1. Syncopation set one.<br />2. Syncopation set one.<br />3. Exercise 0ne.<br />4. Exercise Two.<br />5. Exercise Three.<br />6. Exercise Four.<br />7. Exercise Five.<br />8. Exercise Six.<br />9. Exercise Seven.<br />10. Exercise Eight.<br />11. Exercise Nine.<br />12. Lesson One - accented eighth notes.<br />13. Lesson Two - accented dotted-eighth/sixteenth notes.<br />14. Lesson Three - accented eighth-note triplets.<br />15. Lesson Four - Triplets with mixed sticking.<br />16. Lesson Five - Accented sixteenth notes.<br /><br />Ted Reed's genius is that the book is written in simple progressive skill building exercises designed to increase note and rest recognition as well as rhythm recognition. What I think is an important aspect to \\"... Syncopation for the Modern Drummer\\" is that Ted added a bass drum line played on the count (quarter notes). In my opinion, this is essential when playing any single surface exercise on snare drum or drum pad. To help create timing and independence I recommend my students play both feet on the count (1, 2, 3, 4) and use a metronome at very practice session. I also recommend that my \\"beginner\\" students study the book first \\"as written\\" before we progress into more creative ways of using this book.<br /><br />Speaking of creative ways to use the lesson exercises in \\"Progressive Steps to Syncopation for the Modern Drummer\\" here are a few:<br /><br />-Use them as fills by playing each measure on a different drum.<br />-Play an ostinato* with the hands and left foot while the right foot plays written exercise.<br />-Play an ostinato with the right hand and feet while the left hand plays written exercise.<br />-Play a foot ostinato pattern while playing written exercise hand to hand (left hand plays small tom, right hand plays large tom).<br />-Interpret eighth note exercise as triplets<br />-Play sixteenth note exercise as accents and rests as diddles.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars.<br /><br />* A motif or phrase which is persistently repeated in the same musical voiceented sixteenth notes.

B000NWMJ7C|5.0|I was very pleased when I received this book.  It was just as described and when I thought it may have been lost, was even more pleased when the seller provided me with detailed tracking from USPS. I received my book that same day!
030746363X|5.0|This book is fascinating, couldn't put it down, it's crazy that none of this information was available before. Great job Tim!
0789318245|5.0|Pretty classy looking book. Nice history of tattooing and the pictures are a great collection for anyone into the classic/historical tattoo narrative.
0689865384|4.0|I loved this book. I loved it's fast pace, it's cast, and it's flying and jumping off of things.    I feel that Uglies paved the way for the YA Dystopian genre. I'm sure it wasn't the absolute first (although, now I'm wondering what was?) but it holds many similarities to other dystopians I've read. Not in the writing or the characters or the plot, but in the idea that in the future, we will all be forced to undergo some sort of operation at a certain age, to make us less human. Something that started out with good intentions, like making everyone equally pretty as in this book, but paved the path for a tyrant to come in and take over.    Uglies is one of those books. When one reaches the age of sixteen, in this world, you go under the knife and come out...pretty. They shape your bones and your eyes and your lips. The scrub off any marks on your skin and suction off all your fat. They make you gorgeous. Unbelievably gorgeous. Just like everyone else.    More than the story or the characters, or perhaps not MORE than but alongside all of the traditional parts of telling a story Scott Westerfeld tries to ascertain whether or not this is a good thing or not. Whether or not all the insecurity and self-doubt and self-consciousness that afflicts us as teenagers and young adults can be solved by changing the way we look. This spoke to me a lot. I don't know that I would be able to turn this down even now that I'm twenty five (and have read a LOT of cautionary fiction) so it is very easy to identify with Tally, the main character. I completely understand why she wants to be Pretty. All her friends are Pretty. She has been brought up on the idea that she isn't just ugly, she is an Ugly. Her whole being right now needs to be different so that she can fit it. Authority figures have been telling her this all her life.    So, the idea that she would betray a friend, especially so new a friend, when her Pretty operation is withheld from her is completely believable and understandable. And also awesome because it sends her on a hover-boarding adventure across a deserted landscape of future earth. I especially enjoyed the way the setting was described because it could have been anywhere, on any continent, the aftermath of any part of civilization. It felt the same and yet different from anything else I've read like it.    The world building was exceptional in this story.    As were the characters. Tally's longing to become Pretty and join her friends was palpable. It made the whole story stick together. Her complete and utter belief that she was ugly and inferior and needed to be different. Needed to have someone else change her, was, in a way, just as I'd felt as a teenager but was also a million times worse.    Shay, Tally's friend who runs away from the city just before her Pretty operation, was very simple on the surface but the more I think about it, the more complex and important she was. All her appearances in the beginning seem to serve some sort of purpose to the plot. Whether it be teaching Tally to use the hover-board or being the runaway that forces others to send Tally out into the wild searching for her. But the relationship the two develop outside of the city is different and her character became more alive to me then. I can't wait to see where the rest of the series takes Shay.    And then there's David, who, despite being an ugly past the age of sixteen, seemed to be the most attractive character in this book. I loved his confidence and his authority and his connection to Tally. A lot of spoilers are wrapped up in why I love David so much so I'm not going to say anything more, except if he and Tally don't end up together, I'm gong to be unhappy.    After years and years of not reading this book, I've owned for it at least two yours, what prompted me to pick it up was, well, Scott Westerfeld was in town and man does he know how to put on an author event. If he is ever doing an event near you, go. Don't think twice about it. Hewas funny, informative, entertaining, and just had some awesome things to say. As I went to his very last tour stop for Behemoth I respect his ability to keep things sounding fresh and new even though he must have shown those same slides a million times.    Stayed tuned to future Flashback Fridays when I review the next two books in the series.
B002Q9VPFM|1.0|The product is not as advertised. I bought this because I wanted both the Ultimate Cut DVD and the Theatrical Cut digital copy, which Amazon claims this product includes. However, the digital copy has already expired and there is no way to unlock the disc it comes on. Do not buy this expecting to get both the Ultimate Cut and Theatrical Cut, as the digital copy will no longer work.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|This is one of my favorite Sci-Fi films. Great visuals, great story.. love the film and cant say enough. !!MORE IMPORTANTLY!! I purchased this blu-ray to experience the enhanced 1080p experience. My only player is my PS3. I have now come to find out this blu-ray will not run on the most current firmware update of the PS3. The PIP(picture-in-picture) commentary cannot be disabled. This for me makes the film unwatchable. I say again, if you are planning on watching this on a PS3 with the current firmware you will not be able to disable this most annoying special feature! ( Approx 10 times during the film a window will pop up with a some video of behind the scenes stuff. This will play over the movie, and for me ruins the experience.)    You have been warned!  Dave C.
030746363X|5.0|I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy of the Four Hour Body a couple of weeks ago. I've read through about 2/3 of it since then, and have to say I'm extremely impressed by the content.    I know that given the almost braggadocious title, it's easy to be a bit skeptical about a book like this. However, in reading through the content, it becomes very clear what level of rigorous personal testing and experimentation Tim has put into this material. He has tons of data to back up his observations, and he makes it very entertaining to read and apply.     One caveat I'll throw in here is that you should NOT expect a thoroughly scientific approach to all of the topics covered by the book. Generally speaking, Tim hasn't gone out and conducted extensive studies on large groups of people to prove his conclusions. If, rather, you take the book for what it actually claims to be - one guy's well-reasoned observations about what has worked for him and for a good number of other people - then you will be very pleased with ownership of The Four Hour Body.
030746363X|5.0|I'll admit, after reading all Tim's health/fitness stuff on his blog over the years, I'm a Tim Ferriss fanboy. But that doesn't change the fact that this book is incredible! I was lucky enough to get my copy on December 2nd, which means I've read the entire book already. Yes, it's like 600 pages, but I just couldn't put it down once I got going!<br /><br />The book reads kind of like Tim's diary. Each chapter is like a diary entry of Tim's experience doing something specific, and even if you don't put any of the advice into action for yourself, it's still so much fun to read! It's like you're getting the inside scoop on how elite athletes do things. And it's not the same crap you see in popular mainstream magazines and whatnot. Yes, some of the information is available in other areas, but only if you know what to look for and where to look.<br /><br />So as far as reading it goes, it's fun enough that Tim could say \\"April Fools, none of this works!\\" at the end and it would have still been worth reading.<br /><br />There's not much to say about the content other than it's the real deal. The chapter names might sound over the top, but I can personally vouch for some of the techniques and strategies. So I believe that just about everything in the book actually delivers results. Of course, you can't just read the book and instantly lose 100 pounds of fat, pack on 20 pounds of muscle, or have a deteriorating rotator cuff magically heal itself. That will take time, effort, and money.<br /><br />And if you think it's going to be easy or practical to live on 2 hours of sleep each night, you've got another thing coming.<br /><br />But for the cost of this book, you get tremendous value! Personally the \\"Reversing Permanent Injuries\\" chapter has certainly saved me thousands of dollars in wasted medical treatments and shown me some better options to try first. I mean, it costs me more in gas money to travel to the doctor's office (where I then spend way too much money) than I paid for this book! If you consider how much time, effort, and money it takes to research experts, travel across the country to get treated or trained by them, you see how nice it is to have some of the work done for you by Tim.<br /><br />Now quit wasting time reading and just order the book already. It's well worth it. Anyone giving this book a bad review either hasn't read the book or has no concept of health, fitness, or sports performance. Either that or they are already an Olympic-caliber athlete in perfect physical condition who thought this book applied to them, rather than the other 99% of people in the world.uch time, effort, and money it takes to research experts, travel across the country to get treated or trained by them, you see how nice it is to have some of the work done for you by Tim.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've been using this for about a month now and am hard pressed to come up with any complaints about it. I've watched Avatar and Inception using them and played about 20hrs of Black Ops and the added detail in sounds is amazing. I was really surprised how much detail I was missing though my 5.1 stereo. The sound is very balanced, and I like how the bass never over powers anything else. I have let two of my friends try them out and they have gone out and purchased a set for themselves.   From reading reviews I was concerned about interference from my wireless router, but only experienced a few pops/breakups in the first minute i connected it while it hopped to a new frequency. Since then no issues at all (the router is about 8ft away from the base).  In my opinion it was money well spent. I really enjoy it, and have recommended it to others.
030726999X|5.0|I found this book to be just as quick moving and exciting as the first two.  I loved lisbeth's courage and how she stood by her friends and worked with them when she needed to solve problems.  I found the swedish history and the translation very interesting,  I wish there could be more of these books.  It is very sad that Mr. Larsson has passed on. Wonderful of Amazon to sell at such an great price.
B00461BQC0|4.0|I suppose I fall into the category of fans that KOL shunned this year, as I'm a 35 year old suburban woman (love it when celebrities shun their fans--in this case soccer moms)...but I do just love this band; this feels a bit less edgy than Only by the Night, but I hadn't heard the lead vocal before, and it blew my mind!!
0307454541|5.0|I had heard about the Millennium trilogy, but didn't have any desire to read these books until the first one was available as a downloadable file from my local library.<br /><br />It took a while to get used to all the characters that are thrown at the reader right away. Also it took a while to get used to all the Swedish and all the locations in Stockholm and the rest of the country (especially since I had to look all the streets up online).<br /><br />The narrative is kind of dry and stilted. Sometimes it's pretty obvious that I am reading a book translated from another language. It doesn't help that many British words are used vice more familiar Americans (gaol/jail).<br /><br />Also the story doesn't really start in earnest until a part of the way in.<br /><br />Once past all of that though it took off. I have never ever read a book like this before. I can't even say what is different about it. The rambling storyline, Lisbeth Salander's \\"unique\\" personality, various Vangers (the extended family), the mystery at the heart of the book, all make this book interesting. Waiting to hear more about Lisbeth's past kept me going too (I suppose a lot of those questions will be answered in the second book).<br /><br />There is a reason why most of the world is reading these books. And, of course, the irony of the fact that the author can't even enjoy his success because he passed away.<br /><br />But at least we have the three books. Hopefully the fourth one will be written posthumously the way Robert Jordan's last books were written after Jordan's death.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|Nearly everything in this film is spot on until the final act; Aronofsky takes the story from deliciously dizzying to borderline ridiculous. You could feel the audience collectively refuse to suspend disbelief enough to have any sort of satisfaction at this curtain call. A shame that the bad ending spoils an otherwise beautiful and intriguing experience.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I received my package two days before the actual delivery date. I found nothing wrong and am a very happy customer. Thank you!
0596805888|5.0|I read the review on this from BoingBoing.net, and it sounded pretty good.  I ended up grabbing two copies (one as a Christmas gift).  Since I received my copy, I find myself reading it for almost every occasion.  It's not just a cookbook full of recipes.  It's an instruction manual for hacking together any meal!  From gravies to haute cuisine, this book breaks down the science behind making a great meal.      Interviews, cooking times, dry ice, maltodextrin and kitchen equipment.  The author didn't miss anything.  Learn to make a $10k Gin and Tonic for a fraction of the price!!  This book is the whip!  BUY THE BOOK!!

030746363X|5.0|When I first heard of this book, even though my wife Tracy is featured in it,I didn't think it would be a serious look at serious training. I thought it would try to appeal to the dilettantes who wanted to 'get toned' and lose a few pounds while walking on their treadmills.    How wrong was I?! This is the real deal,and Tim has done what the best athletes and coaches do; reverse engineer solutions to serious training issues by looking at what the best do naturally. BUT he has taken it a step further by truly trying to find the shortest path to the solution.    Tim describes himself as a \\"life hacker\\" trying to find the most effective shortcuts to anything he wants to accomplish and he does the same thing here. It would take the average persons YEARS to discern the secrets of each of the different disciplines he reports on, if they could at all.Tim puts them all in one place, with step by step progressions of how to get them done.    It doesn''t make the answers of how to do these things any easier; that's up to you( us). But at least the answers are there.it's a step by step guide to accomplishing many things we all want but don't know how to do.He cuts to the chase and lays it out for all of us.    Plus, he understands that this is just a starting point for each of us as we are all an experiment of one. Taking control of your body is tough enough under the best of circumstances; Tim has given us all the Cliff Notes version of how to become as Superhuman as you have the desire too.    And, despite it's size( it's a tome) it doesn't have to be read cover to cover. Pick your area of interest and start there. Each chapter is a book onto itself    Bravo Tim, love this book!
B0049P1VHS|3.0|After six episodes \\"The Walking Dead\\" has failed to impress me much. The premise it begins the series with is nothing new - the protagonist wakes up in a hospital after an unexplained zombie outbreak - and does little to defy genre conventions thereafter. The plot is unfortunately predictable and the characters are cartoonish cliches. The zombie apocalypse itself doesn't even look that bad. Everyone is remarkably clean, well fed and in good health - especially the characters who have Hollywood good looks. They always look flawless. Survival is apparently not that hard in \\"The Walking Dead\\", because no one ever breaks a sweat or messes up their nicely styled hair. Special effects also have room for improvement. While the zombie makeup is good, the low quality CG sticks out and the sound effects are WAY over the top. Maybe next season AMC will give the show a larger budget and they can replace those ridiculous looking blood splatters. As a whole, \\"The Walking Dead\\" hardly compares to prior zombie apocalypses entries like \\"28 Days Later\\" and Zack Snyder's \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" remake. Hopefully the longer 13 episode season will allow Frank Darabont to craft a narrative that isn't quite as ham-fisted and unimaginative as this 6 episode miniseries turned out to be. However, I can't help but feel that this would have been so much better as an HBO production with a different director at the helm. AMC isn't willing to get as gritty as the material requires and Darabont doesn't seem to understand what makes a good zombie apocalypse. As novel and exciting as a zombie themed TV drama is, \\"The Walking Dead\\" turned out to be quite flawed, uninspired and ultimately disappointing. Worth seeing, but in no way does it live up to the hype.
1401307450|5.0|I have read it 3 times. I love it. Such a great story of crazy sex, love, music, and the darkside. Anthony's tale of his crazy life is entertaining, fun, sad and lovely all at once. A good summer beach read.
0553284347|5.0|i love this book a lot!!! easy to read and won't make u feel bore. you will learn a lot from this book. how to be a good parents...how important to let a child to have a happy childhood.
030746363X|5.0|I received an advanced copy of this book and there's not much more I can say than that you need to get it. I've had lung surgery twice and a collar bone surgery (high speed longboard accident) in the last three years. All of these were on my left side, resulted in major muscle imbalances between R/L shoulders, and were the cause of several rock climbing injuries since. Long story short, despite having a good reputation, my physical therapists' remedies were not nearly effective enough--this was certainly not due to a lack of effort on my part. Anyway, thanks to a chapter in this book \\"Pre-hab: Injury Proofing the Body,\\" two weeks later, the improvements are insane. I'm not back to 100% balanced yet (another 4 weeks or so) but my body feels more solid than it has in years.    Skeptical: If you're skeptical about Tim or this book because of something you've heard or the title turns you off, fair enough. Realize though that this book does not come from a place of theory or conjecture. The value of the content is in the real results, that is, his writing is based on real results and the value in it for you is as well. Skepticism is a good and a healthy thing, but too often we confuse skepticism with outright dismissal. Being skeptical doesn't mean you can dismiss something, being skeptical means its worth testing and disproving. The difference between being skeptical and uninterested is that the former indicates something worth experimenting with.
0307272702|5.0|Until now, it's been hard to dispute the traditional advice for losing weight: \\"Eat less. Exercise more.\\" But, if we look at how  ineffective diets based on this approach have been over the long-term (as evidenced by the alarming increases waistlines and chronic diseases), it's clear that we need a different approach. Enter Gary Taubes.<br /><br />Although Taubes' approach is indeed paradigm-shifting, it is based on scientific research and findings that have been around for ages. But, as these concepts go against the it's-just-about-the-calories-in-calories-out-balance and if-you-eat-fat-you'll-get-fat commandments of dieting, they've been shunned and disregarded. But, with Taubes' new book, hopefully things are about to change.<br /><br />Taubes clearly illuminates the science behind these ideas with _Why We Get Fat And What To Do About It_--a slimmed-down, reader-friendly version of his 500+ page _Good Calories, Bad Calories_. Although his approach is based on the integration of some hefty physiological, metabolic, and genetic principles, the underlying concept is actually quite simple: eating carbohydrates activates the insulin response which causes the fat cells to \\"hijack\\" calories that otherwise would have been used for fuel, ultimately resulting in the increased-hunger/decreased-energy levels that lead to fat accumulation.  In other words, carbohydrates make us hungry and sedentary.<br /><br />Sure, it's initially hard to swallow the truth that it's not dietary fat that makes us fat, but the low-fat (highly refined) carbs that are the culprit. It may be equally difficult to grasp the concept that calories really don't count when it comes to long-term weight loss and maintenance.  But, given the research and evidence that Taubes presents in this book, it becomes clear that our body's insulin response--and not our lack of will power or caloric net imbalance--is what's (over)feeding expanding waistlines.<br /><br />It's interesting to realize that shedding fat really comes down to shedding the traditional (and misguided) approaches to dieting, and instead learning how to effectively feed your body so that it can fuel--and not fatten--you.the traditional (and misguided) approaches to dieting, and instead learning how to effectively feed your body so that it can fuel--and not fatten--you.
B002VR9QY6|5.0|I own many performances of \\"Giselle\\" but this is, by far, my favorite.  It's possible to find a DVD performance with a more stellar touch here or there; but, overall, this performance is as close to perfection in all aspects of production as one is likely to find.  High praise, I know, but I think it's merited.<br /><br />There is an overall \\"ensemble\\" feel to this performance.  Everyone seems to be operating at the same level of excellence and commitment and on the same \\"wave\\" as to interpretation.  The synchronization of the corps - whether manifested by a single couple, several couples together or the whole company - is exceptional.  Quite honestly, I have seen productions by world-famous companies (no names mentioned) which fall far, far below the standards exhibited by this company.  If they dance like this all the time, they should be at the top of anyone's list!<br /><br />Not only are they together as a group, but there is a singular grace and ease to their dancing that one doesn't always see.  They are, in fact, so unified in style and execution that one can easily overlook just how wonderful they are.  They make it seem so easy and normative that one forgets how exceptional what they do really is.  I wish I knew more about the different national \\"schools\\"; but there is something about this performance as a whole and in the individual style of each dancer which reminds me of Russia.  There isn't a moment of stiffness in anything they do, no matter how complicated; easeful, fluid grace is the best I can do as a description, and they seem to enjoy what they're doing.  If the steps are racking them with pain, there is not the slightest indication of it for the audience.<br /><br />If you want a minus, then I single out the boorish behaviour of the audience, especially in Act 2, for special note.  Seldom have I heard such disrespect from an audience for its fellows or for the artists as this one manifests.  What do I mean?  Coughing.  My god, you'd think the whole performance had been filmed in a tubercular ward.  But even with that the performance is so magical that one can forget such behavioural interruptions.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that, once I've watched a DVD of Giselle, I normally skip over all but the beginning and ending of Act 1 and go straight to the real glory, Act 2.  BUT...in the case of this performance, I have found myself watching the whole of Act 1 because it was just so very lovely, graceful and joyful to watch.  What more can I say?  I suppose you might not like this performance, so individual is preference; but I find it hard to believe in this case that anyone will be disappointed in owning such a \\"Giselle\\".<br /><br />Highest marks.  Really, it's special.  Buy it!<br /><br />This review refers to the \\"Giselle\\" of the Dutch National Ballet.<br />Cast list:<br />Giselle: Anna Tsygankova<br />Count Albrecht: Jozef Varga<br />Myrtha: Igone de Jongh<br />Hilarion: Jan Zerer<br /><br />Kultur Video: ASIN: B002VR9QY6
B00192IV9U|1.0|This album is a joke. If you are a true fan of this man, how can you possibly like this? There is not one song on here that is really even all that good. I would say that Sony has managed to put together an album that is by far the worst of any MJ project. If there are so many songs from the Thriller days and so on..., why put this out first when it is not even half @$$ completed. This is just another rip off by the record industry to make money off of the fans. In my opinion, this will actually hurt sales and dim interest in any future \\"unreleased\\" material. Give the people what they want and it certainly isn't this. If Sony was smart, they could have made this like the History CD. This \\"new\\" uncompleted stuff as a glimpse of what could have been..., along with some unreleased stuff from the 80's to make up for this so called album....., but that would be too easy and then they could not rip us off as much. What a joke.

0684857219|5.0|Having read several books on body building, I feel I have found the master copy that everything of substance has been derived from.  While it doesn't go into detail about the new chemical of the month (found in any bodybuilding magazine) it does give a good, thorough explanation of how to properly do an exercise with illustration.  While I don't have access to the cable machines recommended, everything else that is provided is giving me new variations to what was quickly become a tired, normal routine.
0061730335|5.0|William Kamkwamba is a boy from Malawi, a survivor of famine, a good friend to many, a hard-worker, a student, a caretaker of his family, a builder of a windmill, an inventor, a scientist, and a philanthropist.  William's story, The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, challenges the conventional notions of teaching and learning.  By \\"typical\\" standards, William should not have succeeded in school or in his efforts to build a windmill.  His father is a farmer in a small, rural village in a country where only two percent of the population has access to electricity and running water.  His family cannot afford to send him to secondary school when famine strikes, money runs low, and the family struggles to survive on one small meal a day.  But William is not a \\"typical\\" boy and his is not a \\"typical\\" story.  Because of his curiosity, determination, and his generosity, William is able to succeed beyond his wildest dreams.  His interest in science begins at an early age when he takes apart radios to see how they work and figures out how to wire discarded batteries to use their remaining charge.  When a crippling famine threatens to devastate his family and his country, William perseveres with his education by continuing to read and study even though his family can no longer afford to pay for his secondary school.  His perseverance and curiosity aid him in his windmill project.  William finds parts from a junk yard and builds his own tools while a skeptical village looks on.  After months of hard work, his efforts pay off beyond his expectations.  The many ways he gives back to his family and village are truly inspiring.  It will be interesting to see what the future holds for William.  There is no doubt he will continue to inspire and seek to better his entire continent.      William's story, as told in The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, has several lessons for educators.  His story emphasizes to us the importance of fostering curiosity in our students, helping students research anddevelop ideas based on their interests, and encouraging students to persevere and make the best out of situations of adversity.  Part of William's success can be attributed to great \\"teachers\\" like Dr. Mchazime, Tom Rielly, and Blessings Chikakula who were willing to go out on a limb for a young boy from Malawi and help him achieve his dreams.  This should inspire us as teachers to go beyond our job description as we seek and help the future \\"Williams\\" of the world.  When we find those special students, we must work hard to not only provide them with excellent learning opportunities, but to offer them our love and support as well.  Above all, we must encourage all students to use their knowledge and talents to give back and improve the world in which we live.
B0009P42S2|5.0|Movie was as described.  Case was a bit cracked and was covered in little yellow sticky notes with people's names.  lol. Unusual but certainly didn't take away from the quality of the movie.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this story, and it was great. The author moved well between the past and the present, and the writing style was lovely. And, the ending was NOT IN THE LEAST of what I expected. Very good book - highly recommended.
030746363X|5.0|This is the second Tim Ferriss book I have read and I liked this one even more than the Four-Hour Workweek, which I loved. I have read a ton of diet and exercise books and this one was by far the best one I have ever read. Tim answered so many of my questions on diet and then actually had the scientific evidence to support his ideas. The same was true on the exercise piece of the book. I also expect my sex life to improve and am hoping to get by and feel great on less sleep. (I will let you know about that.) This will always serve as a reference guide for me. It's the type of book I will be constantly be referencing. Thanks Tim!!!
0440422973|1.0|Grisham can tell a tale even if it is ripped out of Dr Suess and then made into an even badder movie .. so good for tale telling and not so good for repetitious weak plotting
0525951652|5.0|What a fantastic story! I would recommend this book to everyone. I am about 3/4 through the story and I am enjoying it so much, I feel like I am right there...part of the events taking place.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|My daughter and I were fortunate to get tickets to Josh's concert \\"Before We Begin\\" which was very casual and very entertaining.  He explained that the reason it took so long to produce a new CD was that \\"Illuminations\\" was something he always wanted to do. He also said that the songs were personal to him, especially the first one which he composed when he was about 11 years old and the one dedicated to our troops after he visited Walter Reed Hospital.  The man is a musical genius and has a great personality. He sings from his heart. So as you listen to this CD please try to keep this in mind and appreciate his talent. Everyone needs a change once in a while.
