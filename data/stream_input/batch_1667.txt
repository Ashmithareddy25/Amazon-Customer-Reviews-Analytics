B00338QENI|5.0|Great biographical aspect that brought life to the fascinating history of an extremely important scientific discovery. This book is easy to read, the science is explained in a simple and interesting way. Many parts of the family's story brought tears to my eyes! You really don't want to pass by this book!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Was hesitant to read this book as the reviews were so mixed on it.  I was pleasantly surprised when reading it and found that I surprisingly had a hard time putting it down.  I cannot wait to read the second in this trilogy!!
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|This film certainly breaks no new ground. You feel like you've seen it all before - not much originality here.<br /><br />The acting is so-so, especially between the two principles. I never really felt like there was any real chemistry.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty good for a free game. Lots of different things to choose from keeps it new. Some levels are harder than others but overall good.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this installment in the Crossfire series more than the first novel.  While I felt that Bared was more of a copy on Fifty Shades, Reflected in You comes into its own and veers away from that mess.  Ms. Day keeps the tension up and the reader guessing until the very last.  Four well earned stars.  Looking forward to the third book very much.
159448385X|5.0|In every era of literature, there is an author that has the ability to embrace his or her readers and touch the most intimate parts of their soul. Khaled Hosseini is one of those authors. A Thousand Splendid Suns is one of the most delightfully touching and intimate narratives that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Khaled Hosseini creeps up to the reader like an old friend in a coffee shop who casually starts up a conversation and ends up grabbing hold of your attention until he finishes telling you his story. At the end of this book, you will feel like you are old friends the main characters. Their pain will be your pain, their happiness will be your happiness, and every experience that they had will forever become a part of you. It is impossible to read this book and be completely unchanged. When you turn the final page, your heart will beat differently and the souls that Khaled Hosseini allowed you to peer into will have become a part of your own.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|We decorated our 3.5 year-old daughter's room with these princess decals. I actually made a border around the room with a few packages of these decals. Since they don't come with Rapunzel ones (and she's my daughter's favorite) I bought separate Rapunzel ones that are also offered on Amazon and are basically the same size as these princess ones. Rapunzel blends in well with the other princesses so I just tossed in a Rapunzel to the rotation of princesses on the border as I went around the room. Then I found a huge standing Rapunzel decal on Amazon that claims to have glow in the dark accents (but they don't really glow). It doesn't matter that they don't glow because it's an amazing wall decal all by itself. We bought a large Rapunzel decal where she's hanging out a window and put that up too. I used the leftover Rapunzel decals to decorate her bed. We went all out and got the Rapunzel bedding and the whole nine yards. She was so excited to sleep in her new princess room that the first night she barely slept a wink -- she just gazed around the room at the princesses and was over the moon! I must have placed, unpeeled and repositioned these a million times each to make sure they were even with the others; they took that abuse beautifully. They don't come off unless you peel them off. You can't go wrong here -- they won't hurt the paint and they go up without paste or any hassle -- it's like putting a sticker on the wall that comes off without any residue. So when she's ready for a ... gulp ... Justin Bieber room (God forbid) or other \\"big girl\\" themed room in a few years, it'll be an easy thing to change out. You can't go wrong here. Have fun!
B008PALI5S|5.0|Gustavo Dudamel's Mahler First on DVD was, as Clive Goodwin points out, quite disappointing: focused on superficial effect rather than substance, especially in comparison with the stunning Dvorak \\"New World\\" he recorded with the Radio Symphony Orchestra Stuttgart (Birthday Concert for Pope Benedict XVI). One could then suspect that the young conductor had not quite plumbed the depth and idiom of Mahler's musical language. So it was with slight trepidation when I ordered the disk, but everything fell into place happily when I played it the first time around. If you want to know my own personal ambivalent feelings about the Eighth - Mahler's last, gargantuan and somewhat desperate fling with late Romanticism - do read my reviews of the Bernstein (with the Seventh) and Tennstedt (with the First) readings on DVD, both noble and persuasive performances, though now dated in audio and video. The outstanding recent recording by Chailly and the Gewandhausorchester brought the oratorio-symphony much closer to me: it is wonderfully exuberant, highly disciplined at the same time and always conscious of the various structural layers, the shifts in mood and the balances between human and instrumental voices, not to mention the virtuosity of all involved.<br /><br />Dudamel has assembled more than 1000 participants: Mahler's dream is finally realized in our time. The rehearsals must have been grueling. As it turns out, the recording of these two orchestras combined into one big happy band, the very fine (perhaps not altogether outstanding) soloists and the army of choristers - no small feat indeed - is surprisingly clear, though certainly not lean. Video is very good. Dudamel has a firm and thoughtful grip on the proceedings, he obviously knows the music very well, his body language is appropriate and he appears to be in touch with every group, even each individual musician. This is quite amazing. His approach to the score may not be as detail-focused as Chailly's and Tennstedt's - let's say it is slightly more synthetic than analytical - but not a single note is lost or glossed over.<br /><br />From the initial organ chord and jubilant orchestral-choral bars, the mood of the Veni Creator Spiritus is joyous, festive and simply overwhelming. You can almost see Mahler smiling down from Heaven. The Second Part, based on Goethe's Faust II, much less compact and somewhat problematic to carry off without dragging, is played and sung very well indeed. Every nuance of pain, love and ecstasy is shaped beautifully and the ending - Faust's deliverance after his 100-year quest through time, life, guilt and redemption - is apocalyptic. Next to the soloists, who give their all, the various choirs shine out, in particular the children, without sheet music, obviously rehearsed splendidly and fully transported by the spirit of the occasion. Brava Venezuela for these beautiful musical youths! All in all, this adds up to a stunning and deeply moving performance you don't want to miss. It goes, together with Chailly, to the top of my Mahler shelf - after I listen to it at least once more.- let's say it is slightly more synthetic than analytical - but not a single note is lost or glossed over.<br /><br />From the initial organ chord and jubilant orchestral-choral bars, the mood of the Veni Creator Spiritus is joyous, festive and simply overwhelming.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, could not put it down - literally.  Spent Sunday in my chair and read the entire book. Extremely entertaining and very suspenseful.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book, I mainly bought the 10 Anniversary edition based on the promise of enhanced content (I had not read the original version).<br />Anyhow, the story was engaging and original; the main character was someone I wanted to know more about and the author managed to portray the gods as the anachronistic concepts that they are without getting too preachy or dismissive. I read the book in about 3 days.<br />My only gripe is with the \\"American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition: A Novel [Kindle Edition With Audio/Video]\\":<br />I own a Kindle Fire HD and at the beginning or every chapter I could see the warning that the audio/video content was not supported.<br />I tried reading the book on the Kindle app on my MacBook Air but the content was not supported there either, I was able to play the audio but not the video on my Kindle iPhone app but I did not purchase the MacBook Air or the iPhone Edition With Audio/Video I bought the \\"American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition: A Novel [Kindle Edition With Audio/Video]\\"<br />Why then advertise a \\"Kindle Edition With Audio/Video\\" that is not supported by the device?<br />**In sum, dear Amazon, please do not sell me a Kindle book under the premise that it will have audio and video when it is not supported by my Kindle device, I do not appreciate it!**

B001IFZL50|5.0|Excellent Blu-ray transfer, DVD is not a bad option either though. No issues whatsoever from amazon and the shipping, Prime is beyond worth it. Best price anywhere found online. I used ookong chrome app to track the price changes, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ([...]).
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I found \\"The Timekeeper\\" an engaging story, but I was hoping for more.  I thought the idea of the story was original, but found myself feeling at the end of the book like more could have been done with it.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read every single one of Lee Child's books and I'm a huge fan of the Reacher series.  I get a kick out of the way the books are written, the action, and the unpredictable nature of his books. It is hard for me to say anything negative about the entire series, but I must say this one was a huge disappointment.  I read it in about 3 sittings and it felt like is was written in about the same time.  It didn't have the usual Reacher wit and it was just pretty bland.  There are usually several twists during the books, and there were a few in this one, but not well thought out.  Most of the plots are fairly believable - you really think a guy like Reacher could get himself in the situations, but this one was pure fantasy. Without giving up the story, I can say that it is extremely unlikely anyone in the FBI would voluntarily work with a drifter like Reacher.  Having said all that, I'll be the first in line for the next book.....
0345803507|2.0|I read all three books to see how it ends. But, I found some of it quite disturbing, especially the sick sex stuff. The sex is both overdone and at times pretty sick. Remove 80% of the sex and what is left?  I ranked it 2 stars as there is some intrigue and a heroine who at times is interesting.<br /><br /> In retrospect, I could have done without reading these books. I'm far from a prude about sex but these books aren't much more than sex and some of that is too sick for me.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|They are constantly updating this game so it doesn't give you time to get bored.  It is nice that it links to other carnival type games that will unlock when you reach a certain point in the game so it gives you goals that you want to reach.  I like it.

1577314808|5.0|This is one of the best books about spiritual growth I've read in years!!! As a lawyer, I wasn't very much convinced about spirituality, but a sudden violent pull on the rug beneath me, that left me laying on the floor for a while, started me on that road. My first book was Zero Limits, and though I was skeptical, it felt like there was something more out there than just the mundane. Several books went by and then Conversations with God came into my hands and well, this book opened me up to a whole new understanding.<br />Now, the Power of Now is different, hard to describe. All I can say is READ IT, you won't regret it. Read it, read it, read it!!!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Here's what I like about \\"Monster\\":<br /><br />A totally fresh approach.  No longer concerned at all, as far as I can see, with capturing any kind of \\"classic\\" sound from some earlier period in Kisstory, and not, as far as I can see, trying to catch some current wave in the music industry either -- which I think is the only artistically viable way to make good music.  In fact, I really don't know why Gene and Paul spent so much energy throwing around phrases like \\"it's a cross between Destroyer, Revenge, and Sonic Boom,\\" because I honestly don't see a strong connection there.  And it's not like 1974-1979, either, which is not a bad thing.  This is KISS today, making great-sounding rock music the best way they know how.  Finally!  No fan of Sting wants five albums worth of \\"Blue Turtles,\\" and no fan of Peter Gabriel wants five albums of \\"Shock the Monkey\\" - what we want is what you have to offer today - something new, something that reflects who you are right here and now.  And Monster is damn close to achieving that goal.  I think it's the closest KISS have come to just chucking any business scheme and just making the best record they can make - they've done this with KISS, Alive!, Destroyer, Creatures of the Night, and Revenge - and now I believe they've done it once again with Monster.  Good!<br /><br />Good songwriting, a feistier sound, grinding guitars, great licks.  Tuneful tunes.  Tommy is no longer being asked to sing like Frehley, or play lead like Frehley.  His lead vocal on the album, \\"Outta This World,\\" is so not-Ace, that on first listen I thought I was hearing Gene sing in a higher-than-usual register.  Cool song, with a sound not unlike Boston.<br /><br />Eric Singer is no longer being asked to sing like Peter Criss.  His vocal cut on the album, \\"All for the Love of Rock & Roll,\\" is a wonderfully tuneful pop song that allows Eric to really show the smooth, melodious side to his vocals.<br /><br />We have never, ever, heard KISS like this.  I'm totallydiggin' it.<br /><br />Some great songs.<br /><br />The opener, the first single, \\"Hell or Hallelujah,\\" is not the best cut on this album by a long shot, IMO.  I challenge the band to open their next tour with \\"Wall of Sound\\" - wouldn't that kill?  When was the last KISS tour that opened with a Simmons song?  Been a while.  \\"Wall of Sound\\" would crunch you in the ribs and deliver a strong message to the crowd.  A bit Zepplin, a bit Hendriks.  A bit something totally new.  Awesome.  Funky.  Killer.<br /><br />The next cut, \\"Freak,\\" is something else again, another completely new beast.  Paul Stanley doing something new, something really new.  Very cool.  Impossible to see how they compare this disc to Destroyer, Revenge, or Boom.  They just have never sounded quite like this.  I love it.<br /><br />\\"Back to the Stone Age,\\" is rocking fun, but IMO nothing to write home about, once you get over the cool new sound they've given everything they touch on this album.  Gene never sounded like this, and it's not a bad thing.  The song itself is okay, not a killer.<br /><br />\\"Shout Mercy\\" is Paul singing over a bit of a Foreigner groove.  It's okay.  Some of these songs are up against very strong competition for my admiration.<br /><br />\\"Long Way Down\\" - Wow, wow, WOW !!!!  Zepplin, Beatles, Grand Funk, Hendriks, hard rockin' funk.  Powerful lyric.  Sounds damn good.<br /><br />\\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" - I guarantee you've never heard KISS open a song like this.  A good time.  Maybe shades of Aerosmith?  Dunno.  Good!<br /><br />\\"The Devil is Me\\" - a decent outing, hard and funky.  What's most interesting is that Gene Simmons is writing autobiographically - have we ever seen this before?  Consider all the crap he put his family through over the past couple of years with the philandering business, and I challenge you to read the lyrics and say it isn't about him coming to terms with his various issues.  To top it off, he ends the track by restating the title in precisely the same voice and tempo as his tagline from the \\"Family Jewels\\" theme song.  I find this fascinating.<br /><br />(BTW, several mentions of God in this album, not something they'd bothered with before. I'm not religious, but it is noticeable.  And not as in \\"God of Thunder\\" or \\"God gave rock n roll etc.\\" either.  They're invoking the creator in a search for emotional comfort.  Huh.)<br /><br />\\"Outta This World\\" - described above.  Tommy growing into his own place, and it's a good start.<br /><br />\\"All for the Love of Rock & Roll\\" - described above.  Eric doing the same.  A really fun tune.  Tell me you don't hear Boston in this one.  But it's okay!<br /><br />\\"Take Me Down Below\\" - IMO a slight downturn from what came earlier on the disc.  Trying hard.<br /><br />\\"Last Chance\\" - a good closer, with some funky breaks and turns.  But nothing rises to the level of \\"Long Way Down,\\" \\"Wall of Sound\\" or \\"Freak.\\"<br /><br />I had heard the Best Buy edition had an extra track, but it didn't.  Still, I didn't have the willpower to not buy the thing once it was staring me in the face.  I am really happy with this album.<br /><br />I sincerely hope the Kiss Army doesn't cry foul on this album, because I think it's the most creative thing they've done in many moons.  A genuine artistic statement.  From KISS?  Yes.

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|There has been a lot of negative remarks about Kristen Stewart in this movie. I don't think she was all that bad. I am sure there are other actresses who could have given a stronger perforamnce but the way this script was writtten, in my opinion, the story line was not about Snow White it was about the effects on the people after the Queen came to power, Snow White was a by product of those effects. Kristen may not have added anything extrodinary to the film but she really didn't detract from it either. Charlize was magnificent as always, and the special effects were awsome, and Chris well he is just a cutie!! Over all a pretty good movie.
B004VD3YIM|1.0|To whom it may concern; I downloaded this on to my Motorola zoom tablet. Before that I was able to see my cameras, I just wanted to have a little bit more control but after I downloaded this product I couldn't even see my cameras and I had no access at all. This was a big headache for me!!!!! They need to work the bugs out....oh they are... we are the beta people. Don't try their free download unless you want a free headache.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|The new disk,\\"Monster\\"is a pure KISS Klassic!Easily the best one in about 2 decades.Its another great disk from all 4 players,but if i had to hold a member up for individual praise it would be Tommy Thayer,he is an AMAZING lead player (he's just as good or even better than Mr.No Regrets)!BULLSEYE!BUY MONSTER NOW!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|A great read.  Story keeps you going until the end.  I loved it, especially the last chapter from Christian's point of view.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Does everything it says it will. Just beware that some ads that kick you off the main gaming screen (to a black screen with the ad in the center) cannot be closed. You have to exit the game in order to do that. Also, of you select a 'winning' game, sometimes it will just be random. But it is a great game for free, even though it has pretty simple layout graphics and the ads glitch occasionally.

B00138GY5I|5.0|I listen to a LOT of music, but this is my single favorite album of all time. I can't listen to it enough.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A story really well written and told. Be surprised by characters that are all but common place. Nobody is fully good or bad so who must be blamed?
B00514HDNW|4.0|I really liked this story.  It was very different from the movie, in fact, so different I think of it a a totally different one!  Actually, I would like to read the version told in the Will Smith Movie.  The ending was sad, and a little bit of a bummer, but I still enjoyed it!
B009HSVHV2|4.0|THIS IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />low- fi, unheavy, no hooks, no melody, uncreative, by-the-numbers, generic, effortless, BORING. some of the words i would use to describe Monster. i hated Sonic Boom because it seemed obvious i guess to only me and a couple others that that whole album was centered around \\"Modern Day Delilah\\" and \\"Say Yeah\\": the only good KISS songs in 15 years. Monster is completely void of any memorable tracks. \\"Freak\\" is the only track that even hints of any melody, but it eventually strays from its potential. gene and paul are notorious for hyping every forthcoming KISS album as the \\"best\\" only to trash it when preparing for the next one. \\"Long Way Down\\" begins with an interesting vibe, but it too falls apart. \\"Monster\\" makes me appreciate my least favorite KISS albums \\"Asylum\\" and \\"Hot in the Shade\\" much much more because there were at least a generous amount of good ideas on those records. Gene's material however is always half-assed especially when the song is written by him only. blah. Monster is also a sad album because it pretty much proves and confirms that all the money and member changes in the world are very unlikely to save KISS (at least as a recording band) from consistently releasing benign and uncreative studio efforts. they need to bring back outside writers again and a decent producer. Paul delivered in '84 with \\"Animalize\\" but the intention and inspiration then was to continue the ressurection of a dying band. KISS is wealthy, indulged and legendary, and like Metallica...really have nothing inspiring them and to their credit really dont need to. but in their cases, IS SOMETHING BETTER THAN NOTHING? perhaps NO KISS album this year would have been a better idea. it just seems theyve become inflicted with the usual mental illness/work ethic that many rich artists and businessman latch onto: save money, make it cheap and quick, pocket the balance and polish the turd. ALTHOUGH THIS ALBUM IS FAR FROM A CLASSIC IN THE SENSE THATSAY, DRESSED TO KILL OR LOVE GUN IS, IT HAS GROWN ON ME IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND I ENJOY IT MUCH MORE THAN I DID WHEN I WROTE THAT REVIEW. I THINK PAUL REALLY DELIVERED SOME GOOD TRACKS. GENE NOT SO MUCH. I HAVE NOT CHANGED MY MIND AT ALL ABOUT SONIC BOOM THOUGH.
B000BCE918|5.0|Came as described in a very nice collector set with all three movies. Love it and came exactly on time:) very pleased!
0452289963|5.0|I got this book because I heard Oprah say how it literally changed her life in her OWN documentary about herself. If you really want an eye-opening book that will change yourself and mind on life, then get this book! You have to be serious about reading it with an open mind and really have somewhat of a drive to change how your looking at yourself and the world you form. I can honestly say I am so grateful I bought this book and I think everyone should own this! Great buy, excellent book!
0783240287|4.0|this is a great video produced by the composer of the music of this musical.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Phantom, Love never dies, and Joseph. It tells the biblical story of Jacob and his many sons and the conflict with joseph. We only recognised two songs here in Australia as I don't remember this musical coming here. For lovers of music and spectacles this video is well worthwhile.

B000067DNC|5.0|I love the series, more so than the spin offs or the movie.  I have since given away this set for the Blu-Rays but if you only ave a DVD player this is a must have.  The DVDs included bonus features, which I think is very important for for any kind of box set.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm not a musical fan, but I watched Buffy the Vampire, Angel and Firefly, so I thought I would give Joss Whedon's Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog a try. The three-part web miniseries (running a total of 42 minutes) aired in 2008 and was released onto DVD in December 2008.<br /><br />The plot centers on an inspiring supervillain named Billy (AKA Dr. Horrible - played by Neil Patrick Harris) who has been invited to join the Bad Horse's Evil League of Evil, but he must do something evil to get in. He plans on finishing his freezing gun, but first he needs to steel some wonderflonium.<br /><br />While attempting to steal the wonderflonium, his archenemy Captain Hammer (played by Nathan Fillion) interferes, but even worse Captain Hammer makes a move on the girl, Penny (Felicia Day), that he has a crush on.<br /><br />As Penny begins a relationship with Captain Hammer, Billy comes up with a plan to get into the Bad Horse's Evil League of Evil.<br /><br />Dr. Horrible will kill Captain Hammer.<br /><br />I absoultely enjoyed watching every minute of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Joss shows that you don't need a big budget; all you need is a well written script with great actors.

B009FOBZL0|5.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this release for some time. It's been seven long years since the last Wallflowers album and although Jakob Dylan's two solo releases in the interim were pleasant enough, I have really missed this band. Happily, the new album was well worth the wait. All the band members sound thoroughly rebooted and energized. The lyrics and arrangements are of typical excellence. Indeed, all the songs range from good to great; there's not a misfire among them (the best track being, in my opinion, \\"Misfits and Lovers\\"). In short, I'm glad all over!
B005LAIHZE|1.0|What a terrific concept. As if the life story with this country's signature events-the Civil War & the emancipation of those born in lifelong bondage- isn't fertile enough material for the imagination. If I were Roger Ebert I would write \\"I hated, hated, hated, hated this concept\\" but being an ordinary mass culture addict with time, a credit card, a childish sense of curiosity and no discerning sense of taste, I went to see this movie. Perhaps it's a childhood indoctrinated with respect for a president during our most trying years as a country but I was unable to slip into that zone of acceptance where I enjoy science fiction or horror or for that matter 98% of films. I kept thinking, \\"What's next? George Washington - Porn Star!\\"
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I originally got this for my young daughter- as there weren't any warnings of graphic nature! Luckily I got th first scare not her. Other than that I loved the game and can't wait for next installmet.

B008G12ERC|2.0|Are they trolling us? Or is this for real? The lyrics on most of the songs are beyond corny. It's like bubblegum pop rock that got melted into some dubstep, with hints of Muse sprinkled on top.<br /><br />I hardly recognize them anymore. This can't be the same band who used to hide messages in their songs and was heavily influenced by science fiction? Can it?<br /><br />The only thing I did enjoy was the \\"making of\\" video. It makes the album more personal, even if I still don't agree with it's existence.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Having grown up with the Beatles and followed the group individually all these years, I was glad to see Paul McCartney perform on PBS with Kisses on the Bottom.  I, too, grew up knowing the songs he sang, and really enjoyed his renditions.  I will be listening again today.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I would recommend this for any student, high school or otherwise :) Simllistic, detailed, and perfect organizing :P Useful for online notes, sources, or texts one wish to store, share, or edit any time, with your fellow classmates.Really an indispensible app, and well worth the download, you better believe it :D
B000063DS1|5.0|I bought The Last Waltz because I read that Neil Diamond was in it. Well, Neil only sang one song and I wasn't happy about that but it was a great tribute to The Band and from a lot of great Rockers. For some reason I didn't know who The Band was when I bought it. But after watching the DVD's I remembered the songs from back in the day and I was really glad that I bought it. It was a lot of fun to watch and I am sure you will enjoy it a lot if you are a fan.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Wish you weren't so dependent on neighbors for some things. But its an ok game. Good for casaual fun. Seems easier than the original.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought this headphone to use with my iPod Classic. It is well made and the sound was fine but I had a hard time keeping it on my head and in my ears but that is just me. I haven't found ear buds or in the ear headphones which will fit that I am comfortable using. So if you do not have a problem with this type of headphones then you would probably like these just fine.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Fifth book of series you'll really like this book it follows HBO series Game Of Thrones.Goes along with 4th book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I down loaded this e-book to my Kindle Fire. The author, Jamie McGuire did a good job writing this e-book. The opening scene drew me into the e-book right away. The scenes were described and thought out very well. The fight scenes were excellent and very descriptive. There was a lot of good suspense and tension in the story.  The initial theme of the e-book keeps you on your toes, you don't know where the two main characters Abby and Travis are going, and that kept me reading on. It was a fun read and reminds you what it was like to be that age. The formatting of the e-book version was excellent, nice to see for a change. There were three typographical errors in the e-book. I have and would recommend this e-book to a friend.
1935670913|1.0|This book seemed to promise a lot but actually delivered very little. I didn't feel we were given the whole truth regarding the John Locke success story - even the formula he claims to have used was very quickly outdated and so really there is hardly anything that is actually of much value...

B0010SEMP0|5.0|This is my favorite vampire series.  I love this series.  Kat and Crispin rock!  I can't wait for the next one!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was a culmination of 48 Hours Mystery and Nancy Grace.  Just when you think you might have it figured out the author makes you start all over. Gone Girl is not about just any ordinary girl/woman she is complicated, mischievous and clever.  If you want a good read for the plane or vacation this is the book ..really enjoyed the narrative .
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it does everything it should...the only thing i have issue with is every now and then when i am typing a post or status update the cursor spot will go back to the beginning and it makes it difficult to finish what i am trying to type...but other than that i have had no issues
B00007AJGH|5.0|This vista series DVD is awesome! It has so many extras. This is well worth the price. I can't say enough good things about this DVD.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|first of all i love this book even though it could have been better. oh and Percy is the BEST!!!!! i enjoyed his chapters because i love him, but they wern't as good as Annabeth's or Leo's.after i read this Leo is bumped up to 3rd fav and Hazel (sadly) is bumped to # 4. WHAT HAPPEND to Frank and Hazel????? their characters were WAY off. they just had no personality!!!!! Frank was a cowering idiot!!!! he was just there, glaring at Leo the whole time!!! and Jason, oh Jason was knocked out cold half the book! i never really like him tha much, he was too in Percy's way. and Piper's POV's were just about her relationship with Jason. and did you notice that only the greek demigods got POVs! any way....... oh and that CLIFFHANGER!!!!!!!! ok seriously if you have not read the book DONT read this!!!!!!! it wa really a cliff hanger Percy was hanging on a cliff!!!!!!!!!! OH what he did was sooooooo sweet i almos cried!!!!! the ending was soooooooo horrible but soooo good! i hate you Riorden!!! but the book was overall great and i allready miss Percybeth!
0525953728|5.0|Great book. Watched the documentary on the attack then read the book. Amazing. No secrets were revealed in this book. I've read 3 books on Seal Team 6 and 2 on Delta so far and this book had less \\"secret\\" material than all the other books I have read. Shame on people that think that he did. Some of this book can be found out by watching the documentary on the subject. Even the way Seal Team 6 was going to infiltrate the building was in the documentary.  The book provides the look on the ground. The seemingly meaningless conversations between teammates only to find out they were there for something more than a drill. The before mission preparation of trying to get the green light for the SEALs. This book is well written and I am glad that I read it. Read the book if you want to know more about the mission that killed bin Laden. Do not read the book if you are expecting secrets.
1401323820|1.0|THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the show \\"Castle\\", so I thought it would be fun to read \\"Heat Wave\\" so I would know what the characters were talking about in the show. I was very disappointed in the book. It was badly written, with prose that stumbled across the tongue. It read like the first draft on an aspiring crime writer (one who was destined to be rejected by publishers) and not as the work of an accomplished writing, such as Richard Castle is suppose to be. Part of the blame belongs with the editing team, which failed seems to have failed in their job.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the book is the complete lack of descriptions of characters or settings. No where in the book are the main characters physically described. Its like the writer assumed that everyone would imagine Nikki Heat as looking like Beckett in the TV show and so didn't even bother writing a description of what she looked like. The same is true of every other main character. Also there are no setting descriptions, except for where it was absolutely necessary for the plot. So there is no description of the precinct but the victims apartment is described. If you picked up this book without having seen the TV show, you would have no idea how to picture the characters or the locations. This is truly a horrible book and I have to think that all the glowing reviews listed on Amazon for this book are fake and probably paid for by ABC. Trust me, don't waste your money on this book.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Tedious, predictable and disappointing. Mr. Sparks seems to beat the same dead horse (sorry Tuck)in every book. Thought I'd give this one a try and believe it will be my last. Haven't read anything really good from him since \\"The Notebook\\". Wish he'd think of something new.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i love this app...just like the arcade game at the fair, only 100x better! you can control it souch better than the real machine,bonuses too
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Balls to the wall with no ballads (I don't mind a good quality ballad, but the last good one Kiss managed was \\"Forever\\" nearly a quarter century ago), this is a surprisingly consistent effort from Kiss.  They've done so many albums that will have one or two good tracks, then be filled with stuff ranging from 'bad' to 'embarrassing to listen to'.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" has one glaringly bad song on it, Eric Singer's \\"All for the Love of Rock & Roll\\".  I'm not sure why Kiss feels the need to give Singer and Thayer tracks anyway.  Nothing about them sounds like Kiss, and it's not like they're going to perform them live.  Thayer's actually performing Ace Frehley's \\"Shock Me\\" on the current tour.<br /><br />Still, you should have fun blaring this in the car for a few months before it becomes another completely forgotten effort.  There are those calling this Kiss's best album since \\"Revenge\\".  I'll agree with that, but only because the few albums in between has been so bad.  It doesn't hold a candle to Kiss's best records, but it's a mindless fun ride.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I am new to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis even though I live in Seattle. I downloaded this album yesterday on a friends recommendation. I was blown away on the first listen. This album is full of amazing messages and music. From addiction, consumerism, gay marriage, and dressing like your grandad, this album has it all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun but challenging.  zen quality is cool as well.  I. enjoy the music and graphics.  very well done.  if it gets.  too difficult I will bail and I.m not spending real cash on it.
0811879542|5.0|All of the previous reviews say it all. The only thing I can add is that this was the book that changed my son from a \\"bedtime only' story boy. He will let us read this one any time of day. 'nuff said.
B0089BSM70|5.0|I got a chance to watch Halloween 2 with the director's commentary on which I thought was very well done.  Rick Rosenthal and Leo Rossi (one of the ambulence drivers in the movie) seem like old friends and give you some great insight into the movie.  Leo references several times about how he's kept in touch with some of the co-stars of Halloween and Halloween 2 via conventions and autograph signings.  It just shows you the popularity of these films and the cult following they have.  The deleted scenes are excellent and also have Rick's commentary on them.  I wish that Scream Factory and Universal would have allowed Rick to edit these scenes back into the movie the way they were supposed to be and given us a true \\"Rosenthal Cut\\" vs. the TV version.  As it is well known, John Carpenter went back after viewing the original cut and directed several scenes that were more violent and better competed with the slasher films that were coming out in the early '80's like Friday the 13th.  Carpenter felt like the movie wasn't scary enough when actually, the script was this issue, which Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote.<br /><br />I think that Halloween 2 is an under appreciated sequel to arguabally one of the greatest horror movies of all time.  Is is a good at the original?  Of course not...very few sequels ever are.  But if you watch both movies, you can see where Rosenthal used very similar camera angle techniques that Carpenter used in the first movie.  It would have been interesting to see the original Rosenthal cut with Carpenter's music from the original...NOT the digitized score.  Carpenter readily admits that he saved the original Halloween with music and that it wasn't scary in the original screening before it.  I'll bet that Halloween 2 would have been much better received if those 2 things happened.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed this new Collector's Edition of Halloween 2 and would recommend it over the recently released 30th Anniverary Blu Ray edition.  Sorry, for me the bonus material in this version outweigh the \\"Terror in the Aisles\\" bonus movie.<br /><br />P.S.  Look for Dana Carvey in a bit role (his first movie appearance) as a reporter in the beginning of the movie.  He's the guy that the TV lady reporter is talking to when she's telling him to \\"interview the kids and get their consent but if he couldn't get that to interview them anyway\\".the bonus material in this version outweigh the \\"Terror in the Aisles\\" bonus movie.<br /><br />P.S.

B003NX76BM|4.0|This book was an enjoyable read.  Fun, fast paced and sexy with drama thrown in everywhere.  A book for pet lovers everywhere!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very interesting.  I really enjoyed reading it.  I look forward to seeing what happens next to Katniss and Peeta.  I am about to start reading Catching Fire.  I hope that it is as good as the Hunger Games was.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|I'm not a frequent, high use Facebook consumer which should be taken into consideration when reviewing my feedback.<br /><br />Likes<br />- Very clean layout, aesthetically pleasing<br />- Easy to use, very simple<br />- Simple, not difficult to navigate<br />- Chat feature on the KindleFire is pretty sweet, very easy to use.<br /><br />Dislikes<br />- Can't seem to sort posts by \\"most recent\\", much easier to do this on a computer<br />- When you make comments on posts the screen jumps down several posts vs returning to the original spot.  Hopefully Facebook can get this fixed, it is very annoying!!!<br /><br />Overall I would say I'm satisfied with the product and would be very happy if a future updates fixes the 2 above mentioned dislikes.
1250010489|5.0|Once again, Mark treads the fine line between fiction and non fiction in this ever to real novel. Mark's deep knowledge of the internals of Windows and the current state of cyber security, is used to great effect to create a reality in which his two heroes, Jeff and Daryl, strive to survive on a suspense filled action ride. IT pros, government officials, and thrill seekers should all read this novel - for education and excitement.
B00992CF6W|5.0|block story ducks and it is to confusing minecraft is simple and fun. in block story its to easy to fined gems I like to play hard to get.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Great powerful voice
B001ACH4DS|3.0|The CD was okay and I do recommend it, but I purchased for one song specifically and there were maybe 2 or 3 other's that I liked. The rest were okay. Not really into love ballads.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|The RED HOOD is way better than batman. The Red hood gets  it done how it should be done in the way that if your bad your dead that way you have no chances to take anymore lives, now as for batman the only thing that makes batman different is that he lets the bad guys live and they always get out of jail and kill more people thats batmans down fall i think. As for the movie it was great, the only problem i had was that i didnt really like the way they animated the Joker.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was as goodas the first.  cant wait for the third one.  i am excited.  these books are addicting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First of all I can't believe that there are any bad reviews about this book.  I've been on a zombie reading binge and needed something else to read for awhile.  I'm so glad I did.  I would say that this is a Science Fiction masterpiece and a must read for everyone.
B007SAP7S0|3.0|I cannot believe the 5 star review and the comments about the quality of this remaster. If you listen through anything other than an iPod it sounds compressed, loud and there's zero dynamic range in this. If you want proof just drag the files into any sound analyzer like Audio LEq for the Mac and you'll see this is totally brickwalled.<br /><br />Look up volume wars or brickwalling online and you'll see lots of YouTube demos. I'd post pictures but I've tried before and no live links in these comments<br /><br />The bonus material here is worth it if you like this album. If you have the original CD and are hoping for better sound quality don't waste your time and money.<br />You know with the cheap cost of CDs and the sheer number of discs they put in these editions I don't understand why they can't have a proper master and a compressed master both if they really insist on having a \\"volume to 11\\" version with no dynamic range.<br /><br />so 4.5/5 for the album, 5/5 for all the great extras, 2/5 for the sound.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run update was great they got rid of the lag but it some times freezes in the title screen. overall this game is still addicting an fun 5 star for me
B00908DDZM|5.0|From the intro of track 1, to the outro of track 18, I didn't once even THINK about skipping a song.  This album took 3 years to make.  Macklemore has been performing a couple of this songs on tour regularly, but he refused to release a subpar work of art, which I always appreciated.  Too many artists now a days use their fan base as cash machines and just release piles of junk every year to squeeze them dry.<br /><br />Thank you Macklemore and Ryan Lewis for reminding us all what being a musical artist is really about.  About respecting the fan base, and respecting the art enough to not abuse it for pure monetary gain.
B002RI9PKO|3.0|The book gets off to a great start with some interesting concepts about potential human development<br />Then about 2/3rds through Malcolm really starts to draw a long bow trying to justify and validate his earlier observations<br />Overall just a good read
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really liked it. Everyone I know who has read the book liked it. I can't wait to read the other 2 books in the trilogy.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Having read everything Lee Child has published, I would have to say in my opinion A Wanted Man is not his best, but it's stll a good read with many unexpected plot twists and turns and Jack Reacher's great analyses of several situations.  The story got a little long and slow in spots, but I still enjoyed it as I have all of Lee Child's books.
B00684J49U|5.0|This season in the series had more surprises than I expected. Since the writer, Shonda, has tried to come up with new shows and they have bombed, I am surprised that she could keep the surprises and shocks coming on this one, but she did. Can't wait to see what the new season brings and hope she can keep these people happy with their show!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie was amazing. The climax and the overall story was heart pound, jaw dropping amazing. I totally recommend this movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The first book was very similar to Fifty Shades of Grey however, this one was completely different.  This book had the perfect ending, I loved it! Half way through the book I was thinking Christian Gray who? I can not wait for the third book.  I really love how their relationship blossomed and I now understand them as a couple.  I used to think Gideon and Eva's relationship was all about sex but you'll see how their past links them together.  Yes there was a lot of sex in the book, but a lot of growth and love as well.  Gideon finally opened up about his past and Eva's past confronts her.  Sylvia Day did a great job!
B00062PN6I|4.0|I recently recieved my pair of HPM - 1000's as a hold me down till my broken HDJ - 1000's come back from Pioneer Repair. All I can say is WoW, great sound for the price point, listened to a few Dub, Reggae, House, Trap, Hip Hop and Dubstep tunes with them and the sound was great, the pads that cover your ear are soft if somewhat cheep feeling, but for 15$ with shipping I dont mind. I highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a quality pair with-out dropping 200$ plus.<br /><br />Soundcloud.com/RooeeZe
1476712042|5.0|This book is unbelievable.  I think I read the entire thing in about 4 days.  Not as raunchy as Fifty Shades of Grey or Bared to You, but it is a wonderful read.  I could not wait to see what was going to unfold during the next chapter.  I definitely recommend this book and I do not read much!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm having sooooo much fun! I thought for along time to download a HO. Thin king it would be hard to see, but it's really great.<br />Do get this app if you like HOs.
B0091XRL86|2.0|Well done visually but the story was just uninteresting. Wallace and Gromit shorts & movies, Sean the Sheep & Chicken Run are all brilliant and I've watched them countless times. So maybe my expectations were somewhat high.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was the most filthy book I have ever read and I have deleted it off my Kindle. I sure wish I had my $10.00 back. I never thought it would be that discusting. The writer must be sick in the head to write the book. No more of that stuff for me. Joanne Foster
B007P7UF0G|5.0|This was a replacement DVD for another that was erroneously purchased because of a wrong area DVD. It was for a French area which would not play on my DVD player/computer.
B0086700CM|3.0|I liked its okay you know but just it doesn't have any levels. it becomes boring and pointless after awhile but then you come back and play it again.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|\\"Glad Rag Doll\\" promised so much prior to release, \\"It's not Peel me a Grape\\" Krall promised, something about being more grown up, sensual, lovers in bed.<br />Knowing the sensational voice of Krall I pre-ordered the LP, the cover art helped with the decision too, all grown up and that.<br />In great anticipation the LP arrived, packaged well with no signs of postal damage. Cover art as previewed, excellent! This would be it Diana Krall's equivalent of an ED pill with all the promise of possible blindness, loss of limbs, dysfunctional internal body organs etc, etc.<br />Carefully unwrapping Ms. Krall, laying her gently onto the platter of a 20year old Thorens, I lowered my needle onto her. I'm Chinese, so give me a break.<br />Closing my eyes waiting for aural, deep throated bliss I began to slip away into neverland.<br />Then, beep beepidy beep beep boo! What the hell just happened! Eyes wide open from shock, a pretty rare sight for a Chinaman; I sat up and wondered if the LP was the right one. Yes, label on LP confirms it!<br />Ok, ok, take a few deep breaths here, she's teasing me, it's just foreplay, ok I get, cheeky!<br />Sit back down, give it a while.<br />I sat through the whole album waiting for post coital aural bliss, the grown upness, the lovers together in bed.<br />At one point I look at the wife for inspiration, all I got was \\"At least it's not like that stupid pool ball one\\".<br />After the curtain fell I felt cheap and dirty from the affair after my expectations of a multiple aural orgasmic experience, I was left feeling I had just paid for a cheery lap dance with a no touch clause firmly attached to it.<br />Never judge a book.........<br />To get me back into the mood I had to put Nat on the deck to get my juices flowing again.<br /><br />Note: Couldn't warrant keeping this album sent back for refund.
B0000507R0|5.0|this album has a good mix of music. the granduer of jerusalem, the fun of benny, the craziness of toccata, the beauty of still ...., the brilliance of karnevil ... all with a very satisfying 5.1 mix. if you can get it
B00008PW3P|5.0|this is on par with anything the mac ever did (yes rumours included) this is a great album and a real good 5.1 mix. lindsay buckingham at the wheel so far as i can tell, and also at the peak of his powers musically. get it
B0063IH60K|2.0|I love solitaire, and I love that I got this app for free, but the ads are ANNOYING, especially the ones you can't exit from, and they mean I can't allow my children to play this game unsupervised because I can't control what they have access to. Like I said, ANNOYING.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great meaty story, grand canvas, mystery, interesting characters, impossible to put down leading to a very stiff neck after staying up for hours to finish it, a wonderful fantasy that I highly recommend. Can't wait for the next in the series.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|A lot of the newer powerstrips have USB ports in them, so when I saw this for my son's kindle I thought is was a great idea. Besides, he is always losing his original charger so having the second one is well worth it. It works perfectly.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Finishing this book, after getting it less than 48 hours ago, touched my heart and left me thinking about all the things i took for granted that i was so lucky to have. this little boys story can move kids like me and grown ups alike and i reccomend it to anyone

AND it wont let me save 2 games. this is my first time playing this game so maybe I'm not doing something rite.  last thing it does need to be a lower price. these r the only flaws I see.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|a must have app...really operates well and is compatible with kindle. detailed in information about battery. one of kindle's best free apps.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is the best fun game. It is worth it it almost never frezes. u can play it for hours. one time I played the game for 6 hours then I had no more coins. SO GET THIS GAME

030788743X|5.0|I originally picked this up for my nook (am I even allowed to say that here?) and LOVED it. Sure I was born in '89 and didn't live through a majority of the nostalgia mentioned here. However I am one with the Force. Just because things were before my time doesn't mean I don't enjoy them just as much. I read it one more time a month later and decided once and for all I needed the hardcover. I needed a copy that was going to last forever and to show off on my shelf, and that's just where it is (until I pull it down to read it again soon).<br />The story, while laden to the teeth with culture references, is still a lively, fast-paced, and unique tale. Sure coming of age tales and hero's journey tales have been cookie cutter for centuries on end, but the premise here is unique. The world is unique. Maybe the Sixers are too one dimensional. Maybe Wade is too two dimensional. But the context makes it fun and exciting and fun and exciting is precisely what the story should be to properly fit the context. Star Wars and video games and crazy kids cartoons are all about fun and excitement. It would only be fitting to have a tale so reliant upon those to be just so. Their simplicity is why they're so easy to love.<br />And a majority of the material can never be dated because it relies on the fact that this culture constantly referenced is dead and gone, a remnant of times past.<br />There's another reason why Ready Player One is great. While some may believe that it may be far-fetched, the reality is that everything surrounding the Oasis is in production. These technologies are coming or exist. The ability to create a program like the Oasis is already here and possible. Affordable, easy to use, convincing virtual reality goggles are already here (look up Oculus Rift). \\"Haptic\\" gloves and technologies are being researched (or are here, if anyone has links feel free to share). The fact that a story could be so very out there and obviously improbable but still end up capturing exactly the direction the industry is headed is incredibly exciting.<br />I read heavy novels and enjoy them too, but I'll never go more than a year without reading Ready Player One simply because it reminds me of the magic of those things that shape your life as you grow up and how they hold a special place in your heart no matter how old you become. But it also reminds me of just how fun and exciting books and the imagination and the memory can be. The creation of excitement, wonder, and child-like awe and curiosity, that my friends is true magic.

B005LAIHY0|3.0|I will say I can see all the conflicting reviews on the action and what it started as and what it finished as. Bottom line for me it peaks my intrest in the next installment and did not put me to sleep. Just knowing that we will eventually endup at the original Aliens is good enough for me.<br /><br /> I am an middle school 3D fan 70's early 80's [when 3D would pop off the theatre screen \\"the operating table in Warhols Frankenstein hovered over the first 5 rows of audience I was seated 3/4 of the way back in the theatre.<br /><br />......But do not buy the 3D version of this film the depth is just inches above 2D. I am disapointed in modern 3D but have come to love my Vizio 42\\" passive 3D I will only buy 3D movies. They don't pop but the depth is awesome, Prometheus  has almost no depth let alone anything close to pop. The Final Destination 3D films at least have a little pop and great depth.<br />Don't wast the xtra bucks unless you can sell the 3D and DVD versions to keep the 2D for your self.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|John Green has masterfully constructed a world filled with colourful characters; a boy with a lesson to learn, a fantasy to be broken, a fantastic girl and a mystery to be solved. Paper towns is an intense tale, one that delves deep into characters and themes as well as fast paced story line that keeps a reader guessing, laughing and crying. The book was intense, intriguing and ultimately was a superb story with an excellent ending and guaranteed good read.
1455518999|1.0|I can hardly believe that this book has been written by one of my favourite authors! All the descriptions to do with photography are hopelessly naive and when I got to the second set of putrefying bodies and there were still no flies(!), well then I gave up. Having read some other reviews, I'm glad I didn't waste any more time on it. Bring back the Camel Club!
B00729GQ0A|3.0|I will admit, I couldn't finish this book. Simply there were major problems for me. One the characters, I would say more, but I'm going to leave that as undeveloped as she did. Second the pacing: fast, slow time jumped... and now we are at the middle of my review. Third the romance, hot and heavy, to cold has ice, then back again. All I can say is that Charles must take a lot of cold showers. And I am left to believe this went on for months? And last but not least; the lead character was suppose to be a collage graduate. Yet she acted like she was innocent child, and had never been around a boy before. Still with that all said, it was not all bad, in the end I do believe this was written for a much younger audiences.

0385504225|1.0|This was soooooo unbelievably boring, i am surprised i didn't fall into some sort of coma after slogging my way to the end. And thinking my efforts of staying awake would somehow be rewarded.........absolutely not! And to think i will never get the time i wasted reading this drivel back again. Ye gods, i wish i had have counted the number of grains of sand in a builders yard. Seriously, dont waste your time on this book.........no, PLEASE dont, you owe it to yourself and family not to!
0525953728|4.0|I am completely pleased with this book. It exceeded any expectations I hsd. the book is written with clarity and the research is blended with the first hand accounts.
B008OJ291W|4.0|Ok...here's the deal...This is NOT ELO...it is JEFF LYNNE...that being said...this music sounds great.  Jeff went back into the studio and re-cut classic ELO tracks and updated their sound.  If you like ELO give it a try...no the new versions are not as good as the originals...but the vocals sound so much better.  I cannot believe that Jeff still has the range he does.  My only complaint is the drums in many of the tracks lack the punch of the originals...that and I like more obscure ELO than the tracks represented here such as Fire On High...Waterfall...Rain is Falling...Tightrope...Wild West Hero...Poker...Eldorado...You catch my drift.  What I hate is that people are writing 1 star reviews instead of listening to the recording with an open mind.  ELO is in my top 10 favorite bands alonside Phish, Beatles, Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd.
0439023521|2.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />This is a tale narrated by Katmiss Everdeen.  It is sometime in the future in the country of Panen and there has been a rebellion.  The Capitol has conquered the 13 Districts--note the 13 original colonies--of what was once the USA, and had a nuclear holocaust of District 13. The other 12 Districts are submitted to the Capitol's rule by forcing them to have The Hunger Games--where two children--a boy and a girl--are selected each year to compete in a contest to the death.<br /><br />Katniss sister, Prim, is selected to compete, and Katniss volunteers to take her place for District 12--the Appalachians and the coal country of today.  The boy selected is Peeta Mellark, the baker's son who had been kind to Katniss when she was hungry.<br /><br />There is a gruesome description of Katniss' hardships and how she had survived by hunting in the woods with her friend, Gale--to put food in their family's table after her father had died in a coal mine explosion.<br /><br />Then there are The Games themselves.  The Capitol manipulates them and they are a mandatory spectacle.  Since I don't want to spoil the ending I'll just say that I was disappointed with the fact that instead on concentrating on the carnage itself, the books switches at the end into a love triangle between Gale, Katniss, and Peeta.<br /><br />The book needs improvement.  Instead of a first person narrative, it could have benefited from the technique of writing from a \\"point of view perspective.\\"  Instead of having Katniss tell us what she thinks is going on on her coach's mind--Haymitch Abernathy--a prior winner of the games, we could have been shown what was on his mind, if the author told the tale from his perspective. Instead of telling us what Peeta's mind is thinking, Ms. Collins could have showed us if she had told the story from his perspective.  And so on; what the people at District 12 are thinking is told to us by Katniss, instead of using her sister's--Prim--as the perspective.<br /><br />I know this is supposed to be a young adult's book, but the writing is soapy and childish.  The book reads easily in a day or two, and is quite entertaining.  It just doesn't have much as far as literary value is concerned.--Prim--as the perspective.<br /><br />I know this is supposed to be a young adult's book, but the writing is soapy and childish.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Well worth the price for the omnibus.  All five stories are very good.  I enjoyed the style and characters. I am  definitely going to recomend this to my friends.
B001MIVTVS|5.0|I had the original 2 LP set long ago and remember it had a lot of nice tunes on it. So I ordered it and put it into my truck's CD player, and it was as good as I recalled. Wear Your Love Like Heaven is the most known tune, but if you like Don's music I encourage you to check this one out. If you have a turntable, buy the LP set which comes in a box with some of Don's illustrations, the 2 LPs, and the lyrics to all the songs. If you're not familiar with Don, you could do a lot worse than this as an introduction. The music's from the early 70's when hippies were hippies, so the tunes are a little trippy. If that's your bag, check it out on CD or vinyl!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This album does not disappoint. I would definitely recommend it. If you're on the fence, just get it. I can't stop listening.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was an awesome read after the 50 shades series.  Still in the same direction but a little different!  LOVED it!
B009B53LA6|5.0|Such a fun album. Gwen & No Doubt never disappoint.  Settle down is def. a favorite and I love all of the songs. Also love amazon's price! =)
0553582453|4.0|Forewarning: I'm a spoiler purist, and so try to avoid spoilers as much as possible in my reviews, including basic information about both plot and characters. As a result, my reviews are somewhat vague, but I try my best to keep things spoiler-free.<br /><br />All in all, `Golden Fool' is a fairly straight-forward book. In sync with Hobb's normal trilogy structuring, this is most definitely a middle book. The first book, `Fool's Errand', is basically a standalone novel used to introduce the characters, setting, and background for the wider story, a beginning from which the following books get their grounding. You can consider the next two books in the trilogy as being one big story split in two, with the opening to this book tying up the events of the previous book.<br /><br />So, what plot we get here is basically set-up and manoeuvring, developments to keep the story moving. In the past I've found Hobb a bit predictable, but that's not the case here. Instead of having things made plain too far in advance and giving too much away, here the plot is very kept very tight to the timeline. It's something that develops as you read rather than being fully determined early on, which is really skilful writing.<br /><br />The main driver of this book, like all of Hobb's other work I've read to date, is characters, who take a much bigger role here than previously. Every plot point, and the guidance of that plot, has its foundation in the characters, and almost everything you read here will be about one character relationship or another. This book is a deep character study, an examination and reflection on the relationships between various characters. In particular, we get a nuanced look at Fitz, a look at not just his life now but how his point of view contrasts to his past. And, as ever, Hobb's characterisation is superb.<br /><br />However, this does have the downside that there isn't a whole lot of action. There's almost none. When it does happen, though, it's fantastic. As much as I like Hobb's writing it can at times feel tedious going through these character conflicts at her measured pace. When she introduces action, provided its timing works and it isn't just adding clutter to her book, the reading is immeasurably better. Furthermore, sometimes the character relationships just aren't enough to keep the story progressing, particularly when certain character relationships either stall or ease, or goes through a period of exposition or development; the action here knocks that out of its rut.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have about `Golden Fool' is Hobb's resurrection of past plot lines. The reintroduction of old characters and conflicts doesn't annoy me, but the way it's handled does. Put simply, there isn't enough background established within this story to support these additional sub plots. These characters don't have their own immediate story arc, and the lack of page time doesn't create any attachment or tension to them. It's hard to care about a character, or a particular character relationship, when you never see them. And, by extension, it's hard to care about the effect on Fitz. In my opinion, the past isn't enough to sustain the immediate story. What happens is supposed to be important, but there's not enough substance and development in the current story to make it feel important.<br /><br />At the end of this book, as with the second book from the Liveship Traders trilogy, I found myself worried about the direction of the story. There's a hell of alot to cover, and the story looks to be heading away to different areas. More, right up until the final pages the story keeps developing, and events keep happening, along a plot arc that looks like we're going to spend a big chunk of time away from. I have confidence in Hobb, but it still seems like she's setting herself on shaky ground.<br /><br />4/5
B008Y5OW20|5.0|This album is a showcase of the magic of Jeff Lynne. He takes these old tunes and puts his own style in them to give them a fresh sound. The upbeat tempo of Beyond The Sea is one that you will play again and again. The only bad thing about this album is that it isn't long enough! All in all,I think those who buy it will enjoy it. A nice and unique take on some of Jeff's favorite songs. Five stars!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I bought this book with some trepidation. I have no interest in video games. Though this book essentially takes place inside a video game, this book is not about video games. Loved the story.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was able to read the trilogy in record time for me! I found the first book terrific,  the second interesting and the third somewhat failing to make it's point.  I hope the 2 & 3 movies are better than the books!  I loved the 1st movie.

B008K4JDLA|5.0|This book opened my mind to a whole new way of doing business. The basic concept of enablement and access to manufacturing for all is a simple one but truly revolutionary. The application of what Chris is saying extends far beyond the manufacturing sector and can be applied to any business where entry barriers were traditionally high.<br /><br />The book has given me a valuable lesson in strategy as well as practical steps that will be implemented immediately and without much cost.<br /><br />The book is a real winner and a must read for anyone in business, particularly if your business happens to be of the traditional 'metal bashing' kind.

B005LAIHY0|3.0|This movie was a mess from start to finish, but at least it was a good looking mess. Its makes me think of a big budget version of \\"Mesa of Lost Women.\\" Even though you know you are awake and paying attention the entire time, you feel as if you just woke up and missed something because the characters onscreen are doing simply inane, unexplained or inexplicable things. And yawning plot holes pop up with astonishing regularity.<br /><br />I look forward to the Director's Cut restoring the two hours of missing footage necessary to make this a sensible movie.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|rayman is a classical game. this new version is pretty great. I like it very much. I am looking forward to next generation.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I downloaded this book due to its standing on the best seller's list. i am always looking for new genres, and authors. if you've read any reviews, you already know the concept of this book. i am female, over 50, and really enjoy Stephen king novels more than any other genre.<br />this book totally opened up a new world to me. i really thought i would lose interest fast, but i didn't. i was neither shocked nor upset at the graphic sex descriptions. in fact, i think i learned more about this type alternate lifestyle. i found myself rooting ana on to explore life with grey.<br />I really do look forward to the next books in the series. if you are an editor at heart, as i am, try not to spend time correcting grammar, sentence structure while reading. i found i was rewriting sentences in my mind constantly. someone needs to remove the f,r,o,w,n keys from this writers keyboard.  someone please tell her, we don't always need to known facial expressions when a character speaks.  that is the beauty of books over movies, we as readers get to visualize.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|A good read that incorporated an interesting plot which held my attention written in the typical style that Jack Reacher utilises. Recommended as worth buying
B0086QS7N2|5.0|The album is as great as everyone said it was, and having the clockwork angels novel to go along with it adds to the enjoyment . Buy the audio book because hearing Neil Pearts very passable ( probably unintentional?) Clint Eastwood impression is worth every penny. Buy it all, you will love it.
1582406723|3.0|I'm a fan of the show and of comics so a friend gave this to me as a gift. I have to give it a meh across the board. Maybe if I hadn't seen the show first I would be more into it, but, I'm not sure. The art is ok. Nothing particularly original in style or technically great. The author mentioned the artists great style and being thankful to have him inside the book...not sure how happy the author is now, since the artist is trying to sue him for TV money. I read the book before I found out about the ridicilous lawsuit, so my opinion is not jaded by that. Honestly, I thought 30 Days of Night was much more groundbreaking than this book. Again, maybe I'm jaded because I like the show, but I really wasn't drawn to continue reading this series. Just seemed sort of run-of-the-mill zombie story.
B009LH1WLO|5.0|This episode serves as an excellent set-up for season 8;  many of the old favorites are back and not don't the king of vampires is hiding out somewhere waiting to make another appearance.  Season seven seemed a bit over-campy in spots, but this episode raises hopes that season eight will be equal to the best of the seasons.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game has so many games. it was a wonderful game. my kids loved the game they play it all the tome
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I used to do the Sudoku puzzles in the paper, but tired of that after a while and quit doing Sudokus.  Then I loaded this and have been addicted.  Using the hints, I have learned how to play at much more advanced levels (now the ones in the paper are easy).
B0099G3I96|2.0|Successful bands evolve over time - they mature, they experiment.  As entertainers, I think No Doubt is a great band - I actually went to see them in concert during their last tour. What makes a good band great is that they bring something to the table that other bands don't, whether it's something as superficial as a stage gimmick or a something as significant as a signature sound. In No Doubt's case, they have a unique sound and feed a lot off of the crowd's energy during live performances. I eagerly awaited the release of Push and Shove, which took them quite a while to produce.  My rationale for that was that great things can't be rushed.  However, when I first took a listen to the tracks, I was greatly disappointed.  I'm okay with good bands changing things up, but in this particular case I think that No Doubt gave up a lot of ground in doing so:<br /><br />First, the album is heavily overproduced in my opinion. No Doubt has a great sound that will only accept so much in the way of production touches without rendering it inorganic. I think it was largely unnecessary because overproduction is typically a sign of trying to compensate for elements lacking in the band which should not be necessary in No Doubt's case.<br /><br />Secondly and most importantly, this album does not contain very much of what's made No Doubt unique as a band.  I first heard No Doubt back in 1995 and was drawn to them because they sounded very different from everyone else and they were very good at doing so. Their energetic ska-punk-poppish sound combined with Gwen's twangy vibrato really set them apart from other bands.  With the exception of Sparkle, you don't hear a lot of what makes No Doubt unique as a band on this album.  They're starting to sound like everyone else out there.<br /><br />I'm a fan of No Doubt and I sincerely hope that they recover from the rut that they're in, but if you look at the facts:<br /><br />1) This album took a long time to produce and didn't yield much.If you read the tweets on their site while they were producing the album, they tried to keep the enthusiasm going, but it was clear that they had a hard time focusing on getting the project done. This says to me that they want to keep that magic they have as a band alive, but probably just want to enjoy each other's company and spend time with their families like normal people do.  They're all married and have kids now, and that's likely where they're energy is now focused.  I think that's a great way to spend your time, but that's less energy that they can put forth for creative endeavors.<br /><br />2) While I think her voice still has a nice quality to it, you don't hear Gwen's twangy vibrato any more.  Gwen's had two kids now and I think it's great she's a mom.  However, hormonal changes in the body both as you get older and during pregnancy affect your voice.  It's my loss as a fan, but it's more than acceptable because she has two beautiful kids to show for it.<br /><br />I've been a fan of No Doubt for years, and I even liked it when they changed up their sound a bit in Rock Steady because they still retained what made them unique as a band. I gave the album review two stars simply because No Doubt as such an amazing history as a band.  Otherwise, I would have given it one star due to my high expectations from a band of No Doubt's caliber.  Sadly, Push and Shove is starting to push and shove them in the direction of sounding like every other band.  If they don't somehow recapture that certain something that made them unique, it could be the end of No Doubt as we know them.
B0091V6TF4|4.0|I already own most of the soundtracks, and the last major compilation, but the exclusion of the new song from the new movie is just sad.  It is a great compilation, for those who don't already own similar releases, but for me, a waste of money, and hardly worthy of the 50th anniversary if it does not include the new song.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|As much as I loved the first three books in this series, I disliked the final two.

The final two left me feeling I can't wait to get these over with!!<br /><br />I'm not saying don't purchase/read them, but be forwarned, the final two books leave a lot to be desired......
B007SYWFRM|5.0|hi i love this game but i was changing the registration on this and had to start all over again
B006LSZECO|4.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is very well written, with an interesting approach to an even more interesting plot.  Nick and Amy Dunne are the perfect couple; he's got a good job, and she's from old money.  But he loses that good job, his mother is very ill, his father is institutionalized, and his twin sister needs help, so he has to return to rural Missouri.  Just when things can't get any worse, they do; Amy goes missing.  Their story is told in alternating chapters; Nick in real time, Amy speaking from her diary.  So that's the approach, and I liked it.<br /><br />As for the plot, I liked that too.  There were several very unexpected twists and turns, again made even more interesting as the events unfolded in alternating chapters.  Can't reveal what that plot was though; you gotta buy the book!<br /><br />But honestly, when all was said and \\"Dunne\\", I ended up despising both characters.  If that was the author's intention, she nailed it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|nice looking, easy to use and full of information, accurate :) as accurate as weather in europe permits lol. no bugs as far as I could tell ...definitely recommend it
B005GHN2GG|4.0|This book is fantastic.  The fact that it is a self-published e-book blows me away.  The characters are rich, the narrative skillfully wrought, and the story is creative and interesting.  I had trouble putting it down!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Loved this book -- purchased it immediately after reading Gone Girl. Could not put either book down - always kept me guessing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It has been a LONG time since I have read a book besides one for work, but I had to see what all the fuss was about.  I am addicted!  Finished book one and immediately had to buy book 2 for my Kindle to continue the story.  I love that it is now turning into a true love story, and I love the way Christian takes care of Ana.  Despite his dark side, he is protective and thoughtful.  I gave it 4 stars because the inner goddess talk etc. got to be quite old.  Definitely not a reason to not read this book though!  Give me some more Christian Grey!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Book has a good story but is extremely slow moving which makes it difficult.  I enjoy a book that I have a hard time putting down.
0316227706|5.0|I preordered this book well before the release date knowing that the photographer always was posting beautiful shots on his website and facebook page. When the book arrived on my doorstep I was anxious to see if it would live up to my expectations. I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES. The images that are in this book are by far the best animal photography I have ever seen. They are real, inspiring, funny, adorable, & true to the spirit of each dog. I have never been moved as much as with these images, most made me laugh out loud, some brought tears to my eye - not in a bad way but because the photographers ability to allow you to connect with each image is so strong. This is a must have for any dog lover! I went back and purchased copies for all my family. An inspiration and feel good book that will have you amazed at the photographers talent and the dogs amazing love of the water!

B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I purchased and downloaded the mp3 album and don't regret it one bit! The album from start to finish is an instant classic with traditional Mumford & Sons solos and lyrics. Great for a fan of the band or someone who wants to start listening!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Really loved this book. My son kept talking about it but I resisted looking at it for ages - didn't want to have to read all the books that followed. Anyway now I am completely hooked and can't wait to read the rest of the series. Totally absorbing.
0345803507|3.0|I bought this series of books I am sure I have another review in here to do but let me tell you even know this is way past the blow up stage the media made this book to be that everyone ran out to buy it. I actually heard about it from my sister and she wanted to read it only cause of the media hype. OMG how wrong was I!!! I read ALOT of erotic romance books and this one is no where as erotic as others. I do have to say this first book kept me wanting to read, the second book I slowed down a bit, and the third book I didnt even want to finish reading it. I did finish it but it didnt hold my attention at all

B004Q7CIFI|3.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B009OLVIKM The Damned Summer (The Ruin Trilogy)]]I know how strange it can be writing in the past as well as the present during the same book, and it can be a sticky situation. I think King pulled it off and over all I enjoyed the book, but it was just too long. It seems that King has gotten so big, no editor has the stones to tell him to cut a couple hundred pages out.<br />I liked the setting, the characters were well developed. We all know what its going to be about by the title alone, so if you're not a JFK fan, you already know better than to pick it up, right? The part at the library was action packed and over all it was a good read. Just too long, just like under the dome, only even more needed cut.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|this hide and seek game is great. I got it for my 8 year old at first on my kindle then on her ipod and my iphone. It is such a great hide and seek game it even gets me stumped every now and then. If you want a chanllenge I would suggest this game.,
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King has always and will always be one of the best authors of our time. His books all have the best plots and twists of any horror or thriller book.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Was a good book surprise ending started out slow but so far i have liked the series looking forward to next
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I like the Fifty shades series and I would have to say this is the best of the 3 for me.  Like others have stated, I wish the writing was a bit better, but it kept me reading so I have to give it 4 stars for that!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Never knew how much of a history buff I was.  This makes it all very real and entertaining!  Can't stop reading Ken Follett!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is written from several people's points of view about a boy named Auggie.  He has never attended school with other children (homeschooled).  Since he has a facial malformation, he struggles with how others see him and how he sees himself.  It encompasses him entering school his 5th grade year and all of the lessons he and those around him learn.  Well written for any age - characters are well-developed and I have to say I got really engulfed in the story (cried the last 2 chapters).  Chapters are very short and would be great for a classroom daily read!  (You could have the students predict what will happen/how Auggie will react/how family will react, etc.)  I have already recommended the book to my own kids!
B003W5C0VW|2.0|I anticipated a great concert with Mick Taylor's skills being a big part of that anticipation. It was OK musically, but very poorly videotaped. The only focus was on Mick Jagger, in all his glory. I hard every saw another band member in the video at all!  Seriously, It also had an \\"old\\" look to it.  I believe the film's quality was the main reason why it was shelved until now. I was really disappointed.  Mick even comments at the end, explaining how the filming \\"back then\\" left alot do be desired.(?)  I wish I knew that before I bought it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I like the Fifty Shades series as much as the next gal, but this one was my least favorite.  I just never felt the plot really coming together.  As others have stated, not the best writing, but it did keep me reading (can be tough...) so it deserves 4 stars for that alone!
B009AJDDQU|4.0|This is a very good Sci-Fi movie to see.  Even though this isn't a \\"prequal\\" to the original Alien movie but I feel it has a lot of connection to the original Alien story line.  They didn't explain everything in the story but I'm sure that's to set up for future sequals.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved how the second book continued along with the first .. I couldn't put it down..every chapter had me curious for more.. You really get to know more about Christian and why he is the way he is..
B005USZML4|5.0|I love this author and have read or purchased most of his books.  This one is a take off from an earlier book and I love it. Just wish I had more time to read. Being on my Kindle, I can take and read while waiting places and in the car.  Will purchase more by this author.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is, without a doubt, the avatar of Molech, Devourer of Hours and Slayer of Triumph. I like this game.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|** spoiler alert--I do discuss the ending ** I read this book while on vacation with my family, so unfortunately, I wasn't able to write the review when it was fresh in my mind. I loved it, but I wasn't as wild about it as I was with the first book in this series. It's hard to write a sequel that tops the first, but that's not to say this book wasn't terrific. It took some spectacular twists and turns I wasn't expecting.<br /><br />There were all the elements present I had come to expect from Sylvia: angst, humor, sizzling love scenes, and lots of baggage with these messed up people. I enjoyed all of those aspects, but for some reason it felt a little lacking to me, like something was missing.<br /><br />I think I was expecting more growth from Gideon. I was hoping he'd talk to her more, open up. Instead, he did the reverse--he gave her a little bit and then almost shut down completely. There was a reason for it, and it's not revealed until the end. I loved what he did in regards to her past and what happened as a result, but I spent most of the book wanting to hammer him over the head, rather than sit and drool over him.<br /><br />There were some great moments with Cary and Eva, and I grew to adore their relationship even more. My favorite line was when he was in the hospital. Gideon asks Cary how he's feeling. This is Cary's response:<br /><br />\\"Like I got hit by a bus . . . or a bat.\\"<br /><br />I laughed so loud on this I started my kids in the room. You have to read it to understand why.<br /><br />I also loved this narrative line. It describe perfectly the feel of this entire novel in terms of Eva's tumultuous relationship with Eva:<br /><br />We stood there for a long moment, surrounded by steam and secrets, physically close yet emotionally distant.<br /><br />Yes! Great writing! Loved it!<br /><br />I equally loved it when they were in therapy together and Gideon's reaction when the therapist tells them to stop being intimate for a while so their relationship can center around something other than the physical part:<br /><br />\\"Doctor,\\" Gideon set one ankle on the opposite knee and settled back, creating a picture of unyielding decisiveness. \\"The only way I'm keeping my hands off her is if I'm dead. Find another way to fix us.\\"<br /><br />Uh, cue swooning sound effects here. And can I say I wish I had written that fabulous line? So much power in such a few simple phrases. It sums them up very well and their undying passion and need for each other on every level.<br /><br />I enjoyed finding out what the deal was with Gideon's past with Dr. Lucas. It was also great to see more of Gideon's sister, Ireland. That was a great scene when they came to dinner to meet Eva's dad. I also liked how this novel didn't take it into the typical BDSM dom/sum relationships that you see in most novels of this genre. That was refreshing. It kind of hinted in the last novel it would go that route, and when it didn't, I was pleased because it seemed more realistic for these people in the state they were in to not go that way. They have so much to figure out before they can even step a toe in that pool.<br /><br />What bothered me though in this book was the way Gideon handled things behind the scenes, making it look like he was having an affair with Corinne. I understood the public had to believe it to protect himself, but he didn't have to do it in such a way he shattered the trust so completely with Eva. It made it hard for me to believe Eva went back to him so easily at the end. I thought for sure she'd make him build that trust back up somehow. It seemed incongruous with her personality. I mean, the woman went around exactting some type of retribution on all of the people that messed him up. Her conversation with his mom was very satisfying--adored that scene! But the ending left me feeling kind of annoyed with Eva. Where was that tough woman then? I know she's gotta have him (I agree since I feel the same way about that man) but withthe amount of distrust he produced, even with her understanding why, it seemed off for her to almost jump back in his arms without any talking, reservation or argument.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is where the 4 star ratings comes from and why I felt a little let down. I had a hard time believing this damaged woman that was taking Krav Maga classes and standing up to him all the time on other issues would cave so easily. It was unbelievable to me; too inconsistent. That's something Gideon would do, not her. He would forgive without explanation or reservations because he doesn't want to talk, he almost doesn't want to know. But isn't that the crux of their problem Eva has with their relationship? He doesn't talk, doesn't want to explain. He did offer some of himself, and I loved what he shared, of course I wanted more, but it still wasn't enough for her. So, why, for the love of all that's Eva, would she simply fall at his feet. Yes, he saved her from her demons, but still. I'm sure it's just me, and my desire for her to continue to be feisty and slightly defiant, but, man, I expected more from her. And I'm hoping to get it in the next book. I hope she gives him hell for all he put her through before they make-up. That's something I'll definitely look forward to and long to see...<br /><br />I'm hoping it tops what she did to get get back at him when he had somebody watching her every move and interfering in Vegas, making her life difficult. That was hilarious! Loved her wicked imagination and sense of fairness and equality.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next installment! Want more touching \\"I love you!\\" scenes, more delving into his hideous past with his family, and more growth from him.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|As an e-reader this app is the Cadillac ( not Rolls) of the bunch. Great content, ease of use, etc.<br /><br />BUT it is not a home library substitute. I feel like it was written by a geek who own two books. I have to go into the PC kindle to find a cookbook or a sifi novel or a computer book and then search the title on the tablet to find the book to read.<br /><br />Your programmers need to talk to that librarian that told them to be quiet in the library when they were eight.<br /><br />If I can't find it, I can't read it.<br /><br />Even the new Fire HD doesn't have collections.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|Sons of Anarchy Season 4 was probably the best season yet. Granted, season 5 is still ongoing and we simply can't get enough. My husband and I watch this show together, and we both thoroughly enjoy the storyline, plot, actors and filming of this show. Thank you Amazon for having this available so that we were able to catch up in time for Season 5 to begin!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|If u loved fifty shades then you will love this book! I couldn't put it down. Can't wait till the next book comes out.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|With Emmy Lou's voice, any thing she does is great, but her match-up with Mark really works well. Their voices mesh extremely well, and the songs are well chosen.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't know this group prior to this album.  Took a friend's suggestion and I absolutely loved it...the vocals are hauntingly beautiful at times and really take you on a journey.  I recently bought their earlier album and, although it has a very different feel to it, I'd highly recommend that as well.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|DON'T BUY!!!<br /><br />I am on my third set of these headphones. The only reason why I have kept using these is because I bought them at wal-mart and have been exchanging them for free.<br /><br />They work well at first, but every set of these I've had stop working after a few months. Either the left or the right ear goes out and never comes back.<br /><br />The quality on these is sub-par, they feel cheap in your hands, and they only last a few months if you're lucky! Save your money and spend a little more on some Astro or Sony headphones.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I've purchased and now have in my collection.  Every song by Adele is wonderful.  Whenever I'm in my car, I play this album over and over again and never get tired hearing her voice and her lyrics.  It's a must have for everyone!!

B005K17RU0|5.0|So far so good. It does everything it's supposed to do & more. User friendly & easy to use. That may be redundant. Price is right as well (free)
B0087ZFHBM|3.0|I am a big fan of Mike Oldfield and find many of his albums sound very good. This is one of my favorites and in spite of the remix it still sounds bad.  I find this odd since Mike has warned people against playing his albums on bad stereos.  Since the (poor) remake of Shiva sounds OK I do not understand why they can't get the tonal qualities of the rest of the songs right.  There is virtually no bass or lower midrange.  The songs sound like they are coming from a horn loaded speaker with a small woofer.  Usually when this happens the person mixing it has a system or room combination that extenuates these areas so they mix them down by mistake. Very unfortunate.<br />)
0525953728|5.0|A very excellent book and was truly inspirational to me  and just a great book. It gives a true light as to what our brave Navy Seals do and all the training that they have to go through to become Americas best.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I say kind of because it is not a direct prequel.  You do not see tons of Aliens running around on the planet.  I would best describe the story in Alien as an offshoot to this one.  There are certainly elements of Alien in the film, and you can see where Alien picks up after this. If however you are looking for a story that leads right into the other movie, this is not it.<br /><br />Taste in a movie like this will be totally subjective.  If you are not a fan of Alien or Aliens (or similar movies) you are probably not going to like this.  As I said before, if you are looking for a direct tie in, and are expecting it to be exactly like Alien, you will probably be disappointed by this.  This movie does have its own story apart from the Alien aspect which, if another movie is made, will likely be the focus.  If you read any of Ridley Scott's comments about the film before it came out, you can tell what he meant after seeing it.<br /><br />As for the story, it is really about the origins of humanity.  I will not give too much of the story away, but it explores the possibility that humans were created by a race called \\"Engineers\\" seen briefly in Alien as the dead Space Jockey.  The ship travels to what the crew thinks is the home world of the Engineers only to find them gone and clues to what happened to them.<br /><br />It definitely sticks to some of the horror and sci-fi movie cliches.  There are stupid decisions made left and right by the characters, and if those kind of things bug you about a movie, this one will too.  There is not a lot of character development (not that there was a ton in the original movie either) so you do not really find yourself rooting for anyone.  I do think it is a solid enough story that if it is continued it has potential to be very good and go in a lot of different directions.  If you can look past the weak points and not set your hopes too high on the Alien aspect of the film I think you can still find this enjoyable.
B008XG1X18|4.0|the only issue I have is the freezes and force close on my fire. other than that when it does work its awesome!
B009GEELDS|5.0|This so just keeps getting better and better. Andrew Marlowe and co. do not disappoint now that Castle and Beckett are together. After the storm is exciting and fast paced and finally brings Beckett a little closure in her mothers case. Fantastic start to season 5, I must say. It can only get more exciting from here.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|The bulk of this album as per usual for any Bon Dylan album is dense. It requires more than a few listens to get to the heart of it.The man has a grasp of the language second to none.Like Ezra Pound and T.S Elliott Fighting in the Captain`s tower,While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers.Ths allagory is exquisite.I only wish that it included a print out sheet that cleared up any questions on pronunciation,Thank You Mr.Zimmerman,Chucky
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Chances are good that you already know this musical.  But this new BluRay edition makes it almost like a brand new friend. The sound is great--fresh but not overdone--and the colors and detail simply jump off the screen.  If I had to quibble, I might say the video is a little saturated: frame-by-frame inspection will turn up quite a few artifacts.  But it's barely a quibble.  It looks wonderful.<br /><br />Any viewer will have a favorite performance in this movie (it's not a film.  It's a MOVIE) and I couldn't argue with any choice.  Whether it's the gung-ho work of Debbie Reynolds, the confident grace of Gene Kelly or the lithe and acrobatic Donald O'Connor, you couldn't pick a loser.  For me, the standout has always been Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont.  She's a marvelous combination of mean and stupid, with a voice that will spoil every drop of milk in your refrigerator. This is one of the funniest women since Judy Holliday or Gracie Allen.<br /><br />If you're new to musical theater, start here.  No other musical has been so appropriate for the big screen.  I can only warn that one tune or another will be stuck in your head for days.

0156034026|4.0|I liked this book. I say that with some reservation. Considering the subject, it is troubling. The format is compelling. A first person monologue. The topic is very current. It looks at 9/11 from a foreign student's point of view. A bright student enrolls in Princeton with a scholarship and is recruited by a Corporation promptly upon graduation. During the summer vacation following graduation with fellow Princetonians in Greece, he meets Erica another graduate from Princeton. Soon after he starts working in New York. Erica, living in New York with her parents in their penthouse introduces him to the social scene in Manhattan. What is not spelled out here is that he makes few friends. The one person he relates closest to other than Erica and Jim, the man who hires him and is his boss at the valuation firm where he works is another coworker, Wainwright, who joined at the same time as him. Erica is a troubled soul, damaged from a previous relationship. If she had been normal things may not have turned out so  badly for this man. One cannot help thinking this way but then there would have been no story. The writer uses this backdrop to explore 9/11 and its aftermath, to dissect in detail what went through the minds of countless \\"foreigners\\" as they watched the unfolding war on terror. Many foreigners, especially students in New York particularly, revel in their \\"foreignness\\". When the whole country was swept up in the patriotic wave, after the initial euphoria, these newcomers had to face reality. His was a generation that had not fought in a war; he had no ancestral claim to the triumphs of previous wars. In this new setup how does one even begin to belong? For an over-achiever it turns out to be a tripping point.<br />Following a trip to his homeland during the December holidays after 9/11, he decides to let his beard grow. This becomes his new identity, which does not sit well with his coworkers. Eventually the writer returns him to his homeland where he lives a lifeshrouded in paranoia.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|What attracted me to their music was the obvious sense of delight and the androgynous sound of the lead singer.  I like music that doesn't sound like it was made in a factory.  I like the unique, the different: special.<br />Specifically, I love the operatic brilliance of Some Nights Intro (very reminiscent of Queen), Carry On is a poignant anthem, It Gets Better is a discordant march of sorts.  The songs range from infectious to mischievous (Why Am I The One).  Some of the songs have a definite party atmosphere; all of them are distinct and memorable.  I took to their music immediately.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A movie like this risks taking itself too seriously. This movie didn't. The humor elevates the entertainment value immeasurably and Downey's performance alone makes it worth watching. I see new nuances each time I view it. This is a movie worth owning.
B003Y5H5B0|3.0|From all the hype, I was expecting a sidesplitting laugh-a-thon.  Instead, what I watched was a fairly standard spoof that veered uncontrollably from the awkward and humiliating aspects of high school to the maudlin and lame antics of supposed friends/partners.  I didn't see anything fresh or new.  There were no blinding insights.  The humor was sophomoric at best and doled out in spurts and dribbles (I will admit I chuckled a few times).  The dynamic between the two main characters was totally predictable, the outcome was no surprise, and the very special guest star was absolutely unnecessary and didn't add a thing to this movie.  Eh.<br /><br />I was less than impressed and so glad I didn't buy it.  It's the next day and I've forgotten most of it already.
0525953728|5.0|I loved the book.  It really shows the work that these men do on a daily basis that we never even think about.  They are the real heroes.  Shame on the White House for leaking their identity.

B008FSCNTK|3.0|All musicians have to decide whether to play the same songs the same old way or whether to re-invent themselves periodically. With some, like John Coltrane, this is a continuous process, and so listeners come to expect something different with each album. With others, like Paul Desmond, he played the same way (or an approximation of it) his entire career. Sometimes, an artist with play one way for a while and then switch gears. Miles Davis comes to mind - he went from playing classic small group jazz with his original quintet, to modal jazz on Kind of Blue, to post-bop with the quintet with Wayne Shorter, et al, to fusion and so on.<br /><br />Diana Krall has the tough job of deciding who she wants to be and whether to sing standards in a small group setting or whether to branch out. She has obviously chosen the latter, having recorded albums with a big band (\\"From This Moment On\\"), of originals (\\"The Girl in the Other Room\\") and with strings (\\"The Look of Love\\"). Glad Rag Doll is the latest effort to re-create Diana Krall.<br /><br />This is not Krall's best effort. She makes a game attempt, but the instrumentation and arrangements do not showcase her voice or piano, and the songs have a limited emotional range. There is a \\"thump-thump\\" quality to the rhythm section which was probably intentional given the pre-bop nature of the songs being sung but given the musicians, is not done effectively. There is a lot of twangy guitar (and banjo and dobro) which is not going to be what Diana Krall's listeners want to hear.<br /><br />The best songs on this album, not surprisingly, have the least thump-thump and twang. Glad Rag Doll, Prairie Lullaby, Here Lies Love and I Used to Love You are probably the best numbers on the album and allow Krall to sing in her breathy way without the distraction of too much thump and twang.<br /><br />I suspect that this will be a controversial album in Krall's oevure and that she will seek to re-invent herself from time to time. I agree withreviewers who think that her best albums were recorded earlier when she played with her trio and did standards and straight-ahead jazz. Like many jazz artists who have had to go commercial for her record label, she still does mostly straight-ahead stuff in concert. I hope that Krall's next effort will be jazz.

B004LWZW6K|1.0|Parody requires intelligence and a reason for it's existence that enhances the original parodied source. Outside of boobs (for those few on Earth to not know them if they saw them) this movie was so bad (script, acting, filming, CGI) that it set a near personal record for fast forwarding so I could still retain important time for living e.g. digging a hole in the ground to immediately fill it back up.

B0099G3I96|3.0|I was excited about the new album since I heard that No Doubt was finally beginning to work on it. After my first listen, I was \\"OK\\" with it. I gave it a couple of more tries and have come to the conclusion that I cannot go past the first four songs. I've loved No Doubt since the pre-Tragic Kingdom days. \\"Settle Down\\" is great. And my favorite song by far is \\"Push and Shove\\" (although the chorus part is still a little iffy). \\"Looking Hot\\" is fun and \\"One More Summer\\" is a great song. I can't wait to see those four live. The rest on the other hand, I'll go grab a beer while they come on.

But this almost $30 set includes a very pitiful array of knex blocks, the connections are filmsy and break if you handle it a little too rough. We spent all the time building it and then it was still very very hard to get the pigs to stay on the flat surfaces. Save your money.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Ben Goldacre fills a vitally important niche in popular science literature. His books serve as a way of explaining highly technical and complex medical issues in language that is easily understood and with emphasis and focus that makes the seriousness of the issues at hand impossible to ignore.<br /><br />Goldacre also holds himself to a far higher standard of scientific excellence than the groups he is critiquing, exhaustively referencing, justifying and clarifying his points so that there is no doubt of the accuracy of his claims.<br /><br />This book sinks a knife into the heart of the nonsense and pseudo-science that is far too often espoused by the pharmaceutical industry and tacitly endorsed by overawed journalists and cowed academics.<br /><br />If you want to know why the drugs are you taking sometimes don't work and often make you ill then you need to read this book.<br /><br />And any medical practitioner, academic or researcher who does not read this book should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.<br /><br />It is absolutely excellent.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is amazing! i couldn't put i down and it gave 50 shades of gray a run for its money!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard such great things and that people couldn't put it down.  So maybe my expectations were too high.  I COULD put it down, but I finished it and it was overall enjoyable.  Doesn't leave a good taste in your mouth though with these despicable characters.
0451213092|5.0|In his book, On Wings of Eagles, Ken Follett does an excellent job of providing the reader with background on the company's employers and the events leading up to their imprisonment in Iran.  His engaging account produces a novel that is, in many ways, more interesting than a fictional story.[[ASIN:0451213092 On Wings of Eagles]]
0061692042|4.0|If Canada [Harper Collins; 2012; $28] was the name on a crayon, the color would surely be gray. Gray, gray, gray. And not fifty shades of it, either. Gray setting. Gray characters. Black and white exists, but all of humanity is in that mixed zone in between, unsuspectedly teetering on the edge of what some arbitrary force has defined as good or bad. Richard Ford's singular narrator, who remains a teenage boy for most of the story, recognizes a destiny that is bleak and never under your own control. The boy doesn't give up, but neither does he strive, as he's convinced \\"every situation in which human beings are involved can be turned on its head.\\" He knows \\"no matter the evidence of your life, or who you believe you are or what you're willing to take credit for or draw your vital strength and pride from--anything at all can follow anything at all.\\" This is the constant tone of this wonderfully written ugly novel.<br /><br />Canada is as much a painting as it is a book. In gray, of course. Everything is there to look at--all at once. The most incredible thing is that the entire work is full of what we all know now as \\"spoilers\\", where everything is divulged at all moments. We have no clues, no surprises, no climaxes. We know everything that is going to happen from the very beginning--and yet we keep reading and we hang on. Better yet, we press on--which is the only virtue you have in a bleak gray landscape that has been thrust before you.<br /><br />A case study for existentialism in its purest state (with some futility sprinkled on top), readers can possess sympathy, but our characters here will quickly dispell the notion that fairness counts for anything.<br />--Tom Field
B008VVT51U|4.0|This movie captures the hopes and fears that all of use 65 and over go thought either before we retire or when we retire. We have gotten so used to living on a working wage with discretionary funds available and when that wage is no longer there,and we have to live on our retirement money plus Social Security- we panic.  At least I did. Now I have to pay for Plan B, get supplemental medical insurance, dental, and prescription insurance. Who knows, I will eventually have to worry whether I need to sell my house and move into senior living. But most of all, I have to think about what do I really want to do in my retirement years.  Too much to think about.  Almost all of this is covered in the movie and it was wonderful to see how difference individuals handled or didn't handle these waning year.  This movie gave me the mantra that I hope to direct my movement forward and that was \\"Everything will be all right in the end, and if it is not, then it is not the end.\\"  A great movie.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|A fabulous movie from the past. I saw this when I was a kid. It's a cult classic with Tim Curry giving the best performance ever! I just don't think this would have worked with any other actor! If you want weird, singing and dancing, and a relatively unclear plot... Just watch it!
B007NG93CK|4.0|This was an engrossing read. Mostly set in a remote town with a sinister moodiness about it, the story has plenty of depth and links into an interesting mining background. I liked the way the author includes plenty of detail about the  case and also sets the story convincingly in the town where the main story unfolds. A very current story in terms of the side issues which are raised.
0810993139|1.0|This book makes bad behavior seem funny and hence encourages young children to emulate the behavior.  I hoped and hoped and hoped the the boy would see the error of his ways but he doesn't.  He allows his friend to \\"take one for the team\\" when he doesn't come clean about terrorizing the kindergarteners.  He thinks its ok that Grandma's house got TPed for something he did becuase she's retired and has nothing better to do then clean up the mess anyway.  At every turn this kid makes the wrong choices, blames someone else, hopes he won't get caught next time and there are no real consequences for his actions.  His last little act of kindness, at the end of the book, did nothing to make up for all the poor choices he made throughout the book.  Would not recommend unless you actully plan to read it with your child and explain why how this kid acts is wrong and discuss what a better choice may be.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I am a big Reacher fan and this book does not disappoint.  Not as action oriented as Child's other Reacher books but satisfying nonetheless.  There is suspense and there are twists and, best of all, there is justice Reacher style.  If you are a fan too you will not be disappointed.  Can't wait for the next novel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|wow.. great   story. Compares.. to hunger games.  I would have paid more to read this.  glad it was on sale so that i had the chance to read it.
B006ATJXQW|2.0|I often read teen novels because the ideas in them are so unique.  I found the story concept interesting.  That is what drew me to the novel.  However the writing style was almost amateurish and left me unsatisfied and frustrated.  I will not be pursuing the Maze Runner series as the writing in this novel was far too irritating to me.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Easy to stay captivated and it's very steamy!!!  I purchased the second book because I had to know what happens to the characters.  Can't wait for the third book'

B0068LYEHA|1.0|I just couldn't get through the book.  I felt like it was supposed to be Chelsea Handler/Tina Fey type book that missed the mark.  I didn't find anything particularly amusing.  In fact, it was almost a little awkward to read.  I struggled through the first 100 or so pages and decided not to finish the book.  Most likely, I won't be recommending this book.
B0000264PW|5.0|This is one of the best hard rock bands ever. This album will not disappoint. Great songs .If you love hard , melodic rock, you will love this one..
B000FCKIFU|5.0|This five book series,\\"Hells Corner\\" is not listed as a \\"Camel Club\\" book, should be read in order. Characters are  developed and added or deleted as the series progresses. Once I started reading the \\"Camel Club\\" I couldn't put it down except for short breaks. Oliver Stone aka John Carr,the main character,and the rest of the club members race through a suspenceful tale with twist and turns through out. I immediately read the rest of the series and was not disapointed. I hope that Mr. Baldacci adds to the series as it remins me of when I was much younger and read my first Bond novel.

B009A3NGF4|5.0|I have been waiting for this album since the band first released word of it. I love the songs and the meaning behind it and I love how raw the feelings are. If you ever have a chance go to their website and hear how each song came about.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun puzzle game that is deceptively simple and endlessly enjoyable. All about lines and connecting them and stuff. Totally rad. Check it out.
1400064627|5.0|Wonderful novel. The most optimistic, heartwarming, and life-asserting book I've ever read. The book is much better than movie. Want to re-read it again and again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The whole series is wonderful. Got a little boring in the middle but right around the end, you wanted to read more and that's where the book stops. I can't wait to read another novel like this from E.L. James! I'd like to know more about Grey's childhood.
B005974CDU|4.0|\\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" is the first Dream Theater album without their drummer, Mike Portnoy. Despite a fair bit of controversy surrounding the event, the band picked Mike Mangini as their replacement. Mangini is an incredible drummer, and has actually played on several of lead singer James LaBrie's solo albums. Although guitarist John Petrucci wrote the drum tracks (along with the majority of the lyrics) for the album, Mangini proves to be an exceptional choice for the band. This album was a bit of a change in direction for the band as well; bassist John Myung has gotten more involved in the writing process, with more focus on his bass lines and even writing lyrics for the first time in about twelve years, LaBrie has shifted his focus a bit more towards his vocal melodies, and Petrucci now handles the production of the album on his own, previously sharing the responsibility with Portnoy.<br /><br />1. On the Backs of Angels - The album's lead single. Fitting for an opening track. The song starts off with a clean guitar inro that slowly builds up into a heavy chorus backed with the usual instruments along with a choir. This album certainly has more of an orchestral feel to it than their others, with more emphasis on choir, strings, and piano arrangements. Not the best on the album, but it's a good song, containing a heavy intro, a melodic chorus, and breakdowns not focused solely on instrumental prowess. 3.5/5<br /><br />2. Build Me Up, Break Me Down - A bit different than their usual stuff. It starts off a bit electronic with a constant and strong guitar riff. The rest of the bands joins in and fits perfectly with the riff that sets the tone for the rest of the song. The electronic element is present within the majority of the song, which suits the mid-paced and heavy style of the song. The song doesn't get too carried away, as the chorus is a bit melodic, like the previous song. The end of the chorus features backing by LaBrie that contains some of the highestnotes he has ever hit. 3.5/5<br /><br />3. Lost Not Forgotten - This is more in the style of their usual stuff than the last two, a song with an extended length that has plenty of technical riffs and passages along with crazy solos. Starting off with piano, the song doesn't take long to venture into the heavy and technical style that remains prominent throughout. Every member of the band shines here, most notably keyboardist Jordan Rudess, with his fitting backing arrangements and constant solos, and LaBrie, with his vocal approach staying constantly strong to complement the song. The solos and breakdowns are flashy, to be sure, but this song, along with others on the album, give a slightly different approach than usual, with solos and backing instrumentation being more melodic. 3.5/5<br /><br />4. This Is the Life - One of the softer songs on the albums. Unlike some of Dream Theater's softer work, this song doesn't venture too far out of it's boundaries; it stays consistently soft while constantly changing to make it interesting. This may not be the best soft song that Dream Theater has done, but it doesn't feel out of place for the band or the album, and it also manages to stay consistent. 3/5<br /><br />5. Bridges in the Sky - Originally titled \\"The Shaman's Trance\\". The intro to this song is certainly unique, mostly acapella with some light instrument accompaniment. The song immediately changes as the intro goes into to one of the heaviest riffs on the album. The heavy guitar sets the tone for the majority of the song that also has, like the other songs on the album, a melodic chorus. This song also has an instrumental breakdown that is both technical and filled with solos. Being of the heaviest and most progressive on the album, this is one of the best tracks on the album. 5/5<br /><br />6. Outcry - Another song with a clean intro, this is a moderately paced song that's heavy but also melodically driven. This song features some of the best lyrics on the album.This song also shows that Rudess is definitely taking a different approach this time (more so than the other band members), with interesting choices for backing arrangements and solos. Going by the instrumental parts of this song, it shows that the rest of the band also decided to take a more melodic turn for solos, breakdowns, and technical parts for this album. 4/5<br /><br />7. Far from Heaven - One of the two ballads on the album. Heavily piano driven, it's lyrics by LaBrie and music are very sad, and his vocal approach fits the song perfectly. This is some of the softest playing the band has done to date, especially by Rudess, with piano accompaniment that can only be described as beautiful. 4.5/5<br /><br />8. Breaking All Illusions - Probably the most \\"progressive\\" song on the album, it starts off with a techinical guitar riff thats slowly joined by other instruments. While initially a techinical onslaught, the keyboards set the tone for the melodic nature of this song. The soft verse has light keyboards with fitting bass and drums before LaBrie and the guitar enter smoothly. The lyrics, penned by Myung with help from Petrucci, are more introspective than the others on the album, offering a nice change of pace. After an equally soft second passage, the technicality and heaviness pick up briefly before LaBrie comes back in to match the rest of the band. As quick as it became heavy, it goes back to melodic, before using the keyboard riff from the beginning as a basis for the chorus. The short keyboard intermission keep the first few instrumental parts interesting, while it slowly picks up into an extended melodic gutiar solo. After that, the tehcnical breakdowns inevitably come into play. The melodic chorus eventually comes back and evolves into an incredible outro that's based on one of the final piano melodies from \\"Far from Heaven\\". 5/5<br /><br />9. Beneath the Surface - A ballad with music and lyrics written completely by Petrucci. Taking a simplistic approach, like the other ballad, the vocals and instruments are soft and casual, which fits the tone of the song and it's lyrics. A short and airy keyboard solo continues the song as LaBrie's vocals harmonize and the keyboard backing becomes more prominent. As the song fades back into the original soft chorus, LaBrie's vocal shoot up on octave, which greatly intesifies his performance and the song overall. It concludes with the same passage as the intro, ending with strings and a final arpeggiated guitar chord. 4/5<br /><br />\\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" is a slightly different approach for the band, as the members became more active in their respective roles after the departure of Portnoy. Because Mangini joined after the album was virtually finished, his drum contributions are limited to playing what Petrucci had already written, which surprisingly fits all of the songs on the album. With this in mind, it's clear that this doesn't sound like a typical Dream Theater album; all of the elements of their music -- the heaviness, progressive sound, and sense of melody -- are set to an extreme for this album. This can easily make a song sound as if it's overstepping it's boundaries, or that it's trying too hard, but the overall product ends up more satisfying than disappointing.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Action packed on every page does great job of putting you  right in the woods with them.
0525478817|5.0|I read this book in less than 24 hours and while I'm not a crier (and I am a woman!) this book did make me get that blasted lump in my throat, but not until the very end.<br /><br />I loved the sarcasm and wit that came from all the teenagers.  It made them real.<br /><br />Loved it.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Jon Stewart referenced this book in a show and I didn't get the reference. I went and took a look at it and then immediately downloaded it and finished it half a day later. fantastic.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this book down. Hands down best books I've read in awhile. Wish there was a fourth book.
0316228532|5.0|I was very excited to get this book, it came exactly on the date it was suppose too, and it was in perfect condition! Couldn't wait to get my hands on one! Also much cheaper than the book store. It was listed for $35 and was sold on Amazon for $20.90!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|My favorite is \\"word of the day\\". This helps us expand our vocabulary in our daily lives. Accessible and easy to use.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This books, to me, deserves WAY more than 5 stars!!  I get really nervous with book series'...  I love them, but they scare me at the same time.  I always wonder how the author can make the next book, or books, better.  Either they try too hard, or not hard enough.  In this case, Reflected in You is 100 times better than Bared to You!!<br /><br />Gideon, oh Gideon...  I am so in LOVE with him!  I hated him and loved him through out the book, but 100% fell head of over heels in the end.  No questions asked.<br /><br />I hear Gidean and Eva so much!!<br /><br />I never felt that this book dragged on.  It was action packed the entire time.  I couldn't put it down!!!  I found myself reading slow much slower than normally just to make it last longer.  Book three can not come fast enough!!!<br /><br />5+++++++ Stars!!
B009B50QOU|5.0|Because of UNO!, I now have a new found fondness for Green Day. They were already one of my favorite bands but, UNO put them back at the top.<br />Looking forward to the releases of DOS and TRES!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It's been awhile since I've been riveted to a book.  This one has it all, family values tested, some humor, legal wrangling, suspense, and a great conclusion.  You won't be sorry.
B005JABN8Y|5.0|If you can handle building a High Grade Gundam Model Kit, then this will be a little bit more challenging. The parts are very fragile. I destroyed a fence rail cause I pushed it in too hard and it was a pain to super glue it together as the rails are microscopic. While painting Usopp's back, I placed it flat down on the table and accidently crushed his long nose.<br /><br />The characters were extremely hard to paint, I managed to do it with the bit fat tip Gundam markers cause I was careful enough, but you really need fine tip. The decals on the small flag was easy enough to place but the strawhat symbol on the main mast requires some skill as it is not a flat mast. You will need to use a Q-tip to press the decal to fill the mast lines so that it looks real. Try not to redo it repetitively because I was aiming for perfection so I had to dip the whole mast into water to release the decal, but after about three tries the decal will weaken and rip.<br /><br />This item provides stickers as an alternative to decals, but the difference in realism from using decals is obvious. Most of the doors come unpainted, so the painting must be done before the assembly. I rushed into building then paint, and it was impossible to disassemble without destroying the amazing ship.<br /><br />Most of the characters cannot stand alone nor do they have a mechanism to attach on the stand that was given. Since the stand ends up being just a square of plastic, I ended up just gluing the characters directly onto the ship because the stand covers too much of the ships area to make the ship look good.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is one of those purchases where I really did not know what I wanted to read.  I read another review or two and bought this book.  I am glad that I did.  I really like it.
1439102430|5.0|This book was received in very good condition and quite soon after order was submitted and accepted.  I enjoy the Kathy Reichs books but had somehow missed this one when first available.  I very much appreciate this source through Amazon.com allowing readers to continue having access to books no longer readily available in the local general markets.
B009GED1IY|5.0|When I went to see this movie in the theaters Inhad no idea it was a musical and I was pleasantly surprised that it was.  I've been waiting ever since then to be able purchase this.  Not only was I able to purchase the HD digital version of this movie from Amazon but I was also able to do so WAY earlier than it is being released in the stores.  Love the movie and my kids are constantly watching it on their kindle fires'.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Just what you want from a Jack Reacher story. If you've like the others you'll like this one. Great story line, the usual feminine interest and lots of action.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|Bias Alert - I really like Joe Bonamassa's work and am inclined to enjoy all his albums.  That being said, rating Dust Bowl only 4 stars was difficult. I think that in context with the universe of blues rock, Dust Bowl is an easy 5 star work.  However, I am grading Joe on a curve against his own work.  While DB is truly excellent, I found it not as compelling as several other Joe B albums.  For example, Blues Deluxe and the Live at Royal St. Albert double set just to name a couple.  Nevertheless, if you love blues rock, then anything by the man I believe inherited SRV's mantle, belongs in your collection.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very neat puzzle game! Sometimes it lags a little, but it doesn't stop the gameplay from being fun. Very user friendly interface too. The music and graphics are also very nice.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really hope the author decides to write more to this trilogy. I was completely hooked and read this book in less than 1 day! It keeps you in suspense and right when you say you're going to put the book down, the chapter ends leaving you having at the edge of your seat wanting more. Definitely a great read! Would totally reccomend. 5/5*
B008I34YYY|1.0|Do not buy this movie or waste your time with it. Truly terrible and I want my money back... don't get fooled by a clever campaign of high end marketing. It's a terrible and not funny film.. ugh.. terrible on all levels.. funny concept but the movie is so awful.. did I say AWFUL... my god what were these idiots thinking.. You can't even watch it for fun like Birdemic... oh well. .buyer beware.
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|I always wanted to see this series. Being able to download the two seasons has allowed me to watch and enjoy at my own pace. It is a great series that holds your interest and you can't wait to get to the next episode.  I think I'll have to continue to watch the series on my kindle. I wouldn't have the patience to wait a whole week to find out what happens next.  I highly recommend.
0316228532|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever TRIED to read. Mostly narrative, little actual dialog among characters. I could stand no more after about 100 pages, and that was torture. It was my book club's choice, and that is the only reason I threw $14.99 in the toilet. Great sleeping pill.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|Why oh why do I have to look at this hard faced actress in what appears seems to appear, every scene. When are we going to have a male actor to make this part more solid and believable. This series needed beefing up by not pampering to the female audience which is rampant throughout TV over the last twenty years.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This book started extremely slow and has remained slow.  Not nearly as well done as Follett's first book in this series.
B004RKXNDU|3.0|Pure LeCarrer. He is the thinng man's spy. I think that this one was written after he came in out of the cold. It has some time has gone buy markers in it.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This book started out with a wonderful premise.  Unfortunately, it soon became too much fiction--more fantasy than fiction.  I ended up giving the book 3 stars because overall it is entertaining and well written, but it wasn't exactly my cup of tea.<br /><br />This centenarian walks off and leaves an old people's home and ends up doing incredible things, like grand larceny, murder and evading police.  As I read on, his past one hundred year life was even more unbelievable.  It soon became too unbelievable and I had difficulty finishing the book.<br /><br />Overall, the writing saved the book for me.  This book at least was entertaining.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first...to slow and not nearly as innovative...it was more like reading a chick flick
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|After reading this book, I have been able to understand so much more clearly why I am who and where I am.  The simple concept that logic and emotion are constantly fighting to make the decision gave me a whole new outlook on my thoughts and actions.  I can now stop and ask what is in control and adjust if my emotions are taking me places I don't want to be.  It was really encouraging to see the stories of people who have fought against emotion to satisfy logic, even when not at all socially accepted.  Even if I haven't gotten to a place where all my choices are right, at least I can say that I have made peace with change in a way I never thought I could.  Another book that makes a great companion to this one is [[ASIN:B008CUKICA A Book of Knowing and Not Knowing (A Handbook for the Information Age)]].  In this book, the author shows you how to navigate changes in technology and information and only use what you need.  Together, these books have helped me break free from always doing \\"what was expected\\".

B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Within a few seconds of listening to Duquesne Whistle, it became one of my favorite song of all time! In this project, Bob Dylan seems to have channeled a variety of musical souls from the last hundred years or more of American popular music and with their help, he created a beautiful, exciting, haunting collection of stories and forgotten memories that will make you smile, sometimes make you cry, and definitely make you glad you're alive to experience Bob Dylan's page of music history.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Redundant sums this book up... The end is quite wonderful - 3/4's of this material could have been cut out and the last 1/4 attached to 'Bared to You'. Doubtful I'll read the third.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|I remember being a high schooler all those years ago and defending kiss and their music.  Most bands that I grew up with grew up too - music that grew and lyrics that became more insightful.  I remember as a kid being fascinated with the old horror movies and the mystery of kiss was very cool.  As I grew older, I continually wondered if kiss would ever grow up.  Rather they turned into a bunch of porno weak men and never grew up.  I hope parents do not take their kids to this nonsense and perhaps one day they will grow up.  For now will the real men read \\"A Walk Across The Sun\\" and stop worshiping the false illusion that women want to be treated in this manner - especially by 60 year old men.  And to think I defended them when I was younger.  Thank goodness I grew up.  What a shame.  MAD
B0013KTGAG|4.0|Sunshine was a wonderfully beautiful movie with a great diverse cast and a great use of special effects for the setting,you get the loneliness and isolation of space and the dangerous beauty of the sun counterbalancing in a wonderful way. My only fault with this movie is a sudden change of tone near the end of the movie, something I don't really want to spoil.

B005FMZX9Q|2.0|The watch is just like in the photo, it's nice.<br /><br />The issue is that it hasn't worked for me from the start.<br />The watch stopped from day 1. I thought it was the battery, so I changed it.<br />After 1 minute, the watch stopped again. What was strange was that it only stopped when worn.<br /><br />Fortunately, I found (by pure luck) that if the backhood is not closed tight, the watch won't stop anymore.<br />Although I managed to make the watch run again I don't think it's normal to keep the backhood untight to keep the watch functioning.<br /><br />Also, I have sent an email to Invicta asking for some guidance of approved repair service in my area, and they have not replied. Unprofessional.<br />I will probably never buy an Invicta product again.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 as the watch is nice and it works (currently. Who knows how long?)

B0007XT7V8|5.0|I love Theory of a Deadman.  They remind me a lot of Nickelback.  I love both artists.  My sister is a HUGE fan of both, so I sent her all of the Theory's and she just couldn't be happier.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|This is a fun movie and appropriate for older children through adults.  We enjoyed watching it with our 2 children ages 9 and 11.  The music is fun too.
B005LAIHRC|3.0|I am trying to view this a second time before my rental expires, but am having a hard time. I love cheesy stuff but this is artery-blocking cheese of the highest magnitude. I am having a hard time telling the two blonde chicks apart, and the scene where Tom Cruise is singing to one of the blondes and starts singing into her granny panties, I just doubled over with laughter and had to pause it for quite awhile. Ok one blonde has a perm and abs, and the other has less curly hair and abs.<br />Though I have to say the 1980's classics do bring a smile to my face, even though most of them are wrecked by the stars in this flick.<br />The thing I liked best about this movie, and I don't think it's too spoilery, is the fact they savaged the dancing goofball boy band dudes.<br />The romance between Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin is a bit out of place in this period piece, but it does show the kids gay people existed before the 19990's.<br /><br />Rock of ages? I'd say rent Rock of Ages, don't buy.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I purchased the purple marware cover for my kindle fire hd 7\\" because it was the cheapest in the store $24.99... everything else was like $50, that was ridiculous to me. Anyway when i put the case on for the first few days I got annoyed because it didnt go into sleep mode when i closed the cover but then i flipped the kindle around and it worked. I was super excited but now the camera is on the bottom... which is strange but in general its affordable, works well, and it's a sturdy cover. Im happy with it. :)
B008G12ERC|5.0|I have been listening to this album on and off for the past four days but this morning I wasn't getting sleep so I went for a walk. I plugged in my iPod and let the album play because I intended to give it one faithful listen. I got home and I started missing my day outside and the stroll and I thought if anything in my day could better that outing with MUSE. To begin and to gain, I must say this is one of the most WELL DESCRIBED, POWERFUL, MAGNETIC \\"hard rock\\" albums I have heard in a while. My neck is telling me it had long forgotten how to head bang. Oh thank you. It seems Indie-Rock had ruled my playlist for so long that I thought Rock was dead but this album, how can I describe it is a stunning effort. Which is my favourite track? Maybe Supremacy. It has some amazing drums but have you ever heard Animals carefully? It's so raw. One would imagine the band is doing their first record which brings me to BIG FREEZE where the earth seems to stop spinning because the vocalist sings like a GOD, I said GOD. \\"Have you found a way to escape? Are you here just because I need you? Can we hole up, a big FREEEEEZE is coming our way.\\" Smack! The music is so-so-so inspiring. Is this going to be the only album that is going to play on my ipod at gym from now on? it should be.<br /><br />Readers will have noticed how Hoobastank have tried all their lives to search for a sound they could associate with and produce but never quite found that sound so did various spins? Imagine for a second that they were to find that might and they all became better at playing their instruments and the vocalist achieved an above-excellent vocal range , that would make them the MUSE on this record.<br /><br />\\"Big Freeze\\" is beautiful rock the sound of which even the wonderful fantastic slobberjocky Tenacious D cannot produce. It is humbling to say the least.<br /><br />After the Wild Beasts like beautiful sound of \\"Animals\\"  and the heart of lion sound of \\"Big Freeze\\" , \\"Explorers\\" is angelic. FNM would be proud.<br /><br />\\"Liquid State\\" is forgettable.  \\"Prelude Survival\\" is another stand out track that reminds me of the best of DREAM THEATER and there is something IRON MAIDEN'ish about it in it's cathedral rock sound.  Get ready to headbang.<br /><br />\\"Save Me\\" is another stand out track which looks like it doesn't even sit on this record. So emphatically illuminating with a beautiful falsetto. The sound is guaranteed to be used in a film in the future, one of those wonderful standouts.<br /><br />\\"Isolated System\\"  has a beautiful piano driven melody.<br /><br />I need to listen to this album some ten times more to be able to understand it, grasp it but having heard what I have, you can tell I am obviously inspired. The 2nd Law has \\"Dub Step\\" (Unsustainable) , \\"Hard Rock\\" (Supremacy) , \\"Piano-esque bliss\\" (Save Me, Isolated System) , \\"Progressive Rock\\" (Big Freeze, Explorers, Isolated System, Big Freeze)<br /><br />This is my contender #1 for album of the year. I love Indie but I'm so glad The Muse kicked it into orbit for a bit. I promise to buy the cd.<br /><br />PS  - This is my first Muse album. It will take me a month to digest because it demands repeated listening because of how many genres and bases it covers. Please comment to let me know more about MUSE and what albums I should perhaps visit next.would be proud.<br /><br />\\"Liquid State\\" is forgettable.  \\"Prelude Survival\\" is another stand out track that reminds me of the best of DREAM THEATER and there is something IRON MAIDEN'ish about it in it's cathedral rock sound.

B004LWZWBU|3.0|When I heard about this movie I said,\\" got to see it! With Steve Martin and Owen Wilson it has to be good.\\" So I sat down to watch it expecting to laugh a lot. I kept waiting for the funny but by the end it was just ho hum. Oh well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best ever! i cried and laughed and was scared! u all need to read it! so so sad.  bye!
B00000J7J4|5.0|I too have been a Santana fan for decades, and find this CD to be outstanding. Carlos focused... Santana light... whatever, it is music with sytyle and flare and is great to listen too. Get it and enjoy.
B00973DDN2|2.0|Hot Fuss was something new and refreshing...Sam's Town was a solid concept grounded the band's matured sound... Day & Age was odd and unique...Battle Born sounds largely like the same song reimagined slightly - but always spun through the same early 80's ballad washing machine. The Killers have the ability to redefine pop music and to do so with stirring lyrics and engaging sonic ingenuity...but they release this album of half-hearted, pretentious rough drafts. I'm dissapointed. I give two stars for the random rockabilly track - I wanted to give one star otherwise. I don't believe this is an album that will find life in my rotation.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Came in a nice dvd case? I'm not really sure what to say but it's a good movie with good action
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I was really disappointed in this trilogy. It was not at all what I thought it would be. I found it very depressing.
0525952926|4.0|Winter of the World is the second book of his trilogy.  I love Follett but it does not compare to his earlier works with non stop action and intrigue.  He mixes in alot of sexual/romantic scenes to appeal to the average reader.  The history of this period is so fascinating that I thought he was just getting lazy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the immediate attention-grabbing beginning and the format with alternating points of view and the chapter titles.  The writing style was intelligent and appealing to me, personally.  The ending was a bit disappointing, but probably the most realistic way to conclude what had happened to these two in their emotional tug-of-war.  I may choose it as my next Book Club selection!
B005HSL626|5.0|this Is a great stunning game great graphics very addicting and very fun it is fun for every age overall great game I rate this a 1-10 if there was a 10 great game
B002VVHLOY|5.0|A really great episode with plenty of nostalgic themes running throughout. Even a not so subtle nod to Jensen's days on a soap opera. More laughs than any Supernatural episode I've seen to date (and I've seen 'em all.)<br /><br />2 very enthusiastic thumbs up.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game always has been a great game game to me who ever created this game great mind nice work.
B001CDF05O|5.0|This 2-disc live album was recorded December 4th at the Budokan in Tokyo Japan in 2001. It was released by Immortal seven years later along with a DVD which I haven't seen so I can't comment on it. The recording quality on the CDs is excelent! The only thing that might bother some of you is that the sound is in mono instead of stereo. That didn't bother me at all, infact it gave a kind of warmth to the sound that made me feel like I was there at the Budokan watching the concert. The setlist is pretty similar to the officially released \\"One More Car, One More Rider:Live On Tour 2001\\", but the addition of the slow version of \\"Layla\\", and the removal of Billy Preston's \\"Will It Go Round In Circles\\" and \\"My Father's Eyes\\" were reasons enough for me to pick this CD up. The band line-up is different as well. Billy Preston didn't play with Clapton on the Japanese leg of this tour, and was replaced with keyboardist Greg Fillenganes who's playing is very different from Billy Preston's. In my never to be humbled opinion this show should've been officially released by Reprise Records as the audio portian of \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\" while the Los Angeles show should've been only on the DVD. I didn't care for the way they editted the officially released CD with most of it being the L.A show, and only three songs from this Tokyo show. So if you already have both the \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\" CD and DVD and you think you don't need this CD for your Clapton collection I urge you to think again! Take it from an avid Clapton concert collector that each EC show is a unique listening experience, and even having multiple shows from the same tour won't get repetitive or redundant. So pick this CD up, crank it up, and enjoy! Thanks for reading. I hope this was somewhat helpful. PEACE!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Awessome, exciting this is my new favorite movie. That's my true opinion I just wish the picture was better it gets blurry, for a movie like this the picture has to be great.
1848378963|4.0|My appreciation for 19th century British literature is usually based on the beauty of the language.  Not that many of those novels are not capitavating and intriguing, but the overwhelming attraction for me has been the sentence structure, vocabulary and method of expression.  In the \\"Woman in White\\" I found a book in which the mystery component outweighs even the excellence of the writing.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story that is well written.
B006GLZTHQ|2.0|Why do they want 13.99 for a short not very good season? There were lots of reviews saying the very same thing, but now they are all gone. I guess this will get deleted too. I have 2,3 & 4

B0040HJNKC|5.0|I've seen Buddy Guy live a few times and I have a couple of his albums, but previously my feeling was that the studio albums never quite matched his live performance.  And while I love his guitar playing, I didn't always like his voice.  But this album, Living Proof, really is just that.  This is the best album he's done in years -- maybe the best of his career.  And if you're not really a Buddy Guy expert and just want a great blues album, this is one of the best across all blues artists.<br /><br />As other reviews have said, Buddy is looking back on his 74 years in several songs and he has a helluva story to tell.  He tells it with passion, insight and warmth.  Songs like \\"74 Years Young\\", \\"Stay Around A Little Longer\\", \\"Thank Me Someday\\" are fantastic musically and lyrically.  On a blues album, usually I'm happy to just get to the solos, but I found the singing and words superb.  Buddy's voice has mellowed out and maybe it's the stories he tells or the way it all ties in with the music, but it's really a great combination.  And when you add guest visits by BB King,<br /><br />There's also some classic Blues like \\"Where the Blues Begins\\" and the instrumental \\"Skanky\\".  That is one awesome pure guitar blues song.  And when you also consider there are guest appearances on the album by BB King and Carlos Santana, this is truly an awesome album.  Don't hesitate to buy this for any lover of the blues.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn novel.  I am looking forward to reading her other books.  This was a very fast read--I am a slow reader and finished it in about 10 days.  I expect others to read it in about 3 days.
B008N1V11U|5.0|gameloft is notorious for charging for ingame items. i stay away from their games. hoewever i do have oregon trail
B003ODHOA4|4.0|First two disclaimers, so that you can put my review into perspective:  First, I have not read this book cover to cover yet;  only the first couple chapters, so far.  Second, my knowledge of \\"normal\\" and \\"polite\\" Chinese is fairly fluent, but not exceptional.  I speak Mandarin routinely and generally effortlessly at home, and my vocabulary is fair-sized, but not really large.<br /><br />Given that background, my guess is that this book is about 70% an authoritative accounting of Chinese slang, and maybe 30% Westerners' impression of said slang.  So, I think it's probably fairly successful in its stated goal, but some of it, I suspect, is just hyped up to give that impression.<br /><br />Some of the slanginess seems to me to be more in the English sentences used as examples than in the actual Chinese sentences/phrases they translated them to.  That is, some of the English sentences are poised in 'street talk,\\" when the translation to Chinese is pretty straight-forward and matter-of-fact (and accurate).  So, if you were to use some of the translations presented here, you might think you're sounding like a gangster, when in fact you're really just sounding like an \\"average Joe\\" (or should I say an \\"average Zhou\\"!).<br /><br />But all in all, it probably is largely what it's claimed to be, and an entertaining read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app, definitely keeps me entertained whenever I'm connected to wifi. Wish it didn't automatically copy original poster's caption when I repinned.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|the game is just. awesome I cant stop playing it the fact that it has multiplayer makes it even better
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Dark, gritty, tense; everything a good book should be. Up there with 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' IMHO. I liked 'Sharp Objects' better than 'Gone Girl' and 'Dark Places', although those were very good too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am really enjoying this book Mark does a great job of capturing my interest completely. As a very proud and thankful American I really appreciate reading about the inside of military life and operations. Nothing in life is perfect but the life our military leads to protect us is pretty incredible it isn't easy on them or their families but I thank God for their sacrifice. Two thumbs up Four Stars!!!!!!!
0316228532|4.0|There are parts of this book that are fascinating and parts that don't really pay off. Krystal Weedon and her family are a pretty strong plot line, and I think it would have been a much better book if JKR had tightened it up to just her story and reduced the story arc of other characters to more of a supporting role, and how they relate to the Weedon family. Or maybe more of Sukhvinder too, her plot and ending felt very much like that of a character like Neville Longbottom, just most entrenched in the Muggle world, obviously. But there were so many storylines that just felt like, \\"well, this stuff happens in the real world.\\" Yes, it does, and the descriptions are probably quite accurate. But that doesn't make them particularly rewarding to read, outside the occasional recognitions of some emotional truths. The arcs aren't that satisfying, and they don't particularly reward the effort of keeping up with them.<br /><br />Still, I admire Jo Rowling for trying something so different. It's a fascinating thing to read if only to see that an author who outsold the Bible and became a billionaire off writing doesn't necessarily strike gold every time. If you're really interested in the themes of Harry Potter -- death and the power of love and kindness, recognizing common humanity while not being blind to the ugly things people can do to one another -- then it's interesting to read some of these same principles finding expression in a very different setting and cast of characters. But if you are expecting likable characters or a magically atmospheric world, you will probably be disappointed.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Warning -- the Days are not nice people, either before or after the massacre. This is not much of a spoiler because Libby warns you at the beginning. If you want a story about nice, sympathetic, likable characters, you should probably pick up something else.<br />  The Days are that one family that everyone knows about -- dirt poor, but too proud to accept help. Their desperation leads them to make bad decisions, making it easy (and understandable) to blame them for their own misfortune. Their neediness makes them latch onto the wrong people, creating dysfunctional relationships where they are both predator and victim. They lie, cheat, and steal. They are prone to violence and neglect. These character traits make Dark Places a difficult novel to read. The more I read, the better I understood Libby and the rest of her family, but I never got to the point where I would have wanted to hang out with them and be their friend. At the same time, the characters really stuck with me and I find myself thinking about them and re-evaluating the book. In fact, I originally gave it only 4 stars, but after reflection, realized it was better than that.<br />  The story unfolds in two directions -- Libby's \\"now\\" sections are her attempts to remember and piece together what happened on that fateful night; the other members of her family alternate chapters revealing what actually happened. I didn't find the format confusing and I don't think the story could have been told any other way. The impact of the novel comes not from figuring out WHAT happened, but the motivations that led each character to this particular place in the road. I had actually read a couple of \\"spoiler\\" comments (to see if it would be worthwhile to read) and STILL did not really know what happened until I finished the book, so the suspense and plot twists are excellently done.<br />  Flynn's books are not for everyone. Her characters are not very sympathetic, and their actions are often violent and even cruel. Butstorywise, she is an original. I loved Gone Girl, loved Dark Places, so now I am downloading Sharp Objects. Flynn will make you question your assumptions about people and life -- and sometimes that's a very good thing.

0815411839|4.0|I always like to look at the  one and two star reviews for books. Sometimes I think they must be written by competing authors. Anyways, this book isn't a challenge to read. In fact, it's a compelling, well-thought out, definative bio. I think that Spoto gives a lot more realistic arguements for  Marilyn's demise that than the conspiritist group. I've read the the conspritist books and by themselves, living on an island without the internet,  they're more than a little convincing. However, after having read Spoto's one can pretty well get the idea that an accident happened. It didn't have to - but it did. More than likely this was the answer. ( see Occam's razor)
0425263908|5.0|It took me forever to get an ARC of this one to read and even longer for me to read it. I was really hesitant to read it because I've never read the author before and all the hype kind of made me really nervous to read it in case I didn't like it. Luckily for me I had nothing to worry about because I LOVED this book.<br /><br />I know this book was published in the wake of the series Fifty Shades of Grey (Which I also read and enjoyed a lot) but this one in my opinion was a better read. I mean there are a lot of similarities between Bared to You and Fifty Shades but there are a lot of differences as well.<br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out why I enjoyed this book so much since Gideon is not the kind of man I would ever want to be involved in and I frequently found myself wanting to stab him through my kindle for how he was treating Eva in the novel. I honestly don't really care for him that much but I do enjoy the chemistry between them.<br /><br />I found the story to be intriguing and entirely all consuming I think I read the entire book in just a couple hours spread over two days. I was completely and utterly addicted to the intensity Eva and Gideon had for each other.<br /><br />I think what I enjoyed most about them as a couple was how flawed they are. Both suffer from their own personal demons. Eva was dealing with her own past and was trying to learn more about Gideon but he kept wanting to keep himself blocked off from her as he'd never really had a vanilla relationship like the one he wanted with Eva and kept pulling away. It was getting to the point that I was hoping that Eva would drop him like a hot potato and wash her hands of him for good but in the end I'm glad that she didn't.<br /><br />This book is absolutely not for everyone and that's okay some people are going to like it and some aren't but I think that if you're looking for a book that's in my opinion much more emotionally intense read than Fifty Shade with a lot more spice (even though it's lacking the BDSM qualities of Fifty Shades) this might just be the read for you. Sylvia Day created one of the hottest couples on the book market today and this really shows her talent in creating characters that while they aren't perfect do seem to go together quite well. I know I was impressed with this book and when I read it I couldn't wait to read to find out what happened next between this pair. I highly recommend this title as well as this author who after only two books has gotten a fan for life.<br /><br />* I received a free copy of this book from the published via NetGalley in exchange for my free and honest review.

B000002ITW|3.0|At this time (October 11, 2012), there are 80 - 4 and 5 star reviews. There are 15 or so 3 stars or below ratings.<br /><br />This album has several high points. This album has a number of WTF moments (there are moments in this album that make me cringe). Overall, I think one cd would have made for a stronger album.<br /><br />I am a fan of the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, the Hollies and C.S.N.&Y., but 5 stars is unjustified.<br /><br />3 stars is more than fair.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I found this a very easy & fairly interesting read. Great characters, and leaves you wanting to read more. Could have been larger and more varied in volume size.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|I can't tell if this movie was poorly written or hacked to death during a Hollywood schedule crunch, but the end result is that the story line is botched and the characters completely unbelievable. There were so many times during the movie when I found myself shaking my head because of some ridiculous premise or character reaction. It's a shame, because I found a few of the ideas and graphics to be bordering on stunning. I hate long-winded reviews and the trite vocabulary lessons that accompany them, so I'll just close by saying that I was very disappointed with this film.
B00008ENTJ|5.0|Everything is great w the record. Quite happy with the price and turned up in good time. The cover looks great w no damage.<br /><br />Thank you
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Fun but the plots a bit old. Ok for a while, but got tiring. I liked the Disney version better.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|By far and wide the most graphic/violent animated Batman film.  Great story, decent animation and will definitely be a part of my collection.  Really wish they'd stick with using Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman/Bruce Wayne for all of the Batman Animated films.  That's the only thing that annoyed me about this otherwise awesome animated story.<br /><br />This cartoon is NOT FOR CHILDREN! I repeat, this cartoon is NOT FOR CHILDREN!!  Sometimes I think the animators/producers forget that not ALL parents are hip/wise to the fact that many superhero stories are NOT appropriate for children.  Someone may naively purchase this Batman animation simply because it's about Batman without knowing or bothering to know what it entails.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|What's not to love about this show. It has a great story line in each and every charater and shows you that even though they aren't blood, they are a family and stick together and that is something most families are lacking. I love these guys and would love to be an \\"Old Lady\\".
B008Y5OW20|5.0|This album is everything that McCartney's Kisses On The Bottom isn't, that is, tuneful & engaging & a very suitable take on some old classics.  Nice balance of polished arrangements & performances without being too sterile or lifeless.  An excellent addition to a magnificent catalogue, I don't think too many people would be disappointed with this.  Re the short running time: apparently the Japanese version contains an extra track which is a version of an old Del Shannon number.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This movie is great to me becaused I loved the original movies  its made with all the story lines from Ripley (Weaver) movies but A WASTE OF MONEY TO BUY IN 3D, the 3d effect is so light you only have the depth thats 3d gives, I WANT MORE IN YOUR FACE OR OUT OF THE TV---DONT MISLEAD THE PEOPLE BY SAYING 3D JUST TO GET MORE MONEY, THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE STOP BUYING 3D MOVIES ALTOGETHER LIKE BLU-RAY PLAYERS(DON'T DO HALF THE THINGS THAT IS SAID IN COMMERICALS), AND THAT WOULD BE A SHAME.

B009A3NGF4|4.0|This album is wonderful, if less upbeat than \\"Sigh No More.\\" The music is hauntingly lovely and the lyrics are well-written. I left off a star because it seems to be less full of a sound than their debut album.
0547564651|5.0|I have not read the entire book yet; it contains so much thought-provoking information that I am taking notes and working my way through all the research-based information it contains. As a teacher for many years, I have come to believe that I can have a positive difference in how they learn and succeed, but there is so much more that influences what they accomplish. This book is packed with valuable information! I would recommend as a book to read for everyone who works with children and everyone who raises a child.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I've been waiting for Bruce to give me something as great as his mostly ignored second album, \\"The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle.\\"  \\"Born to Run\\" is deservedly prestigious, with inspiring power pieces like \\"Jungleland.\\"  Though this album established Bruce's rock 'n' roll format for the future, for me it was a step down from the incredible genius creativity, the sophistication, the fusion of genres of rock, soul & jazz captured with \\"The Wild & Innocent.\\"<br /><br />With the Grammy nomination for \\"The Rising\\" and the immensity of the 9/11 American experience as its format, I anticipated that the musical splendor of that second album might again be achieved: \\"The Rising\\" is a very good work, but, alas, falls short in comparison.<br /><br />\\"Wrecking Ball\\" was highly touted by Jimmy Fallon when Bruce appeared on his show.  Jimmy knows good music.  I am slowly coming to agree with him as this album continues to grow on me.  It most certainly speaks to our current hard times of financial recession, unemployment, and the privileged aristocrat thieves who viciously continue to rape and plunder the world economy.  The simplicity of the lyrics, with their bluntness, strong metaphorical imagery and subtle calls of hope and deliverence, work dynamically with the stark melodies to give us all reason to have heart and persevere for that better day.  The album is so good that the fascinating \\"Swallowed Up\\" is presented as a bonus track on the \\"Special Edition.\\"<br /><br />But, for pure musical brilliance, \\"The Wild and Innocent\\" still stands alone.  And probably always will.  True classics never die.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|great read, he builds, develops and creates awesome characters. love the period of time he has chosen when we are experiencing a tumultuous time now. has really peaked my interest in the upcoming elections.
B0073COMKW|1.0|The unit I purchased emits an audible noise - not useable in a table lamp or similar application where people would be near by.  Very annoying.<br /><br />Also, the unit has a \\"CE\\" product safety certification, which is applicable in the European Union.  The unit I got does not have a UL label or marking, which is the product safety agency listing applicable in the US.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I just watched this movie and I can say that for once I think most user reviews got it right. While the movie was visually appealing (it looked pretty amazing in point of fact) the story seemed rushed. Almost as if it could have benefited from an extra 30 minutes of scenes added in (I can only assume the typical Hollywood Dougs didn't think people would wanna watch a 3 plus hour long movie) to stretch out the story better and make things seem less like happenstance. I thought the premise and concept were great, I thought the effects and design were great, I just think the execution was not great. It seemed like something was missing, and even though I found the movie enjoyable and a good modern horror sci-fi film much in the vein of Alien, I think this movie could have used an extended cut to draw out sequences and segue one scene to the next more smoothly as I felt some of the transitions were choppy. I could even see this being better as a 6 episode miniseries as the concept was to big for the length of the film. On Blu-Ray, Twentieth Century Fox puts out another immaculate transfer of a movie, it pops onscreen and is one of the best and most detailed releases I've seen to date. And with a 3 and a half hour making of, the special features are great. Well worth the $25 bucks. Aside from the pacing problems, I wish the design was a bit more plain and a bit more 1970's like Alien. Although I really like the design in this movie, in Alien the computer screens were green and simple (because that's what computers looked like in 1979 and movie magic couldn't really enhance that like it can today since the advent of CGI) and costumes weren't as sleek as this movie which makes some distance between them, continuity wise. If you like sci-fi or Alien, then you'll probably like this movie just fine!
B008I34XUY|5.0|Looking to round out your eclectic collection? Want one of the most underrated guitarists? Fun lyrics? This is a must.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book is both heartbreaking and wonderful at the same time. I found myself thinking about it at work, in the shower, basically whenever I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. I think the mark of a good book is when it makes you see a well known topic from a different perspective. It really takes the tragedy of school shootings and teaches you to see things from all perspectives. In my mind, a must read!
B0038M61JQ|5.0|As my guitar teacher said, buy this album and play it when you think you are good. This is a masterpiece.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|My daughters absolutely love these sticker books.<br /><br />However, this mother is not impressed by the random dresses and 'reusable' furniture stickers around my house.  While I wouldn't necessarily slap the \\"educational\\" label on this, it's better than sitting in front of the TV, right?<br /><br />I would advise on getting a folder or some sort of holding station for the random pieces that come with it.  Maybe like a fabric pencil case?  For now, we just shove them back in the book but that's not a long term solution at all.
B000002KK2|5.0|Rickie Lee Jones album is still relevant after all these years. Her style should be studied by present female vocalists looking to do a lot with less.

B000002OX7|5.0|This is my top 5 of all time albums, no questions. Wearing headphones is one super way to really get everything here. The only problem with the album is it is too short.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This puzzle game is very relaxing. The movement is graceful and flowing, while the music is calming. At the same time, the puzzles are challenging enough to keep you interested.

B0018QQQK8|4.0|Sparks' \\"Lucky One\\" is the first of his books I've read.  It was actually pretty good, with some typical Sparks tearjurking.  But a happy ending non the less.  Love story of a Marine looking for the woman in the good luck photo - Elizabeth.  Then there's her story and her spoiled childish ex-husband Keith.<br /><br />Logan Thibault is just out of the U.S. Marine Corp.  He WALKS with his trusty dog Zues in search of the girl in a photo.  He WALKS from Colorado to Hampton, North Carolina.  A WALK of 1481.45 miles.  Now this would be probable if he hitched rides also, but there's no mention of this.  Other than this he and his dog are great.  They're both heroes and loveable guys.<br /><br />Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Green is a strong single mother taking care of not just her son, Ben, and her Nana, but also training dogs at their home/ business.  The \\"lucky\\" photo belonged to her brother - marine died in Iraq (where Logan found the photo).  So her disbelief and suspicion of Logan's motives is understandable.<br /><br />Keith Clayton is a spoiled childish guy.  He's a deputy,  Dad's the sheriff and grandad's a judge.  Keith uses his families connections in order to get what he wants - his ex-wife Beth.  He also thinks that he is above the law - takes pervy pictures of travelers and gives threats to any guy Beth tries to date.<br /><br />The end was a little confusing.  It was still quite good.  It has closure.  I didn't agree with the drastic way the \\"bad guy\\" Keith was handled.  I really liked the dog being the great hero.  It was still a pretty good story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really fun way to spend some down time.  lots of cute animals and fun task to complete.  so far this app hasn't asked for any extra money.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game its very addicting. Better then angry birds by far. Every aspect of this game is a lot better then any of the angry birds games.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|While I was fascinated how this woman was pulled into a darker side of life, due to low self esteem, people pleasing ways and rebellion, I did have to question her stories while serving her time. How could prisoners who are both embittered by life and the system, be this warm and fuzzy once the hard exteriors are cracked? I've since met someone who worked at this facility, during this time, and raised her eyebrows when I spoke of certain instances in the book. That said, I am curious if she still keeps in touch with these women either through letters, visits, sending commissary money, etc.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game, addicting and cute. Just like the arcade game. I recommend! If only there were unlimited coins......graphics aren't super awesome but it doesn't matter on this type of game
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Once I understood what was happening in the book I clearly felt this was inspired by Jaycee Dugard's story, although told with the twist of being fiction. While the story starts out a bit slow with the same pieces told over and over, stick with the book as when it reveals itself you'll be aghast!! I would love the author to continue with the characters story right where the book ended. Emma, is that possible??
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I loved the game,  the graphics are something else.  Each level shows you some thing new. Very good, not exactly relaxing but enjoyable.
B00023B1A8|5.0|Filmed at San Francisco's Warfield Theater in November, 1991, this concert features the legendary Crosby, Stills & Nash performing acoustic versions of their best loved songs. Among the tunes included on the set list are Our House, Deja Vu, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, Teach Your Children and many more. Over 80 minutes of acoustic bliss.<br /><br />From Woodstock to the present day, Crosby Stills and Nash have always been included among super group stature. The boys were showing their age but the skills were still sharper than ever. The harmonies were so clear and you could see and feel the emotion from the trio after every song. They thoroughly enjoyed the evening and so did I. This was a reunion to remember.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Still's metallic sound and fantastic solos. When he played his electric guitar on a couple songs he captured the audience and their participation was infectious.<br /><br />This was a stimulating experience. I found my attention riveted to the screen, not wanting to miss a note.<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Crosby, Stills & Nash's \\"The Acoustic Concert\\" on You Tube.
0060254920|5.0|Everyone I know has either read this book or has heard great things about it. In my opinion it is one of the best books to let your imagination run free. It describes this whole new place and you can't help but get lost in it too. You want to join Max on this adventure and you want to make your own. It's almost like an elaborate twist on the classic fort made out of pillow and blankets.

0812979702|4.0|The book proves that golf is 90% mental and that the multitude of tips about<br />the mechanics of the game are but confusing.

B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the most impactful movies that I have ever seen. A movie not to be enjoyed, but experienced. Trust me when I say that it's an experience that could very well have life-changing effects for it's viewers. A

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I honestly had no idea my kids would love the Avengers that much (a bit young for them, don't you think?), but the movie is so dynamic and entertaining - it made a great movie night for the whole family.<br />Before going to bed, daddy and daughter spent some quality time reading the novel that came in the combo pack with the Avengers DVD. I am honestly amazed that my daughter knew all the super heroes even before the movie.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you like Downton Abbey, and you don't already have the first release seasons 1 & 2 DVD sets of the series, then you should have this. I waited for this set instead of getting the first releases, but really it's more of a repackaging of the original release with the Christmas episode here as well. So buy this if you love Downton and don't already own it...and hurry because the 3rd season comes out in January!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Lee Child has an amazing ability to turn a short story into a novel.  He expands anecdotes into whole chapters and lards the story with non essential factoids.  I understand that the genre is escapism, page turner and sheer entertainment but a little more character development would be welcome.

1476715904|5.0|Ok guys. I'm excited about this one. Slammed is definitely going to end up in my Best of 2012. When I read the description before requesting this one from NetGalley, I was totally intrigued. Slam poetry sounds pretty awesome. I don't actually know anything about slam poetry, and I'm not a huge poetry person myself. I can definitely respect it, and there are some poems that I love and adore. But as a general rule, my personality is too blunt and direct for poetry on an everyday basis. I love the symbolism and such in poetry and even in literature of all genres, but sometimes I'd just rather not try to figure out what things mean. I'd rather just be told what they mean. And that's just plain lazy of me. BUT, I do love when a character in a book loves poetry, (i.e. Sam from The Wolves of Mercy Falls series by Maggie Stiefvater). And let me tell you, Will did not disappoint.<br /><br />Slammed went a completely different direction than I expected with one major twist happening fairly early on in the book. Even though it happens early, I just can't bring myself to ruin it for you because it was a game changer. For me, the book had an entire feel to it, until it SLAMMED into this plot twist.<br /><br />I could not put this thing down!<br /><br />Usually when I find myself reading about an impossible situation, I get annoyed and frustrated and the characters make decisions that I wouldn't make myself. But even with the impossible situation, and even with the decisions I wouldn't make, I never really got annoyed or frustrated with this one. This book reminds me of how I felt about Pushing the Limits. The characters have all been through so much, and what they've experienced makes them all very real and very human. And even though they've been through a lot already, their journeys aren't over...not by a long shot.<br /><br />I felt the emotion of this book and these characters very strongly. When Lake was performing her first poem for class, my heart was pounding from that nervous feeling you have of being up in front of your class and having everyone looking at you. She had a message she wanted to deliver, so her heart beat harder and faster. And I felt it. I'm not saying her class assignment poem was my favorite one ever, it wasn't even my favorite one in the book, but I just felt that moment so strongly. And that's just a slight example. The whole book was packed with scenes like that when I as the reader got pulled in more than most books even attempt to do.<br /><br />This book...this book is one of the good ones. Slammed is one of the ones you'll remember and you'll refer back to, and you'll want to re-read. Definitely add Slammed to your must read list! 4.9 Stars for me...ok...shoot, let's go ahead and give it 5.<br /><br />Have you read Slammed? What did you think?

1400069289|4.0|It's interesting to read a few of the reviews that weren't particularly complimentary because I felt the book was much better than the average how-to. It may be because I'm not a professional in the psychology field and so I didn't view the book as rudimentary as others may have. I felt that Mr. Duhigg did a good job of covering habit formation in individuals and institutions. I found chapters 1-3, 9, and the appendix portion titled \\"A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas\\" to be the most useful for me as an individual, but as the president of a non-profit board and the member of other boards I found the other chapters thought-provoking and they stimulated ideas about how to guide and focus an organization. I certainly wouldn't say that it is comprehensive, but I found it to be useful.  Overall, I would recommend the book and I plan on buying it. If you're just interested in your own habits and don't have time to tackle the whole book just read the chapters I mentioned and you should get everything you need out of it.
0316227706|5.0|So I ordered this coffee table book because the picture on the cover looks EXACTLY like my dog... except that my dog hates jumping into pools.  LOL<br /><br />This book is well done and the pictures are so cute, I highly recommend this book to everyone who loves animals, especially dogs!!
B008OJ291W|5.0|First, I don't understand the criticism of Jeff for re-recording his own songs in an effort to improve upon the originals. What he has accomplished here is actually quite astounding. I mean, how many other 64 year old musicians could come back 35 or so years later and sing ALL the vocal parts and play ALL of the instrumental parts of their most popular recordings, and not only duplicate those parts precisely, but also sound as good or better than they did 35 or so years earlier? I think it's a phenomenal feat! Secondly, he has done a stellar job. These new versions sound fantastic! He has meticulously recreated every guitar part, every bass part, drum part, keyboard part, and sang the myriad of vocal parts that were typical of an ELO arrangement. The arrangements are virtually identical to the originals, you can just hear the parts more clearly now. And amazingly, his voice sounds every bit as good as it did when he was in his 20's when he originally recorded most of these songs. This album is a testament to a true artist's commitment to his craft and his continual striving for improvement and perfection. We should celebrate this music and any music this uniquely gifted man shares with us.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I don't actually purchase many hard copies (or write reviews) of music with all the pay to download services available nowadays but once in awhile there comes a time when variable bitrate mp3 files just aren't good enough. This was one such case.<br /><br />I'm sure most people who are purchasing this album have heard most if not all of Lindsey's songs on Youtube at one point or another.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, but it most definitely is for me. I know people who are very fanboy about their various niches of music and are completely closed off to what other people enjoy, but I am happy to say that they all seem to enjoy Lindsey's music.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think this book was amazing.  It was very real, and very raw.  It is a great coming of age story for anyone in high school.  I think this should be a required reading for schools across the country.  Shed some light on real situations that kids go through every day, and no one even realizes.
B005ETANC2|5.0|When my dvd came it was nicely packed.  I have another version of this movie and the universal vault version is superior.  If you like this movie or classic horrer fliks, snatch it up.  atma-sphere
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As with all of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books, this one was awesome.  I can never get enough of Jack Reacher.  Keep writing Mr. Child!
0345803507|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations. I was completly amazed at the wonderful events and struggles each character went through. I would recommend this book.
B0099G3I96|4.0|the first run through i was kind of annoyed that it wasn't as dancehall as gwen was saying it would be, but there is a lot of reggae and dance hall vibes in the middle of things, as well as the 80's/synthy/electronic vibe they've always thrown in here and there...  i can say it reminds me a lot of her solo stuff (which i loved), so i didn't mind this albums pop/electronic vibe. it took me a couple of times to really get into it, because majority of the songs seem kind of slow, but i do love it.<br /><br />the one thing i worried about is what were the songs going to be about, and it's kind of irritating (and weird) how much gwen is (seemingly) STILL complaining about her husband. but then again, what would no doubt be if she weren't complaining about her willingly imperfect and dramatic life? duh!<br /><br />i think my favorite tracks are \\"settle down\\", \\"push and shove\\", \\"looking hot\\", \\"sparkle\\" and \\"easy\\".  the one thing that really irks me is how \\"easy\\" starts off all sultry and dark, and then the chorus kind of doesn't fit the rest of the song, but it's still catchy.<br /><br />i guess maybe you just have to be open minded with this one?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read! I was expecting to be turned off by the topic, yet, the writer wrote it in a way that pulled me in and didn't let me down through the entire trilogy! Abso loved it!
0525953728|5.0|Great book. But what I noticed is you could easily see a good bit was written by a journalist co-author. He gets pretty detailed on the sites, smells, etc of inanimate objects while he is also hyperfocusing on mission details and kit. Makes for building a good picture but I would bet that a lot of this added text is just that...added. A guy that is so focused on a mission is not going to write all that detail or even worry about it when a major mission is coming up. Author claims he hyperfocuses, but it seems like he is the best at both worlds...seeing the tree in the forest as well as the forest in the trees, and he seems to be able to do both all the time. Now, I know some will say this is from superb training but the brain just doesn't work that way, so I'm calling BS on some of the added text written in the book. With that said, I loved the book. Can't wait for the movie.
B00000J7JO|1.0|The Loudness War will kill your hi-fi system. This record sounds so awful when pumped in volume it is unlistenable. It's pretty sad it has come to this with music. There are literally no dynamics left on this disc. There is one mastered level of every peak and dip in the waveform meaning zero dynamics and it just gets louder and more obnoxious when you turn the knob. It's really sad people have to listen to this and even more sad record companies think these albums are good for anything but coasters. Even on your ipod this one sounds like complete and utter ****.<br /><br />Some really good tunes by the Peppers but just try pumping this on your 5k system and you will be in tears at how awful it sounds. Sadly all of their albums here on out sound pretty much the same.

B001ECQ75A|3.0|I must admit, I am a kung fu fan and grew up watching them in Chinese (eyes skipping to English bu if they had subtitles).  But being that this is animation certain expectations must be lowered.<br /><br />Great animation, good story line in Kung Fu Panda.  I was pleasantly surprised what a fun movie this was.  We always expect the kung fu here to be a lithe, fast and furious character.  Not so here.  I think that's what made this so entertaining is that the hero is a chubby panda.<br /><br />I can't say that I loved the casting.  I'm not so crazy about Jack Black's voice which seems a bit passionless and more so in Kung Fu Panda 2.  That is too bad since he is the main character. But James Hong stole the show with his range of emotion and infectious energy.<br /><br />I liked the story but too bad that most kids movies are so predictable and this falls into that category.  I don't want to ruin the plot for you but I think they could have done the feel good ending a little better.  I really like the way that Brad Bird writes his animated movies.  There is always a great twist.  Not so here which is why I can't give it 5 stars but my expectations for anything kung fu (even animated) are pretty high.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is loeded with tons of truths and insights.  I particularly liked the part that references Obama's \\"speech\\" to the Seals.  It is interesting how even in times like this things have a way of becoming policital fodder. The writer qualified the President's speech as \\"straight from the speech writer's playbook\\".  Very Interesting!  Well worth the time to read.
B001R6AW18|5.0|having previously purchased the kong/son of kong/MJY box set a few years back, I was pleased to find the print clean and sparkling, nearly flawless. I won't bore with technical details that have been regurgitated, but this digi-book BR version is a gem worth owning in anyone's blu-ray collection; BUT, my only complaint is the absence of Son of Kong as an extra feature included in the set; would it have killed the studio to have done a restoration and BR version to include? no doubt, down the road, there may very well be a SOK special edition in BR, just to soak videophiles for some extra $.<br />oh well, that's Hollywood.
B001IF252M|1.0|I bought this from only genuine-fulfillment by amazon and It is another cheap one. I works poorly. I have it set up to a Sony tv and occasionally switch to use with an external monitore. The only way i can get any signal on both is if the cable doesn't move at all. Any slight movement will cause the screen to go black. The reason is that i can't connect the blue vga cable completely. it just sits there without being screwed in. The things you tighten don't reach far enough to the threads and keeps slipping out.

B009IKPOUO|5.0|While Barbra's range while acting out a song has gotten even greater over the years, her vocal range and sheer power and reed-like quality isn't what it used to be.  I vowed to never to buy music of hers again after the last effort and especially the Grammys tribute performance--that was just painful.  But this takes me back to the Barbra before I was even born, and helps me relive the sounds she made when I first listened to her music on the Guilty Album.  Spanning the decades is a real treat for anyone, especially those who have just discovered her.  I don't know if I like the \\"One More Look at You\\" track or not, so I am giving the benefit of the doubt and keeping the 5-star rating.  The opening reminds me of music from a Partridge Family episode or something.  I did like the PF, so that is why I am undecided.  Easily worth the download.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book helps you understand how you can  declutter your home and your life.  It makes the process less overwhelming and easier to understand and undertake.  Worth reading, take away what works for you.  Yes, it can be fun.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I have been really disappointed with the last few Depp/Burton movies. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory being almost unwatchable and all. But Dark Shadows was both amusing and interesting. All in all it was a nice little movie. The over the top special effects fit in well with the mood of the movie. I would recommend it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have been a fan of the show from the first episode... I found this seasons shows to be no different...
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It still is so amazing to see these superhero characters in a live action movie...<br />Keep it coming Marvel !!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|My spouse started playing this game on the computer and after giving it a try, I got hooked on the game. I like replaying the deal if I don't win the first time.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Really  liked the movie......British....so it's NOT as streamlined as an American movie !  If I remember right.....NO profanity.  Downhearted & basic....very enjoyable.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Since the first time I saw this movie I cried so bad. One of my favorites romance movies. You have to watch it.
B007I5QNRE|4.0|Great to see Kindle going high tech to include the Audio material which is part of the book. The content is very good...with illustrations all over to support. My only issue so far is that it is better for an advanced student rather than an absolute beginner.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|The family loves this film and truly, I agree. This is a first rate family film that hits the right notes and is \\"So fluffy I(we) can't stand it\\" Good price here too - altogether worth the time to watch and everyone is happy by the end!!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Johnny Depp was worth the rental.  Found his role amusing but not enough \\"camp\\" to save this movie.  Watch the original to enjoy the drama and humor.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford did it again! If you liked the first album, no doubt you will love this one. A mix of some more upbeat songs along with some great slow songs too. Classic Mumford instrumentals throughout. Hopeless Wanderer...beautiful. I listen to this all day long at work.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|For anyone familiar with military sci-fi, this book won't be terribly new or innovative, but it will be vastly entertaining. I'm not going to include any spoilers in this review; there are plenty of reviews out there that can do that for you. However, I will say that if you've ever been through Basic Training, you'll probably laugh outright at the training scenes, and Scalzi has done a good job of creating a unique and compelling world. His characters are strong and vibrant and make me want to know more about them and their world. The book itself is an extremely easy read, but it's engaging for all that. The perfect lunch break or after work mental vacation, and I highly recommend it (it's better than the squeals, too, but they're not bad either; it's just better). Only reason it's not a five-star rating is because it takes a whole lot to get me to a \\"perfect\\" rating.
B00973CGXK|5.0|I was anticipating this album since hearing of its release date.I'm a huge killers fan!!Saw them in concert and have all their albums.I'm also a fan of 80's new wave which is this albums strong point.It sounds like a modern 80's album.I'll definitly have to see them in concert again playing the rising tide.
B000LC51TM|5.0|This CD with DVD pack is awesome. The concert footage is the best I have seen ending with Stripped, one of their harder to find tracks. Then you have the CD to listen to it in your car. My favorite Rammstein purchase.
0891419063|5.0|The book is well written and factual. The terror of war the frustration of combat are all here. You won't be disappointed with this one.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|First movie I've had streamed via Amazon. Excellent color and clarity. Great graphics. I had doubts about the movie itself--wasn't sure if the audience was for \\"kiddies,\\" teens or adults. This movie held my interest throughout. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Beautiful album with some great, poetic lyrics. The title song \\"Babel\\", \\"I Will Wait\\" and \\"The Boxer\\" are my favorite tracks. Overall, there are less memorable tracks in comparison to Sigh No More (IMO), but Babel just further solidifies Mumford & Son's sound and style.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Always a very high quality show.  There's never a let down from episode to episode and season to season.  The writing and the acting is A plus!
0307744434|5.0|What a beautifully written story. I just can't get enough. I have read it twice and it was even better the second time. Thank you, Erin!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|something you might not know is that this app has a widget! I have go launcher and I use this Apo all the time to see how much time I have left. Very accurate!
B0053TMP24|4.0|I love this new sieries! Every time a new book comes out I just have to have it!Glad percy is back! rick riordan continues to get even better at writing!
B005HSL626|4.0|It's fun and easy to play.  I haven't got the chance to plan it to often.  So far I like it.  My score is not to good for now but as I play it, I'm sure it will improve.
1451648537|5.0|I really enjoy this book. It is written in such a way that captivates instead of bores (unlike many biographies I've read). The story told is honest, brutal, and telling. Steve Jobs, a technology god, is revealed on all sides. He bent the impossible to create the possible. And while he pushed through many obstacles he didn't seem to make the same effort in his social life. This is the part I enjoy most - the willingness to admit his tendencies to not consider others above himself (and there were many). It is a great insight into his life, his creations, and his business models.
0316228532|2.0|I have not read Harry Potter - So was looking forward to a book by the Author that appeared to be something I could get into and I loved the concept of the story- I have it on Audio book 13 hrs over three parts  - the first few chapters where great I had great hopes - JK can really write but I had to give up reading it 3 parts thru and I have never done that before  - It got so unendingly squalid and hatefull mean and dirty that the thought of another few hrs of that would likely do me in - It's like all the nasty stuff of a hundred peoples life has been set loose - I am not a \\"Pollyanna\\" reader but this was just too much- Maybe if it wasn't sooo long 13hrs of desperation is 7 hours too long.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The whole series was 5 stars+++++  It was easy to read..... kept you wanting to read more.  I did not want to put it down.  Good read.
0783232039|2.0|Coming back with the reviews of The Childs Play franchise. You have the 1st movie a classic nothing wrong with it you have likeable characters, fast pace an idea of a killer doll that works. The 2nd movie was just a solid sequel Alex Vincent was good again you had a likeable teenage character the 3rd movie was a good sequel & I'll never understand the hate it gets I liked Justin Whalin as Andy I liked The Military School setting it also wrapped everything up there was no opening left for a sequel. I know Don Mancini said part 3 is his least favorite but dude you went on to direct Seed Of Chucky have you drew any money outside of The Childs Play franchise. It makes me think what did he do for money in between 1991 to 1998. Anyway Don Mancicni thought going in a more goofy direction would be a great idea. Made on a budget of $25 million made $50 million directed by Ronny Yu he'd go on to direct Freddy vs Jason I'd rather watch Freddy vs Jason than this movie. Stars Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky, Jenifer Tilly as Tiffany Catherine Higel as Jade, Nick Stable as Jesse, John Ritter as Warren Kincaid, Alexis Arqutte as Damien & Gordon Michael Woovett as David. The story is you this lady named Tiffany who bribes a cop to get the doll remains from The Police Evidence Locker. I really don't know what killed the cop. Tiffany takes the doll home & puts it back together I'm sorry I don't like the Leather Face look for Chucky. Then you are introduced to Damien some kind of hency for Tiffany I guess. Then you are introduced to our leads Jesse & Jade Jade's Uncle who is The Cheif Of Police has his men follow her cause he's strict on who his Niece dates. You know wht this feels like Scream. Childs Play doesn't need to borrow any tricks from Scream.  You have Tiffany try to perform voodoo to bring Chucky back & she's reading Voodoo For Dummies which I guess is trying to be funny & it wasn't funny to me the humor in this movie & the next movie isn't funny at all. So you have Tiffany hancuff Damien to the bed Chucky comes back to life takes a pillow sits on it suffocates Damien we find out that Chucky when he was human was Tiffany's Boyfriend. Tiffany wants to get married Chucky basically refuses Tiffany gets mad throws Chucky in a Play Pen. She buys a girl doll & throws it in The Play Pen Chucky breaks out kills Tiffany in the bath tub Tiffany is brought back as a doll. Then Chucky figures out oh we need to get this Amulet I was buried with in New Jersy. The 1st Childs Play took place in Chicago & this BS about a Amulet I thought the only way to transfer your soul was to the person you 1st told who you really are. Tiffany know Jesse so she has him take 2 dolls to NJ & Jesse takes Jade with her. Warren Jade's Uncle breaks int the van where Chucky & Tiffany set a trap that fire nails at his face why have John Ritter in this movie for him to be killed & make a referance to Pinhead. That's another thing being self aware like Scream. You have this cop pull them over he finds pot in the van & Jesse tells Jade to go get some food. That cop is calling in what he found Chucky takes some sheet paper lights it up puts it in the cops gas tank this was the only good part of the movie. Jesse & Jade get the cops death pinned on them. They find out from their friend David that The Police are locking the border & that Jade's Uncle Warren has gone missing. You have Chucky & Tiffany talking like a real couple which was stupid but I liked where Chucky was going through the radio stations & complains about the current music scene. You have Warren still alive he pops up Chucky finsihes the job. Then you are introduced to this con artist couple who steals Jesse's money. Then you have Tiffany throw a bottle of champange at the glass ceiling where shardes of glass kill  the con artist couple. Jesse & Jade both call David. Chucky proposes to Tiffany they do it & this scene is the only 1 I laughed at. You have David come into the picture they play who done it like Scream. He smells a foul oder finds Waren he takes the gun makes Jesse & Jade pull over some cops drive up David tries to flag them down & he is hit by a Semi & goes off into CGI land. Chucky & Tiffany pop up they tell Jesse to drive. Chucky shoots at the cop cars & they lose them in the persuit. Chucky & Tiffany kill an old couple steal an RV. They tell them about their plan Jesse & Jade cause Chcuky & Tiffany to argue. Jesse hits the break & Chcuky goes out head 1st Jade knocks Tiffany into a hot stove Jesse wreaks The RV. Chcuky takes Jade to get The Amulet Jesse takes the burnt up Tiffany Doll. Jade get the amulet Jesse trades Tiffany for Jade Chucky throws a knife in Jesse's back Chucky does the soul transfer thing Tiffany stabs Chucky stop him. They start fighting. Chucky stabs Tiffany in the heart. Chucky is knocked in the grave site. A PI shows up. I like this scene where Brad Dourif says \\"Go ahead kill me I always come back but dying is such a b  it  c  h!\\" He is shot & killed The PI lets them go then we have an ending that leaves it open for a sequel a doll baby pops out of Tiffany. I'm sorry that I skipped  through the plot I mean it's a poor sequel they forgot about having likeabl;e characters characters that felt like normal people in favor of pretty faces. The Tiffany character did nothing for me I'd rather have Chucky on his own I didn't like the comic relief & self aware route the series took. A self aware movie isn't a bad thing cause I like Scream & Austin Powers 1&2. Brad Dourif is the best part of the movie. The gore is good & that's it. Ronny Yu I don't get why they got him to direct he did an alright job. Brad Dourif was good. Jenifer Tilly was hot but not much in the acting department. Nick Stable I didn't care for. Katherine Heighel wasn't any good must of been her 1st role. John Ritter was given nothing to do. Gordon Michael Woovett was forgettable. Alexis Arquette was given nothing to do. If they absoultly needed to do a sequel they should'vedone it where Andy was an adult married had a kid his wife buys their  kid a Good Guy Doll & go from there. This movie also has a featurett I know it's like 5 minutes but still that's more than what 2 & 3 has. If you like this movie that's fine if I don't like a movie it's against the movie not against the fans. Every movie has a fan & hater. Bride Of Chucky for me was the beginning of the end
B007IXWL2C|3.0|There is something about the 50 series that made me want to read through all three books.  Frankly I was uncomfortable from a few pages into book one and I had to read just a few pages at a time instead of my voracious appetite to read a book quickly until the conclusion.  There was no conclusion, just agonizing sex scene after sex scene in a culture I'm too old or naive to appreciate.<br />I would stand up and scream about the uselessness of the entire 3 book collection unless I weren't totally honest.  I wanted to see how it came out.  The final scenes were hardly worth the effort but I MUST commend the author.  I read all three even though I was uncomfortable, out of my cultural comfort zone, and as much as I like sex, I quickly tired of reading about it.  And yet I read all three books.  Something about the subject, the style, the writing, the intrigue kept me through page after page.  So while I speak negatively I've got to be objective and admit SOMETHING kept me anxious for the final outcome!  What was the something?<br />Don't know and don't care but have to give credit where it is do.  I'm still 50/50 on the subject.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I for one am addicted to pinterest. This wonderful app only feeds my addiction even more if you know what I mean :{D I recommend this to every fellow pinner :)
B007EC27QM|5.0|Awesome. just love it when an app just does what its suppose to!!! like this one does. no fiddling with ect.... it just woks perfectly!
B00992CF6W|2.0|hello I'm going to tell you about my opinions on bs and mc well bs is better hands down on tablet yea mc is fun but it cost SEVEN FLIPIN DOLLARS that's one third of the cost of it on the computer and how much is bs ITS FREE!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great. Very sad in the end but very good.  Wish there were more books to this series i was very into them just need to find more like them i guess just if i can.
B005PK553C|5.0|This was an amazing series! Watched the entire season in two days! I couldn't get enough. It is scary, chilling and creepy all at the same time. Can't wait for season two.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I actually downloaded this program to get a white noise program that would distract me from my tinnitus.  This is even better--I get to choose from a myriad of ambient sounds, music (instrumentals), and layer them in any order I wish.  Some are to help improve focus and concentration, some to aid in meditation, some to relax and ease you into sleep, and even more to smoothly transition from sleep to wakefulness.  This program is so much more than I expected, and is really helping me overcome my tinnitus and insomnia.  Love it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|nothing revolutionary, but looks good and runs well. Addicting like Facebook games, Farmville and those.  If you just want to kill some time, it's great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The original story was refreshing. My favorite story has been Harry Potter for a quarter of my life. The Hunger Games has tied for my affection. After I finished this series the first time I couldn't help but want more. Another good series is the Gregor books from Collins.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I rarely read fiction, so this review is not coming from an expert! I liked the style of writing but not so much the plot or the ending. Possibly this was the writer's intention! A lot was left open as I finished the last page.
B00136JPB0|5.0|In my humble opinion, one of the best albums ever made, by one of the most tragic and underappreciated artists ever.  Every song is good, and with precious little in his catalog I feel like I have to treasure all of them. With all the Nicki Minajs and other just pitiful music out there, we have to hold on to the real artists who are not with us any longer.  We miss you Jeff!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Very interesting reading.I wanted to find out what all the hype was about was with this book. Some of our friends had read it and didnt think much of it but I enjoyed it.
B00729Z6R4|3.0|Better than their first two, but still missing something. Definitely more of a Bon Jovi influence on some of these songs.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Well, it did seem a little weird to me after reading a few of his previous books, but it was thought provoking just the same!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I was quite disappointed in the movie. It's visually stunning, pretty well acted, but it's just Aliens redux. The dark gut of an alien ship, the pods, the goo. The alien man creature himself was fairly impressive, but this was made laughable at the end of the movie when the camera went back to this aliens dead body and out popped................the alien creature from Alien, Alien 1, Alien 2, Alien 3, on and on. I actually laughed out loud when I saw this. If you're looking for something new, this isn't it, unfortunately. I was waiting to get my socks knocked off by this, but the best parts of the movie are in the trailer.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is one of those rare books that truly gives one an experience of the author's experience. I truly felt I was on the trail with Cheryl. She was able through her writing to give me a felt sense of the isolation, grief and beauty she experienced on her transformative hike. This book will break you wide open, make you thankful for the loved ones in your life and get you itching to see the Pacific Coast Trail for yourself. You will not be disappointed in this book.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Informative and interestingly written. Good background on the DEVGRU without revealing classified informtion. We were encouraged that most of the proceeds were going to families of deceased Seal Team 6 members.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I will probably read the last book of this trilogy -but one book would have been sufficient to tell the story - the sex scenes go on and on and on - I can't imagine this in real life  - and wouldn't want to entertain the bondage idea.  Sometimes, our imagination is more exciting than such detailed description.  I got to the point that I would just turn the page when another sexual encounter started.
B0000BWTK3|4.0|On this disc it's a warhorse to the left of us, a warhorse to the right of us. And the results are downright refreshing. Although I'm a great lover of Schumann's symphonies and many other orchestral works, I've never been all that crazy about his piano concerto, though I've been able to appreciate it and recognize it as the major work it is. Meanwhile, I've been even more stand-offish about the Grieg Piano Concerto, which to me has always seemed tired and wheezy. Well, Jansons, Andsnes and the Berlin Philharmonic have changed my mind somewhat abruptly about both, the Grieg in particular. I'm not sure what it is, but in both recordings -- the Grieg in particular -- there's a pulse. The work is finally alive for me. I'm sure that many of the elements mentioned in other, more analytical reviews are the reasons why. If both these concertos have either not spoken to you, or if you've lost your interest after repeated hearings of other recordings, I suggest you give this disc a try. There's dynamism here, and two old dogs have been taught to do tricks they were always able to perform, if only given the chance.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I have now read the whole trilogy. The books are all derivative, but well written and diverting in a mindless sort of way. The first 2 books were at least somewhat different in that they involved a gameshow-like event called \\"Hunger Games.\\" The last book devolves into a combination of badly written war story and the protagonist's extreme self-pity making it the weakest of the trilogy.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|As a longtime, 'old skool' 51 year old KISS fan(atic), having first seen them live for the 'Destroyer' tour in NYC, I was initially dissapointed upon first listening to this release. I wanted to say something along the lines of \\"they should hang it up already\\", but then something interesting happened- I listened to it a 2nd and 3rd time, without my pre-concieved notions of what they SHOULD sound like, and lo and behold- I liked it! 'Monster' ROCKS! The songs are heavy on riffing and soloing, and Tommy Thayer shines with great playing, hooks, and chops! Eric Singer's drumming is world class, and what can you say about Paul and Gene; they are timeless rock greats still doing what comes naturally! In summation, of course old KISS is classic and phenomenal, but the present incarnation of KISS clearly still means business (and I don't just mean in the 'Gene sense' of making big $$$). In this day and age of 'the dumbing down of rock and pop', given the dearth of great bands (compared primarily to the 60's through 80's), it's great to see bands like KISS, RUSH, DOKKEN, OZZY, AEROSMITH, SCORPIONS, etc. releasing QUALITY 'no holds barred' world class rock well into the 21st century!
B00667KMUO|5.0|After reading all of this beloved series and seeing the first seven movies, I couldn't wait to view the culmination of this saga.  I was not disappointed!  Yates was able to take the best of the last half of the seventh book and put in a neat package that all fit together perfectly.  I believe I was on edge through the entire picture and what a finale.  Thank goodness for the privacy of my home, because I could yell and applaud as loud as I chose to.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Amazing sequel. I love the way that Follett carries the generations of characters while delivering a powerful lesson in history.  While the book stands on its own; I would have preferred to read its predecessor and successor in order, as I did with RR Martin's works.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is one of my favorite movies ever. It never fails to get me choked up in the last part of the movie when the son finally comes around. I live with a man who is an embellish-er so perhaps based on my life experience I can appreciate the movie more so than the people who just don't get it. Jessica Lange performance is so heart warming. What a classy lady.
B009B50QOU|3.0|I was looking forward to this album, but was kind of disappointed. I like about 2-3 tracks from this, but i am not really that pleased with green day's work.<br />It's not all that amazing, but it is very much better than the rest of today's music.
B0091REZMW|5.0|awesome game a good way to pass time. just wish it was a little bigger and didn't force close.A+ game
0802798225|5.0|Though I prefer the \\"How to Ruin\\" series by Simone Elkeles, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the Perfect Chemistry series. Upon first glance, I saw a cheesy cover and my expectations were low, but the story has depth and it deals with issues far beyond teenage love. Opposites Brittany and Alex don't just fall in love, they become part of each other's lives and help deal with issues they thought that they would always have to take on alone. I needed the next book in the series before I was finished with the first so if you're looking to try this book out, you may as well pick up all three.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|this book really made me think about my life. and i really love books like that! its a very good book
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I ordered tempest for a friend of mine, he is a Bob Dylan fan and was very satisfied with it. The price was very good and the explanation was to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Appropriate follow on to the Hunger Games.  Entertaining and keeps you reading.  A good and logical sequence of events.  Wish the series was longer!!
0525953728|5.0|Bought this book for myhusband. He started reading in the afternoon and couldn't put it down. Stayed up till 3 am reading.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|purchased game for my grandson....no fun whatsoever....probably would be fun if additional coins were purchased; however, we can't continue to buy coins just to amuse ourselves.
B000059TEP|5.0|Not a scary movie - purely inspirational!! Fantastic script, story Very Very well done!! Have some Kleenex handy, I cry everytime I watch it. The directors comentery is Very interesting!! One point of trivia - those sounds of the 'grim-reapers' coming for the bad-guys - is only the sound of babies crying - slowed down. This movie is a must see - must have!! Scott MacNeil.
B00932AA5G|5.0|What a great film. I really enjoyed this one. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It's definitely worth your time.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|This book is written in a straightforward way, with a clear point of view. Easy to go through, but informative. The author is also very accessible and willing to answer questions. A good buy.
B007PP2J9I|4.0|Like its predecessor \\"Zero Day\\", this book is a cyber-thriller that will keep you reading even if you know nothing about technology. What I like about Russinovich's books is that, although fiction, he depicts very plausible scenarios that can happen today. It is great to borrow from the author's knowledge about systems security and scary that his stories can actually happen.<br /><br />This book is about technology as a weapon. What would happen when governments start using common hacker tools (viruses, trojans, etc.) to attack other countries? If you want to know, you should read this book. Creeps me out to think about it, but it is a very enjoyable read.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|Friends is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I was so excited to hear that the episodes were going to be released on Blu-ray. But then, I found out that this set only contains the BROADCAST versions of each episode, meaning each episode is significantly cut down to fit a 1/2 hour TV time slot.<br /><br />This is totally unacceptable. Why should I (or anyone that owns the Friends DVD's for that matter) downgrade my episodes to the Broadcast versions? I already own the complete DVD set, and that set has the FULL-LENGTH episodes! Yes, they are now being presented to us in HD, but that is not worth it if we are losing so many hours of unbelievable comedy!<br /><br />My word of advice: Stick with the Friends DVD's, because buying this set will mean losing out on SO MUCH Friends comedy.
B005K01VZS|5.0|You are on a journey with God and see how all people can find him. when finshed you feel and see  the message, to see above not just for the stars. Great Book
B007VWEEQQ|5.0|Love it...<br /><br /> I could enjoy my country radio true iPhone !!!(free app -(Tuneln Radio)-all world radio stations)<br />Easy to plug in,I have 2011 Q7.<br />Sound very clear.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app for the Kindle Fire makes using Pinterest, so simple and easy!  The ONLY negative I have, is that I spend waaayyy to much time on Pinterest now :)
B004QPOVF0|5.0|This is a must for AC/DC fans and proves they still ahve it and rock thier asses off.<br />I'd highly reccommend this to anyone loves classic rock and music in general!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but so far its unlike anything I've read of King's.<br />I try to only read it while on the treadmill so needless to say, I'm spending a lot of time on the treadmill!
B0098VXE50|4.0|very good storyline.visual graphics,I give this movie a 7/10 rating.wasn't to crazy about kristen stewarts acting same old expression.charlize theron was very good and evil,the rest of the cast made this move work,not corny a true fiction,meaning not over done or out of place lines.
B008XG1X18|5.0|wonderful site I get on and its hard to get off. before I realize it I have been on for hours. I love it!!!

B003UBTX72|4.0|I just started reading Keith Richards' memoir and had to write my review now before my impression fades and is no longer quite as strong as it is at this very moment. Keith has been caricatured over the years.We think we know just exactly who he is, but of course we don't.In the opening pages, this book has made me realize this fact by it's prose. I know this book was a collaborative effort,but the the words seem to be just how Keith would tell us his story over a drink or two.He's funny, self deprecating, sarcastic, smart and everything a good story teller needs to be to hold a readers attention. As he described a mid '60's road trip through the American southern states, I found myself cringing, laughing and then as he related visiting black clubs,  playing with local musicians, Muddy Waters and how the patrons were quicker to accept and welcome he and his traveling companions when the white clubs would not, I understood on a whole new level why he loves  playing the blues so much. I was actually crying while reading Keith's words and the joy he might have felt from those experiences. I say that because I know his fans have noticed his face when he plays the blues. He gets this smile on his face and I can't help but imagine he is recollecting some fond memory. I wish I'd picked up this book sooner. Well done Keith.
B005LAIGF0|5.0|rite of passage: a young girl is coming of age,flirting and testing the waters with men to see how alluring one she be to them. the vast majority of us do not have terrible tragedies result from  these fledgling efforts. but what if you are the one who does have these results?  that is what this movie shows us with anna paquin as the girl.<br /><br />she is the cause of this tragedy and cannot face that fact.  so she focusses instead on the man she was was flirting with who may be legally responsible. if she can get the law after him, she feels, then maybe justice can be done,  she could not pick a worse way of attempting to solve this problem. causation in the legal world bears no resemblance to her young adult sense of morality.<br /><br />this film follows NO hollywood trite plot on the girl's quest.  this is not a thriller or a mystery.  this quandry unfolds with strict realism. it unfolds exactly as it would unfold in the real world. she learns what we all learn, that we are the sum of our actions and have to live with the gravest of those for the rest of our days, internally.<br /><br />anna paquin is terrific in this film.  she has become as good an adult actress as she was a child actress. we are getting some terrific actresses who began acting as children.  to name just a few: jodie foster, natalie portman, scarlett johanssen, elizabeth taylor and anna paquin.  this used to be unheard of.  child actors just disappeared from the screen as they grew up.  not so any longer.<br /><br />note: i saw the theatrical version of this movie which is 2.5 hours. A New York Magazine critic maintains this version is worthless and that you need to see the extended cut 3 hour version.  I really thought this was fine at the 2.5 hours and ADDING an additional half hour seems to me to be padding a work that clearly made its point in 2.5 hours, especially since this critic added that this extended material is about the mother's boyfriend (I would have cut what there was of him.)  if it bothers you not seeing the full 3 hours, then hunt for the dvd package which contains the 3 hour extended cut version. caveat: most movies are not meant to be 3 hours in length.  there are very few movies which are worth seeing which are 3 or more hours in length. usually all it means is that the director has not learned how to edit his movies.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

1451678193|4.0|This was an interesting series of short stories about what might happen if there were Martian beings and Americans landed there. The tendency of the Americans was to impose their own culture on the world, with little appreciation of the existing culture and the beauty of Martian creations. In a way, it was a retelling about 'how the west was won'.
1401238580|1.0|I pre-ordered this set months ago, as I was excited that such a collection would be available before I had to set up a V for Vendetta Display in November.<br /><br />The good, the book is great, but you can buy a comparable edition for a few dollars less on Amazon by itself. I repeat the book is great 5 stars, too good for this set.<br /><br />The mask is a flimsy thin plastic number complete with hanging tab. Garbage. I will return and buy the deluxe rubies mask, it has to be better than this one. The worst part, the packaging. It is so flimsy my first set was dented, and my replacement set was worse, the cellophane tearing out of the front. The box looks completely different than what is shown here. I will upload images to show what I mean. What a waste of potential.<br /><br />If you don't care about the quality of the mask or the condition of the box you may like this.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Oh my word!  This is an awesome book and completely 'unput downable'.  It keeps you guessing right until the end and leaves you with a sense on completeness.  With every word, you are dragged deeper and deeper into Panem and find yourself living with Katniss and Gale and Peeta.  Loved every minute of it! :)

1609611543|5.0|I had already started eating a low-carb diet but this book helped me to realize that wheat and wheat products can cause blood sugar to rise and intensify cravings for sweets. If it helps other people get off of eating wheat products and bypass health problems that wheat can cause - then it is worth the time it takes to read the book. I'd recommend it to others who want to change their eating to feel better and lose a few pounds in the process.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|This movie was great. And I'm beginning to be a fan of 3D movie. I just got a TV about a month ago that supports it. So I go this one on 3D only because it was $24. Seems like a normal Blu-Ray price.<br /><br />The 3D was very easy to watch. I feel Scott did a great job with it. I watched the Avengers in 3D as well, and there were a few shots where my eyes were strained trying to figure out what I should be focusing on. I didn't have that at all with Prometheus. The entire movie was easy to watch in 3D. Just enough depth to tell what was in the foreground, and background.<br /><br />The movie itself was really good. The first 50 minutes or so, I just kept thinking that they don't make movies like this any more. The attention to detail with the sets was awesome.<br /><br />I'm giving this movie 4 stars because there were some things in the movie that I just wasn't sure what the point was. It just didn't feel like it belonged. But overall, this is a very enjoyable movie. Turn up the surround sound, turn down the lights, and just enjoy.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I'm not sure what else to say. This book was not good at all. It was painful to get through. Bared to You was an excellent book, one of my all time favorites and I literally could not wait for the follow up book. Bared to You consumed me and I read it from start to finish in one day. Sadly, it was not meant to be with Relected in You. I don't want to waste your time with a blow by blow of the book, others have done a far better job than I could.<br /><br />Reflected to you was so bad that I wish Bared to You was a single story, even with the abrupt ending. The characters that I grew to love and care about were not there in the second book. The sex scenes that took my breath away and amazed me in the first book were devoid of emotion and hard to get through in Reflected in You. I'm sorry I read the sequel because it has ruined the characters and story I loved in the first book. I feel out of love :(<br /><br />Save your $9.99, it is not worth it. In fact, if I could I would ask for my money back. I don't think I have ever said that about any book in my life. It was just that bad.
081297381X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and I now have a much better appreciation of how events occur<br />in the real world of extremistan!

B00005MP58|2.0|I found this series to be really disappointing except for Colin Firth whom I just love.  The girls (actresses) were quite ugly I thought and just the whole series was a huge disappointment on the same level as the new Pride and Prejudice starring Keiren Knightly. The original film with Greer Garson was fabulous and still is today.  The actors and actresses were carefully chosen and it will always remain a classic.
1400112559|5.0|Great info and you can tell the author loves his dog \\"Pump\\" and dogs in general. I highly recommend the book.  I got it in audio after I got the paperback so I could review and listen to on mu commute.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great story by and about a great American. I highly recommend this book as well as Marcus Luttrell's book Lone Survivor.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Mumford And Sons have given music a much needed kick in the butt by proving you don't need to be a synthed out dance band to sell to a big audience. It's helped bands like Avett Brothers, Trampled by Turtles and more reach a wider listener-ship and helped reestablish Americana and roots music in the USA. And that's a good thing in my mind. \\"Babel\\" is their second full length CD, and it follows the slow-burn success of \\"Sigh No More,\\" as well as finding the band in a tough situation. How do you appease this new found audience who look upon you as the newest and next big thing without disappointing them?<br /><br />In response, \\"Babel\\" loads up on the bombast and the religion. Think U2 with banjos, with the bulk of the songs also having a soft/loud/soft/explode variety of songwriting that owes as much to grunge than folk-rock. There's way too much \\"Jesus saved me\\" here for my tastes, yet the disc overall is pretty darn great. There's a lot of soul in Marcus Mumford's voice and he's happy to pour it on with all the force he can muster (the title track) or in longing (\\"I Will Wait\\")or cries for salvation (\\"Whispers in The Dark\\"). As the band rises and swells behind him, Mumford's voice carries the emotional wallop of the lyrics he's penned with ease. Add some otherworldly harmonies and you have the makings for greatness.<br /><br />There isn't much subtlety in that manner of music making, but the emphasis here is on the rock part of Folk-Rock. There's a hunger for this kind of honesty in music and \\"Babel\\" gives sustenance.
B007VTUYWW|3.0|I watched it after many years, and I remembered it being better. Could that be due to the novelty factor?
0316228532|1.0|I was excited to see where J.K. would take her story writing but sadly disappointed that her Adult book needed to tell a story so filled with explicit and vile language and scenes.  I feel her story could have been told with out every other word out of many characters mouths being the F word.  I understand the some of the characters have a horrid life, I get that.  I have read quite a bit of this book hoping to get to the good stuff.  Not finding it.  Not at all what I expected from the book cover.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Isaw this on tv and found it at an awesome price here, he arrived very quickly and fantastic condition no complaints at all it even still had the bonus hologram picture still in the case. I recommend this seller to anyone.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Pretty far fetched but its entertaining. They don't hold back! Kind of makes me want a Harley. Great acting, enough humor and wit paired with some hot sex scenes, oh and don't forget the ruthlessness of it and you've got a great show!
034580404X|5.0|If you can look past the numerous grammatical errors and poorly edited content, you will find a decent love story. I mean it's not the next Pulitzer winner, but it's a good choice for someone who likes spending a rainy day reading on the couch. If you know anything about the Twilight series, you will be able to predict pretty much everything that happens in the story. I was in need of a mindless read, and the Fifty Shades books delivered exactly that.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|[[ASIN:1439102813 Still Alice]]<br />Many people, old and young, have a fear about alzheimers disease, but<br />know nothing about the long term process. The author, Lisa Genova, has<br />given us a glimpse into one family's experience and, in the process,<br />has developed a thoroughly professional and well written novel.  This<br />is not a lighthearted book, but one that is written with great love<br />and care.
B009B50QOU|5.0|took about a week to get used to the new songs, some are a little different than normal greenday. Sounded more mainstream, new day, boy band rock. But i like the hard rock style of 21st century breakdown.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series knocked my socks off.  It was professionally written and a little reminiscent of Stephen King.  Howey yanks you back and forth until you don't know what to think anymore.  Loved it!
0307887898|4.0|This book should be called Business management for dummies. It is well accessible, broadly applicable, and important reading, almost a textbook. The writer is somewhat modest in his analogies to founding fathers of scientific management, but all the same he manages to convince the reader about the pitfalls of running companies the old fashioned way. So it is not about changing the way new entrepreneurs think and act, as implied by the title, it's much more.<br /><br />For me, the main points of the book concern the adoption and adaptation of lean product manufacturing and agile software development into guiding principles of business development. Ries introduces examples mostly from the world of software business, but he and I both believe that these can applicable outside this domain. The approach to knowledge work is healthy as he advocates way of working in which \\"teams work cross-functionally to achieve validated learning.\\" I like his thinking of validated learning a lot. This refers to setting \\"scientific\\" criteria for determining if organization's intuitions about their offerings are true or false. This thinking follows Steve Blank's Customer Development ideas in how a growing company has to define itself through interaction with market.<br /><br />In the book Ries introduces a bunch of concepts to build a new vocabulary of business management. The Lean Startup involves a minimum viable product, validated learning through split testing, actionable metrics, pivoting, small batches, and innovation sandbox. Most of this is fascinating and well grounded. However, the style and linguistics are my primary problem with the book. The author tackles so many fronts with so many new concepts at once, that some logical connections seem to fade in the process. He calls for scientific rigor, but has to admit that the ideology advocated by the book remains more a matter of faith than test. Luckily he acknowledges this by pointing out to academic endeavors which try to validate his learning.<br /><br />The book is gratefully clean of many problems that are evident in the area of \\"innovation literature.\\" Yes, this is a pretty optimistically written work, which obscuring some business realities, but establishes others. The single thing I don't like is the style of expression. Despite or maybe because of numerous editors, the style lacks a clear voice and include idle expressions best left out. Overall, the amount of clutter is adequately small, so the great number of insights justifies the printing of this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who tries to build new ideas with the world.
B009B50QOU|5.0|This album really surprised me I love green day and enjoyed every album they've made but I wasn't sure when they released the singles but this album has grown on me so much that I really love this album this has turned into one of my favorites from green day.
B000IZA9NK|4.0|A throwback to the days of movie house serial and cliffhangers, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is just plain fun. Wonderfully visualized in an \\"All Green Screen alternate world of giant flying robots, WWII era fighter planes that drive into the sea to become submarines, flying aircraft carriers, near super heroes (and heroines) and evil geniuses... It makes you wish it were true. Silly and beautiful to look at, the film never takes itself too seriously. Watch for a cameo by legendary (and deceased) Sir Laurence Olivier.
0525953728|5.0|[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]] From taking surveys I managed to accumulate a coupon that the book only cost me 16 cents.  But, it is worth far more than that.  I have read it, staying up late and passed it on to another veteran friend of mine, who will pass it on to a mutual Seal Friend of ours.<br /><br />It is good to see the actual account, which clears up much of what our biased media portrays. The Author, Mark Owen does a fantastic job!  I salute him!
B008FSCNTK|1.0|It's a sad day for Diana fans. It seems that the second rate talent of her husband is showing through. I was thrilled to see a new album coming, but after listening to the samples on Amazon...... I just can't bring my self to buy it. Especially after I borrowed it and gave it a spin. I will be awaiting the second album from an up and coming super talent in Andrea Motis. Her first album was amazing for a 14yr old!! Give her a listen... She definitely learned her craft from studying Diana. She is going to be something. But back to this new release by the modern master of sultry sounds and exquisite piano caresses. Not to be a prude but the album cover is a bit tacky, the music on the album is uninspiring and the plunky style of playing is not our Diana that we have come to love. Sure life has changed for her with a new family and loosing her mom but I kind of expected jazz from a jazz singer. Maybe next time.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|A friend recommended I read this and at first my feeling was, not another Holocaust book. I wasn't in the mood for a depressing story like Sophie's Choice at the moment. I read it anyway and while the subject is a difficult one, Tatiana de Rosnay handled it well. I lived in Paris for two and a half years and with all the walking tours I took I never knew about what happened to the Jews there in 1942. I wish I had known.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great movie, loved the sarcastic humor!! It was great to get to rent the HD version the day it was released and never leave the couch!
B003VS0CYC|3.0|Be careful that you're reading the right review - This is for the blu-ray trilogy. Turns out, I failed and read a review here for a different version that listed all kinds of goodies/extras - like commentary, featurettes, concept art, etc. I think the review I saw was for the OOP Criterion version or something, because this trilogy has no extras. Well it's got the trailers, that's it...no commentary or featurettes.<br /><br />It's nice to have the original Verhoeven cut in HD (sort of), but if you're looking for the Robo version of something like the excellent Alien Anthology blu-ray set, this isn't it. Someone needs to broker a deal between MGM and the folks at robocoparchive.com, where the RA guys develop the \\"special features disc\\" and Hollywood's remastering ninjas really go to work on these films (or at least the first one), and do for them what was done for the Kubrick movies. The Shining blu-ray, for instance, makes that movie look like it was shot this year. Robo 1 still looks basically the same as it did on DVD.<br /><br />In any case, perhaps one day Robo will get the massive blu-ray set he deserves, until then, seems like this will have to do. If the dearth of extras is a dealbreaker for you, it seems that the Criterion DVD is probably still the way to go.

B0034G4OYK|4.0|Sony Pictures Animation has never actually been able to keep up with the other big boy animators on the block. Movies like \\"Surf's Up\\", \\"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\\", \\"The Smurfs\\", \\"Arthur Christmas\\" and \\"Pirates!\\" never met the critical acclaim or the wide acceptance of some of the movies from Disney, Pixar or even Universal. Yet, teaming up with Columbia Pictures on \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" may have been a really good move.<br /><br />With the voice talents of Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Cee Loo Green, Selena Gomez, Steve Buscemi and David Spade, \\"Hote Transylvania\\" has something for everybody. There were times in the film that I was a little overwhelmed with the constant bombardment of characters and jokes, but eventually the movie settled down and capitalized off of some character development and brought some pretty good heart to the story.<br /><br />\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" has a lot of story and back-story, but it is all well explained and not your typical simple animated storyline. Dracula is raising his daughter, alone, so he builds a castle in the middle of Pennsylvania, fortified by rows and miles of zombie cemeteries and ghost forests. His hotel has become a fortress to keep he, his fellow monsters and most importantly, his daughter safe from the hateful murderous humans. His daughter is getting older though, she's 118 now and she has become too curious about the outside world and she wonders if humans are really how they've been portrayed.<br /><br />\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" is the Muppets, animated. There are a slew of characters who have gathered in one place for the birthday party of the century. All of the characters have their own personality and it reminded me of the Muppets as I watched it play out. Dracula, I compared to Kermit, trying to hold the show together as the onslaught of characters and personalities clashed. The jokes are fast and furious. Many of them aren't that funny, but I did notice that many of the jokes were tailored toward adults and many were ones that kids would find gut tickling.<br /><br />Ultimately though, \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" is a fun trip to the movies for all ages. Is it hilarious? I wouldn't say so. At times I found it funny, but when it was all said and done, I was sold on the personality and the heart behind it. Despite all the silliness and the constant playing up to the kids of our age with the music and the hyperactivity, somewhere in there, there was a whole lot of heart behind it all.ard adults and many were ones that kids would find gut tickling.<br /><br />Ultimately though, \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" is a fun trip to the movies for all ages.

B009MO5G90|4.0|There have been five of the \\"Resident Evil\\" movies now, all either written or directed by W.S. Anderson, who I'm not a huge fan of. When he brings his mind-numbing nonsense down to relatable level and doesn't get as ridiculous as he did with 2011's \\"The Three Musketeers\\", he has skill and he sure can bring the carnage like the best of them. So combining the ultra-popular genre of zombies with science fiction action appears to be a good recipe because this series, based on a very popular videogame, has been successful and has a reliable following.<br /><br />I have to admit, as much as I'm not a huge fan of Anderson's, I have enjoyed this series. There are requirements for viewing a \\"Resident Evil\\" movie. First of all, you have to know at least some of the background from the videogame and the characters. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is the most popular character and the one you need to know the most about. Course there is also Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) who had her own starring role in the video game series. In this film, she works for the Umbrella Corporation, a company bent on world takeover with a T-virus and cloning.<br /><br />There is so much back-story and history to this series that I couldn't possibly go into it and still write a review without losing you halfway through, so I won't. The movie even starts with a fairly long back-story, but even it doesn't help. You either know, or you don't.<br /><br />The problem with the \\"Resident Evil\\" series is the lack of feeling you get from endless gunfire and explosions. In a series that has humanity in peril around every corner, the lack of humanity in its storytelling has been its achilles heel. The action has always been cool and intense, but at some point or another, the relentlessness of it sort of desensitizes you. Eventually, the cool effects lose their impact. That being said, \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" did something about that. Nothing sucks an audience into a perilous situation like an eight-year old girl with a hearing impairment. As the movie unfolds Alice finds herself attached to her daughter, a clone, and you as an audience member are just as concerned for that girl's safety.<br /><br />The story is convoluted, but some of the best action sequences in the entire series are present here. They aren't overwhelmingly ridiculous. Insert some humanity and feeling in the form of an eight-year old deaf girl who is probably the only actor in the film who brings the movie down to reality, and \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" is one of the best of the series. I don't know how much that is saying. You're either a fan, or you're not. \\"Retribution\\" is a decent time at the movies.l with a hearing impairment.

B0058W74UY|5.0|i have no problems with this app bought for my 10.1 in airpad and would say it is stable and worth the download.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|A-cappella nerds are run amok in the new movie \\"Pitch Perfect\\", and how wonderful it is in this day and age of studio doctored album releases that somebody would have the keen sense to make such a movie. Sure, there's the television show \\"Glee\\" that explores the same thing, but the television show \\"Glee\\" is studio doctored a-cappella. The beauty of the human voice without instruments or synthesizers is truly a lost art form and \\"Pitch Perfect\\" represents well.<br /><br />The best part about \\"Pitch Perfect\\" and the a-cappella that it demonstrates is the realization that Anna Kendrick (Up in the Air, 50/50) can really sing among other things. One scene in particular stands out where she auditions for the a-cappella group, `the Bellas'. In the scene, she creates music with her hand and a cup while singing. Brittany Snow as well showed off her singing ability in the television show \\"American Dream\\" but here, she hits it out of the park even more. Then there is Rebel Wilson, who plays Fat Amy. You may remember her from the smash hit \\"Bridesmaids\\" from last year. She adds the humor and spice to the group.<br /><br />\\"Pitch Perfect\\" isn't without criticism in its predictability. Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton recently teamed up for a more wholesome film called \\"Joyful Noise\\" in which a group of choir singers are trying to compete in a national competition and need to spice up their routine. You get the same storyline with \\"Pitch Perfect\\". Given though, \\"Pitch Perfect\\" is by far the superior film of the two. The comedy is better and the a-cappella is real and well constructed.<br /><br />The a-cappella in \\"Pitch Perfect\\" is the film. Director Jason Moore who knows a thing or two about music, having directed \\"Avenue Q\\" on broadway, knew it had to be great. The storyline wasn't going to be the selling point. He also knows a thing or two about what young teen audiences want as well, with a few directing credits on the WB and CW networks. There are many highlights throughout the film and I even found some of the musical numbers in the middle of the film more compelling than the finale.<br /><br />\\"Pitch Perfect\\" is a combination of a lot of films, but the good thing is, all those films are good ones. Movies like \\"Mean Girls\\", \\"Bridesmaids\\", \\"Joyful Noise\\", \\"Bring it On\\" and oh, I'd have to mention \\"Glee\\" even though Glee is sort of fake a-cappella, are all inspirations for what turned out to be a movie with a routine storyline that you can't take your eyes off of. The script is tight, eventful and always interesting. The humor is good. Everything blended together to lock you the audience into your seat for a fun and toe-tapping good time.e film and I even found some of the musical numbers in the middle of the film more compelling than the finale.<br /><br />\\"Pitch Perfect\\" is a combination of a lot of films, but the good thing is, all those films are good ones.

B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP. IM ADDICTED!<br />I'm one of those people who can rarely follow recipes or assembly instructions. with this&quot;PinTi&quot;  App on my<br /> KinFire I can search for items that visually inspire me with incredible ease!<br />  One change I'd like to see is the ability to easily<br /> manipulate my boards and their titles.<br />It helps to have titles others can easily relate to.  I did not realize this right away so my visual collections (boards) were organized and titled to my own quirky personal memory triggers. So I had to create many over again.<br />I don't read instructions so don't quote me on the app's inability to do this. It could be that  I just haven't figured out. how to do it YET. Enjoy!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Love this season. Had the other six except this one, made my month when I finally got it to complete what I had.. Recommended to anyone who loves supernatural shows!
1451662432|5.0|I made it a point to pick up this book on the day it was released. I have always enjoyed Arnold Schwarzenegger's films and was intrigued by his rise to the govenor's office in the great state of \\"Kalifornia.\\" But I wasn't prepared for how readable his autobiography would be. While I was waiting at customer service at my local Costco, another customer saw my copy of \\"Total Recall\\" on the counter and asked if this was the first book by Arnold I was reading. When I replied in the affirmative, he told me he had read all of his books and had enjoyed them all. That was a real endorsement for me. You can hear Arnold's voice as you read his words on each page. The book also contains some interesting trivia: Richard Nixon first suggested that Schwarzenegger should run for governor in California; Karl Rove discouraged him from running in the recall election. If Grey Davis had survived, the Republican Party was hoping to have Condi Rice run for the office in 2006. Fascinating! If I can irreverently steal a line from Arnold's movie: \\"Get your ass to Mars\\" and buy a copy of \\"Total Recall.\\"
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have enjoyed Ken Follett's work and this is a logical next step!  I love some (but not all) of his characters and I want to know what will happen to them in book three!  Sign me up!
0385338686|4.0|I found this book to be more about someone finding themself than just about romance.  The romance part was in the background a bit but the story was more about the main female character.  I really enjoyed the story.  I really like this author.  Its very interesting all the way through, never boring, revealing and just a make you feel good book.  I am reading all her books.
0812550706|5.0|Awesome book! Thoroughly entertaining. I couldn't put this book down. This was actually recommended to me by my boss. We've had several conversations about the book and the strategic applications within the work place.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a very clever and well written story. I was hooked from the first few pages and couldn't put it down. Brilliant!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Ever been nostalgic for another period in time? Ever had fond memories of a long lost lover or a love long lost? Ever wanted to visit another place in time, or re-live, or do-over a piece of time? After you read this book you may not be so anxious to hop in the old time machine and experience that \\"blast from the past.\\" Memories are best viewed in hindsight, not foresight.<br /><br />Stephen King is, as nearly every connoisseur and consumer of horror fiction knows, a master story weaver. With \\"11-22-63: A Novel,\\" he has proven what he has said about his writing all along: \\"I write fiction; others define it.\\" King has weaved yet another haunting masterpiece with this work, but not JUST another masterpiece. This may end up being THE definitive classic masterpiece of fiction in a long line of King's classics.<br /><br />In this tale, I found myself literally transported back in time to a critical period in American history, and not only read to what it was like in the late fifties and early sixties, I felt its texture and tasted it. I was born in 1962 and as such, never consciously \\"experienced\\" those days; however when this story ended, I was feeling a strong sense that I had experienced them. It was one of the most sublime literary experiences I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.<br /><br />You will NOT regret purchasing this book. If you download the audiobook, DO NOT download the abridged version. You will kick yourself if you do.<br /><br />~L.Fleming, Tyler Texas
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|A good app for transferring files between device and laptop without turning on USB. A couple of drawbacks: 1-No apparent start/stop buttons; 2-No error message if upload fails such as trying to upload to extsd card which isn't allowed on android (a pet peeve of mine-but that's for another discussion). Overall, a good toolbox app to have on hand.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a very good book that I highly recommend. It gave very good insight into the life of a Navy Seal and what they do to protect our country. I really enjoyed it.
1602526184|4.0|As always with Ian McEwan the writing is superb. It is a well told story and approaches its subject matter in strands and layers, deepening the story, laying open the characters. And then...the relationship disintegrates and what has been slowly built is expelled into a rush of a helicopter view of an end point. Where the protagonists have aged. Their main life events condensed in a few pages. It works, he is too skilled a writer for it not to be a deliberate sleight of hand. but as a reader, I wanted to have my sense of the inevitable confounded. Not a happy ending, but one that was not so predictable. Set in the 1960's Mr McEwan captured the almost pathological ignorance on communicating around intimacy in the English. Mabbe something we should thank our American cousins for changing. I still remember my first visit to New York and two middle aged American men discussing loudly in a coffee shop, their respective wives sexual wants in graphic, intimate but surprisingly sensitive way. They wanted to know the mechanisms of what made a woman work and darn, it must be just like putting a cupboard together if only they could sort out the plan and make sure they had the right tools. The protagonists in \\"On Chesil Beach\\" could have benefited from overhearing such a conversation.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not  Lee Child's best but still entertaining! Lets face it Jack Reacher novels are not designed to be literary excellence.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Amazon version doesn't work for my s3. Beware if you have an s3. Bought this app a while back and wanted to give it another shot since Swype was sucking. Oh well
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Since season 4 ended I have been wondering how the writers would bring all the players back into the fold.  They have done so in a most rewarding way.  As for the three eposides that have aired, I am in doubt the Captain knows of the new feelings between C & B but from previous episodes I get the notion that R & E have figured it out.  I am looking forward to see how the writers work in the Captain learning the secret - which is no longer a true secret - and how the 'twist' will unfold.  Monday is a great night.
B002APU580|5.0|I seen this movie on tv and had to have it. If you like movies from this era this one is a must see.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Keep the levels coming! I beat it all and I'm hungry for more! I just wish it was part of where is my water so I didn't have to switch between apps.
B005603236|5.0|The quality of the audio and vision of this blu-ray is excellent.  I really enjoyed this movie and I am glad I have my own personal copy because I plan to watch it several times more.  About the story line of this movie I can say that I loved it.  The romance is simple but you can see the chemistry between the main actors.  If you are looking for a romantic movie with a happy ending this is it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The writing was good, I felt the storyline lacked a bit though. The main character really needs to stop crying so much.
B001QKSWOE|2.0|Have read every \\"number\\" book. Most were laugh out loud funny. The characters well drawn and the situations, though often ridiculous, were fun. Loved to share her wiggling out of uncomfortable situations. Gramma Mazur was fun, even if she did many of the same things from book to book. Love Lula. This book lacked umph. Some of the scenes were borrowed from other books and weren't funny or believeable then. Of course, one has to suspend their disbelief, but there has to be something to keep the reading interested. Very disappointed.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Awsome! Conected it to the port and Ubuntu have it working already. No need for extra drivers. No noticeable latency, excellent sound. :)
B007FEFLTO|4.0|story moves quickly and he gives a nice insight into the workings of the differing factions concerned between the wars.

B008FSCNTK|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews of this album?!? OK so she is not singing jazz standards in a standard format. Get over it.<br /><br />The music is clearly performed with love and emotion. This is not commercial music. They were happy making this music and I am glad to be able to share in it.<br /><br />This is moving music with honest soul. She loved the music of her Nanna and Pappa from the 20's and she has done it up with modern arrangements and her smokey, soulful voice.<br /><br />Great musicians play on this.<br /><br />A unique musical experience. Thanks for this Diana. I get it.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|So much happens in this season! You will be happy one minute and in tears the next. SOA is one of the best shows I have ever followed.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is way more fun than several other free games ive tried. This is now in my top 5 favorite games! I used it on my kindle fire and love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know that it dosent have the nether portal but the is because it is harder to make the the Pc and xbox but the aren't done upgrading it the next update is having the nether in it to let you know.so.stop saying it is a horrible game
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The Time Keeper seduces the reader into a fun and entertaining fantasy where Father Time, and young adolescent and a wealthy dying man collide.  I was engrossed from the first page and found I could relate to each character.  While the beginning caught me, the ending was less than exceptional.  I look forward to other books by the author.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of the movie, especially the interactions between the main characters.  Wish the online version came with the deleted scenes and gag-reel.
B002APU580|5.0|Charming retelling of the Jane Austen classic. The rustic look of the Bennett estate suggests \\"class\\" differences more than previous versions between the have and have not people in the story. This film was nicely produced and well acted and has special qualities of its own to recommend it. And while the BBC PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with Colin Firth is a more complete telling of the Austen tale and I have a special fondness for the 1940 MGM Garson/Olivier film which took liberties with the story, this Keira Knightly version has a warmth that makes it utterly appealing. It's definitely worth a look see. I recommend it.
0345803493|5.0|I loved this book! I've already read the 1st one & have finished this one! Now I am on the 3rd one! I can't hardly put it down! Ive heard there will be a movie, awesome!!

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|We just received the case last night and it's as I expected it to be based of other reviews.  It's easy to install and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the Kindle Fire which is what I was hoping for.  The case is light weight and seems to be sturdy enough to protect the Kindle Fire.  We shall see soon enough as I have 3 kids and they for sure will test the durability.<br /><br />I have yet to try out the \\"stand\\" of the case.  I quickly tried it a couple times after I installed it and it didn't seem to stay in the groove for one reason or another.  I'll try it a few more times and update as necessary.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is a very clever book that I fought reading. All my friends that had read it recommended it, but I wasn't intrigued by the book description. I ended up buying it because both of my book clubs have selected it - so one way or another I was going to end up discussing it. When I did start reading it and really got into it - then I couldn't stop reading. Slightly disappointed in the ending, but was thoroughly entertained throughout. Definitely didn't see the twists coming.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|Very different and a lot darker than the original idea of Snow White a must see if you are into these kind of movies
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this book is for those people that need to privately feed their own eroticism....it was such a thrilling series...i read all 3 books in 2 days....could not get enough of these characters and how they developed into the lovers they are...cannot wait to see the movie...will take my husband
B00631VJIC|4.0|This soundtrack is wonderful.  The songs included in the soundtrack are a great choice especially since they played such a significant role in the series.  Sons of Anarchy is one of my favorite shows so the music is very important to me too and this soundtrack did a great job.  My one and only complaint is that a few songs that I was hoping to be on the soundtrack are not.  This is not and will not be a deal breaker for me because the soundtrack is still great.  Puts me in the mood to watch some SOA!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|There is so much action from start to finish. You can never figure out what's going to happen next! As soon as you think you know something else happens!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I could not wait to read a new Jack Reacher story. Lee Child is the best and he always does right by Reacher. This time Reacher gets into something that doesn't take him long to figure out. The book was fast reading,these stories always get me on the first page,hold my interest thou to the end. When you see the name Lee Child, you know you are getting the best story possible. Its a given. I think everyone who is a fan will enjoy another adventure with Reacher,he's the best.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Pines by Blake Crouch, was an intriguing book.  The suspense kept me reading and turning pages. The storyline held up until near the end.  I was kept on the edge of my seat waiting to find out how this too perfect community came to be and would things crumble.  However, the story slipped and the timelines didn't match up.  A little more clarity would have been nice to understand how much time had passed from when the main character came to this town and his present day time.<br /><br />I found that I had to reread a few parts to figure out the timelines for each character and how they came to the town.  Mr. Crouch started to jump around with the years and dates that it got confusing.  It sort of felt like he had a good idea but couldn't quite figure out how to make it all come together and quickly threw an ending in to make it fit.  A little more written thought process would have helped me follow much easier.
B0098PX68G|5.0|The film left me absolutely speechless, I even let the credits run out before I could bring myself to turn it off. This is a story of friendship, love, courage, and life itself. It is both crushingly heart-breaking and infinitely hopeful.. The actors' performance is fantastic. All of them did quite an amazing job. Benedict Cumberbatch's work is especially stunning. It can easily be his best act so far. An actor with a bigger name at the time would have gotten an Oscar for the performance, no doubt.<br />The film is a real gem, give it the full attention it deserves. And please don't miss James Vincent McMorrow's song that plays during the end credits!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it! Beginning to end it was perfect. All the ups and downs with Gideon and Eva's relationship is what makes them unique as a couple. I feel like a lot was revealed in this book and they both grew to trust one another. Gideon ceratinly let his guard down and surprised me when he opened up to her FINALLY!I know he still has a lot more to say!<br />Call me crazy, but the guy is gorgeous and powerful, i did not mind his controlling tendencies. He is all man and he wants to protect what is his. I love a character that knows  what he wants and takes things to the next level with his own hands.<br />The stories of Corinne and Cary were very intense and interesting to read. It brought suspense and mystery. All the characters in this book are awesome!<br />I certainly enjoyed this book so much i feel like i know them personally, and i cannot wait to read the third book. More incredible sex and powerful storylines.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books. definitely worth reading. Definitely recommend this to anyone.Christian Grey is someone you would want to meet in person.

B004GHBQCE|5.0|This is a great album, rare that he still wrote and grew as a singer. So many just perform there old hits. When the man comes round one of the best.
1455121924|5.0|I bought the book \\"Wheat Belly...\\" on CDs. I'm glad I listened while driving back and forth to work because the driving kept me awake - otherwise I'd probably have fallen asleep on it. :-) Nevertheless, boring or not, the information was sound. Who knew!? Wheat is in everything, how can you live without it? I have stopped eating wheat and I feel better and I'm finding that it's really not that hard to quit. I believe Dr. Davis makes his point. Wheat has been changed so much in the last 50 or so years to where past generations probably wouldn't recognize it. Dr. Davis has done us a great service to point out the problems with wheat. I had never heard this information from any other source. Even though I've been on a strict vegan diet in recent months, I did not know the potential harm of eating wheat. Good job, Dr. Davis.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enjoyed immensely. Would recommend to others if you like a good mystery/ puzzle game. Can honestly say I am looking forward to bug the next one.
B0099G3I96|3.0|Though this was a fairly solid album, I was expecting it to sound more like previous No Doubt albums than it does.  This album sounded like a Gwen Stefani solo project with the dance/produced vibe it has to it.  The rest of the band seems to only make a few cameos.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing because it would be the best of Gwen's solo projects.  However, none of her solo projects, nor Push and Shove would beat out any of No Doubt's previous releases.  I liked Settle Down, Push and Shove, Looking Hot and Gravity the best.  One more summer would come in right behind them.  The others won't make it to be downloaded onto an MP3 player or into the car.  Over all, it's good to have No Doubt back, as the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but I'd would have liked more classic No Doubt and less Gwen Stefani dance music.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i dont play very many games but love this one! my daughter introduced me to it and i played one game just to amuse her. now i am addicted
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Read this.  Incredible story line and also takes you back to a simpler time.  I strongly recommend this book...his best ever!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its ok but I think the scrat game is unfair because 99.9% of the time you're only winning the smallest prize. I also don't like the fact that the acorns and hearts are not earned without purchase or a very long course of playing the game.
B0087HT36U|5.0|It is more challenging the birds.  Lots of fun.  Saving the peasants is harder than it appears.  I recommend this for anyone that has time to kill and enjoys birds.
B000HZGOUI|5.0|This movie if by far on the best survival/action movies I have ever seen. The backdrop the Portland forest makes for some beautiful shots as well as the scenes in British Colombia. I highly recommend this movie, its worth the purchase! With Tom Brown Jr. One of the worlds best survivalist teachers helping off screen its hard to go wrong.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B0015O5XUM|5.0|Van Morrison is a timeless classic. These greatest hits  selection only touches the tip of the iceberg of his musical library but it's a wonderful compilation of some of his best songs. Love it!!
B007RI56NY|5.0|This is an awesome album with a great mixture of styles. Just when you think they can't top themselves. I Love it! Keep 'em comin Train!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read the book in 3 days!  I could hardly put it down, and wanted more at the end! Now I want to read the other books by this author.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This album is delicious. I recommend buying it. Even if you don't think you really like this genre, start with this album. You will not be disappointed. By the way, note that this is not one of the super long paid-for reviews. I'm a regular guy who thinks this album is awesome!
B0095R64AO|5.0|I loved the movie. It made me laugh. I couldn't stop watching the movie. I watched it from the beginning to the end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game; can hardly put it down. I only wish they would allow you more opportunities to gain more coins!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Amazing book i would reccomend   for anybody! Great ending with a surprising twist. For adults and kids alike. Definetly enjoyed reading this series
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Alarm Clock Xtreme does what it is designed to do. I like the way it gradually increases the volume level so as not to be jarring when an alarm goes off. Ability to set multiple alarms also a plus. I'm using it on my Kindle Fire with the IHome docking station.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was enjoyable for an action film, not overrun with non-stop action that left little room for story like so many do today.  The dialogue was top notch; there were a lot of great lines.  It was a really fun film!  I'm in my late 40s, but the kid in me still enjoys a good superhero movie, and I enjoyed this one very much!
B008LA7RMK|5.0|I first bought this album when it was released in 1964, while I was a sophomore in high school. Being a big fan of the Beach Boys, I had all of their albums up to this point. The California sound was appreciated here in Florida, too. And this album marked a turning point in their career. No songs about surfing, and no songs about cars, either. It was more teen angst. And no one did it better.<br /><br />The songs on this album are nothing short of great. The album starts off with a great cover of Bobby Freeman's \\"Do You Wanna Dance\\". The Beach Boys made this one their own, and is the only track on the album not penned by Brian Wilson. The biggest standout on this disc is the original version of \\"Help Me, Ronda\\" (spelling as it's on the disc). This version has an intro, doesn't have Mike Love's \\"Bow bow bow's\\" in the chorus, and is longer. It's also the version of this song I prefer. (The single version appears on the \\"Summer Days and Summer Nights\\" LP.) Also heard here are two of their other singles, \\"When I Grow Up (To Be A Man)\\" and \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\". The former laments growing older and what the future may bring, while the latter just makes you want to cut a rug along with Brian and the boys. The rest of the tracks deal with teenage life and love as we remember it. All in all, an enjoyable listen.<br /><br />Until now, this album was only available in mono and in Capitol's fake stereo \\"Duophonic\\" process. This Duophonic method introduced a delay on one channel to create a pseudo-stereo effect. Brian Wilson didn't want a stereo mix of this album since he felt he had better control of what the listener heard in mono. Capitol released the fake stereo version to appease those listeners who owned stereo players and insisted on something to make use of it. It was also believed the multi-track masters were lost...but wait!<br /><br />The new issue of \\"Today\\" features the mono version of the album, followed by a brand new true stereo mix. No, it's not Duophonic. It'sthe real deal. And what a difference it makes! This was first tried a few years back when \\"Pet Sounds\\" got the stereo treatment to rave reviews, followed by a 4.1 surround version that was a revelation. While I don't expect the same treatment here, I'd welcome it if it happened. The remastered sound on this CD, in both mono and stereo, is amazing. But it's the stereo mix that reveals textures in the music that mono just can't reveal. It has to be heard to be appreciated. Run...don't walk to your computer to order this. One little note... I paid $13.20 for this album from Amazon, but found it also available, along with the other reissues, for $9.99 at Best Buy. Shop around to get the best price, but you do have to have this CD if you're a true fan of the Beach Boys.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|When I started reading this I really wasn't expecting all that much.  I bought the book on the strength of the rating it had received.  I found it quite hard to get into initially, but then the story took off and I was engrossed.<br /><br />I found the quality of the writing excellent and the story well crafted. There were some conventions of the genre within the book but these were very well written. What I found most enjoyable was the ability to build suspense and draw me into carry on reading to see where things would go.<br /><br />There are a number of good threads which can still run through to the next book, which I'll eagerly await!

B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie takes you through hope, sadness, surprise and gives you a glimpse of young love to boot.  Stratas of class are revealed in the cultures of both British society and Colonial India.  Actors are superb.  No cutesy aging flirting going on,  but infidelity is hinted at and a surprise romance occurs.  Those who fit the real meaning of \\"mature audience\\" would enjoy this movie.  If you want titillation,  go elsewhere.
1449410243|3.0|While The Oatmeal's original book was constant laughs from cover to cover, his second book fails to live up to expectations and I'm not sure why.<br /><br />Either due to the subject matter (all cat comics - not too compelling besides the Bobs), the fact that it seems incredibly short in comparison to the original (blew through it in about 10-15 minutes, while the original I was too busy laughing and enjoying it to read it so quickly), most of the book is old website/blog material, or just a bit of everything made this book a disappointment.<br /><br />However, it is still The Oatmeal, so it deserves a solid 3 stars.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I recently finished \\"A Feast for Crows\\". While it is far from being my favorite book of the series, I still found it to be an enjoyable read. My sense, however, is that you really have to be into the characters and the environment as a whole to feel like this book is worthwhile. Very little of high consequence happens (although there are a couple of interesting bits), but I can definitely see that Martin is setting things up for the next big chapter of the story. This is the \\"lull before the storm\\", as it were.<br /><br />After you have read the entire book Martin admits to the reader that this is only one half of what was intended to be a single book. Thus, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" covers the same time period as \\"A Feast for Crows\\", but focuses on an entirely different set of characters. I have just started this book, but the reader should be encouraged that the list of characters there are more of the \\"A List\\" variety: e.g. Tyrion, Jon, Bran.... However, I would expect that not much of consequence will happen in that book either.<br /><br />The real test of this series will be in the next edition. If you like \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" you will need to make the investment to read this and the next book. Otherwise you will have no idea what is going on....
141694737X|5.0|I bought this book for my son when he was 2.  He loved flap books.  I kept this one in the diaper bag for entertainment while we were out or while in the car.  Simple words with repetition and explaination of each animal action.  The great thing is when he turned 3 he started \\"reading\\" himself.  He memorized the book so smiled wide with the turn of each page and the lift of each flap.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan pulls it off again. He combines humor, action, and depression in this one great novel. I personally think it was the best of The Heroes of Olympus series.  Kids will love this whether they love to read or not.
B005IQZB14|3.0|This is a highly fascinating read so far. The author has some amazing experiences, and shares them all, good or bad. I like that in a true story. Where many writers avoid the tough stuff, this one puts it out there, and lets the chips fall where they may. A very human story.<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is the book has a serious case of My-itis. A sentence like this for example, \\"I took a drink of my water.\\", makes me cringe. We know you are on a hike, we know you have water, why put the ownership on it? When the words MY and I are in the same sentence together, it makes me want to rewrite the sentence. Why not simply say, \\"I had a drink of water.\\" Out of curiosity I scanned the book for the word \\"my \\", and found a whopping 2478 hits. Whereas two other books of similar size and content rendered 451, and 735. Searching on the word \\"I \\" rendered 4622 hits. That's a lot.<br /><br />Though it gets a bit daunting, I haven't stopped reading MY copy yet.
0385738773|5.0|I just finished this last book of the trilogy and loved it.  This final book is full of so much adventure, twists, surprises and thrills.  I literally gasped out loud a few times.  Just when you think they are safe or that someone is about to die...something crazy happens!  It was a really exciting ending to the series.  Though I feel like some things were still left unclear, I feel closure :)  Highly recommend to those like that like thrilling stories!
B006VGGAC4|4.0|I've followed Arnold since before he came to America. I read everything from him  and about him and I didn't realize he was such a klutz until this book.<br /><br />I think this book is as candid and detailed (in some ways too detailed) as even I thought possible.<br /><br />It's really remarkable what he's accomplished in his lifetime and it's no wonder he can at times be polarizing and controversial. He's not as refined as one would expect especially given all of the life experiences and extraordinary people he's been around which was a surprise.<br /><br />As for the affair, I'm not surprised by that at all. A man doesn't have to be good looking to be attractive and I think Arnold with his charm, charisma and star power can probably have most any woman he wants.<br /><br />I'm disappointed by his lack of discipline in that regard. He has been blessed in so many ways and he worked very hard to get where he is, why jeopardize that but he is human after all.<br /><br />Now, I hope he can get his family life back together and reconcile with Maria and behave himself the rest of his life.
B004OCCKX0|3.0|This is a great box set-the sound is probably as good as it can be, and the packaging is very well done.  The outer lidded box is a thick cardboard.  On the back is listed all the songs for all four albums-\\"The Psychedelic Sounds of Thirteenth Floor Elevators\\", \\"Easter Everywhere\\", \\"Live\\", and \\"Bull of the Woods\\".  Each disc is in a cardboard envelope that's a reproduction of both the front and back of the original album cover.  The graphics are crisp and colorful.<br /><br />The albums were remastered in 2007, and the stereo sound is much better than some previous editions.  Saying that, the \\"live\\" set (which might have been a new studio album) is still not like we'd like to hear it, but it too has been improved upon.  The 12 page booklet has an essay on the band and the era.  There's some period photographs and reproductions of concert posters which add interest.  There's also a list of all the various personnel that drifted through the band during this period.  There's a number of songs that rate higher than 3 \\"stars\\", but there's also some tunes of lesser quality, so I would rate this closer to 3 1/2 \\"stars\\".  You may feel differently-to each his own.<br /><br />I don't really know what else to say about these seminal releases that hasn't been already said.  This is late 60's period Texas psych-rock.  Erickson's visceral vocal style, combined with that strange sound from Tommy Hall's electric jug, combined with a straightforward, bare bones rhythm section, is sometimes (but not always) hard to beat.  The lead guitar of Stacy Sutherland is perfect for Erickson's songs.  His fills and lead work give the music an extra edge.  But it's Erickson's lyrics and vocals that are the main attraction-very unique-even for that era.  But together this band defined early garage/psych/rock, and turned it into a visceral sound that's still exciting to heat today.<br /><br />So if you're looking for the first four original albums (with less \\"crowd noise\\" on the \\"live\\" album), in remastered stereo sound, with a pretty cool booklet, you might want to check this out.  While the larger box sets that collect a lot of other music are fine for people who want everything, those of us who want to hear just the original albums will find this collection worth owning.remastered stereo sound, with a pretty cool booklet, you might want to check this out.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|The idea of Snow White in a non-cutesy light was a good one. However, on screen it just didn't quite work. The casting was wrong: Snow White was supposed to be fairer than the Queen, but the actress they chose just looked like she was in pain the whole time. The character development left the viewer not really caring about any of them and the focus seemed to mainly be on battles and action.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett fans will not be disappointed with this one. As with other of his books centered around the World War II era, he brings the reader face to face with the horrors of the war as experienced by the well developed characters who are interwoven into an outstanding timeline of events.  I think this is much better than the first of the trilogy, and I'm looking forward to the third.
B002ZG99NG|3.0|It's too derivative of Heat, to the point of distraction.<br />Nevertheless, The Town showcases some nailed performances - particularly the mentioned Jeremy Renner but also Affleck himself, the reliable Chris Cooper, Blake Lively, and Pete Postlethwaite - characters which anyone familiar with the neighborhoods depicted would recognize, certainly to a greater extent than, say, The Departed.<br />It is impressively constructed, production-wise and narratively, if a bit less sweeping than some of the influences it echoes (the original Thomas Crown Affair, The Friends Of Eddie Coyle, Heat, Monument Ave, Boondock Saints, The Brinks Job, even Point Break), and perhaps we should take Mr. Affleck seriously as the actual brains behind the Affleck-Damon partnership.

B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Second album completely held to expectations. Bought it the day it came out, and have listened to it a few billion times since.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|The whole series is just a bad mixture of Jane Austen and The story of O.....romantic beautiful and rich man with a little bit of (not so kinky) sex....I think it was made just for earning money quickly, and the author succeeded. Today people mostly read if it is about sex, and it sold the story....it is meant for younger people that haven't read a lot in their lives, so they think it is very amusing and interesting, but for us that have a lot of reading miles it is just another bad series of books. I bought it because everybody talked about it, the first book dissapointed me, but I bought the second hoping it will get better. I bought the third because I was interested about the development of this (lame) story. And I am sorry. It is not a lot of money, but the series definitely doesn't deserve it.

B00846REIS|4.0|At first I assumed it would be a knock off of fifty shades of grey from the other reviews however after reading the book it has some similarities but not the same. I enjoyed the book and can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a good book, just not the book I liked the most, which is he second book. It does tie the trilogy up nicely, though
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just finished the book and didn't delay in writing this because I don't want to wait till the emotions pass.  This book brought out so many emotions that I can't really explain.  Gideon Cross has to be the MOST intriguing, confusing, committed, obsessed, emotional, sexiest, dedicated and deepest character I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with in a book.  I just can't get enough of him.  His love for Eva is just unparalleled.  He said it, he would do anything, he would kill for her, he breathes each breath for her.  AMAZING.  I have to be honest and say that Eva was getting on my last nerve through much of this book because, of course she had no idea of the behind the scenes details, she just could never give him the benefit of the doubt.  Seemed she could only distrust him at every turn.  While he gave her so much to distrust, I felt that she maybe could at least believe in what he constantly said about the depth of his feelings for her and his commitment to never be without her.  I know Eva was a mess in her own right, but I still wanted to wring her neck many times.  The book causes a lot of angst and anxiety with all the ups and downs they suffered through, and I have to admit that I actually had to stop partially through it and find comfort in some \\"lighter reading\\", by reading another book,  but there was no doubt that this book blew me away and made me feel things I've never felt before whole reading a  book.  Congrats to Sylvia Day for an incredible book that apparently from the reviews, everyone is fully enjoying.  Can't wait to see how it plays out in the next book.
B008G12ERC|2.0|Full disclosure - I've been a big fan of Muse's since the early 2000's when I picked up an imported copy of Origin of Symmetry.  So perhaps you might dismiss this as me grumbling about Muse evolving away from their earlier sound, but I thoroughly enjoyed the band's growth up through Black Holes and Revelations.  However, the Resistance included some troubling signs that the band was starting to become a bit too self-indulgent in their sound.<br /><br />I'm not going to belabor the point, but I find most albums that are breathlessly recommended by people who tell you to \\"listen to it with headphones on so that you can appreciate the full brilliance of the technical accomplishment\\" to be boring, overwrought, and ultimately not that good.<br /><br />I'm not a music snob - I like music that moves you, and that connects with you emotionally in some way.  Muse's earlier albums were big and bombastic and in your face and they rocked in a way that bands don't rock any more.  I don't like technical accomplishments of composition and production that don't still manage to connect with you emotionally.  Resistance was a jumble of decent to good songs, and boring, forgettable \\"new-Muse\\" songs.  The 2nd Law is nearly entirely forgettable, and there's not one song off the album that moves me, or inspires me to give it multiple listens.<br /><br />I fully expect that bands have to evolve over time, and that this will alienate some of their listeners.  Unfortunately, Muse has evolved away from a band that embraces big riffs and big sound to a band that has created boring, forgettable songs.  I hope that they can recover from this, like U2 recovered from their Zooropa/Pop misadventures.

B00590679E|5.0|Finally they got it right with the new recently released deluxe catalog of Jesus & Mary Chain.<br />I wasn't a fan of the previous release, the dual disc sets as it's easy to scratch one side of a disc and that could affect both sides since the label acts as a protective cover for the cd.<br />Now it seems more are taking the cues from Suede, their catalog has been the finest deluxe treatments yet,  each of the sets come with the full<br />album on disc 1, filled with b sides and demos from disc 1 to 2. The brits loved b-sides so there's always plenty of that action.<br />The 3rd disc is tv appearances and music videos.  Although, unlike the Suede sets, it would've been nice to include a complete concert of the band<br />during it's heyday.<br />The set is better on these than ever before, well since the vinyl came out at least.<br />Well done and more need to come out in this format !
0061928356|4.0|I enjoyed this book and recommend it. It's told as two stories that come together at the end. I was fascinated by the part taking place in India, where the characters were very well developed, complex, and interesting. I had no idea what would happen in the Indian side of the story, so it kept me riveted. I didn't like the American side of the story nearly as much. Those characters seemed very two dimensional -- very whiney and unlikeable. I found myself skimming the American part of the story to get back to the Indian scenes. But it gave me something interesting to read for a few days.

Overall this album is great, on a per-song basis as well as a whole album. I find myself listening to the whole thing instead of just choosing a song or two that I enjoy. If you liked their previous album, Babel should be a sure thing for you.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|REFLECTED IN YOU  (Crossfire #2) by Sylvia Day<br /><br />REFLECTED IN YOU is the second storyline (October 2012 release) in Sylvia Day's erotic romance Crossfire series.  Gideon and Eva's relationship continues its' sexually charged and frighteningly obsessive climb until there is no place left to go but into the abyss.  The roller coaster of emotions is blatantly palpable but our hero's frenetic change between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde will give you the same whiplash as the storyline's heroine.  Reflected in You continues at the same point in which we left off in Bared To You.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's relationship is built on a mutual need.  The sexual energy is highly charged and there is rarely a moment when the couple is not engaged is some sort of act.  Their need for each other seems to overwhelm their daily lives so that at any moment they could be caught in the act.  But great sex isn't always enough and Eva will learn that first hand when Gideon begins to pull away. Even couple's therapy isn't working when one-half of the pair refuses to admit the truth.<br /><br />Eva's best friend and roommate Caryhas sworn to Eva to clean up his act but will find himself the victim of Eva's past..  Hoping to take Eva away for a weekend for two, Gideon all but kidnaps Eva for some R&R pledging himself to her for all eternity.  But Gideon is hiding a secret and Eva begins to believe that whatever is pulling him away, has something to do with his past.  His inability to confide the truth to Eva will plant the seeds of mistrust and jealousy will rear its' head when Eva finds Gideon in pubic with his ex-fiance.  Thinking two can play at that game, Eva embarks on a series of lunches that will push Gideon Cross over the edge.<br /><br />Gideon's nightmares once again play a major role in the development of mistrust between the couple. His refusal to open his heart to the woman who has fallen in love with him, will begin to form a barrier that will grow larger every time he withdraws and refuses to acknowledge his past. When Gideon is ready, Eva may not be around to hear the truth.<br /><br />Eva's past will eventually catch on two levels.  A former flame will come to town hoping to reconnect, but a young age, she acted defiantly and stupid, and does not want to revisit the past.  But Eva's nightmares return as well, and in true thriller fashion, her nightmares will become real.  As Gideon continues to pull away, Eva comes to the realization that perhaps her past was too difficult for Gideon and, that alone, would shatter the confidence she has been rebuilding for so many years.  Perhaps she was meant to be alone after all.<br /><br />REFLECTED IN YOU is an amazing ride of emotional ups and downs.  Sylvia Day has taken two broken souls and thrown them together into what can only be called a tsunami of gut wrenching waves of sorrow and pain.  This couple is utterly wrong for each other and yet utterly right.  Eva grounds Gideon's personality quirks as well as his heart.  Reflected in You will leave you wondering when a secondary storyline draws attention to Eva's past and the investigation lands on everyone's front door.<br /><br />see all of my reviews at : thereadingcafe.comthdraws and refuses to acknowledge his past.

So often we get off track and walking the Pacific Crest Trail was a way to remember and analyze her life. A very good read and I would recommend it to everyone.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was well written and had an easy to follow plot. I did struggle with Abby's character at times and her stubbornness/immaturity. Overall, a good read and I will be looking forward to the next book from Travis' point of view.
0439023521|5.0|Seen the movie, had to read the book. The book is better, although, the movie was good enough to make me want to read the book. So I have to read the the next one.
0316069884|5.0|I decided to become a vegetarian (toward vegan) after having read the book. I also buy extra copies and give away to my friends who care about their health or animal right. The writing is smooth and makes me easy to digest, even though it's sort of a heavy subject!<br /><br />  I believe that everybody has the right to know where his/her food comes from and the impact of his/her health.<br /><br />  Strongly recommend!
B00884GR0W|5.0|BEST BUY EVER!!!!(besides my kindle) .this game us amazing i could go on and on but im not cause u wouldnt read it all.A MUST HAVE FOR PPL WHO LOVE MINCRAFT!!have fun w/ thus app i play it every day for like 3 hours.the only thing i dont like is u keep having to make ur own pickaxes like u dont just make one and keep it forever like minecraft u have to constantly make them but oh well.BEST GAME EVER FOR KINDLE FIRE!!
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I thought this was a great musical - but you probably have to be a fan of the music genre to really appreciate it. The movie doesn't cater to everyone and that's what's great - there's sex, drugs, and of course R&R - and its a lighthearted throwback or homage to that time. The remixes of the songs are great: take two classic rock tracks and meld them together and the outcome is perfect for most of the songs.<br /><br />The cast does a great job - especially Baldwin and Cruise.  I don't really care much for Russell Brand, but he was alright too.
B0081GWXPA|3.0|I have read this book several times since high school (thanks Mrs. Wilson) and decided to purchase an electronic copy for my kindle.  For the most part the translation is okay.  but there are a few wrong words that are just hard to over look and it kind of pulls you out of the story. I know that sounds weird for those of you that have read the little prince but yeah, it does.<br /><br />Anyway, read the book.  Everyone should read this. Especially those of you that really get bogged down in their jobs.  Great way to reset. :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Super fun and addictive....just like the fair and it's FREE!!! Go ahead and download it * you won't be sorry.
1416585710|5.0|As always this book is a typical Stephen King but with a twist.  This actually is a love story which is something I have never found in any of his books before.  It certainly doesn't detract from the story but is just an exception to the normal books he has written.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the little clicky noise. Easy to use game. Moves the cards for you. Good options. Ads aren't too bad.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King is my favorite author and I have been reading his books from the beginning.  I do not own a Kindle but was allowed to read this short book on the internet.  As with all of his books this one is a great one.
B004GYY714|5.0|Very impressive! You can hear different radio stations from over the world. I enjoyed very much and the variation of music. If I don't like one station, I find another one.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I love this game but after the last update it wont work! I am so sad I got almost to level 40 but should have expected it since the first time it updated it did the same thing and I had to start over
B000SW2ETU|5.0|Love this show! I am caught up on all seasons now and I miss watching one every day.  Sunday is to long of a wait!
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I don't need to add much to all the reviews here.  I just want to say that, in my opinion, this is the best movie of the MI series, staying truest to the original tv series.  The story is complex, intriguing and very taut. The action is fast-paced and sufficiently used, without overpowering the story flow (whereas with MI 2, the action sequences overshadowed the story). There is even some lighthearted wit and humor interwoven into the intense drama and thriller of the story. A second best in this series would be MI 3, which also stayed true to the series' integrity. The first MI movie (with Jon Voight) is good, but lacks the cohesive structure of its sequals. I think these movies get better with each attempt and new story. I hope they plan to make a fifth MI movie.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I'm a Dylan fan,  but I prefer his later stuff to most of his early folk music. UNPLUGGED is my favorite album, but TEMPEST is a close second.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Per the title, The Adjustment Bureau is a secret organization of men in suits and hats who, while remaining unseen and unobserved, \\"control\\" the timeline of fate for everyone... making adjustments in reality to steer the course of each individual's daily life.  It's a far-fetched idea made very believable and interesting by the makers of this movie.  The story itself surrounds the life of a congressman (Matt Damon) and his eventual meeting and romance with a dancer (Emily Blunt) which - according to The Adjustment Bureau - was never supposed to happen.  Once Damon uncovers the existence of The Adjustment Bureau, and learns of their plans, he gradually out-manuevers them in order to be with Blunt, despite their efforts to keep them apart. It's a unique and intriguing story with excellent performances by all the actors... particularly by Damon... one of his best roles.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Its a good app with a wide variety of peaceful sounds that honestly help me sleep at night I would reccomend it to other people a must get
B00634GHJA|4.0|great app that does what it says. you can use it to move pics from your phone to your tablet. it is fun.
B0037RDPEG|1.0|Normally, even if I hate a book, I have to finish it but Eat, Pray, Love was an exception. Terrible! So pissed that I wasted my money on it. We chose it for our book club one month because none of us had read it before, well we soon found out there was a good reason for this. The only positive thing about the part of the book I actually read was a few lines about life, depression and happiness that were well written but the rest was rubbish. Never again will I read something that Oprah has recommended. Of course she would love this book because she is a rich woman who could also easily drop everything and go on a journey to discover happiness if she so desired. Don't waste your money people! I have never written a negative review and I hope I never have to again because it doesn't feel very nice :(
B004LWZW7O|1.0|The premise was interesting ... the screenplay and writing were really poor. Frankly a boring, predictable movie. And its \\"in your face\\" attack on capitalism got old real quick. \\"Rich people are bad, and steal from poor people\\". \\"Poor people are victims and are only poor because the rich steal from them\\". The theme got tiring after 10 minutes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i'm in middle school so it has just what i need from negitive numbers to adding. i recommend this to everyone!!!!! LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!!!!
0812992784|2.0|I was disappointed to find that this is a remarkably dull book. Which is surprising, because the story is riveting. How the author managed to take that riveting story and turn it into such a boring recitation is difficult for me to understand. You've heard the cliche about a book being so enthralling that the reader couldn't put it down. Well, I could hardly make myself pick this one up. It just never pulled me in.
0345803493|5.0|The second book in the 50 shades trilogy was my absolute FAVORITE.  It combined enough of the crazy, wild writing that was found in Book 1 with enough of the happily ever after moments that make you fall in love with Christian Grey!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent follow up to Bared to You.  The author gives us a deeper understanding of each character, especially Eva and Gideon.  Loved it.  Finished it in a week!
0345803507|5.0|Out of all of the books this would be ranked number two on my list, with the 2nd book being my favorite.  This book was way to \\"mushy\\" for me.  The second book had the perfect balance of craziness that you expect to find in the 50 shades series, with enough happy moments to make you want to find your own Christian Grey.  I must say books two and three were my favorites.  I wish there was more! The last part of the book, the from Christians perspective needs to be turned into a book itself!
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Lonerism is even better than Innerspeaker (and that was a phenomenal album). Great from start to finish, this might be the best album of 2012 and well worth the wait. All the distorted synthesizers and heavier effects give them a way more expansive sound. \\"Music To Walk Home By\\" and \\"Keep On Lying\\" are two of my favorites, but there's honestly not a bad track on the whole thing having listened to it all the way through several times already. It sounds like it could've been released in the late 60's yet still sounds fresh and new somehow. Check out the animated video for \\"Elephant\\" and the Todd Rundgren remix of it. The video is amazing! Psychedelic elephants!!!
6305537321|4.0|Great digital remaster of the classic movie.  The movie is good quality.  I enjoyed watching the old time movie.  It helps me slow down when I watch it, especially since all of the movie and life itself these days are so fast paced.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Excellent read - 5 Stars!<br /><br />Layken hated being uprooted from the only home she knew after her dad unexpectedly passed away. She hated it, that is, until she caught sight of the new neighbor. And if seeing him wasn't enough, their amazing first date definitely put her in a state of loving her new home. The only thing better than the date was the goodnight kiss that sealed the attraction and her \\"I love Michigan\\" outlook.<br /><br />The end? Hardly... That is only the beginning.<br /><br />Starting school is tough on anyone, especially when it happens to be the last year of high school. Imagine being confronted with a truth that brings your new found happiness to a screeching halt. A realization that could jeopardize a family's future if anyone finds out about a blooming romance. Layken's first impression was right - this new home is for the birds.<br /><br />The end? Hardly... We're just warming the engine.<br /><br />Can Layken and her boy-next-door, Will, be able to resist temptation? Will their brief but intense leave everyone intact and unscathed? Or will their time together leave a path of destruction?<br /><br />The end? Hardly... You'll just have to read to find out!<br /><br />This novel \\"Slammed\\" me into a tidal wave of emotions! There were so many points at which I laughed out loud, cried, and swooned. I truly cannot think of a single aspect that I didn't like about this book - the characters nearly jumped off the page with life; the dialog was natural and real feeling; the story flowed flawlessly. And one of the best parts of the book? The poetry and song lyrics that were sprinkled throughout - absolutely beautifully crafted!<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Hoover for creating such a spectacular read! (less)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so pointless but so addicting! I get so excited when I collect prizes and puzzle pieces.  when my infant wakes me up multiple times a night to eat I pull out my tablet and play at like 4am and throughout the day at work lol love it
B000I14UTS|5.0|for 40 years this been one of my favorites, loved it then love it now. her mother was super and so is she. five stars.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesome!  I love this game. I can't wait for more. Levels. I how about p &amp; f showing up or maybe candace
B008LY9AWG|3.0|If you've read the other two triple-(very)-short-story ebooks our famous writer Connelly has released over the last year or so, \\"Angle of Investigation\\" and \\"Suicide Run\\", you will probably agree that \\"Dive\\" is similar in price and value received. This time the tales do NOT feature the author's long time leading man LAPD detective Harry Bosch, but rather are just three quite short but unrelated suspenseful little yarns, usually with a twist at the end for added interest. We enjoyed them while they lasted, but don't look for more than a 20- or 30-minute pastime herein.
B003QSMC18|1.0|Aside from boring, had things I find objectionable especially for a kids movie. It had voodoo and just downright boting
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I have to say I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would. it was challenging and fun. I look forward to the updates and more floors.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|This movie in no way, shape or form resembles the original Dark Shadows.  What a huge disappointment.  What a wasted effort.  I was willing to accept it on its own terms, but it fails even there.  The comedy isn't funny, and the drama is watered down.  The original series told some wonderful stories but was hampered by a crushing schedule and miniscule budget.  Ah.. what might have been. :(
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|The 3D rendering of this movie is not that great.  I have several top 3D blu-rays as reviewed by Keith Niemeyer which are much better.  Even though Prometheus was shot with a 3D camera, the depth of field just isn't very apparent in most live-action shots.  The occasional object thrown into the foreground seems forced and is often more distracting than integral into the overall scene.  Disappointingly devoid of significant 3D effect are the opening scenes of the planet's landscape and the landing approach of Prometheus.  The 3D effects are most evident in scenes with CGI such as the mapping of the tunnels as shown on the bridge of the Prometheus and text overlays.  Still, for $5 more than the basic blu-ray version of this movie, I would say this 4-disk version is preferred:  both for the 3D disk and for the special features disk.
B0090XOJAA|5.0|I purchased this version which Amazon has listed as a French Import Version two weeks ago when it was released in France and Canada. Although I enjoyed some of Mika's earlier hits,I have never bought any of his work before until now.<br /><br />What an album! Intelligent and well produced tracks spanning dance, rock and pop. His voice is much more toned down (gone are the high pitched notes) and I think you can now better appreciate its true beauty.<br /><br />Here is a listing of the French/ Canada version as it appears in the 2 cd format which I strongly recommend for the alternate and remixed tracks.<br /><br />Cd 1 - (NOTE: For cd 1 Tracklisting for U.S. version will be the same except Elle Me Dit is replaced by Make You Happy Miami Edit)<br /><br />1 - Origin of Love (a future hit single - pop music at its finest)<br />2 - Lola<br />3- Stardust (another future hit produced by famed DJ Benny Benassi)<br />4- Make You Happy (already released as a single and there is an official video)<br />5 - Underwater - (needs to be released - great ballad)<br />6 - Overrated<br />7 - Kids<br />8 - Love You When I'm Drunk<br />9- Step With Me (another favourite and possible future single)<br />10 - Popular Song<br />11 - Emily (This is the English version of the French megahit Elle Me Dit)<br />12-  Heroes<br />13- Celebrate (The first single and there is an official video)<br />14 -Elle Me Dit<br /><br />CD 2<br />1 - Karen - French ballad<br />2 - L'Amour Dans Le Mauvais Temps<br />3 - Un Soleil Mal Lune<br />4- Make You Happy (Cherokee Remix)<br />5 - Celebrate (Robbie Rivera remix)*** This track will be on the U.S. Deluxe<br />6 -Elle Me Dit (BeatauCue remix)<br />7-Make You Happy (L.A. Edit)<br />8 - Tah Dah *** This track will be on U.S. version<br /><br />CD 2 will see the greatest changes. Instead of the French songs, you will have acoustic versions of \\"Origin of Love\\" , \\"Celebrate\\", \\"Kids\\", \\"Overrated\\" and \\"Love You When I'm Drunk\\" You will also have an incredible remix of \\"Stardust\\"<br /><br />I have decided to buy both versions owing to the strength of the songs. Whether remixed, original or acoustic, the songs have a distinctive feel and you will want to have all the different versions.
0316228532|4.0|Instead of presenting the struggle between good and evil in a realm somewhere between reality and fantasy, Rowling confronts us with the world or our own making wherein our choices determine the fabric of our present society. This makes for uncomfortable reading, as upon honest reflection we see a glimmer of ourselves and neighbors in her characters. The story is firmly set in England, yet the plight of each person surely has a worldwide counterpart. The citizens of Pagford and Yarvil seem incapable of honest self-reflection. It is only when faced with tragic interconnected situations, that may have been averted if they hadn't been so self-centered, do they pause to think beyond themselves...yet some still fail to perceive.<br /><br />The story held my interest throughout, although at times I was wondering why or if I cared enough for Pagford or Yarvil to keep reading. Somewhat of a morbid fascination drew me on. I am glad I read to the end, which justifies the storyline and reinforces Rowling's message of the connection of all to all, while managing to leave the reader with a lump in the throat, a sense of hope and guarded optimism. In the end we are left with the knowledge that the nobles in Pagford can and should do more for the commoners in Yarvil--clearly the author's humanitarian intent.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|I knew Conan wasn't going to blow me away, but I did assume that a 2011 production would have decent enough story and effects to make it worth my time.  WRONG.  The main plot is thin and goes nowhere - truly nowhere - and the action is inconsistent and terrible.  Free was too expensive for this wasted of two hours.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It was the best hidden mystery games! Loved it! Kept me going!<br />I would highly recommend this game! Can not wait for the next one!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I thought their first album was amazing and this may even be better. The lyrics, vocals, instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time I listen.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|it was a fun read,but i was sort of unimpressed with (spoiler allert) 1 of the villians.i take my villains very seriously and 1 was just too silly.it may b because i am a teenage girl and it is not directed at my age gruip.however,i still love this series.this book made me laugh out loud at times.Rioron rocks.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Stunning visuals finally something that outshines avatar in the looks department. A few plot holes but still one of the best movies in years.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Zafon is so good that I not only completely enjoyed The Prisoner of Heaven, but I also remembered why I loved Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game so much.  I wanted to read them again and I will.  And I will enjoy them even more for having read The Prisoner of Heaven.<br /><br />Where to start?<br /><br />The writing:  lyrical and vivid don't do Zafon's skill justice.  They are just words.  My words.  Sort of like someone giving you a brush and the exact colors that Degas used to paint a masterpiece.  A nice start, but you won't get there.  I will just say that very, very few writers have ever painted a picture like Zafon does.  Old school, classical, timeless, beautiful.  I feel lucky to have his books to read.<br /><br />The characters:  Dickens and Dumas would love these characters.  They are complex, endearing, vivid...alive.  Brimming with humor and menace, they leap off the page.  It just doesn't get any better.<br /><br />World building:  you and feel the damp and smell the aroma of Barcelona.  You can't get closer without a time machine.<br /><br />Tone and style:  Gothic with a sense of humor and rapier wit.  You will run out of note cards on which to copy quotes.  I really feel that Mr. Zafon is a modern Dumas.  What is it about these Spanish writers (also thinking of Arturo Perez Reverte) that makes them so good?  They are throw-backs in such a good way.  Every time I read them I feel that someone discovered a great lost Dumas novel in their attic.<br /><br />Story:  seamlessly weaving into the prior books, it made me want to re-read them just to experience them again in light of this wonderful new story that provides both a present story and a back story to a central character---so the action both follows AND predates the other books.  Don't be afraid to read them out of order, but you really should start with Shadow of the Wind as it really sets the whole Zafon world in motion.  My only gripe?  I was done too fast.  You fly through Zafon's books andwhile it was a satisfying story, I wanted more.  He is the only writer that I can think of that I wish every book that he wrote was 1,000 pages long.<br /><br />He may not be to everyone's taste, but if you like gothic, atmospheric, old style dark adventures; if you really love Dumas; if you love to visit vast, ancient cities and meet characters both sinister and angelic, then you will love Zafon's books.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|A lot of redundant scenarios which makes it sometimes confusing.  It all pulls together in the end but it's slow going and makes you want to skip long descriptive passages.  I wouldn't recommend it if you like a fast paced read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a big reader but this kept my attention. I couldn't put it down. I read all three books within a week. Very recommended
0805095535|4.0|MY THOUGHTS<br />LOVED IT<br /><br />The recounting of one's life is a difficult thing to attempt, so Paul Auster uses the second person YOU in almost every sentence, which at first thought, seems like a horrible idea.  The writing is so fluid and remarkable that it won't bother you and you will wonder why no one else writes this way.  You will not want to put this book down once you start.  You will find that recounting ages and street addresses to catalogue memories is the best thing in the world.<br /><br />So, I got a little bit carried away there, but I was in awe of the stories Auster recounts, those little bits of details that almost everyone remembers like your first dog, childhood traumas, your first love and apartments.  I think I related to this book because of my age. I wonder how younger readers will react to remembrances that are universal to anyone over fifty. The book is more details linked together by age rather than a complete story of his life.<br /><br />Perhaps the most truthful and touching story in the book is his recounting of an auto accident that almost took his wife's life.  He builds up to this part by explaining what a perfect driver he is, but then lets you in on a little secret.  He has been having panic attacks and is now on medication, which in part, may be to blame for his risky driving where he turns in front of a van.  You can see his grief and hurt as his daughter and dog are safe but his wife may be gravely injured.  I really enjoyed this one and all of the touching moments he retells.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|If anyone knows who Amanda Seyfried is, then they should know \\"Mean Girls,\\" \\"Dear John,\\" \\"Boogie Woogie,\\" etc....  She has always played a realistic role.  However in this movie, fairytale was set loose, and she just did not live up to the character she tried to protray.<br />I have nothing but love for Amanda, and I love the fact that we share the same last name and she is now a leading actress.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Mahjong Deluxe[[ASIN:B006BDHAX0 Mahjong Deluxe HD]] has given many hours of fun! Never had any problem. I have tried other Mahjong games but this is my favorite.)
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest. with this app you candle basic browsing and pinning, pretty much anything. but mine has frozen a few times which can be annoying. otherwise its awesome<br /><br />cant beat free!
B002PEP4C8|5.0|What a chilling tale!  She does such a GREAT job making you see what she's going through and feel what she is feeling...This was hard to put down!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Great Blu-Ray DVDs set from this wonderful TV series.  Worth every penny. I have already watched the first half of this season.
B001974DG0|5.0|I am addicted to Koontz novels, but this one is amazing. Of course I think the same of Strangers, and so many others. He makes it very hard to pick one favorite.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I love a good quick read, this is my second book by this author, I really like his writing style! His characters are easy to get into, and believable. There were 1 or 2 typos, not really enough to even mention. I'm on my way to the amazon bookstore now to hopefully find another book by this author.
B008N1V11U|4.0|its soooooooo freaking fun I love it but one problem its $7.00 that's redickuluse I speller it wrong but who cares well any way that is expensive .I don't think any one would buy it after what happen when people went to see it at that movie and that bazare shoting happen. lets take a moment of silence :-)
B006LSZECO|1.0|This novel starts out very slow. The only thing that kept me reding was the language, which I thought was thoughtful and interesting. I certainly didn't care about the characters. About halfway through the book, the characters became so outrageous, and there were so many twists that it became a joke. I hated both these characters for their shallowness. The only reason I completed reading the book is that I am in a book club and I had to discuss it.
0307352145|5.0|Quiet is a book for those interested in the idea of introverts in an extroverted world.  This book will make you aware of your own introverted tendencies.  Everyone can be classified to some degree as an introvert or extrovert.  Some fall under the extremes of each characterization and most others fall somewhere within the spectrum.  It is important to realize whether you are mainly introverted or extroverted because it will shape every aspect of your personality and your life.  This book discusses three aspects of personality; how people become introverted/extroverted, what tendencies you have as an I/E, and how you can maximize both your personal and work life by finding your sweet spot.  People can display a wide range of personality traits on the spectrum, but everyone has their comfort zone.  Those who operate most in their comfort zone will maximize their happiness and interactions with others.<br /><br />I personally found this book fascinating because deep down I consider myself an introvert trying to be as extroverted as possible in a world that never stops demanding it.  The author found herself in the same situation and describes how introverts play a crucial role in society and we shouldn't always strive to change our introverted ways.  Many of the characteristics and traits the author describes about introverts fit me to a T.  The point of the book is that in a world where we increasingly value extroverts, we should take a step back and realize the value of those who are quiet, listen, and take time to deeply analyze the world around them.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|It is incredible to me that the Writer/Director was able send tackle such a subject and deliver flawlessly. All you have to do is open up your mind and listen.
1416594795|5.0|Let the arguments end with this!<br /><br />For anyone out there that still needs proof of evolution, here it is.  Dawkins is famous for his very strong opinions, especially about religion.  This book does not focus on religion at all.  Instead, he uses this book as a pure explanation of evolutionary proofs and a history of evolutionary work directed at the doubters.  In many of his other books he makes some arguments for evolution, but here he dedicates the entire book to proving evolution once and for all.  This is his one book that you can look to if you need an all-encompassing proof of evolution.  So whenever you have a friend or family member that tells you they do not believe in evolution, you can point them to this book.  Today, it's not a matter of believing or disbelieving; rather, it's a matter of being informed vs. ignorant.<br /><br />Dawkins can get a bit feisty at times and you may feel as though he is talking down to you for being an ignorant buffoon.  But, if you can open your mind, looks at the facts, and think about the arguments he presents, then you will be better for the experience.  To be a well-informed member of society about evolution you must read this book.  It is no longer acceptable in today's day and age to continue to ignorantly refute evolution.  This is an important issue because science classes in private and public schools are affected by people's opinions on the topic.  To deny children the ability to learn about evolution in school is like denying them the ability to learn physics or math.<br /><br />All in all, this is a must read.  Anyone who still doubts or denies evolution needs to read this to change their mind.  Anyone who wants facts to help them prove the theory of evolution to their friends, family, or coworkers needs to read this book.  This book will give you the necessary ammunition to fire at the doubters and nonbelievers.  Anyone who can make it through this book will be wiser for the experience.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much, but at times the plot was a little weak. The story seemed a little campy, but still was a fun read.
1451648537|5.0|I want to tell the world to read this book.  I've read a handful of biographies in the past, but this one takes the cake. Steve Jobs lead one of the most creative, successful, and badass lives anyone could imagine.  Imagine if your first job out of school was creating and running a company, and the only job you held throughout the rest of your life was basically the same thing.  Then imagine that nearly everything you touch turns to gold.  As I write this review, Apple just became the world's most valuable company of all time (not adjusted for inflation).  That's quite the legacy and business model he left for his company.  And that's not including the legacy he left for Pixar, one of Disney's gems nowadays.<br /><br />This is an amazing life and story told by one of the best story writers in the business.  I don't think anyone else could have made this book such a page turner.  Even during the slower parts about Steve's personal life, kids, girlfriends, etc., Isaacson kept me along for the ride.<br /><br />This book will give you an extra appreciation of Jobs, Apple, the Macintosh, and in a larger sense the history of computers and personal technology.  Steve Jobs came along with just the right knowledge, attitude, and charisma to become arguably the world's most successful entrepreneur and CEO.  Sure he had a lot of help along the way, including Wozniak in the beginning, but you will gain a great appreciation for his brilliance as you go through his life.  Hearing the stories about Jobs' crazy side, his brilliance, and even his brutal insults makes you wish you could have worked with him.  It makes me wish I was more of a badass in my own career and gives me something to aspire to.<br /><br />Overall, if you love technology, iPhones, iPads, computers in general, biographies, CEOs, or anything similar, this is a must read.  I listened to it on audio book and loved it.  It was over 29 hours long, but I had no problem polishing it off in less than a month.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child never fails to grab your attention and keep you enthralled through out the read. I like that Reacher is showing his age, he's been around a long time!
0525953728|2.0|I listened to this one as soon as possible on audio book.  When I heard about this book in late August I marked the release date on my calendar.  Sadly, the book was a let down.  I wanted and expected the entire book to be about the raid on Osama's hide out in Pakistan, but it was not.  I bought into the hype and hysteria about this author divulging military secrets and info.  The book was neither exciting nor informative.  Two thirds of the book is dedicated to the author's background and Navy SEAL training.  The training details are interesting to a certain extent, but I found myself yawning and forcing myself to listen onward.  When he finally gets to the Bin Laden ambush, he doesn't do a great job describing the situation.  Not going to say anything more about this one.  This book would be better off as a movie, and I'm sure it will be some day soon.
B000BTJDGC|1.0|Read the other One Star reviews -- they trash this film and deservedly so.<br /><br />Let me review it from the legal end.  The court room drama is bogus.  It doesn't matter if the real story took place in Germany, or \\"based on\\" in America -- legal procedure does not work as portrayed.  For example, the judge scolds the defense attorney in open court for being late.  That is grounds to request a mistrial (which would be denied) and later used as one of the issues on appeal.  The judge would have called both attorneys to the bench and quietly told them if either one was late they would be held in contempt of court.  By scolding the attorney in front of the jury -- which would not have been called in until both attorneys were present -- it sends a message to the jury that the judge is anti-defense attorney.<br /><br />More than likely some of the jurors were christian and maybe catholic.  (A good defense attorney would have made sure at least 4 of the jurors were catholic in an attempt to hang the jury.)  The D.A. does everything he can to insult the priest -- thereby insulting the jurors christian beliefs.  Even if the jurors don't believe in the priest's exorcism rites, they do believe in Christianity.  The D.A. has made himself unlikeable to the jury.  He shows the priest no respect and thereby the Christians of the jury no respect.<br /><br />(It is not uncommon for a jury to side with the attorney they like, regardless of the facts of the case.)<br /><br />A doctor who can help the defense approaches the defense attorney and says he will testify for the priest.  He is the key that will set the priest free.  What does the defense attorney tell him?  Come to court tomorrow morning!  The first thing she would have done is that night take his deposition in the presence of an attorney from the D.A.s office.  Then when he was killed, she could have entered that document into evidence.  A document does not carry the weight of live testimony with a jury, but it does witha Court of Appeals.  So, the doctor is accidentally killed and she has no great witness nor a document of his testimony.<br /><br />Half way into the trial, she discovers that she needs an M.D. who can rebut the states M.D.!  Excuse me, she would have deposed this M.D. prior to the trial -- she would have known exactly what his testimony was going to be.  Prior to the trial she would have lined up at least 3 M.D.s to rebut the states witness.  She would not wait to the last minute and have the light bulb go off in her head.<br /><br />And she tells her associate -- during the trial -- that she knows nothing about exorcisms. So the two of them get a stack of books to study -- and she's due back into court the next morning!  In other words, she did not prepare for the trial.  She works for a huge law firm.  This is a high-profile case.  Everyone in that firm would have contributed to making her defense.<br /><br />Out of desperation, she reads a book authored by an \\"expert\\" in exorcisms.  And what do you know -- the expert is available to testify.  But the expert can only testify as to what people of faith believe exorcisms to be, not if the priest performed a correct exorcism, or if an exorcism was even necessary.  And this is where the D.A. dropped the ball -- he could have (in a polite way) shredded this witness.  He only asked a couple of non-relevant questions.<br /><br />And finally, the defense attorney gives the worst closing argument in the history of jurisprudence.  Rent the film just to watch that closing argument.  She deliberately makes the case for the D.A.  She continually repeats all the strong points of his case, and underlines the weaknesses of her case.  She concludes by saying to effect, \\"Hey maybe there are demons -- I don't believe in them -- but the priest did, so you should give him the benefit of the doubt and set him free.\\"<br /><br />The priest has grounds for appeal based upon his attorney giving up on his defense and surrendering to the D.A., and her lack of preparedness for trial.  He was definitely not represented by a competent attorney.  She should be disbarred.
1439110123|5.0|The Prize and The Quest are the only resources you will ever need if you want to understand the history and current state of oil and how it affects the world.  Oil is far and away the most important commodity on the planet and as the supply changes, so too do the world's economies.  If you are angry about the price you pay for a gallon of gasoline at the pumps, give these books a read to understand why the price is so high instead of complaining about greedy oil companies.  Oil companies have literally nothing to do with the price of a gallon of gasoline.  The real things you can blame are oil traders around the globe, OPEC and Middle East instability, rising demand from China and other developing countries, global supply/demand, potential terrorist or natural threats to supplies, and others.  The real issue is that we in the U.S. aren't paying enough for a gallon of gasoline. That same gallon in Norway costs $10.12 as of August 2012.  We would do well as a nation to actually increase gasoline taxes, thereby bringing in much needed dollars to decrease the national deficit and decreasing our demand and need for foreign oil.<br /><br />The Prize is the first book by Dan Yergin, a world renowned energy and oil expert.  It tells the history of the oil and gas industry from its meager days supplying kerosene for lanterns in the Northeast U.S. to arguably the largest industry in the world.  Working for an oil and gas company gives me a great appreciation for the history of oil and how companies like ConocoPhillips came into being.  The history of oil has done more to shape the history of the world than the average person would ever guess.<br /><br />The Quest acts as a sequel to The Prize.  In this book, Yergin continues the tale of how oil is shaping the modern world.  Since The Prize came out in 1993, much has happened in the world of oil.  In fact, arguably more has happened in the last 20 years to change the oil industry than occurred in the previous 150 years.<br /><br />These books are a must read if you want to understand the world economy and the energy challenges we face in the very near future.  Expensive oil seems to be here to stay.  The global economy is so intertwined that supply shortages across the globe can affect every aspect of our lives here in the U.S.  Hopefully the underlying message that people take away is the importance of U.S. energy independence or at least near independence.  With the reserves of shale oil, oil sands, natural gas, etc. in the U.S. and Canada, we finally have the opportunity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, especially from the Middle East, Venezuela, Nigeria, and other unstable countries.  We just need lawmakers to get out of the way.  Maybe they should consider reading these books.br />These books are a must read if you want to understand the world economy and the energy challenges we face in the very near future.

B000W93CHC|5.0|Pillars of the Earth and World Without End happen to be my favorite fiction books I've ever read.  However, they are not for the faint of heart.  They are each over 1,000 pages in length and the plots focus on fictional accounts of two different time periods in the middle ages.  Pillars of the Earth chronicles the efforts of building a cathedral in 12th century Kingsbridge, England.  The plot centers around several different characters and will actually switch back and forth in between their interconnected stories.  World Without End is the sequel to Pillars, taking place 200 years later in the same town and following  the descendents of the Pillars` characters.  The story begins with the main characters experiencing a traumatic event together.  The remainder of the novel follows these characters as their individual journeys continually overlap throughout their lives.<br /><br />Where Pillars deals more with the characters and their struggles/triumphs, I would say that World focuses very heavily on the world events taking place around the characters.  World takes place during the Black Plague of Europe.  With nearly half of Europe's population dying during this time period, it's obvious why this event dominates the storyline.<br /><br />The top three things I liked about these books are; 1.) Story 2.) Characters 3.) Sense of accomplishment.<br /><br />1.)  The story takes you to a different world.  If you've ever been lost in the plot of a book, these books will certainly give you that feeling again.  It's fun imaging how different the world was nearly 800 years ago.  It was very peaceful reading these books and entering into a much simpler world than that of today.<br /><br />2.)  Follett is a fantastic character developer and soon after you dive in you will find yourself loving some characters and despising others.  He often portrays the royalty and elites as the villains, and the poor as the heroes.  You will gain an appreciation for the present day legal system as you read about nobles ordering the deaths of peasants based on false information or pure bias.<br /><br />3.)  When you finish one or both of the books, you really feel like you've accomplished something.  You've been on a journey with these characters throughout their lives and you are sad to see it end.  It takes quite some time to read these books, but once you're in, you're hooked.  I also learned a lot about the history surrounding the middle ages.  Although you have to take a lot of historical fiction with a grain of salt, I like to imagine Follett is close to accurate in his account of what life was like in the 12th and 14th centuries.as you read about nobles ordering the deaths of peasants based on false information or pure bias.<br /><br />3.)

B00913DPW2|3.0|My kids and I like to play the adventure/seek games, but we much prefer the ones with puzzles (as opposed to just finding things in jumbled scenes).  We downloaded Haunt due to a promotion and have really been enjoying it.  Cool graphics, creepy scenes and fun puzzles.  Unfortunately, there are a few bugs that often have you wondering if the ghosts are preventing you from entering a door, or if the game has simply stopped responding.  Also, it can get a bit frustrating at times.  This is one we haven't finished yet because the kids fizzled out of frustration with the lack of moving forward, but I don't think that kids were the original target audience and serious puzzle-solvers should really enjoy this one.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book started slow for me...i think i just didn't like the \\"slang\\" of the Gladers, but it soon became a read I didn't want to put down.
B00846REIS|5.0|Having had read 50 Shades long before it was what it is, I was a little hesitant on buying this book. I'm SO glad I did!! Both Eva and Gideon have some serious issues, but you can't help rooting for them. Buying the next book now!
B0084AYLK8|2.0|The book itself is excellent. Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting. But, the kindle edition is, like the title of the review says, missing a chunk of the text. There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.<br /><br />Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for.
1401322786|4.0|Great read! Great advice and interesting story line. Will definitely recommend especially if you like books by Mitch Alboom. Enjoy
B001BC5HXG|5.0|It would be impossible not to rank John Steinbeck along with Mark Twain and Faulkner as one of America's greatest writers.  I have known that for years, and why I had not read \\"East of Eden,\\" I do not know.<br />Steinbeck's characters speak of and to the soul of man, perhaps never more so than in \\"East of Eden.\\"<br />It had been a number of years since I last read Steinbeck.  With \\"East of Eden\\" I'm reminded how brilliant his writing is, but also never to let his other books gather too much dust.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I read this book by Follett a couple of years ago in paper cover. It think it was deceiving to bill it as a new release. You should refund my purchase price.
B005LLX582|5.0|This movie was amazing. It is not typical at all, and it may not make sense to everyone, but this is the type of film that I believe people will be studying in classes in the future. You should watch it and form your own opinion of it the way you would look at a painting and feel something about it. If you approach it without expectations besides what you may know of how Terrance Malick makes movies (whispered dialogue and beautiful images) you may enjoy it much more than otherwise.
B00932AA5G|3.0|I found this a bit grotesque and not nearly as charming as it would like to be.  To me this is a very minor movie, that doesn't nearly live up to any level of hype.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|This movie was really good. The feel of it is like a movie version of Bulletstorm (video game). The motorcycle scene has a noticeable few seconds of lower-quality special effects that sort of look like a flipbook behind him. It doesn't ruin the movie though, and the rest of the movie has good effects. It's not \\"die-hard+blade runner\\", but it is probably inspired by die hard and escape from l.a. The main character is funny and cool like a comic book sort of hero. The film overall is good if you know what your getting into.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Haven't enjoyed a game this much in awhile. It is very realistic and just like the real thing. Even though you may have to buy more coins if you run out, they don't cost much. Its very relaxing and worth the download. I would recommend.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I had high expectations for this movie, and it surpassed my expectations by a long shot. It has an artsy feel, but it just makes the violence more raw and brutal, and it makes the romance more touching. Approach it with an open mind and you may be surprised.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addictive. great little game. I cant put it down once I pick it up! Hope there will be updates soon.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Really good movie. It has the same feel as Alien, answering questions from that film while presenting some new questions. It has to be able to stand on its own after all and it can. It is one of my new favorite movies from maybe the best director around.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I mean it needs some improvement and the price is ok with me I would say this is worth $5.99. has some bugs but it is good

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This was my first Steven King book I have ever read. I was pulled to the book because of the subject matter... someone trying to stop JFK from being shot.  In short I really enjoyed the book, enough even that I might go back and read some of the other books King has written. One thing that I see many of the reviewers saying is that the middle of the book drags, I have to disagree, I felt the whole book was good to great. I will say that middle of the book is not as fast paced, but it is necessary and I think the story really needs it. Also I disagree with the reviewers saying the ending was predictable, it is not, and I challenge them to prove where there is any foreshadowing of the ending.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Using Evernote, means I don't need to write things down on paper anymore! Especially, when talking to a client on the phone. How cool is that!!
B008602KQI|3.0|Don't know what all the hype was about.  Just an OK. movie. Ending disappointing.  Nothing done to stop the killing of these children/teens.  I would have liked an uprising of the people to stop the system and see the downfall of the the elite people responsible for it. The audience would have cheered.  Good guys win.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I cannot sit down for any length of time without reaching for my Kindle, thinking I'll just play a few minutes.  Before I realize it, I have played for an hour or more.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this story.  Nothing has caught my attention as well as many of my friends and family ( including my 20 year old college student daughter) like this series. I felt the picture was satisfactory and sould quality average. Absolutely fine for watching in my living room or den. Heart warming, lovely clothing... period appropriate and simply magnificent acting .  It is truly a value for what I got from this. A great escape if you appreciate classics and the early 1900's. I have not anyone who enjoys Classic material in DVD or books who did not simply love Downton Abbey. I have watched both seasons through 2 times.  Don't buy the Christmas at Downton Abbey separate. It it the last episode of season 2.  If you plan to watch this, you must watch season 1 first... and then you will probably be ordering season 2.  See which is the least expensive ... to buy seasons separate or the season  1 and 2 set. Hurry... Season 3 will begin in January!!!!!
1400052181|4.0|I was amazed at the detail and the tenacity of the writer in producing this book.  The people literally came to life in her hands.  The whole matter of who owns our body parts and cells and test tube babies is only beginning to be explored. Also it is sad that Black People were not given the same rights and consideration as Whites.
1400031524|5.0|Len Deighton's Ipcress File was a gritty version of what James bond is really like, sans all the flash and gimmicks. What I enjoyed most was the set-up of two intelligence officers where we know that one is a traitor but we don't know which one until the conclusion. So it is with this Kurt Wallender thriller about a small-town Swedish detective who gets mixed up in international intrigue. It starts off with an innocuous case: two bodies are discovered floating on the Baltic Sea. The field is expanded until Wallender winds up in Soviet Latvia, smack in the middle of a local political duel between two colonels. We discover that one colonel is a demon, but we don't know which one until practically the very last page. I enjoyed the way the author builds gradually from nothing into sublime complexity. This kept me from going crazy on a flight from Paris to San Francisco. My gratitude.
0345803485|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read and not because of the twisted sex.  To put it simply, the author CANNOT WRITE.  Her characters are cliche and paper-thin.  She reuses the same tired exclamations, descriptions, adjectives, verbs, adverbs over and over  AND OVER again. I made it halfway and then quit, and I rarely quit on a novel.  If the book hadn't been on my Kindle, I would have thrown it across the room in irritation. So yes, it's making her a lot of money but not because it's a good read.  It's not even an average read.  It's just plain bad.  So why is it so popular?  Oh yeah, sex sells.  How original.

Then I played \\"Figure 8\\" and \\"Hanging On.\\" I was absolutely floored! Her voice reminds me a lot of Kate Bush back in her \\"Sensual World\\" days and Lisa Gerrard from her \\"Silver Tree\\" album. Very impressive and talented artist with a voice that is soulful, jazzy and a healthy touch of rock. I look forward to more from her!

B0047T70VW|5.0|I had been meaning to read this for a long time.  I finally did, and loved it from the outset.<br /><br />A vividly imagined, lovingly described, all-too-depressingly feasible future world.  Well-drawn characters with whom you easily sympathise, even in their conflicts with each other. No punches pulled where the action demands; occasional, sudden brutality punctuates the story very effectively.<br /><br />This is a great work of contrasts and combinations and changes that keep you entertained, and a wonderfully ambiguous and thought-provoking ending that really highlights the central theme.

This box set of fantastic music, what a shame about the sound. The sound is so poor it nearly made me cry. They say- Transferred from the OMR without adding anything. Well, if this is the result, they should have added something. The Bob Ludwig remasters is just so much better it is almost unbeliveable.The music=10 out of 10. The sound=0 out of 10.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I bought the Hunger Games trilogy books for my nephew after hearing the hype from book readers.  I was sick at home, so I decided to watch a movie. While scrolling through Amazon movies, I ran across the Hunger Games and thought, \\"Self, maybe you should watch this to see what you sent the little guy and see if it's any good\\". Well, I was pleasantly suprised.  I was only able to watch the first half, then had to eat dinner.  I found that I wanted to go back and watch the rest of the movie right after dinner. So, good movie.  Lots of adventure.  I think this is an appropriate movie for middle school kids.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|when someone showed me this I never realized how fun it would be. I really enjoy the strategy that's involved. if you have a game oriented mind you'll be sure to love it!
B003E88TKS|4.0|Wow George Cloony, you have played some sad characters lately. This movie, the Descendants. But I have to say that this movie was very entertaining and fun to watch.  You know things are not going to be or go right just based on the characters personality and life philosophy. I would recommend.

B003Y5H54W|5.0|it was in great condition, plays great and the cover looked flawless. i love the movie. couldn't believe that it the condition
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I have referred this book to several people and they have all loved the book as well.
1408800489|5.0|I bought the book b/c of the cute title, and was not disappointed!  I could truly imagine what the characters looked and sounded like, plus what the countryside even looked like.  I've always enjoyed books with British roots, and this one is exceptional.  Please read - you will thoroughly enjoy it!  The book came very quickly, and was just as described - I will not hesitate to order from this bookseller again.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was very disappointed with JK Rowlings new book.  I was excited to buy it but after just a few pages, I realized that I could not read this book.  It is full of very vulgar and offensive language.  I actually returned it to Amazon for a refund.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am another in the minority who did not read the Harry Potter book series, however, I did see the movie series with my Granddaughter.  I purchased this book because I was curious about what type of story Ms. Rowling would write for an adult audience and was intrigued by the descriptions I read. I was hoping for a sharp, funny and insightful look at small town politics with its' real-life consequences. Instead, it was immediately evident that this story was another dark and morose tale of children being victimized by  cruel and dangerous adults, and in turn, victimizing each other. Ms. Rowling is adept at painting an exacting picture of the effects of cyclic poverty, substance abuse and child abuse that is apparrently as dire in the UK as it is in the US. She is also dead on at illustrating the chiasmic flaws in an ineffective and impotent child welfare system that is also apparrently as dysfunctional there as it is here. The last two chapters of the book were  the best, in my opinion. It left me crying, as a tragic ending will often do. While I feel Ms. Rowling is a very good writer and has a talent for weaving together many plot lines at once, this book wasn't what I expected or what I had hoped to read on my fall vacation.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutley love this story and enjoyed both books so far.  Can not wait until the final one come sout in December.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|I found this artist through a Facebook recommendation from a friend.  I was very happy to find out that all of the music on this CD were as wonderful as the first one I heard.  If you are looking for a great artist and something different to listen to, I would recommend you give this one a try.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|My girls love this game wish it didn't cost so much to get more characters for them to play with.  Probably designed for adults who can afford to drop money on a game but 300+ hearts for more items is a bit much.  Wish they would let them use the fake money to buy more instead of the hearts.  Girls will keep playin they just will never get moms password to buy hearts with
B001FB55HQ|3.0|I gotta give this movie and actors, writers, director props. It's not a great film by any means. I just watched it for the 1st time since it came out and thoroughly enjoyed it. I hated it when I saw it in the theaters and never bothered to watch it again until now. 1 and 2 are so good it is hard to accept anything less, but I suppose I finally could see it as a stand alone (like Terminator comics and games) and it is pretty *beep* good. Still dumb *beep* like T-800 throwing Jon around when he should be snapping his neck, but hey it isn't perfect by any stretch. I like that you can take or leave the 3rd one since it doesn't follow it directly.<br /><br />This one doesn't suffer from the *beep* camp in that movie and thank god it is not another car chase/remake. If you want a Future War film, this is it, warts and all. Plot is actually really good, with some good twists and mystery. One thing I appreciated more this time was how the villain, refreshingly enough, is Skynet itself this time and will operate much differently than a human army or one cyborg sent back in time with a simple mission. Sort of hard to follow as far as what Skynet knows and doesn't know, but that puts us in a similar position as the humans in the movie.<br /><br />It's too bad this didn't do better b/c I'd like more (hopefully T5 and 6 by William Wisher happens!). If people can see this as something new (FINALLY breaking away from Arnold and the chase plots; very, very glad to hear to dropped out of T5--in favor of Fast and Furious? Lol) it may finally develop into the prequel/sequel series (time travel screws with its place in the series lol) that it has the potential to be. With William Wisher involved it just may. More please!
B008N1V11U|1.0|Love the game. lets me play for a bit then I have to reload again and again. takes almost all day. Frustrating!  I want my $6.99 back.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|We had to have the first version of this show when it first came out and thought it was good.  We managed to see this version and it is far superior.  The performance by all actors/actresses was much better as were the voices.  The picture, sound and sets were all great!  Highly recommend.
1455502758|5.0|Christoper Hitchens was a pitch-perfect writer. The last words about his own death are like an episode from The Twilight Zone. Strange to read the words of a man \\"living dyingly.\\"<br /><br />While not his best literary work, \\"Mortality\\" honors the Hitchens name.<br /><br />One gripe was his targeting of Randy Pausch and The Last Lecture. Hitchens found the video and book to be tiring and offensive \\"when your audience is almost morally obliged to enthuse.\\" The hypocrisy is painful to read, as Hitchens wants to grieve by his own rules. But to Hitchens, others aren't obligated to follow them. While I agree that Pausch's approach was tedious, it was his freedom and choice when he died.<br /><br />A couple highlights:<br />-\\"I wasn't quite prepared for the way that my razor blade would suddenly go slipping pointlessly down my face, meeting no stubble.\\"<br />-\\"Cancer victimhood contains a permanent temptation to be self-centered and even solipsistic.\\"<br />-\\"For me, to remember friendship is to recall those conversations that it seemed a sin to break off: the ones that made the sacrifice of the following day a trivial one.\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have spent too many hours enjoying this game. Excellent graphics and animations. If you like solitaire  then you will  love this game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I finished this book in a day!  There‘s plenty going on to keep you wanting more!  This series of novels is giving 50 Shades of Grey a run for the money!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|As the title says, this app works great on my kindle. It gives lots of helpful information like the ETA on your charge, and how long you have for doing certain tasks.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I started watching this show maybe a year or so ago and just love it.  I have the entire series.  I love the psychological anaylsis that they do in figuring out people related to crime.  I just hope \\"Emily\\" comes back.
B008MM9630|4.0|Love all of the interesting items to plant. Would be five stars if gem costs for goal items were not so outragiously high. Other than that I just plant away and continue to forget to harvest that is a user issue LOL.
B008IJHIAA|5.0|An earlier reviewer of this 2012 reissue complained of an error in the last track of the Live disc. I ordered the set anyway, knowing that amazon is good about handling merchandise returns. As it happens, both my discs play perfectly all the way through. I wonder, therefore, if the earlier reviewer just got the one bad disc in the lot. Maybe! Whatever the case, the problem seems to be limited.<br /><br />Now hoping for a pretty massive reissue of Dead Letter Office for the IRS years...
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great app for transferfing files wirelessly between your tablet and PC.  Also great for Kindle Fire for file administration.
B0090EHVMC|2.0|The animation and visuals are great.  But the story is really lacking, and the comedy is unfortunately sparse and weak.  Very disappointing considering that this comes from the same people who made the fantastic Despicable Me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Almost through reading but I know this book will remain with me for a long time.  Follett is a talented story teller and the research for this tale must have been extensive.  Having lived through this era, there were many questions answered for me, and many things I never knew about.  I look forward to the third book in this trilogy.
0316228532|1.0|While I wasn't expecting a return to Hogwarts or anything about Quidditch, I was expecting an interesting and perhaps readable book.<br /><br />Alas, all of Harry's spells couldn't remove the curse of boredom from the Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />Could this be the single most boring book ever written?  Quite possibly so.<br /><br />If you are an agnostic, you'll discover prayer as you get down on your knees and pray for the book to end.<br /><br />The book drones on and on and on.<br /><br />About midway through you begin to wonder, \\"why am I still reading this?\\"<br /><br />You hope it's going to get better.<br /><br />It never does.<br /><br />My advice - this is one of the all time worst books of English literature.<br /><br />Skip it.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a while.  It's actually a great story not just a mma cage fight for two hours.
B002VRGCKW|5.0|Not everyone loves Pollini's \\"intellectual\\" approach, but there is plenty of feeling and emotion while the technique, approach and interpretation remain impeccable and true to Bach. It is hard to think of music more gorgeous or gorgeously performed than this.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Even though I just received it today with FREE super saver shipping, I can tell you that Amazon really does the best in shipping and security. But that's not the point. The BlueRigger USB extension was well-made and REALLY LONG!! (32 feet is long! Compare that to a long VGA cable!) It's durable, gold-plated just as it promised, and it can even charge my trusty Nexus One!<br /><br />BUY THIS! Trust me, it extends your USB to 32 ft long, charges my phone while Amazon says it can't, durable AND GOLD-PLATED!<br />Go BlueRigger!!
B00130UFY2|4.0|Is this fine art?  No, but people need to stop holding everything up to absurd standards - this is a fun movie.  This is very entertaining.  Downloaded to my Kindle Fire, this kept my full attention and captivated me for the entire length of the film.  That's all one can ask of a movie when stuck on an airplane.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am upset because this is the last book. :(. I love this trilogy and i cant wait until the movies come out!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Very interesting detail of the few humans who believed in the commandment to love thy neighbor and exercised this commandment as children of God.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Battleship is full of action and has a very good plot. I highly reconmend this movie to the action pack enthusiast.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Plenty of action right from the start.  A throwback to when movies did not have to show all the gory details to keep the audience involved.  Really a Hitchcock type direction where the implied violence and/or action let the viewers imagination do the work.  Great movie.
0446604844|5.0|I am a big fan of David Baldacci, so any novel of his is a favorite of mine. Amazon is a great place for me to buy used books that still in great shapes. The sellers are dependable and I always got my items on time and in great conditions.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I think it was kind of fun but a little boring you really need to watch were you fly I like it it is okay
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I can't wait for the next book to come out in this series. This is a wonderful story about two people who discover love under less than ideal circumstances.  I definately recommend this book!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I was really looking forward to this second book.  I loved Bared to You.  This was very disappointing.  To much on again off again.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|good drama, keeps the reader flipping the pages until the end. highly recommended to readers who are looking for entertainment
B00571F26Y|4.0|I will tell you that avoiding wheat is not as hard as you would think and it is so worth it.<br />I feel so much better only after less than a week!!<br /><br />This was a good read. I love discovering what makes the \\"latest diet craze\\" tick and this book delivered.<br />While it took quite awhile to get to following the diet itself and some repeating of the same information<br />all in all I was satisfied with the concept. Since reading this book I have begun avoiding wheat in any form.<br />Today after avoiding wheat for almost a week I had an open faced platter. After eating this meal I felt like<br />I had just ate Thanksgiving Dinner. Could it be the two slices of bread? I'm thinking it is and I have decided<br />to continue to avoid wheat.
B008Y5OW20|3.0|I'm in my 40's. Jeff Lynne has been my favorite artist since my early teen years. ELO is my favorite band, followed by The Traveling Willburys. I've been re-listening to all of my Traveling Willburys music over the last two weeks and wishing Jeff would come out with a new album. Low and behold, he had a new album out on Oct 9, 2012! Imagine how elated I was upon seeing it!<br /><br />Of course, I bought it and gave it a listen. My elation subsided. Jeff is Jeff and he has a sound all his own. I wish he would have written some new music. Jeff doing covers? I feel like he just 'phoned it in' on this album. I'm happy to have something new from him but I am rather disappointed. I guess I shouldn't have expected so much from my favorite artist after three decades of awesome music. Jeff, if you just happen to read this, come on man. You are capable of so much better!<br /><br />Variable Bit Rate - Just in case it matters to you, the MP3 version of the album from Amazon is a VBR. The rate varies from 192 kb/s to 320 kb/s. It does NOT seem to affect the sound quality. Cheers!
B0053O89KG|5.0|Have become a big fan!  Enjoy humor along with the mystery.  WAS so glad to see Beckett and Castle finally have a hot scene at the end of Season Four.  Hope they continue to act like grownups and not bashful teenyboppers!!
0321714113|5.0|Simply a must have.  I well written and organized book, useful as tutorial from cover to cover, and a valuable reference every moment of your professional life thereafter.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was really drawn into books 1-5, what a great world! I really loved reading it and enjoyed the simple yet complex setup of the society. I had a few moments where I was asking myself \\"why\\" and some of the answers came leaving more in its place.
B008I34XUY|5.0|The 2012 remaster project has given FZs entire catalog a significent sonic upgrade. The early albums, and the releases from the '70s seem to benefit the most; there is greatly improved seperation & detail, and the nearly 20-year sonic veil that clouded these iconic titles has been lifted. The Ryko releases (as well as my Japanese imports) are audibly inferior, and any serious fan will find these remasters well worth the upgrade. Of course, the better your system, the more apparent the improvements. Technical mastering liner notes as follows: &#34;Mastered by Doug sax with Robert Hadley and Sangwook &#34;Sunny&#34; Nam at The Mastering lab, 2012.

BTW - the recent vinyl reissue betters these CD versions by a significant margin.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Not sure what it is with these guys but I cannot download anything AGAIN. It seems like every other update they push out makes the app unuseable. When it works it works great but that's only half the time. I wish I just had a version several updates back. It worked flawlessly then but I had to delete the files due to no more room on my SD card. I went and bought a 64GB microSD card so that I could put a bunch more videos and mp3s in my phone and now this AGAIN. Uhh.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is pretty awesome. Once you get an understanding of it and playing it right it becomes addicting and you honestly want to keep going to get stronger and earn better gear
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am so glad these men shared their stories.  I think this is the best account of World War II  I have ever seen.
0525951652|3.0|If only Ken Follett hadn't been so determined to teach us readers a history lesson, he could've had a winner of a book here. The first 300 pages read like the best of Follett: lots of characters engaged in interesting situations, minor intrigue, some sexual dalliances, character defining moments, and intriguing looks at social strata.  Then Follett becomes embroiled less in the characters, and more in making the characters' lives entwine with historical figures and events centered around World War I.  The best historical fiction writers make sure their characters are involved in the history, but don't attempt to lecture so much about each event as Follett endeavors to.  His narrative flow becomes blocked like the long intestine after a person consumes copious amounts of dairy products and high-fiber breads.  The story becomes almost unreadable at times as we treated to many a lecture about World War I politics.  The book becomes less of a novel and more of a textbook about 400 pages in, and by page 700 I was desperately hoping to encounter the emotions of the characters again like I had in the earlier pages of the novel.<br /><br />Alas, I didn't encounter enough over the last 280 pages.  I will not be buying the 2nd in the series.
1619695006|3.0|Ever the astute purveyor of internal dialogue, The Casual Vacancy takes us on a dark journey into the petty minds of citizens of Pagford, a small town in the west of the U.K.  Whereas Harry Potter's story highlighted every brave, kind, loyal impulse of man and took us on a journey of self-sacrifice and victory over evil, The Constant Vacancy does the opposite.  I found it depressing, and the heavy voiced narration of  Tom Hollander in the Audio CD version didn't help.  Everything was tinged with a dark undertone; there seemed to be no hope in sight for any of the characters.  I found I did not like any of the characters enough to care what ultimately happened to them, and I am even seriously reconsidering my desire to retire to just such a small place as Pagford, some idyllic place in the countryside of the U.K. now seeming to be a horrible grouping of nasty minded, petty individuals I'd do well to avoid.<br /><br />The writing itself was, as usual, stunning.  No one turns a phrase like J.K. Rowling.  I could see the characters in my mind's eye so clearly, and see the village as well.  It's kind of creepy to think that the author calmly looks at people and knows their inner, vile thoughts so well.  Knowing she herself has been in different class levels throughout her life, I'm sure she's met these characters along the way.<br /><br />I listened to the audio CD on my way to and from work to about 60% through, then skipped to the last CD and was able to gather what happened, plot wise.  This isn't a plot heavy story, it's mostly a character study.  I had to skip ahead because the darkness of it had started to affect my actual mood in a way I wasn't liking.  Do I recommend it? Not really, unless you just want to marvel at the writing chops alone.
B008I34Y6W|5.0|See the review of &#34;Apostrophy&#34; for tech details, but these 2012 CD remasters (all titles) trounce every version (save vinyl) previously available. Serious fans: upgrade. Update 11/01/15 - Have now purchased the 180-gram vinyl edition (along with all the others) and this title (pressed, like all the others, at Pallas in Germany) is flawless and stunning in every way, bettering even the great CD remasters. I am fortunate enough to own the Discreet original in pristine condition, and while they are pretty close, this new version seems to have greater dynamics, wider separation/localization in the soundfield, improved definition, and is pressed on dead-quiet and perfectly flat vinyl to boot. All without sounding &#34;tweeked&#34; or digital in any way. The ultimate way to listen to the master's (greatest?) album. Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is so fun I play this game every day after school. this game goes to hight stander with me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game! i wish it was real money lol.  keeps me busy and my kids like to play with me too.
B00005221M|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis at his best.  Love the scenery and depiction of pre-revolutionary time.  If you enjoy history movies this one is for you.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Life isn't always what it seems, and it doesn't always turn out the way we had envisioned or hoped. In this movie, we watch the inner lives of several characters \\"of a certain age\\" unfold and expand. With the bloom of youth past, retirement upon them and circumstances inducing radical change, all of them decide to retire in India at the Marigold Hotel. When they arrive, they find that the hotel isn't the luxurious retreat for the elderly that was described in the brochures that led them there. It is not without its charms, however, and the manner in which the retirees meet both the good and the bad of their new home lays the groundwork for their blended individual stories. The dialogue is excellent, the cast and the acting is brilliant, and the message is hopeful without violating believability. Baby boomers will see themselves in one or more of the characters' situations, and they will come away from the film with a renewed sense of hope and worth.<br /><br />The film's perspective on two ways to grow older is beautifully executed. Not all the characters \\"make it.\\" Given the same opportunity for adjustment and change as their companions, a couple of them cannot forgive, hope or move forward. Others, however, find a new beginning by embracing change and welcoming a future which is completely different from the past they left behind.<br /><br />In all, the movie is provocative. It is funny, sad, engaging and substantive. A refreshing change from saccharine happily-ever-after or hopeless all-is-doomed films, this is a thinker's must-see for people in their sixties and a please-see for the young. (The young people in this movie are wonderful, too.) Kudos to the writers, producers, directors and actors for a job superbly done.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I bought this Blu-Ray set and I love it. The commentaries included on each Blu-ray were insightful and fun. I Loved the bloopers and other features as well and It is a great deal since there were so many episodes for season one. Can't wait for season 2, hope it is just as long.
B008I34ZG6|5.0|Please see the \\"Apostrophy\\" review for details, but, in short, these remasters are the best-sounding way to listen to Zappa short of pristine vinyl.

B005K17RU0|4.0|Pretty detailed app. Not used to being able to go to a certain day and get weather details by the hour. Like it alot!
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Bought this one because of Band of Brothers.. It was an area of history of which I was unfamilar.  While it did not live up to Band of Brothers  it is worth watching
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love this show!!! I know my mother says, How can you watch that gross!! But i truly love it. I even bought me a T-Shirt, with Sheriff Grimes shooting a walker and blood splatter over most of the shirt! It is so cool!!! Believe it or not it does have a plot and utimately could happen!! Sad but True!!!
0812982622|5.0|This was an amazing book that takes you on a journey from boyhood of the main character to a roller coaster ride of his life.  The writing is just one of the best that I have ever read.  This book has so many twists and turns, you are not believing where it goes next, but you are happy it went there.  Just a pure masterpiece and if I could give it more stars, I would.  Even through have bronchitis while are I was reading most of this and hacking a lung while trying to read, I just did not want to put it down and stop.  Everyone who even thinks about whether they should get this book or not, definitely should, and you will thank yourself that you did.  Just truly amazing.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Once again, I am impressed with Invicta. This is my third watch from them and for the price, the quality is excellent, band is comfortable and holds better time than my Rolex.
0316228532|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. I was immediately drawn to these very human characters. It defies the idea of good and bad characters. Regardless of how I felt about each character, they all faced their own dangerous and sometimes deadly and destructive demons. The lessons j.k. Rowling imparts are beyond the stories in her literary works. I'm inspired to stops and consider the personal struggle of others and be a helpful force in their lives wether foe or friend, vs. a destructive force.
B008OJ291W|3.0|This CD threw this listener at first, even in terms of where it should be put in a retail rack, or how it should be thought of -- it's Jeff Lynne covering his own music (which he has every right to do, of course), all of it associated with ELO, so it's really a Jeff Lynne recording. But, as Jeff Lynne owns the ELO name and can attach it to anything he chooses (even to this reviewer playing the spoons, if Lynne so desired), there is that point to consider.<br /><br />The clarity of the new recordings, while not exactly a revelation, is a plus (though one could hardly complain about the upgraded remasterings on the original recordings from the past decade or so, either); and the updated instrumentation has its points, even if most fans (and who else is supposed to be buying this?) would retain a tremendous fondness for the originals in all of their 1970s glory. And the little fixes to the minor flaws from the original 1970s-era catalog were probably a necessity, if one were to pursue a project like this in the first place. It's not essential listening for anyone on a limited budget who has the originals in some form -- there are no serious re-considerations of any of the material; it's infinitely better than, say, the Chuck Berry re-recordings of his 1950s/early 1960s Chess hits on Mercury from 1966 (in stereo, with an electric bass . . . which was lethal on that record, incidentally -- speaking of whom, there's no new version here of \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" ELO's one non-original hit, which leads one back to the suspicion that this CD was motivated as much by the business side of publishing as by any need for a musical \\"statement\\" on Lynne's part). It's more of a curio than a necessity, though an extremely attractive one -- these songs were mostly ALL over the radio across a decade, and with all of the upgraded sound and instrumentation, he does mostly capture the feel and texture of those originals. In that regard, one also sort of wishes that Lynne had reached out to a few more obscure corners of the ELO catalog for this album, such as \\"Illusions In G Major\\" -- with all of the majestic sounds on hand, a little rock & roll beyond \\"Do Ya\\" would have been appreciated.<br /><br />But it is fun listening -- how could it not be, assuming one likes the songs to begin with -- and all but the pickiest fans may enjoy this addendum to their Electric Light Orchestra library. And the inclusion of \\"Do Ya\\" and the \\"10538 Overture\\" (which dates from the Roy Wood-era of ELO, even if it is a Lynne song) even makes it an addendum (albeit a minor one) to the Move library, and it's difficult to complain too loudly about that in 2012.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|looking for mindless entertainment...this is it.  fun. glad it was a ffotd.  worth every penny...or should I say token?  If you like arcade games then this is worth adding to your fire.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I watched the TV show before reading the graphic novel, but wasn't dissapointed with either once I read it. There are a few changes from the show, but this is a great read!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I enjoy using my calculator plus and it was free.  It has a large enough for me to see clearly.
B008G12EUY|4.0|True artists change. This album is different, but I can still feel the muse essence in each beat of each song. It is good music, it doesn't matter if is not like their other albums. Most people seem not to agree, but I'd be bored of the same 'flow' 3 albums in a row. If you like good music, buy it, if you just like a couple of genres, there are a lot of industry 'artists' out there.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|I was so excited when I learned that Tim Burton was making a Dark Shadows movie. And when he said in an interview that he'd been a fan of the original series, even better.  I thought he would be respectful of the original and do it justice.<br /><br />Now, I should mention here that I was absolutely addicted to the tv series when I was growing up. The show came on at 4:00 pm every day.  My bus didn't drop me off until 4:10.  I would literally jump off the bus and RUN up the yard into my house so I could watch the last 20 minutes.  We had one of those huge Sylvania black & white console television sets in our living room. I think I watched all the seasons in black and white, even after they started broadcasting in color. I had a mad crush on Jonathan Frid when I was in middle school.<br /><br />Sadly, this movie is bad.  I mean really, really bad.  It alternates between gory violence and campy humor and doesn't really do a good job at either one.  I ended up turning it off about 2/3 of the way through because I just couldn't bring myself to watch any more of it.<br /><br />If you were a fan of the original series, you will not want to watch this movie. I'm both sad and disappointed.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book is my favorite out of the Twilight Saga! I have read it 3 times and still cannot put it down once I start reading.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|In all honesty, this album deserves a 3.5 rating. That being said, I'm one of those many detractors that hates seeing other people in Ace's and Peter's make up. In theory, I'm opposed to the current KISS lineup.<br /><br />The songs on this album are pretty solid, however. They've won me over. This is a well-crafted pop-metal/classic hard rock album.<br /><br />I think it's cool that Eric and Tommy sing lead on their respective tracks. They both are competent players and singers with their own personalities that should be introduced to the world.<br /><br />Yet that leads me back to my original, theoretical gripe with the current KISS line up. Why didn't Eric S and Tommy T get to have their own make up characters like Eric Carr and Vinny Vincent got to have? It's disingenuous to me. If they had had their own characters, I would've given this album 4.5 rather than 3.5 stars.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It is very helpful but you can‘t search a word you have to find the word. But is overall good
B0036TGT3E|3.0|The movie is a 5 star film.  The blu-ray looks awesome.  BUT it's strangely missing clips from it.  [...]  No idea why, but that's the only reason I give this Blu-Ray edition a so-so review.  Great for kids but adult fans might want to keep their DVDs.  [[ASIN:B00003CXB4 The Lion King (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)]]

B001G7CAGI|5.0|I've had several friends tell me to watch this show;I'm now watching it on my Kindle and I am hooked!!! If you liked X-files you'll love this.<br />The HD on the Kindle is excellent.
B007SGM084|5.0|When I began reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I wasn't sure that I liked it however I'm not one to stop reading any book, so I persvered and I am very glad I did..The characters developed nicely as did the plots not to mention the insights into Grey, as why he did the things that he did.  If you can get beyond the BDSM content and understand the why's and wherefores...the depth,knowledge,and research required to write this series, is incredible! And the fact that I had to look up the definition of several words is amazing to me! This series is one of the Best I've ever had the privilege to read! I would purchase anything written by E L James.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is bloody brilliant! I'm a big fan and I've read all of her books, even those written as Madeline Wickham. She was one of my first favorite non-paranormal writers and I always have such a good time reading her books. I mean like laughing out loud, snorting, tears coming out of my eyes because it is so funny kind of good time. This book was no different. But for being so funny there is also always the right amount of emotion and conflict and a little bit of a mystery thrown in to keep me glued to the pages.<br /><br />Poppy just lost her engagement ring during lunch at a hotel. Then she had her cell phone stolen but her luck is turning up when she passes by a trash bin and she sees a phone! Well if someone just threw it away then it's okay to take it right? She can give the number to all the hotel staff and cleanup crew so if they find her ring they can call her. Sam Roxton calls the phone and tells her it belongs to his PA that just quit and he needs it back. She helps him out by stopping a very important business man from leaving before Sam gets there. Since Poppy just saved Sam's butt he agrees to let her keep the phone a couple days until she finds her ring, since she already gave the number out to all the hotel staff. Her fiance, Magnus, gave her a precious family heirloom and she doesn't want his parents to find out she lost it. She promises she will forward all his text messages.<br /><br />What happens when you forward someone's messages? Well you can't help but read them right? LOL I admit it! I found a phone once and read everything in it. hehe So as Poppy is keeping up with forwarding Sam's emails she can't help but be curious about all the back story behind them and she ends up reading everything in the phone. She begins to get to know Sam in a way through the email and test messages. But there is definitely more to him than those messages can show. Poppy thinks he doesn't reply enough, and that he replies too briefly and rudely. When Poppy meets up with Sam she asks if she can reply to a few emails because it is driving her crazy that he is not replying. She ends up replying to all of them and then even sending out extra ones that go to his entire office that she says Sam wrote. LMAO The emails are hilarious. I started snorting.<br /><br />Sam is of course pissed off. She tells him he's too stiff and mean. Well then Sam reads all her texts and emails and says she is too nice. She needs to stand up for herself. Every message is worded like oh can you please do this for me thanks so much but if you can't it's okay I'm so sorry xxxxxxxx kisses. Sam says she should be direct. Sam wants her to confront her future in-laws which have been making her feel like inferior. They begin to form a friendship through their text messages and give each other new perspectives on the problems they are dealing with. I loved Sam! At first he does seem stiff and rude but as we get to know him he turns out to be such a sweet and loyal guy.<br /><br />Sam also has a business scandal about to burst and a message Poppy received on the phone may be the answer to saving Sam's boss and the company he works at. Poppy is also receiving some devastating text messages about Magnus. Poppy does everything to help Sam and can't stop thinking about what will happen when she returns the phone and he is no longer in her life? Poppy has begun to count on texting Sam for advice. I loved the writing style. All the emails and text messages were so hilarious. I also loved that the book included footnotes. Little funny thoughts thrown in to give some more back story and extra laughs. I love footnotes but I've only seen them in Lisa Lutz's Spellman Files series. Sophie Kinsella always has a great way of showing all the thoughts of her characters. You know when ramble on in your head and try to excuse your actions or talk yourself into something? Those are some of my favorite parts of her writing. I always love I had a fabulous time reading it and as always will be anxiously awaiting the next book by Sophie Kinsella.<br /><br />---<br />\\"I thought you might like to do a Fun Run.\\"<br />\\"You did.\\"<br />\\"Yes. I did.\\" My voice is a little husky with nerves. \\"I mean...they're fun! So I thought I'd reply. Just to save you time.\\"<br />\\"You wrote an email and signed it as me?\\" He sounds thunderous.<br />\\"I was trying to help!\\" I say hurriedly. \\"I knew you didn't have time, and they kept asking you, and I thought-\\"<br />\\"The e-card was you, too, I take it?\\" He shuts his eyes briefly. \\"Jesus. Is there anything else you've been meddling in?\\"<br />\\"OK, I had this...this other idea,\\"<br /><br />\\"My hand keeps automatically reaching for my phone in its usual place in my pocket. Every instinct in me wants to text someone OMG, I've lost my phone! but how can I do that without a bloody phone?\\"<br /><br />\\"We're playing Scrabble. It's a nightmare.\\"<br />\\"Scrabble?\\" He sounds surprised. \\"Scrabble's great.\\"<br />\\"Not when you're playing with a family of geniuses, it's not. They all put words like 'iridiums'. And I put 'pig'.\\"

0525953728|5.0|I don't read much but this book was a quick read and kept my attentions the whole time. It will make you proud to be an American.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|This is AWESOME! I love Anne Rice!  She is my all time favorite author. Her Vampires are real people as well as Vampires, always dealing with their humanness . This series introduces you to a host of Vampires and their lives. Of course the naughty Lestat is always in the middle of things. Bad  but loved by all. then there are Those Who Must Be Kept. Who have been asleep so to sleek for several thousand years. Alaska & Enkil . Who finally wake and the terrible destruction left in the Mothers wake!A must read for every one! Then you'll want to read all the other Vampire books. You won't be able to put them down! I'm on my second go round of all of them! Happy reading, maybe the Dark Trick will come your way.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I absolutely loved the whole trilogy of Fifty Shades and have read all three books three times each. I just couldn't get enough of Christian and Anastasia and so happy after everything they went through that it all ended happily ever after. Can't wait for the movie but the casting will have to be spot on.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This was an addicting train wreck I couldn't look away from. Abby has moved to a new town to start a new life in college. Then she meets Travis Maddox. He is everything she is trying to escape, trouble. He has girls all over him, makes his money in illegal fights, has rage issues, and is known as the school player. But he has his eye on Abby so Abby decides how about we just be friends. This works for awhile since they have a lot in common and enjoy each others company. But when Abby loses a bet and has to live with Travis for 30 days she just can't deny the growing attraction and pull they have for each other.<br /><br />This is actually a rather controversial read. Travis and Abby's relationship is very far from perfect and quite a bit unhealthy. He has jealous and rage issues. Abby can't make up her mind. They fight and drive each other crazy. They are a disaster but sometimes a beautiful one. They truly love each other but are bad for each other sometimes but then perfect for each other sometimes. It is a realistic look at a crazy relationship but I don't think you are supposed to go \\"I want that\\". No, it's more about just enjoying an additive train wreck and hoping these two can get it together and be there for each other, since no one else will be able to do that for these two characters.<br /><br />I'm not easily offended so I enjoyed this but it definitely won't be a read for everyone. There is a lot of sex, cussing, and violence. Travis never hits Abby but if a guy looks at her sometimes he hits the guy. The author is currently working on this same book but from Travis' perspective which I will definitely be reading. It had a bit too much of the vicious circles thing that I hate, like in Anna and the French Kiss, where the couple just can't get it together. The story kept me intrigued though so I enjoyed it.<br /><br />---<br />\\"Shake in your boots, boys, and drop your panties, ladies! I give you: Travis: 'Mad Dog' Maddox!\\"<br /><br />\\"You like Pigeon,\\" hesaid defensively. \\"It's a dove, an attractive girl, a winning card in poker, take your pick. You're my Pigeon.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's dangerous to need someone that much. You're trying to save him and he's hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\\"
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Probably like a lot of Beach Boy fans, I ordered this album more for nostalgia's sake than anything.  And honestly, the first time I heard it, it kinda washed over me and didn't make a big impression.  But then I listened to it again and soon realized that what I got was a lot more than I had bargained for.<br /><br />Like others have said, this album is shockingly good and gets better with every listening like albums did in the old days.  And when have 70 year-old artists ever recorded an album as vibrant and good as their best early work?  I expected nothing but a trip down memory lane, but what I got was frankly the best rock album in 30 years.  Every track is a winner.  Every single one.  The third track, \\"Isn't It Time,\\" is one of the catchiest Beach Boy songs I've ever heard, and I'm not kidding.  Please, do yourself a favor:  buy this album.  It's an instant classic.
B009B51K9U|1.0|I have been a Green Day fan since 1994.  I own every album they have put out and, if asked, I would say they are my favorite band.<br /><br />However, I have to give this album purchase one star.  Why?  Censorship.  I don't know on whose shoulders the decision to censor this album via Amazon rested, but it was the wrong choice.  I vehemently oppose artistic censorship in any fashion, and be warned that if you purchase this album through Amazon, you will be receiving the radio edit versions of each song.<br /><br />On its own merits, as a long-time Green Day fan, I would give this album 3/5 stars.  Think \\"Warning.\\"  If you liked that album, you will probably enjoy this one more than I did.  Personally, I long for another \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Insomniac\\"-esque production.
B009B50QOU|4.0|I really enjoyed this CD. It is Green Day at its best. It sounds similar to Warning, which is a good thing. The CD never really drags, but that is because it is a little bit short. That is my main complaint. Once the CD gets going, it ends. But I cant complain. It is a great CD if you like Green Day, or Pop-Rock.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First, let me say I am by far someone who reads alot of books. It really takes a good book to get me to stay interested. This booked pulled me in from the begining! This is a must read!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Absolutely loved Bared to You and couldn't wait for the next book Reflected in You to be released last week and promptly read that too. I love both characters of Gideon and Eva and also Cary, can't get enough of them and look forward to the last book in December where I'm hoping they will find some peace and happiness.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|love it. can't put it down. this word minimum is annoying though. I'm just trying to use it up so
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Well worth the money. It is currently the best app I have for the Kindle Fire. The AI is challenging enough to keep my attention (in fact I always lose on higher difficulties).  I am not a big fan of Carcassonne the board game, but it works very well as a mobile app. The computer takes care of all the scoring and bookkeeping.<br /><br />This app offers a lot of options for setup,  you can choose different rule sets, number of opponents, etc.  It also comes with The River expansion.<br /><br />Also a plea to developers: I want good, modern board games like Puerto Rico or Catan on my Kindle Fire, I am willing to pay $5 a pop for them if they are the quality of Carcassonne. Many of these are available in the Google play store right now,please bring them over to the Amazon store as well.
B005LAII62|5.0|I am writing this review to level out a one star review that is promoting this movie as unfit for family, etc.  This is a fun family movie with an uplifting story and great effects.  It encourages diversity and acceptance.  I pray for the day that a movie intended to harbor good will and positivity such as this one will not be jeered at for having a gay character but just be accepted as nothing to be surprised at; the character will be looked at as just like everyone else, because that is what they are; just like everyone else.<br /><br />The erroneous and disturbing review purporting a non existent \\"gay agenda\\" etc.  is particularly disturbing and the ignorance blinding.  This is a family movie with a good message, the only agenda that I see is those, even those who should know better, attempting to squash and silence those who are for equality, acceptance, civil rights for all.
B000KFB4PK|4.0|Cool birthday gift for a 6-year old!  Sized well, and easy to assemble. Would recommend.  Can add links as child grows.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Perfect follow up from their first Album.  There are no bad songs on this record, you can listen from beginning to end and fall in love with every song.  It's great music, with amazing lyrics and powerful messages. It did not dissapoint.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|this is the worst movie ever. **spoiler** All of a sudden at the end the girl in the movie becomes a warewolf. WHAT!!!!!!! It was so out of left field. That is what made me decide that the movie was defenitely rediculous. The movie starts off really funny and entertaining. Then when DEEP wakes up its still funny. It isnt until after 15 min. after he wakes up that the movie gets boring and ridiculous. The ridiculousness gets bigger as the movie rolls.

0793518326|3.0|Being a huge Beatles fan, I was extremely excited when I received this book. I had been under the impression that this book would have authoritative scores with authentic instrumentation, chord voicing, fingerings, etc. To my dismay, as I actually started looking at some of my favorite songs, what I found instead was a collection of shoddy transcriptions done with about the skill level of a first year music student.<br /><br />Errors are so frequent and substantial that they essentially render the book useless as an accurate source to learn from. Errors like the opening left hand octaves in Martha My Dear mistakenly being transcribed as perfect fifths, the many inaccurate harmonies and chord voicings, and even errors identifying the correct instrumentation had me banging my head against the desk and transcribing certain sections myself. It really kind of defeats the purpose of having an external reference if that reference is so unreliable that you end up having to double check everything yourself. You might as well just look for tabs or chord charts online, as the accuracy would be about the same.<br /><br />Anyway, in my great frustration, I ended up shelving this book for several years. A few weeks ago, I decided to pull it off the shelf on a whim, and I suddenly noticed something incredible. This book is the perfect height to use as a monitor stand! I've had my monitor on top of it for almost a month now, and my visual line to the monitor is now the perfect angle, while the monitor itself is completely steady. Those 1000+ pages of amateurish transcriptions really provide a lot of stability.<br /><br />In summary, The Beatles Complete Scores is the best monitor stand ever! (Don't buy it if you want the music inside, though.)
038572179X|4.0|The first parts of the book I will not review as they have been so adequately covered.  That is except to say, that I absolutely loved them, the writing style, the access to the interior thoughts of the characters and the real beauty and depth of the reading experience.<br /><br />However the last section when Briony is celebrating her 77 th birthday was really distressing, and sadly, mostly because of just kind of \\"housekeeping\\" type  errors.  Actually this also happens slightly before when Briony goes to the church to witness the wedding of Paul and Lola.  As she is sitting there thinking about family weddings she had attended, she thinks well of course she would not have been at the wedding of Lola's parents as she would have been too young.  Yes indeed she would not even have been born!  This is sloppy, to have such an error escape not only the author but his editors.<br /><br />I thought the final section was rife with such inaccuracies.  Not the denouement, which I knew anyway from having seen the movie, but the facts of the actions and settings of the final pages.<br /><br />Briony's recent diagnosis of incipient dementia is believable as is her donating her papers to the museum.  also her accidental running into Lola and Paul, those descriptions fit into the tenor of the entire book.  But then we part company with the way the rest of the book has been written.  Nothing else would seem reasonable.  Why would Briony be having such a huge celebration for a 77th b.d.?  That is not a milestone b.d. like the 75th or the 80th or 40th etc.  It is not as if her family could have known of her recent diagnosis.  so therefore are we to believe that all 50 (distant, as evidently Briony herself never had children) relatives  took the time and attention to celebrate each one of her birthdays?  Even if she was a famous author?<br /><br />Then the description of the renovated house itself seems to be askew with what we have read described in the first section.  That house was maintained by a cook (who sometime serves as a nanny too) and an off site cleaning lady (Robbie's mother)  There is also a sort of handy man who picks up people at the station and odd jobs like that.  But the house in the final section would have to be huge to accommodate 50 overnight guests including Briony, herself who has not just the aunt's old bedroom but a suite that encompasses it!  Even setting aside the understandable necessary changes (like the lake drained to become part of the golf course) the early house could not possibly have become the second house.  The most insulting thing though is the resurrection of the cancelled play and the performance of it by the young relatives.  Why this play?  Out of those Brionly had writen?  The only real significance of that play is the aftermath of its non-performance.  The accusation and the consequent ruination of Robbie's and Cecilia's lives.  If the relatives were familiar enough with how to access the play, they surely knew the results of that evening.<br /><br />The delayed publication of the story of Cecilia and Robbie with its mockery of a good ending for them would be meaningless to the general reader.  and all significant participants in the events; Briony, Paul, Lola, the twin, and Leon would be gone.<br /><br />I would like to comment on the atonement, but think I must be missing something.  There is no atonement.  The blueprint fantasy that Robbie and Cecilia laid out for Brioney was certainly never followed by her, her novel is certainly none and so I can only conclude that the author meant something else and I don't understand what it is.  Unless mockery.
B004EPZ08Y|2.0|There are two crucial movies in this series: Final Destination (1) and The Final Destination (6). FD 2, 3, 4, and 5 are simply less and less exciting rehashes of #1. They do get progressively bloodier, but also progressively less relevent.<br /><br />Basically, see FD1 and TFD6 in that order, back-to-back. It's one big, exciting ride. Leave out the fluff that is 2-5.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I purchased these for my daughter's room & they are so cute! A lot bigger than I expected & great quality. I would definitely recommend.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book had me at the edge of my seat the whole time! That's  why i gave it a five star rating!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Fifty Shades books are all hype and no substance. Honestly I kept reading the books hoping it would get better but in the end all I got was the phrase \\"my inner goddess\\" permanently etched into my brain. Just when I felt it was going somewhere with the plot the resolution (like in all the books) was a huge let down.<br />I get it this book is supposed to be risque but honestly after a while I started skipping all the sex scenes. I get it their in lust, love but if your book is going to be all about sex why put a story line in it especially one that doesnt leave me with anything at the end. I should have saved my money and listened to other reviewers Do not buy these books! If your going to do it anyway at least wait wait for them to be on clearance or free.
B007UPNA6Y|1.0|I totally agree with the review by 'Reacher Creature', and just want to make sure another one star was added! I was really looking forward to the launch of the new Reacher novel and was counting down the months. When I first started reading the book I was so happy to be reading it, i couldn't wait for the great plot and the clever insights Reacher is known for.... what, nearly at the end of the book - what happened? where did the story go? It really seems that this book was just a moneymaking exercise for Lee Child - poor form.
B007PFD90G|4.0|Otherwise, its an amazing and puzzling portrait of the life of a writer and its eventual insanity, of course a bigger insanity that any of us will ever face. Argh.
0385344333|2.0|The first Lee Child book I have found disappointing. It is shallow and actionless, considering his other Reacher novels. I've driven I80 numerous times from Cheyenne, Wyoming to Omaha, Nebraska which probably leads me to be judgemental of his descriptions of the area. One suggestion would be for Child to drive an area before writing about it.

AND the fact Amazon made me wait over 10 days to get the this book which I pre-ordered.<br /><br />SOOO disappointed, MS. Rowling has let all her fans down.  I knew going in that this book was a departure for her, she should have stuck to what she knows best. Beyond AWFUL!

B007THA4FI|3.0|Being a huge fan of the Potter books and movies, I signed up for the pre-order of The Casual Vacancy as soon as possible.  When it arrived, I tried to start reading the Kindle version.  It literally took me weeks to get through the first third of the book.  Had the author been anyone I did not have a strong pre-existing admiration of, I would have quit and given the book a single star.  It really feels like a two-star book but according to Amazon's scale and my feeling that it is basically OK, it gets 3 stars.<br /><br />If you are thinking of purchasing this book, please find a way to read a sample to see if the writing sucks you into the story.

B008MEM24S|5.0|What a fun game.  It is so fun to play and it really makes you think.  Hours of fun!  A must have!
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|I'm not sure that I would say that this was as engaging as their first effort, but it's not far off the mark. There are a couple of 'Meh' tracks in the middle, but the beginning and the end are very solid. I love the rendition of the Boxer, I think that's a great idea. Very nice.<br /><br />Every song seems to have that trademark Mumford Crescendo. Fun stuff. I find myself just putting this album on because I can listen to it from start to finish and not really even pay attention to it, or I can listen to it with focus. It's worth picking up.<br /><br />~B
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|quick fun skillful.  great time can't. believe I waited this long to play. reminds me of the dozed machines at county fair with the exception you win<br />the best part its a free app with links to other gsmes
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun to play--easy or hard--whatever you're in the mood for. I've replayed some that I thought were quite easy only to be hard the next time around! Wow...brain freeze or something. Keeps me on my toes.<br /><br />It works well on the Kindle Fire and follows the touch well--something other games could take lessons from.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Another great book by the wise and wonderful James Herriot. This book will make you want to read on and on, letting you forget about the things you have to do. A great buy and I recommend.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I recently discovered Mumfords and Sons music. This album is beautiful! I am in love with every melody! Exquisite job!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app helps me waste so much time.  I love it so much!  Sometimes it has a hard time opening but other than that it is terrific!
B008J34466|5.0|Pink has done it again!  I love this album!  The lyrics are fresh and honest, the music is very danceable.  Pink's vocals are right on!  I can't find one bad thing to say about this album.  I ordered it prior to release and have listened it to it constantly since receiving it.  My favorite album of the year thus far!  What a talented woman!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved the game. Lot's of twists and turns. Great mystery and storyline. Wanted to have the game keep going on and on.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|We were so into this series that we watched this entire series in one day. We could not stop watching so we just kept the episodes rolling throughout the day. We stopped for some food and bathroom breaks but we did it all. Was not crazy about Jimmy being killed off but I'm sure they have their reasons.
B009B51K9U|5.0|What else can I say? I have enjoyed Uno! since the first to the last song! It is an ode to old punk created by them! One of my favs ever!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a ok game the thing i like is all the other games it is realy good on kindle fire
B009DP9D6A|4.0|deadmau5 rarely dissapoints.  This album is full of solid songs and fun collaborations.  However, most of the tracks are in a different vein than deadmau5' previous efforts, so don't be surprised when only a few tracks feel familiar.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really Love it! its so so good i really enjoyed reading this book! cant wait to start the third book.
1858705770|5.0|This package is information excellance, it does overlook some of the high points, in the song writing tho. For example all of the songs are based on fact, they do reflect on what did happen to the band members, double trouble is about Ronnie and Gary when they were in jail, ronnie reflected on how many times he was there and gary simple stated \\"your two times bad\\" hence the name double trouble.<br /> It also failed to mention that rickey only has one lung and through Gods grace he is still \\"high Octaine\\". If you are a collector, this is a must have.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|This movie is an entertaining popcorn flick. The cinematography & primary characers' acting is nicely done. However, the 2nd characters' acting is mostly terrible, the plotholes will make you confused, and the terrible science will make you cringe if you're science-minded. And when I say terrible science, I mean the science makes absolutely no sense, and this movie barely qualifies as \\"science\\" fiction. Ridlely Scott made an attempt to rival the engrossing and legendary Alien trilogy. It falls short, but it's still a decent movie none the less.<br /><br />Here is a list of all the good and bad of the movie.<br /><br />1. Cinematography:<br /><br />Great scenes. The scenery is nicely done, fits the tone and makes the world seem epic. In line with the dark scifi tone of the earlier films, although a bit more flashy (more Avatarish) and less gritty.<br /><br />2. Acting:<br /><br />Theron and Fasselbender are great. Rapace is decent. The ship captain is ok. The others are mediocre. The guys who play the scientists<br />and Rapace's husband are terrible.<br /><br />3. List of Plot holes & Crappy Science:<br /><br />1. Why did the alien have to sacrifice himself in the beginning? He could've cut himself or taken a dump in the water...both would've deposited DNA that would've given rise to live. Or taken a dump in a bucket, drip in some blood, and then stir in some black goo...BAM Primordial Ooze!<br />2. It's impossible that the aliens created life on earth to create humans. Mankind evolved through the slimmest of chances. ie., humans wouldn't be around if the dinosaurs weren't wiped out by meteorites...or if the dominant invertebrates weren't killed off in mass extinctions. Did the Engineers pull the strings on every major cataclysm on the planet for billions of years?<br />3. The Engineers could not have created life because that would make their civilization billions of years old. This is impossible based on their technology (or lack there of). Their technology and biological features also seemed unchanged between the two time periods of the movie.<br />4. How did the two explorers get lost when they had a 3-D map of the entire area, plenty of explorer/scouting robots, and direct radio communication with the ship that also a hologram map of the place they were in?<br />5. Why did they create humans, get us to worship them, and then try to wipe us out?<br />6. Why did they create extremely dangerous biological weapons (that is a huge threat to them as well) in order to wipe out technologically primitive humans?<br />7. How did the android know that dipping black goo in the guy's drink was going to turn his sperm into alien-squid sperm?<br />8. Why did the Engineers create humans, get us to worship them, then give us star maps to one of their secret weapons base?<br />9. Again, WHY THE HELL DID THEY GIVE CAVEMEN HUMANS A MAP TO THEIR PLANET FULL OF SECRET BIO-WEAPONS???<br /><br />4. More Plot Confusion and Uncharacteristic Behavior for the Characters:<br /><br />1. Why did the scientists act like dumb jocks?<br />2. Why did the two women at the end run in a straight line to get away from a thin flat falling donut?<br />3. Why did the alien with his head chopped off run TOWARDS the room with the deadly biological weapons?<br />4. Why didn't the squid-facehugger give birth to a chest burster?<br />5. How did the squidhugger grow big without consuming mass (I know, this is in line with the regular alien series)...<br />6. Has the scientists never heard of \\"dangerous microbes\\" when they decided to take off their helmets?<br />7. Why did they let the robot mess around and press every button on the ship?<br />8. The main character played by Rapace gives birth to a squid alien, and she just shrugs it off and everyone else is fine about it?<br />9. The billionaire old guy who is suppose to be dead suddenly shows up near the end - and everyone conveniently ignores him/is fine about it.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Ok where to start? First off, plot wasn't bad. There were points that I really liked. The fact that it was a college setting was really nice. I am getting a little tired of high school settings. I liked that it was a full college campus and that it had the little \\"Fight Club\\" action in it, although I am not really a fan of boxing, it added a little something extra to the story.<br /><br />Secondly, the characters... okay for me they were not that believable. I didn't feel connected to either Abby or Travis. Their whole relationship was all about the dependency they felt towards each other. I couldn't really relate to that I have never seen or experienced that dependency so it didn't really make me crazy about their relationship. Travis was a little obsessive too, these relationships are just not healthy and it was a little overboard I think. At certain parts of the book, the story was only about how obsessive he was with her or how she was with him.<br /><br />The plot was not all that interesting. I enjoyed the college scenery, but the overall story was not that unique really. Boy likes Girl, Girl likes Boy but doesn't want a relationship, Girl dates other boy, Boy 1 gets jealous, Boy 2 gets jealous, Boy 1 and Girl get together...
0451232852|4.0|I learned a great deal about WW I.  My father had been a marine in WW I and was wounded on the day the war ended, for which he was awarded the Purple Heart.  Like all wars, this war was totally about politics with little thought, by the heads of state, of the sacrifice of so many young men. I look forward to reading \\"The Winter of the World\\".
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Great movie, well worth the purchase and well worth watching. We will keep it in our collection to be watched many times. Will also work as a teaching tool in a classroom.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app!!!  Happy to have; because it is so easy to use and provides all the info I need in one place.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very similar yet different from 50 Shades. If you liked those books, you will love these! Good story lines.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it can seem to drag a little in certain areas but overall very entertaining!
B000067J1Y|5.0|This is an awesome movie. this movie is hilarious leslie nelson takes the show. this is one of the funniest movies since, spaceballs, robin hood men in tights and monty python and the holy graile. this is just a good movie if you want to laugh. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0525953728|5.0|Very fast reading.  Usually these type of books don't interest me, but this one sure did.  I could feel myself actually being there.  Great book highly recommend it.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|VERY BRITISH. SOMETIMES DIALOGUES ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND FOR US HERE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE POND. TURN ON CC ON THE TV. PROBLEM SOLVED. I'M IN AWE WITH THE FASHION DETAILS IN MEN AND LADIES OF A BYGONE ERA. IF WE THOUGHT THE MOVIE \\"TITANIC\\" WAS VERY \\" DETAILED\\".......WE WERE WRONG.....
0345533054|5.0|Coben is just a sensational writer.  I can't get enough of his books - they never fail to surprise me with their twists and turns.  Just when you think you've got it all figured out, he completely throws you for a loop.  I literally can't put them down.  When he releases a new novel, you can bet the TV is growing cobwebs in my house!  Absolutely the BEST suspense writer out there!!  Keep 'em, coming, HC!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game. I really liked the helps being available when I got stuck. It was challenging and fun.
B003NF0G12|5.0|This is an awesome movie. this is one of the best dramas i've seen in a long time. the story is great and the actors are phenomenal. sean connery is one of the best english actor to date. and his performance in this movie is great. For Rob Browns first movie he blew me away with such talent. this is just a good movie. it will make you laugh and cry. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B007Q0OV6Q|1.0|Sorry, LEGO.  I just can't do it any more.<br /><br />Yes, the 2 special minifigs are awesome & my boys would kill for them - but I can't justify spending $100 for 2 calendars.<br /><br />...this will be our first year without LEGO advent calendars.  They'll be disappointed, but will get over it.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|It must get boring singing standards, even when you've built a career doing so.  Krall's attempt to do something different here is admirable in theory but tedious in execution.  When I want to hear Diana Krall I'll play something else from her numerous CD's but this one will be filed with \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\" and won't likely be played again. Hopefully this is simply a diversion and not a harbinger of the rest of her career.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|There are a few things that would make this game better namely earning more coins faster. The game could also be better without having to spend real money to add coins. A game of this caliber shouldn't require the player to spend any actual currency. That being said, the graphics are great and the frequency of gifts and special coins are just fine.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Pretty much one of the greatest bands and albums of all time! It doesn't get any better than Mumford and Sons!!!
B00006HBUB|5.0|This is an awesome movie. scooby-doo is one of my favorite characters ever made. i love the show and i love the movie. the only down fall to this film is freddie prinze jr. he is a terrible fred but everyone else was good espicialy mathew lillard as shaggy he did such a good job i thought shaggy was alive. he did his character really well. this is a great movie for any scobby fan. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a great game for the price. If you like puzzles and hidden object games, this is for you. The game is fairly long also (a good thing!) If you get stuck just hit the Hint button and it leads you the right way. I usually don't give 5 stars for anything, but for the price this is well worth it. Great job Big Fish. Keep putting out great games like this and I'll keep buying them.
B009B51K9U|4.0|After two conceptual albums, Green Day went back to their roots but with a pop touch (even quite The Clash in \\"Kill the DJ\\", for example). The formula is quite effective: simple but powerful, entertaining music.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. Children can see and understand what greed can do to the humanity, the planete. Great lesson on greed, recycling, smart living. A must see!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is wonderful because it gives you such a variety of different games. This game also lets you chose what games you buy instead of going by level like other games.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|probably one of the most comprehensive memo applications available. As a user of multiple devices, this allows me to keep all my notes organized and synced no matter which device I'm accessing. What is it that you wish you had access to anytime, or anywhere? Recipes? Notes on a book your reading? Classnotes? Notes on a presentation? whatever! start it in Evermore and you can make changes from your computer, kindle, android device, iphone or ipad and the list goes on. oh, did I mention its free?
B0086700CM|5.0|it is my life I love this game every part about it is bomb.  its nu virsion is even beget than the old
B0028R3NCU|5.0|this is officially my coolest device....it has made my flash drives redundant. the small size and removeable storage makes it easy to carry around and gives me unlimited storage opportunity
B008602KQI|4.0|the story and plot lines were excellent and exactly what I had expected but some og the visual effects were a bit much even for science fiction
1401307787|5.0|The timing of me discovering this book was perfect. I was (am) in a real transitional period in my life and I'm typically living it as an emergency. I'm not a meditator at least consciously, but the insights and wisdom in this book really set me on track to truly \\"being\\" in the moment. Puts things into perspective in a clear and effective way. Highly recommend.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Ok soldier book - but not very different from the ones written by Andy mcnab and Chris Ryan. Good entertainment and maybe the truth of bin Ladens death.
0743244249|2.0|Boring didn't keep me interested.  Read bout 5 chapters and put it down. Don't reccommend .Really disappointed  hoped for good read
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|If you enjoyed their first album you will enjoy this. Some people are calling this \\"Sigh No More Part 2.\\" I do not believe this is true. I believe is it is built upon that foundation but there is a difference.
B0098VXE50|3.0|the film left alot for the viewer's imaginiation  as I know the real story of the snow white saga. the plot was hard to grasp as the wicked step mother did not live up to the origional ....
B009B50QOU|4.0|Green Day has been making music for over 25 years, and there is one thing that remains true today: They still know how to rock. For fans of 21st Century Breakdown, ¡UNO! will bring back fond memories of Green Day's iconic hooks and meaningful lyrics. There is just one or two songs that fall short; specifically, Kill The DJ. Definitely a good addition to any fan's collection.
B009B51K9U|4.0|Certainly not as meaningful or inspired as American Idiot was, but Uno sees the band return to making the accessible pop punk songs they did so well on Dookie, Nimrod, Warning, etc. Not life changing but a good listen and fans of the band will not be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|One quick note for those with insomnia: this app is likely to kill your chances at sleep. The rewards from coins are just slow enough to drag the game out until dawn.<br /><br />This game is great for killing a few minutes every few hours. It attempts to recreate the carnival game which pushes coins over a shelf but is more complex. Worth playing unless you can't find the time every few hours to push just one more coin.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you've ever played this game using real coins you will love this ADDICTING game! Hours of fun!! No quarters necessary!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|loved the ending and seeing it from mr. grey's eyes.  i think this was a perfect lead into maybe one more book from mr. greys point of view.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Juvenile game. Kids might enjoy the game.  I found it boring.  The only reason I gave it one star is because the review would not accept less.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Other reviews cover the details.  Florence Welch simply has a a voice you want to hear.  Variety on the tracks, but still that voice.  I was an instant fan. The album made me smile just to listen.  Haven't watched the DVD, music DVD's aren't my thing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Im a big fan of minecraft and the pocket edition keeps getting better! its not as good as the computer verson yet but the origonal is always the best! and mojang if your reading this \\"keep up te good work!\\" ive been playing the minecaft computer verson for a while now, i started in 1.0! and mojang this is the best game ive played! thank you so much!<br />From,<br /> a very happy person :D
B009CPEOC4|5.0|If you love Katy Perry and her music, you will love this movie.  A must see for everyone. Very entertaining.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|The sticker on the front of \\"KISS - Monster\\" couldn't be more honest. When they promise no filler and no ballads they mean it. All twelve tracks on this album rock from beginning to end. Whether written and sung by Paul Stanly, Gene Simmons, Tommy Thayer, or Eric Singer, each song is an adrenaline ride of rock 'n roll riffing.<br /><br />Just like \\"Sonic Boom,\\" every single track on \\"Monster\\" is written by one of the four members of the band. It's 100-percent KISS the way fans like it.<br /><br />It's hard to keep things rolling on a record for twelve songs but KISS succeeds where other bands fail over and over. From the first track to the last, your eardrums will be beat down by songs that bring to mind the 1980s era of the band like \\"Animalize,\\" \\"Asylum,\\" and Crazy Nights.\\"<br /><br />There's not a lot here that reminds me of the 1970's KISS albums. That might be a bad thing for some, but not true KISS Army members. I find all the eras of the band to be great in their own unique ways.<br /><br />Lyrically, the band returns to its raunchy roots on tracks like \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" and \\"Take Me Down Below.\\" Each member gets to step into the limelight on \\"Monster.\\" Paul Stanley brings his \\"take it or leave it\\" attitude to the single \\"Hell or Hallellujah\\" and \\"Freaks.\\" \\"The Devil in Me\\" and \\"Back to the Stone Ages\\" are classic self-reflections by Gene Simmons.<br /><br />Tommy Thayer's track, \\"Outta This World,\\" features the talented singer / songwriter grabbing the Spaceman character by the balls and making it his own. Eric Singer performs lead vocals on a track that reflects himself entitled \\"All for the Love of Rock 'N Roll.\\" Anyone who's ever read or heard the drummer's philosophy about life knows he practices what he preaches.<br /><br />Paul Stanley produced \\"Monster\\" with the help of Greg Collins. The outcome is a raw and rollicking sound that is an extension of \\"Sonic Boom.\\" You can hear the energy and passion they put into each song. It's evident the band was recording the songs the way they wanted to present them.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" continues to show that KISS is here to stay. Two solid records with the same lineup should put to rest any doubts in anyone's minds. The present incarnation of KISS is more than capable of continuing to deliver quality rock anthems just as they have since the band's first album in 1973. They continue to be the \\"Hottest Band in the World\\" and show it on \\"Monster.\\"recording the songs the way they wanted to present them.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" continues to show that KISS is here to stay.
