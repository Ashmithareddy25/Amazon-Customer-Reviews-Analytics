B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This is Coldplay, so of course it's awesome, but in this album they get back to their humble beginnings.  Oddly enough, they remind me of an Australian band on this album, which is an added bonus.  Their best work since Rush of Blood to the Head!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I have been a Priest fan for a very long time and have always enjoyed the twists in their music over the years, some for the better, some for the worst, but all having the Judas Priest signature sounds. When I first heard Nostradamus I was taken back and a little confused, this wasn't the Priest I've known and loved for over 20 years, or so I first thought. The more I listened the more I liked it, and before long I found myself hooked. I find that each time I listen to it I catch something new. There are shades of Priest from Rocka Rolla all the way up to Painkiller, and much more. If you purchase this album expecting another Defenders of the Faith or Painkiller you may wind up being disappointed, but if you embrace the album on its own merits and give it a real good listen you'll find that the Priest has created another classic album, that hopefully years from now everyone will realize just how great this album is.
B000LE16VW|5.0|This movie has everything: deep emotions, action, suspense, a beautiful love story, hilarious comedy...  Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are a truly beautiful couple and, of course, Demi will have you crying your eyes out.  While this is a strong heart and tear-jerker, Whoopi is amazing at relieving the stress with non-stop laughs.  Highly recommended for any collection!
B001AIRUP4|5.0|The picture is stunning, definitely one of the best Blu Ray titles i've ever seen. This is something you buy if you're looking to show off your HDTV. You can't go wrong with this, plus you get your bonus copy to put onto your iPod/iPhone to take around with you for those long trips.<br /><br />Final Verdict: 5 Stars, for being an amazing movie and for it being magnificently restored.

031606792X|2.0|I devoured the first three books of the series.  Each in a day in a half.  The whole series is an escapist fantasy and I understand that it must be treated as such, with heavy self-administrations of suspended disbelief along the entire way.    Meyer doesn't disappoint in delivering the escapist fantasy, nor does she disappoint in delivering a fast-moving, action-packed storyline.  What she DOES disappoint in is delivering a meaningful story that will resound with the reader - one that can touch us and inspire us and leave us as better people in the end.    **SPOILERS**    From the beginning of the series, Bella is made out to be the underdog and everybody roots for the underdog.  Everybody to some extent identifies with the underdog.  But the best underdogs are the ones that claw their way out of the gutter and FIGHT, tooth and nail, to the top to where they can finally revel in the reward that they have achieved.  This struggle is essential.  It is echoed in every great story that has ever touched anyone's heart - the great comic heroes, the Disney movie protagonists, etc.      Bella lacks this struggle.  Sure, there are obstacles along the way, but there is no real struggle.  There is anticipation, worry, fear, sure.  But the most Bella has to ever do is close her eyes and poke her fingers in her ears and sing LALALA, blocking out reality, until fate decides to take it easy on her and fix everything before she opens her eyes.  Her most admirable trait is her sheer stubbornness.  Meyer likes to think that she created a martyr in Bella.  She thinks that because Bella stayed quiet during her transformation so that she wouldn't hurt Edward and Carlisle, or that she told Jacob to run away with Renesmee while she stayed to fight, that she is a real hero.  But she is NOT a hero, she is just steadfastly selfish.  She sees Edward, and wants Edward, and will do anything to be happy with Edward - even if it requires breaking her best friend's heart, or her parents' hearts,or anything else.  Later on Renesmee is incorporated into this, too.  But her tunnel-vision prevents her from growing and becoming the heroine that everyone who is watching her (us, as the readers) desperately wants her to be.    Romeo and Juliet would not have been the timeless classic that it is today if the story had been effortless- if the warring families had put down their arms for the sake of their beloved son and daughter and had the miraculous happy ending that Breaking Dawn has.    Superman would not be an iconic superhero if he had no obstacles to make him stumble - if his well-being and the serious well-being of those he deeply cared the most about were not truly threatened.    As it were, no one that Bella loves is ever in danger.  Nothing seriously threatens to take away what she cares about.  We never truly fear for Renesmee because we know that the book will not end on the Volturi killing her.  We do not fear for Bella's health when she is pregnant with Renesmee because we know that there is no way for her to fall - vampirization will save her no matter what.  We know that she will not lose Jacob, because he imprints (how conveniently, at that.  Out of nowhere.  What a contrivance) on Renesmee.  We know her parents are never in danger, and what's more, they are never even really estranged from Bella so she never has to worry about that potential loss.      Despite what authors of 5 and 4 star ratings might think, I am not ranting against the \\"happy ending\\" or being bitter and disillusioned.  I love the fact that Bella was able to be happy in the end.  But the real pain is that I held Bella too high in my expectations.  I believed that she could earn happiness - that she had the potential to FLY, not just wait for everything to fall in her lap while she grumbled about life.      In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy finally escapes and it is a happy ending.  It is a REAL happy ending because he used his intelligence and strength of will to work at something better than the hand life dealt him.  And when he escapes, our souls exult for him.  If, like Bella, Andy had achieved a happy ending by moping in his cell until someone offered to grant him super powers and he then just busted a hole in the wall and walked out, it might still be a happy ending, but to a much lesser degree.    Yes, Breaking Dawn is sort of like a dream or fairy tale.  It does not have to listen to the strict laws of reality.  But in order to be the best story that it can be, it DOES need to be something we can relate to, even if remotely.  Meyer had a great premise with the Twilight Saga.  She created a cast of characters that I (for the most part) adored, and so of course I wanted to see the story fulfill its potential.    The biggest disappointment is that no one did- in a bizarre case of deus ex machina, Meyer swoops into the story time and time again with contrivance after contrivance.  So I did not hate the book but as things stand, but honest-to-God, it broke my heart to see it fall so short.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|This comic masterpiece was as big a riot for me as it was in my first viewing some 7 years prior, and it does indeed recall the satire of Moliere.  However, this time I started to find the cruelty in the premise gnawing a bit at my conscience.  Perhaps it was the chance in a second viewing to study the characters more than the plot, whereby Monsieur Pignon appeared too affectionate and likeable to ridicule for sport.  I might have even tweaked the ending to inflict the final comeuppance on Pierre Brochant with NO help at all from Pignon.  But then I reminded myself that THIS IS AFTERALL JUST A FARCE, with Pignon in the end no less a fool than, say, Stan of \\"Laurel & Hardy\\" or Norton of \\"The Honeymooners\\".  And no less so than previously, I found myself getting caught up in the sequence of comic errors that continued to build upon itself.  The inclusion of Pignon's boss for collateral victimhood added an extra dimension to his role in that sequence.  The most brilliantly crafted thread was the way Pierre's predicament was compounded with each acceptance of Pignon's helping hand!  I'm putting aforementioned sensitivities aside in grading the movie for its content - a solid 5.
B001BMKOZW|2.0|Unlike most of the other reviewers, this album is a disappointment for me, but not a surprise.  I've only listened to it 7 or 8 times so far, but the combination of Daron's mainly inane and repetitive lyrics and flat vocals is leading me towards just putting the disc away.  For me SOAD has been on a downhill slide from day one, with their debut being one of the greatest discs ever, Toxicity and Steal being just fantastic, Hypnotize/Mezmerize at pretty good, Serj's Elect OK, and now this.  For comparison I estimate I've listened to the debut start to finish at least 300 times over the years and it continues to get better.  I just have to hope the hiatus will end but lead to a creative revitalization and another round of brilliant music.
B00000I07R|5.0|I'm a huge Bon Jovi fan and love everything they do, and this album is no exception.  It contains \\"In These Arms\\" and \\"Bed of Roses\\" -- two great ballads written in a way that only Bon Jovi can write them!  \\"I Believe\\" is a fabulous driving-in-your-car song and the lengthy \\"Dry County\\" is beautiful and moving, with a long guitar solo.  Every track on the cd is a good one!
B00005JCAA|5.0|What a movie! What dialogue! What superb writing and execution of a lovely story.<br />Truly a movie of just magic. Brad Pitt is so convincing and seriously one of his best roles ever.<br />Anthony Hopkins and the actress who plays Susan... remarkable to say the least.<br />The most beautiful movie in the world...

031606792X|4.0|I became \\"enraptured\\" by the Twilight saga earlier this summer, reading all four books within a month's time and also locating and reading the first chapter of \\"Midnight Sun\\" on Stephenie Meyer's website.  I am a true fan of this series, yet I wouldn't call myself fanatical (yet).  I love romance novels, having read countless stories over the years, because I'm all about the \\"happy ending.\\"  I want to feel GREAT when I finish a book.  I want to fall in love with the characters myself and  experience vicariously their ups and downs on their way to love, peace, and happiness.  And I don't think there is ANYTHING wrong with a character getting everything she's dreamed about by the end of the tale.  After all, fiction is one of our greatest forms of escapism from the boring realities of everyday life.  So reading about somebody I've grown to care about--somebody I can identify with through his or her insecurities and imperfections--win life's lottery so to speak, is a fabulous emotional experience for ME as well as the character. This experience is what Stephenie Meyer gave to me when she created Bella, Edward, et. al., and I thank her profusely for it.    What has me flabbergasted about this series is how completely polarizing it is.  I have never see such a rabid \\"love it/hate it\\" reaction from such a broad base of readers.  Politics is close, but still comes in second in terms of people FEROCIOUSLY taking sides on an issue.  (Believe me, I have already been verbally attacked for another thing I posted!)  My question is WHY?  I will offer that Breaking Dawn was not my favorite of the series, but it was certainly a worthy ending.  I would give Twilight and Eclipse 5 stars each, and New Moon and Breaking Dawn 4 stars each.  For me.  For the amount of enjoyment I got out of reading each, and satisfaction with each book's overall story arc/ending.    What I ask here is:  For those of you who absolutely did not care for Breaking Dawn because THE STORY did not go in the DIRECTION YOU WANTED--not because you think SM doesn't know how to construct a proper narrative--WHAT exactly were you expecting to see happen to these characters?!  Because all the posts from the naysayers that I've read here and on other boards are generous in their vitriol for the ending of this series, the lack of characterization, the implausibility, etc., yet NOBODY that I've come across has actually taken the time to tell me what exactly THEY expected to HAPPEN in this final book!  WHY is Meyer's ending for characters she arguably holds more near and dear to her heart than ANY of us so \\"bad/wrong/unacceptable?\\"  I really want to know where you who criticize would have taken these characters instead.  Because I think what Stephenie Meyer did was quite in keeping with the spirit and progression of each book.  Instead of just ripping apart a story you didn't feel was worthy of your time, please give me a constructive summary of how YOU would have ended the saga, so that I may better understand why you all hate Stephenie's ending so much.  Because I don't understand why \\"happiness\\" has all of a sudden become a four-letter word.    Thank you.
0743454537|4.0|i loved this book. i tred jodi picoult's book very carefully becasue afetr reading the pact, i think they are all sad. offcourse i knew this one was going to be sad when i started reading it. but either way it stil takes you by surprise when it gets there.<br />you get to know the characters in a way that makes you feel for all of them and what they're going through. you cant hep but agree and hate agreeing all at once.<br />i don regret reading it at all. this book was amazing and Anna's voice is so strong you hear it even after the book is finished.<br />Jesse is easy to love even though he is the troublemaker, his actions are valid and natural.<br />i loved it and i would recommend everyone to read and ask yourself, what would you do?<br />at first i thought i knew and that the answer was simple and in black and white. the truth is there's so much gray that it over clouds everything.<br />my 4 stars was due to the ending. not anything else.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A series produced by the BBC and narrated by Dr David Attenborough; it turns out to be an electrifying  testament to Planet Earth. Technically, the 5 DVD's are excellent; great video and superb audio.<br /><br />This is a series that basically spans the globe bringing us stunning visual accounts of the wildlife on our world; in the air, on land and under the oceans, from pole to pole, from desert to tropical forests. There are moments ranging from motherly tenderness to stunning hunts of predators and prey; some will leave you breathless.<br /><br />Each DVD tends to deal with a particular area or topic. One doesn't have to delve far into the first disc to realize that someone, somewhere has spent countless hours (mostly just waiting for the right moment) to obtain these unique and unbelievable shots/films.<br /><br />My highlight of the entire series was from disc one; an immense great white shark (previously hidden beneath the surface of the ocean), leaps completely out of the water to devour a poor unsuspecting seal. This spectacle is presented to you, the viewer, in slow motion; the actual event is stunningly quick, violent and takes place within less then two seconds. Talk about being at the right spot at the right time (unless your the seal, of course), to actually film this incredible footage. .<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A 5 DVD collection; professionally filmed, edited and narrated. It will make you aware of the beauty, yet savage potential that encompasses some of the less traversed areas of our home planet.  5 Stars...more if I could.<br /><br />R. Nicholson

B0017MO10U|5.0|Really enjoyed this. Got it a couple of weeks ago and have watched it twice already, actually did a whole SG1 thing with this film and The Ark of Truth this past weekend, told the wife is was all based on fact, so she left me alone. Sure hope this is not the end of it all. Anyway this film and 'The Ark of Truth' are well worth the money and you will not be sorry you bought them.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|DO NOT BUY THIS!!  IF YOU DO, AND PLAY IT IN YOUR CAR, YOU'LL BE UNABLE TO STOP SINGING IT AND THEN EVERY NIGHT YOU WILL HAVE ONE SONG IN YOUR HEAD AND THEN WHEN YOU AWAKE YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER TUNE IN THERE!!!!    So FAIR WARNING--don't blame me when you go insane!!    ...now I've got to go cos this one's my fave and I have to get up to do the hand motions too...    \\"don't go wasting your emotion lay all your love on me...\\"    JUST GO BUY IT FOR GAWD'S SAKE!
B000063DHK|4.0|Iron Maiden cuts loose with some of their staples - like \\"Run to the Hills\\" and \\"Number of the Beast\\" - but also showcases some of the tracks you don't always hear, like \\"Flight of Icarus\\" and \\"22 Acacia Avenue.\\" The album is very solid throughout, and even its weak points are pretty darn good. I would have liked to see a little more vocal energy on a few of the tracks - Bruce Dickinson really can own the songs sometimes, and when he doesn't you can really tell. That's not to say he's not good on those tracks, but when he goes all out they are exceptional. Still, this album is a must for all Maiden fans, with the definitive cut of \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" and some other essential tracks.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I love Jason Mraz.  What a cool style he does.  Really makes you want to just  chill out and enjoy life while listening to him.  He has a really pleasant voice and just a fabulous overall sound and rhythm.
B00166QJRU|5.0|A wonderful performance by the Spiders from Mars. It showcases, Bowie and Ronson in the early years  Ronson's back up vocals, blend well with Bowie's early sound.  Wish I could have been there!
B00005JPO1|5.0|Honestly, I was dragged to this film.  So, how surprised was I that I loved it.  I was concerned about Ford's age and how he would play the character of Jones.  They found the perfect balance in the film for him.<br />The movie was filled with action and humor like the first.  Le Bouef was a great attribute and will hopefully continue on with the films.
B00005QGAT|3.0|I got this from the company when I worked there, I opened it and I played it and the sound was so bad I took it out and I lost the CD itself. I kept the case because I have a copy thats missing the case, so its worth buying if u have an old one missing the case.
B00168ML1G|5.0|This was a fabulous movie.  If you like the Comic book genre, this is one of the best out there.  Tony Stark was an awesome character.  Robert Downey Junior delivered the character incredibly.  I would definitely see it repeatedly, loved it.<br />But, it really is a shame if you missed the opportunity to see it on the big screen.  It is a great movie theater film.
0385720920|4.0|If you pick this book up, don't even bother looking at the back cover, what is written there cannot even begin to tell you what you are about to read.  I picked this book up based off of a few different people's recommendations and hearing the author's name dropped by several of my favorite authors.  I had been told over and over how absolutely hysterical this book is, so of course I had to read it.<br /><br />First let me warn you this book is not for everyone... in fact it's not for most people, but there is a select group out there that this book is perfect for.  In this book you will find addictions, depravity, sex acts of all kinds, death, pain, obsession, profanity, blasphemy, and enough repetition to drive an English major insane.  But don't let that stop you from reading... this is actually a very strange yet disturbingly profound book.<br /><br />Short Summary: Our title character is a sex addict who fakes choking in restaurants to make people feel like heroes... he's had a terrible childhood with a completely insane mother who kidnapped him on multiple occasions.  She's now in a home and is fast approaching her end, while her son, Victor, attempts to deal with his past, his problems, and his future.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book about redemption, this isn't it.  Victor is a failed med student who is riddled with psychological problems raging from sexual addiction to severe childhood trauma.  He wanders through life searching desperately for meaning, purpose and hope... all while fighting to keep from being a \\"good guy.\\"  The only truly multidimensional character in the story is Victor, and the book is told stream of conscious from Victor's point of view.  Victor behaves badly and fights to mentally defend his behavior to both the reader and himself.  We swap between the current day and his childhood, or actually his memories of his childhood which are told with a bitterness not toward his mentally unstable mother, but toward himself.<br /><br />Victor is filled with a deep rooted self loathing that comes across clearly to the reader, however he constantly defends his actions and feelings but his defense is hollow.  It is clear that he knows that his life is pathetic and his future is going to be devoid of true happiness should he continue on his current path.  As a reader you follow his mental wanderings, excuses, and find yourself hoping that he latches on to something healthy.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much of the plot away, although there really isn't much of a plot.  This is more of a character study of an addict, and addict who knows that things should be different but rejects and rebels against society to the point that he cannot even comprehend a healthy existence.  As I said this book will not be for everyone, it is harsh, gross, filled with bodily fluids, depraved sexual acts, profanity and bad choice after bad choice.  Most of supporting cast is filled with stereotypes and one dimensional jokes, also the way that this is written is very repetitive and the style will be jarring to many readers.  It is not an easy read to whip right through due to the way that it is written.  I am glad that I read this book, but I don't really know who I know that I would recommend it to.<br /><br />Oh, and yes, parts of this book are very funny... but on the whole I was left feeling rather sad for the people in it.  Perhaps I'm just feeling sensitive today, but the hopelessness of the situations that these people put themselves into is a rather sobering idea.  The concept that keeps reiterating itself through the book is the idea of reality and who we are, do we create ourselves or do we let society decide who we are... if we try to fight against society are we just dooming ourselves to unhappiness and ultimate misery?ted self loathing that comes across clearly to the reader, however he constantly defends his actions and feelings but his defense is hollow.

B000002U82|5.0|This is such an incredible work.  It is almost like an opera.  Just well thought through, the musicianship is of the highest level and the creativity is amazing.  Note, that while many people do, you do not have to get stoned to listen and fully enjoy this album!:)<br />It is an album that you turn on and just sit back and listen to.  A main event for the first time listener.
B00013RC8O|4.0|If you love cars and movies with no real purpose this is a must see movie.  Any diehard car fan will appreciate the thrill of watching a Dodge Challenger running across the western country side.  The ending is a bit disappointing though.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Nightmare before Christmas is sooo fantastic.  It should have one so many awards.  Elfman is amazing.  He wrote the score and does Jack's voice.  The story is creative, visually it is stunning , and the score is timeless.<br />We love this movie in our house.  I don't think Elfman has received his due recognition for this film.
031606792X|4.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />She could have written much better then what was written. The way she made Bella not want to give up her \\"nub\\" just to put Edward in pain isn't like how Bella would really react. Seeing Edward in Pain was difficult. Also It was Odd when Jacob Imprinted on Her Baby what kinda bulls*it is that.
031606792X|4.0|I liked it. It's 100 times better than New Moon which was just long and boring. My biggest problem with it was that all of a sudden Edward started calling Jasper, Jazz, and Emmett, Em. It was really annoying and it's not like their names are that long. Also, if your going to have your characters call their brothers by nicknames you would start with the first book. They've only been together as a family for about 50 years or something. They would have their nicknames set.
031606792X|4.0|I have loved the Twilight series. Twilight is my favorite of the series, partially I think, because that is when the characters are introduced and everything is new.   I love how Stephenie expanded on the first book and developed the story line and the characters.  The fourth and final book wrapped up all the details that were just hinted at before such as:   1) Bella's shield from Edward's mind reading becoming a shield to protect her family  2) Bella needing to keep Jacob in her family, although it ended up being in a way that suprised many. Once Bella became pregnant, I saw the imprint coming!  I was a little disappointed that there was no big fight scene. Jane should have been destroyed. I do see, however, that Stephenie was showing how Bella changed from being so \\"breakable\\" to being the strong one. I liked that.  Looks to me that Stephenie is using Breaking Dawn to set up a sequel with Jacob and Nessie (don't like the name either). I would be most excited to read it.  I would recommend this series to anyone. It was great to see how Bella and Edward's love was expressed without having to go into details that would give the series and \\"R\\" rating.
0307387178|4.0|My 9th grader chose as one of his \\"optional\\" summer reading books.  I  read \\"Into Thin Air\\" years ago, so liking Krakauer, gave this one a try.  Good, quick, easy read.  Well done Jon!
0790731452|5.0|Mars Attacks! is the best Martian/Alien movie of all time, with an all star cast and an understandable plot.    The US President finds satallite photos of UFOs coming toward Earth, and they prepare a WELCOME type-thing. But these aliens haven't come to negotiate with us, they have come to exterminate us! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!  And we must kill the aliens before they do us!    Cast of characters:    Jack Nicholson: Plays the role of the US President who finds the photos the the UFOs coming toward Earth. He also plays a Casino/Hotel owner Art Land, who focuses on his hotel other than the Martians and tries to invite them into his hotel.    Glenn Close: The US First Lady who thinks they're ugly when she first sees them. She thinks that we should \\"Kick the crap out of them\\" after she sees them kill people.    Annette Bening: Wife of Art Land who thinks the Martians have come to help us restore Earth. SHe changes her mind after the first invasion.

B00000IREA|3.0|The Good Things<br />*The film has good video quality.  A few color shifts and particles on the print perhaps, but is mostly clear, sharp, and colorful.<br />*Some parts are actually pretty cool.  The angelic alien and the Black Queen are great, and there are one or two neat fight scenes.<br />*Some symbolism (particuarly some phalyc symbols).<br />*Acting is not bad.  A few good lines.<br />*The costumes are excellent (although some people may find them too outlandish).<br />*Some sets are great, with imaginative designs and props.  As noted below, however, other sets are awful.<br />*It is presented in Widescreen.  Includes English and French audio.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Some sets are great.  Other sets are just plain terrible.  Barbarella's ship is made of ugly brown shag carpet and moves in pretty lame ways to unconvincingly simulate movement. Another set was made entirely out of bags of air.  On the other hand, this may just be something else great to laugh at.<br />*Jane Fonda seems to act pretty well in this film, but her character is terrible.  She acts stupidly and shows hardly any backbone.  She's attacked by little dolls and birds, and she's so helpless! Maybe it's just the times, but I would have liked it much better if Barbarella was actually a strong and intelligent person instead of a ditz.<br />*The plot is unremarkable.  Barbarella has a task to find a mad scientists.  She winds up falling from one peril to another, almost always as a result of dumb luck more than anything.<br />*Not for kids.  Contains some nudity, a bit of violence, and other parts of implied sexuality.<br />*No subtitles.<br />*No special features.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*Some parts are completely laughable, usually unintentionally.<br />*This whole film must have been made by hippies.  Aside from the outdated styles, there's also a lot of talk of peace (\\"Now why would anybody want to create a weapon?!\\" she asks...), love (\\"love\\" becoming a universal salutation apparently), and free love (which runs rampant throughout).  The whole film is loaded with ideas like this; some people may enjoy them, others may hate them.  I found it very laughable.<br />*Special effects may be slick for its time, but are notably outdated.  It's similar to \\"Fantastic Voyage,\\" only worse.<br />*Goofy sound effects.<br />*The music is very groovy and upbeat, adding to the psychedelic feel of the film.  Some people seem to like it.  I hate it.<br /><br />This film is so bad, you'll either love it or hate it.  The whole thing plays out like a sci-fi/fantasy version of \\"Austin Powers.\\" There is a whole world of better sci-fi and fantasy, but if you want extreme cheesiness, this is the best in that regard.<br /><br />I've seen a few scant bits of information, indicating that Robert Rodriguez is trying to remake the film.  He can't do any worse than this, so I'll be looking forward to it...whole film is loaded with ideas like this; some people may enjoy them, others may hate them.

It's similar to \\"Fantastic Voyage,\\" only worse.  *Goofy sound effects.  *The music is very groovy and upbeat, adding to the psychedelic feel of the film.  Some people seem to like it.  I hate it.    This film is so bad, you'll either love it or hate it.  The whole thing plays out like a sci-fi/fantasy version of \\"Austin Powers.\\" There is a whole world of better sci-fi and fantasy, but if you want extreme cheesiness, this is the best in that regard.    I've seen a few scant bits of information, indicating that Robert Rodriguez is trying to remake the film.  He can't do any worse than this, so I'll be looking forward to it...
B0019HQIFE|5.0|If there's one thing that John Mayer makes clear on this concert release, it's that he's not just the handsome pop-rock star that he has been painted as throughout his rise to fame.  Mayer is really a man of two talents:  A knack for catchy singer-songwriter radio hits, and some serious talent on blues guitar to the point where he's played with the likes of Eric Clapton and Herbie Handcock.    \\"Where the Light Is\\" works as both a showcase piece and perception-breaker for Mayer, who plays three distinct sets in a single night in L.A.  The concert holds an loose and intimate feel, filmed in an appropriately conservative manner to allow viewers to observe the nuances of the performance.    Highlights include a fantastic surprise Tom Petty cover to close the acoustic set, and a surprisingly rollicking trio set where Mayer pulls out continuous blues licks like a kid in a candy store.    The fantastic visual quality of this blu-ray release is certain not to disappoint.  It will satisfy longtime John Mayer fans, as well as turn the heads of those who may have written him off in the past.  It is an excellent value by any standard, and a standout performance.

0446618306|4.0|I met Nicholas Sparks with \\"the Notebook\\" movie. Then I started reading his books. Besides \\"the Notebook\\" and \\"the Message in a bottle\\", \\"Dear John\\" brought another point of view. I have never read a soldier as the hero and throughout the book, his being a soldier never scratched my mind. That is, the author could easily made me penetrate the hero's life. From this point of view, the book is easy to read. The story absorbs you. A beautiful love story, tragic and it could take me from my life and I can say that book was really a holiday for me.

0446402389|2.0|There's about 250 pages of a good mystery novel stuck in the mud of this interminable 450 page book. First of all, it is clear that Tom Rob Smith can write well and tell a story. But my God, let's edit the fat and padding out of this book. And you can seriously start with the endless, mind-numbingly tedious imposition of his marraige and wife, which add absolutely nothing to the main story. And Mr. Smith, for future reference, a little atmospheric Stalinist detail goes a long, long way. As do a character's interior monologues.     This novel is essentially untouched by an editor's hands, or else a decision was made that readers would put up with plodding through all the added, unnecessary pages in search of more details about the actual mystery.

031606792X|1.0|Stephenie Meyer & the publishers advertised this book and promised \\"it will take your breath away.\\" Well, I read it and still had all my oxygen in tact. What a major disappointment. Absolutely nothing in this book shocked or surprised me. It was completely predictable and I felt as though it were written by a fan. As I read the book, I wanted to accuse her of ripping off the work of some fanatical and dreamy 15 year-old. Where was this promised excitement? What sacrifices did Bella have to endure? What was the point in making TEAM EDWARD & TEAM JACOB decals with the re-print of Eclipse if no choice was to be made at all? I thought it was creepy Quil imprinted on Claire & thinks it's even creepier Jacob imprinted on Bella's daughter? What will he tell her one day: \\"I couldn't have your mom but you look like her so you'll do?\\" In the world Meyer created, no child should have been born in the first place. Why are the men able to procreate but women cannot? And this impending battle? It felt like a balloon being blown up and you wait for it to pop; rather than bursting, someone just lets the air out. I am a huge JKR fan and I couldn't imagine during the looming battle between Harry & Voldemort there would ever be a point when Hermoine would burst into the

No tengo objeciones con el contenido de esta formidable serie, pero sí con la edición que he recibido, que es la que se comercializa en la actualidad. Me parece una desconsideración con el mundo latino que no vive en norteamérica no disponer de subtítulos en español, en especial con el mundo latino sordo. A lo anterior cabe agregar que, para quienes podemos oir, el doblaje al español de este producto es de pésima calidad.
0743289692|5.0|In her book \\"Infidel,\\" Ayaan Hirsi Ali acknowledges several people who made it possible for her to survive the Islamic tribalism she grew up under in Africa, to escape to Holland after her father arranged for her to marry a man she didn't love and to prosper thereafter. But if I were to cite one overriding factor that saved her, it would be the Western novels she read.     Throughout \\"Infidel,\\" Ali brings up these books again and again, particularly in regard to love, sex and marriage. To understand their impact, it's important to recognize the mind-numbing, repressive culture she had to endure. Ali was born in Somalia to religious, clannish Muslim parents, and her mother taught her to memorize old chants of war and death, raids, and camel herding, and female Somali poetry that never mentioned love, which is, she writes, \\"considered synonymous with desire, and sexual desire is seen as low -- literally unspeakable.\\"    Fortunately, Ali and her family moved to non-Muslim Kenya, where she attended a British colonial-based school and learned English. There she read \\"1984,\\" \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and tales by the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen.    \\"Later on there were sexy books: Valley of the Dolls, Barbara Cartland, Danielle Steele,\\" she writes. \\"All these books, even the trashy ones, carried with them ideas -- races were equal, women were equal to men -- and concepts of freedom, struggle, and adventure that were new to me.\\"    Here are some other excerpts:     \\"[T]he spark of will inside me grew even as I studied and practiced to submit. It was fanned by the free-spirited novels ... Most of all, I think it was the novels that saved me from submission. I was young, but the first tiny, meek beginnings of my rebellion had already clicked into place.\\"    \\"I always found it uncomfortable to be opposed to the West. For me, Britain and America were the countries in my books where there was decency and individual choice.\\"    \\"I knew that another kind of life was possible. I had read about it ... [T]he kind of life I had always wanted, with a real education, a real job, a real marriage ... I wanted to become a person, an individual, with a life of my own.\\"     \\"Infidel\\" is a great study for someone who would like to (further) concretize the crucial, life-sustaining role that art plays in man's life.       ~ Joseph Kellard  Theainet1@optonline.net
B001BGTWXI|5.0|...with many of the maggots out there.  I think that this is still a good metal album, and still maintains the essence that is Slipknot.  Yes, it features some slower music, but these are still both musically and lyrically sound.  It makes for a much more flowing album, a la Pink Floyd; it is very theatrical.  Rather than being a deviation from the norm for this band, I see it as a natural evolution from their past.  They want to add slower songs, more melodic songs, and as long as the band is up to it, so am I.  I'm enjoying, can't get enough, and I want more!
B00007LTIB|4.0|I have the Atlantic release, without bonus tracks. Sound quality is good, but Yes adopted a very active atmosphere on Relayer. The result is a very hypnotic, sharp-sounding album that makes me want a shower if I don't have enough sleep prior to listening to it. Gates of Delirium has some very pretty moments in it, but I'm not content with the album as a whole. If you haven't already, get Tales of Topographic Oceans for some better Yes.    Update: I've had this album for over a year now, and it has really grown on me. The music really does outweigh the sound of the recording, and even makes the latter more fascinating. The sound is frequently jammy and meandering, but the sequences in Gates of Delirium are both catchy and interesting. Sound Chaser is built of contrasting sections that range from frenetic to groovy to dark to something akin to disco. To Be Over conjures images of rural island villages with its pentatonic opening and Steve Howe's Coral Sitar. Overall, a cool album.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Excellent! I have watched this movie many times and had the VHS tape, so I was amazed at how much of the actual movie I hadn't seen. Old versions cut off the sides for 4:3 TV formatting. If you have a wide screen TV, you definitely need to get this and watch the whole movie.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I am very pleased with the product I received and will continue to do more in the future.
0375428550|5.0|I highly recommend this book for intermediate users who are already familiar with English usage but are looking for a quick review to familiarize themselves with the test format. Every test has its own strategy and so does iBT, which is very different from the PBT or CBT.     This book delivers the best 'strategies' to crack each part of TOEFL iBT. The strategies are very easy to understand and are very practical.   I spent two days studying this book (and only this book), and received a satisfying score of 110 (out of 120). However, this book will NOT teach you so much about the basic knowledge for English grammar, structural writings, vocabs, etc. So if you need help in these fields, I'd recommend buying other books to complement your study. Good luck for the test!
B001CB8NQE|1.0|The introduction of Stargate Atlantis brought a new lease of life to the Stargate theme.  Unfortunately, despite the excellent scripts I found the original Stargate series to be in general boring and mundane.   This was largely due to poor casting.   All of the actors in that series are what I would describe as being straight actors and actresses.  They lacked the X factor.   One could ask well what is the X factor?   In truth it cannot be described.   You either have or lack it.   Perhaps a simple description of this factor is that it is someone who has dynamics, charisma, personality, and character.   Further, they are able to bring a large array of facial expressions and mannerisms to their acting.  In other words they have the ability to captivate their audience.   With the introduction of Ben Browder and Claudi Black the original Stargate series was instantly transformed into a superb series.  But needless to say that just when a perfect casting balance was achieved the powers that be decided to end the series.  Returning to Stargate Atlantis, the first three seasons were and are superb.  Indeed, I had no hesitation in purchasing these seasons on DVD.  Try as I may I could not find a single fault with any of the episodes.   The casting was perfect, the scripts and story lines excellent, and the acting and special effects superb.   Unfortunately, season four is a disaster.   The positives of this season are that the scripts, stories, and special effects continue to remain superb.   However, these are negated by the fact that two of the three characters that bring dynamics to the series have been dropped, namely Paul McGillion (Dr Carson Beckett) and in particular Torri Higginson (Dr Elizabeth Wear).   These two together with David Hewlett (Dr McKay) bring the series to life.  All three have the X factor that is required in order to make a series or movie successful.  It seems to me that the powers that be are trying to gradually introduce the redundant actors and actresses of the original Stargate series into Stargate Atlantis thus introducing the same mistakes.  It is possible to replace a straight actor with a dynamic actor but not visa a versa.   Torri Higginson brought charisma, personality and character to Stargate Atlantis, together with superb acting.  Amanda Tapping is a straight actress and I am sorry to say that she fails miserably in replacing Torri Higginson.   Amanda Tapping would be more suitably placed as a member of an SGC team or working in a lab with say Dr McKay.  Compare the two actresses and notice the charisma, personality, character, and wide variety of facial expressions and mannerisms that Torri Higginson brings to her role when compared to Amanda Tapping.  It is noteworthy that both Paul McGillion and Torri Higginson appear in different roles in season four all but too briefly.  During their brief appearances the season was again brought to life but faded rapidly with their exit.   May I please offer the directors some advice for the sake of resurrecting the life of Stargate Atlantis?  Both Paul McGillion and Tori Higginson need to appear in as many episodes as possible in season five.  Amanda Tapping needs to take on a different role if she is to be successful in this series, and a suitable replacement is needed with similar characteristics to Torri Higginson. I will not be blindly purchasing season five on DVD until I have watched it on the television.   It may well be that I will have to cut my losses and make do with the first four seasons of Stargate Atlantis and then purchase the final season when ever that may be.

In fact we are using it as part of her therapy to recovery. We read the book out loud together and it has opened my friend up to discuss her own feelings and perceptions about her condition and spurred her on to get stronger.

B001DDBCUU|5.0|First, I find it hilarious that of the 4 reviews that give this just one star, 3 of them are written by men. The other seems to be a female of dubious maturity. This is entertainment people. Nothing more, nothing less. I can easily see why some would be disappointed in it, if they've sat with the series from the beginning. I, for one, enjoyed it, for what it was. Something fun to watch that killed some time on a Saturday afternoon. I felt they kept the characters true to the series. They could so easily have wrapped up a happily ever after for everyone but we are left with Samantha being... well.. Samantha. Of all the characters I wanted to see change for the better, she was the one. But again, I fully understand why she did not. I will buy the DVD when it's released, mostly because I have the whole set from of the series anyway. And because I will watch it again as it will be worth the time.
B000OCZD60|5.0|This is the BEST version of the movie I have seen ( I bought it on VHS and DVD) and by-far this version beats them ALL hands down!! Too bad HD-DVD is no more, I guess I will buy it on Blu-Ray next!!
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I bought this movie for our 2 year old son, and he LOVES it! We've probably watched it every day for 3 weeks straight, and I'm actually not sick of it yet! The animation is amazing on Blue Ray; in some of the scenes, the cars actually look real. And there are so many little details that went into this movie that make it really special, like how the engine noises of the different types of cars are accurate (like the purr of the Porsche).<br />My favorite scenes are Guido's 3 second pit stop, and the tractor tipping scene (I crack up every time Mater says, \\"That's Frank!\\")<br /><br />This is a fun movie to watch, even if you're not a racing fan. And I think this is a cute movie for kids of all ages. Every day when we come home, our son says, \\"Mama, wace car, wace car!\\"
1878424319|5.0|This book embodies the \\"It's not me, it's you\\" theme.  It is a quick read, and something you should read weekly.   I loaned it to a friend and they never gave it backso I'm buying it again!  One should live by the 4 agreements!  REALLY---I'm trying!

B001BKXUOQ|2.0|All hope of me buying anything else that bears the name \\"Slipknot\\" is in fact gone. This is not Slipknot. This is Corey Taylor having some radio success with Stone Sour and carrying it over to Slipknot.     If you have heard Pyschosocial and All Hope is Gone, you have heard the two best songs on the album. Save your 15 dollars for something better.    Oh, and the DVD that came with it is absolute garbage.     You have been warned.

0307386171|2.0|After watching atonement, I wanted to read more material by Ian McEwan.. so this was my choice.  Wonderful pose and writing style, but I couldnt say I enjoyed the story.  I kept wanting to like it and hoped it would get more interesting.  In a nut shell it was about a newly married virgin couple that goes into their mind process of dealing with sex and flashback to how they met and their interaction with the rest of the world; which seemed a little off for the period of the book.  I will try another of Ian's book, but this short novel lacked subtance.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|the only thing that \\"vol.3\\" lacked was its aggressiveness. \\"all hope is gone\\" brings that back to the table. songs like \\"gematria\\" and \\"vendetta\\" are by far the heaviest songs you're gonna hear from the band.\\"snuff\\" is a great acoustic while \\"gehenna\\" is sludgy and moody. \\"psychosocial\\" is pure classic slipknot while \\"sulfur\\" is very stone sour esque. what makes this album better than \\"vol.3\\" is that the band is much more tighter. this time around when it came to making the record, they were much more focused than on \\"vol.3\\" (if you recall, during the making of vol.3 rick had to sit all the members down and get them to get along because none of them weren't speaking to one another) and got right to buisness. dave fortman did a great job with the production on this album. i didn't think that he'd do as good as rick..but he did. a disasterpiece they have made once again.

B0014Z4OL6|3.0|\\"The Color of Freedom\\" (also known as \\"Goodbye Bafana\\") is based on the memoirs of James Gregory, South African prison guard and censor officer, who died in 2003. The name of the book is \\"Goodbye Bafana: Nelson Mandela, My Prisoner, My Friend,\\" and you may think the book title tells all you have to know. In fact, the truth is a bit different in the film directed by Bille August (\\"Pelle the Conqueror\\"). (And I know the controversy over the original book, but I will not talk about it here.)    Though August's film is inspired by the life of a man who guarded one of the most important political figures of our time, the story of \\"The Color of Freedom\\" is not exactly about Nelson Mandela (played by Dennis Haysbert). It is more about James Gregory himself and his family - his wife (Diane Kruger) and their children - and the spiritual transformation James goes through. The story is told against the background of modern South African history, but its perspective is always that of James Gregory.    \\"The Color of Freedom\\" can be seen as a portrait of a man caught between his ideal and reality, or family and establishment. Superior officers don't like the idea of a warden talking friendly with the prisoners, much less reading Freedom Charter in secret. While watching the film, I thought his friendship with Nelson Mandela could easily jeopardize James's position and James would have to pay the price of his spiritual freedom, but ... well, I cannot disclose the plot, which I think is not very dramatic. But you may find it differently.     Dennis Haysber is surprisingly good as Nelson Mandela and Joseph Fiennes did a great job, actually his career-best acting, as the protagonist. The locations of South Africa provide beautiful sceneries and the credible backdrop for the story, but the characters of James Gregory and Nelson Mandela need to be fleshed out more, especially the latter. To understand the changes that happened in James, we have to know more about Nelson Mandela and hispersonality, but the script lacks information and insight, which could have made the film much better.
0553805460|1.0|I purchased this book on a run through the airport bookstore, thinking it would be a tale of cunning akin to Bringing Down the House or a Wall Street collapse like Liar's Poker.  This book is neither.  Mr Belfort talks about his lavish spending and drug habits.  There is very little in terms of how the firm operated (duping uneducated investors) or remorse.  The last three or four pages skim over his arrest (without specifically detailing the charges) the trial, and more oafish behavior in rehab.  Instead of a sincere cautionary tale, this is a crass, boisterous account of a manipulative hack.  Maybe more jail time would make him remorseful.
B00164DWEA|4.0|Compared with \\"Hulk\\" made back in 2003, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" looks much more action-packed and fast-paced as if trying not to be like its predecessor directed by Ang Lee. The director of the new Hulk movie is Louis Leterrier responsible for his actions \\"Danny the Dog\\" and \\"Transporter 2\\" and like the laconic hero Jason Statham played, the new \\"Hulk\\" gets to the point straight away. No more father-and-son conflict; no more talky script; just a quick introduction of Banner or the Hulk, and his love Dr. Elizabeth Ross, ignoring what happened in the 2003 film.    Edward Norton is Bruce Banner, now a fugitive working at a bottle factory in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Because of one small accident (which involves a cameo Stan Lee himself), Bruce is hunted down again, running away from the soldiers led by Gen. Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt). This time Bruce runs like Jason Bourne in the narrow streets of the town before turning into the Hulk. Then actions, I mean, the Hulk's actions begin.    The actions are supported by computer graphics, and they get bigger and bigger as the story unfolds, leading us to the climax fighting sequence in the big city. The CGI Hulk's actions are fun, but some may think they get too big or even over-the-top. But maybe we should remember that there is no point in making a movie about the Hulk without such big and over-the-top actions.    Between these actions \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" slows down to take time for character development and humor. Some ideas work, some don't. Edward Norton is brilliant as always, giving intelligence and sadness to the character he plays (plus his uncredited contribution to the script). The new cast includes Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson and Tim Ross, with amusing cameos from Rickson Gracie, Robert Downey Jr. and of course, Lou Ferrigno, but it is Edward Norton's splendid performance that really fascinates us.    Some might find the new Hulk too fast and noisy, especially those who loved the Ang Lee film. Others including me, however, will find this is exactly what they should have done five years ago.

B00166QJRU|5.0|Much better than the soundtrack live album from Ziggy Stardust The motion Picture, the band sounds raw and rocking.  Mick Ronson was brilliant of course.  I used to have the widely available bootleg of this on LP.  This package comes with some great pictures and notes in a box and of course sounds much better than my well-worn record.
B00110K62U|4.0|I bought the DVD of \\"Les Mis\\" to replace a taped version.  I am completely satisfied with the DVD except for the fact that, unlike the tape, the DVD has no subtitles to describe the events of the story being depicted by the music.  For anyone who has not read the book or seen the actual musical, the subtitles are necessary to completely follow the story.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|It didn't take all that long for Slipknot to seperate themselves from the nu-metal pack that their major label debut hit alongside in 1999.  Fast forward almost ten years later, and Slipknot is still around, consistently releasing heavy albums that marginally get better with each new release.  The eagerly anticipated \\"All Hope is Gone\\" is the best to come from the band yet, and despite what some of the negative reviews here state to the contrary, \\"All Hope is Gone\\" is pure ear candy for metal heads.  Lead single \\"Psychosocial\\" is a prime example of this, as are \\"Gematria (The Killing Name)\\", \\"Sulfur\\", \\"Gehenna\\", the title track, and \\"Child of Burning Time\\".  The album as a whole finds Slipknot's musical prowess ranging from brutal to melodic and back again, with singer Corey Taylor taking more than one cue from being in Stone Sour in terms of his vocals.  While \\"All Hope is Gone\\" may borderline on being a little too long, it still stands as being the best thing from Slipknot to see the light of day yet, and further cements the fact that Slipknot is thankfully here to stay.
0307387178|2.0|I was disappointed in this book.  As others have said, it should have remained a magazine article because there really isn't enough substance, in my opinion, for a book.  I think the main character was part immature (for a 24 year old man) and part crazy.  I had some difficulty following the time-line.  It was never real clear to me just exactly what this guy was searching for.
B000EGFVQS|4.0|This book was a mixture of things both bitter and sweet.  The novel is written in the first person from the point of view of a 14-year-old murder victim looking down from heaven.  This isn't a 'who dunnit' mystery, however, since the identy of the murderer is given to us in the first chapter.  Instead, the story is about how Susie Salmon's family and friends cope with her death and learn to move on.      From the gruesome details of Susie's murder to the touching family moments, this book was entertaining and somewhat moving.
0930289234|5.0|The Watchman has become a classic of the graphic novel genre, and rightfully so. Interesting setting, great plot, great story telling, great story. It's got it all. If you think you might like this book, then you will.
1559211407|5.0|This book is a charming little story post WWII consisting of letters between an American novelist and a London bookshop employee.  Later, other staff members of the bookstore begin writing letters to the novelist as well, revealing little parts of their lives.  All letters written wth humor and charm. This book reveals how the written word can serve to forge friendships more lasting than the many casual face-to-face contacts we now routinely substitute for true friendship and create a deeper understanding among people in very different life situations.
B000002L61|5.0|This might be one of his most favored albums/cds but it is not my favorite.There are songs on here that I just \\"get through\\".While it is essentail Dio is not his best,IMHO. The songs on here are the typical Dio flavor and must be owned for some of the classics.    However, I recommend \\"Lock Up The Wolves\\" even more than this.LUTW offers even more of Dio on it as Dio's best vocals are on it and every track just shines.    I bought this to replace a stolen Cd.Kind of funny how Dio's stuff is also the music that is most stolen from me.:(
B00008OE4W|5.0|I first saw Sneakers when I was about 13 years old. I was fascinated beyond belief that hackers could be so powerful and that computers could be so powerful. That was back in 1993 or 94 - and it seams a world away now. One wouldn't think that Sneakers could still have any impact on people after all these years. But watching it again made me so happy. It made me realise that a good story with a great plot is much more powerful than new movies a bit like it (Die hard 4, Mission Impossible). Snearkers is not a movie with fantastic special effects. But it has a fantastic cast, and a wonderful child-like fascination of the new world of computers and the more or less promising digital future.   Buy it, if you like super comedy, a good story, great action - and being in the company of some of Hollywood's finest as Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley, River Phoenix and many more...
031606792X|5.0|My daughter just could not put this book down and now she is reading it again!
0670033693|5.0|First I would like to say, though I read continuously and voraciously, this is the only time I have bothered to write a review, I enjoyed this book that much. If you like Hillerman, Box, Harstad or mysteries in general, you have to read this book. I am having an exceptionally hard time deciding what it is about this book that has me smitten. First it has to be the characters, the banter and humor were irresistible, but the location, and the story also were captivating. I do know the only thing that I can complain about was the empty feeling I had when the book was finished, I missed the characters! I sincerely wished I could hop in the car and drive to Absaroka County Wyoming to hang out with just about every one mentioned in the book.

B000E1MTY0|5.0|This movie has a much more darker tone than its predecessors. It successfully tells how Batman was created and of Bruce Wayne's internal struggle with his alter ego. This HD-DVD has a stunning picture that does not disappoint. And, the story moves along quite nicely while keeping the movie within the realm of reality. If you are looking for a Batman movie that will entertain you from beginning to end, you've found it!
B0013L2EDQ|4.0|First of all, I enjoyed the book.  It was typical Rollins fare - out there, wild plot lines, etc.  However, what I didn't like about this book is that there was almost too much going on.  Too many mini story lines made me feel like someone was manning a channel changer when I was trying to watch a movie.  And many of the mini story lines were left hanging with no ending and some never went anywhere.  Besides that fact though, the book was a good read and certainly kept me turning the pages.
B00102FELM|5.0|I bought this DVD through Amazon Canada almost one year ago because it was not yet released to the USA.  Although there are no special features on this DVD the show itself was remarkable.  The setlist was chosen by a vote of fans on the Scorpions website.  I've been a Scorps fan since about 1982 and have seen them live 10 times since 1987.  They are one of the best live rock bands in the world and they still play shows all around the globe throughout the year.      One of the great parts of this show was the addition of some songs I've never seen live and the collobaration with three former Scorps band members from long ago to play on stage.  The audio quality is good, I can turn it up loud and enjoy the vibrating of the entire house.  Although not top notch audio quality the previous live performance DVDs I've purchased by the Scorpions have all been less than adequate in that regard.      The show was shot at the Wacken Open Air Festival, a long-running four day heavy metal festival in northern Germany, about two hours from the Scorpions original hometown of Hannover.  The Scorpions entertained the crowd of 60,000 people as the headliner of the opening night of the festival.  Most European rock crowds that I've seen on video lack the enthusiasm of their United States brethren but this crowd was good, of course they were heavy metal fans just looking for a reason to mosh.  :)      Excellent concert performance, very good video and audio quality.  A Scorpions fan must have for the collection and a GREAT way to introduce young people to the musical performance these guys offer nightly around the world!  Long Live Scorpions!
1401216676|5.0|Amazon recently recommended that I purchase The Killing Joke based on my new addiction to comic books and graphic novels. (I've also only recently gotten into video games and other things that I think that I was supposed to start liking a long long time ago...Can you say: \\"mid-life crisis?\\"<br /><br />Anyway, how timely I thought, of this Killing Joke recommendation by Amazon....A \\"new\\" Batman versus Joker story that is as \\"Dark\\" as the Nolan Brothers' most recent Batman films ([[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]] & [[ASIN:B001CXW8CW The Dark Knight]]). And it virtually coincides with the theatrical release of the latter. With Heath Ledger's (Award Winning?) performance of the Joker fresh on my mind, I couldn't resist a \\"new\\" Joker story that captured a 'Darker' Batman and a much 'Darker' Joker than the silliness of the TV series' Cesar Romero or other more tame animated versions of the villain.<br /><br />Ah, but the Joke is on me! New story??? Not!...The Killing Joke is new only if you're a noob like me that isn't in the know. This 2008 hard cover is a re-release that was originally published 20 years ago! The Killing Joke was written in 1988 by Alan Moore, and it is graphic novels like Moore's (along with those of Frank Miller...see [[ASIN:1401207529 Batman: Year One]] & [[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]) that inspired the Nolan Brothers' recent film adaptations. Therefore, indeed, it isn't The Killing Joke that has captured the 'Darkness' of the Nolan Brothers' films; it's the other way around.<br /><br />But you already knew that, right? So I won't pretend to try to think that I'm informing you about the greatness of graphic novelist Alan Moore's storytelling ability. And I won't allude to the fabulous work by veteran comic book artist Brian Bolland.<br /><br />I will strongly recommend Batman: The Killing Joke if you're unfamiliar with it and you are looking for a Batman versus Joker story that rivals the 'Darkness' in The Joker only recently introduced to the general public through Heath Ledger and the Nolan Brothers movie The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Add this to your cart...and....Smile!through Heath Ledger and the Nolan Brothers movie The Dark Knight.    Add this to your cart...and....Smile!
0345349571|5.0|Barbra Tuchman's A Distant Mirror is an excellent narrative history of the period, highly readable, and thoroughly researched.  Cast as an extended biography of a singular figure whose life almost exactly bracketed a tumultous period in the history of Europe, the book examines the social, military, religious, economic and medical fabric of one of the pivotal periods of western civilization.  Dr. Tuchman's books are always accurate and accessible, providing hours of reading pleasure, but A Distant Mirror is, perhaps, the best of her works.  Here one gets as fullsome a portrait of a remarkable man as it is possible to imagine, given the passage of almost 700 years.  Although the book is advertised as a history of the entire 14th century, the work concentrates on the latter two-thirds of the century because that period more nearly coincides with the life of Engeurrand de'Coucy and because most of the important events of the century occurred during that time frame.      I read A Distant Mirror twice during 1978 and 1984.  Recently I was moved to read the book again and was perhaps even more impressed with the third reading.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game was given to our family as a gift.  We had so much fun with it, we bought one for another family as a gift!  It is one of the most popular games at our family game nights.  It is never the same twice!!!  It is durable and easy to put away and store.
B001DHXT6G|1.0|The only thing they should have done was clean up the artifacts, pull back from the picture a bit to give it a little more scope, and put them in production order, starting with The Cage followed by Where No Man Has Gone Before, and so on. THAT'S ALL THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE! But, NOOOOOOOOOO.... they had to interject their own stupid opinion into the effects shots. I don't need to or want to see some yahoo's crazy interpretation of so called \\"impressive\\" angles of the Enterprise. I mean really, if they were going to ruin this show with \\"Lucasitis\\" they should have gone way out, like a knockdown dragout fight between Spock and Kahn in where Spock kicks Kahn's ass in Space Seed. Or have the Tribbles reveal giant fangs when Klingons were nearby.  Making phaser fire look sharper and space explosions look less cartoony, Hey, I most definitely would have been in favor of that. But for them to change just about every effects scene just shows me that these idiots playing on a computer have nothing but contempt for the great classic series. Until someone comes along and does this series the way I said at the beginning of review, I'll just stick to my original dvd releases thank you very much.
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|U WAIT SO LONG FOR A NEW ALBUM FROM PORTISHEAD ....AND THEY DROPPED THE BALL ....ONE GOOD SONG ....AND MAYBE ONE OTHER OK SONG....
031606792X|2.0|Let me begin by saying that I really enjoyed the first three books in the Twilight series.<br /><br />So I started Breaking Dawn and it almost immediately made me want to stop. I could care less about the wedding details, this book really is written for teenage girls, huh? I was about to get bored with the honeymoon when Meyers takes us to absurdity in her plot twist. I couldn't help but wonder if Meyers thought the plot was so twisted and unlike her main character that she decided to switch to another characters first person for 'Book 2'. I mean I like Jacob, I mean I really do (more thatn most of Meyer's fans probably), but I would have much preferred the books all be told from Bella's perspective. The pregnant Bella was to far a stretch for Meyer's to write I presume? That's fine, but lets edit some of these pages, does the pregnancy which doesn't last all that long, really have to take up so much of the book?<br /><br />Then the baby, Renesmee? Let's look past her ridiculous name for a moment-oh wait, that is just too hard to do. Let me gasp, sigh, and roll my eyes. OK, back to my review. Jacob imprinting on Nessie (better name choice?). I saw it coming but how I wished Meyer's wasn't going to let me down in this fashion after the first two sections of Breaking Dawn had been such a letdown, but no, she goes through with it even though Leah was a better match in my opinion. I was hoping someone in the story could form a relationship the old fashioned way but I guess not. I can stomach Bella's overcoming of most of the drawbacks to the newborn stage but Charlie coming over. Are you serious? If I wasn't so interested in just how bizarre this book could get, I would have stopped reading pages ago.<br /><br />So I try to overlook most of the bad silly things that happen and look at the positives for this tale as I am investing a lot of spare time into this 754 page book. Meyer's tries to fit the pieces together pretty well. I like the supernatural powers and even the wolf twist, I was even managing to accept the imprinting scenario as were Edward and Bella when the book was winding down-slowly-slowly-slowly through the Volturi visit when what do I come across but Jacob crying a tear the size of a baseball, a BASEBALL. This was it. I must have read this sentence 14 times. A baseball. Really. Well, that really tells me how sad he was at the prospect of losing Bella. Baseball (come back eyes, don't stay back there).<br /><br />Baseballs aren't really huge, unless you have tears the size of them. Then they are just ridiculous. I would have cried from laughing if I didn't feel so inferior to these large, perfectly rounded tears of Jacobs. I am being insensitive, aren't I? Oh well, I can't seem to help myself.<br /><br />Anyways, I had to get that off my shoulder. The book ended OK, I would have liked to have seen an actual physical confrontation between the Voturi and the rest of the vampires but I will take the ending she gave us. Hoping that it is the end.<br /><br />Stopping at Eclipse was probably best, but ending now, you know with your \\"THE END\\" page and all it's finality at the end of Breaking Dawn is respectable.managing to accept the imprinting scenario as were Edward and Bella when the book was winding down-slowly-slowly-slowly through the Volturi visit when what do I come across but Jacob crying a tear the size of a baseball, a BASEBALL.

1577316517|5.0|I loved the book \\"A New Earth\\" by Eckhart Tolle, and have found myself referring back to it often.  Then I received this deck of inspirational cards and I was beyond pleased!  This 52 card deck is perfect for contemplation and reflection.  The top of the box flips up, so you can prop a favorite card up to think on (I put a new card up each day).      This is a beautiful deck.  It's simple and elegant, yet do be careful when handling the cards to have perfectly clean and dry hands!  They get smudge marks on them very very easily.    The cards themselves appear to be divided into four groups; they have a deep blue background with white text and either an orange, green or light blue border.  Or a dark blue border with black background and white text.  At the top of each card, above the text, is a tiny picture of the earth.      The back side of the cards is the beautiful orange of the book, with a strip of blue space and stars with the earth centered in it.      The insert that comes with the deck does not explain why the deck seems to be divided into four sections - but I'm assuming that they pertain to the different levels of understanding, starting with the orange, the green, the light blue and then the dark blue.      And of course, each card contains a snippet of wisdom from the book.  Some are single sentences, others are longer - all are helpful!    \\"Whatever the ego seeks and gets attached to are substitutes for the Being that it cannot feel.\\"  From the cards.      \\"The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it.  Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking.  Separate them from the situation, which is always neutral, which always is as it is.\\"  From the cards.    \\"Very unconscious people experience their own ego through its reflection in others.  When you realize that what you react to in others is also in you (and sometimes only in you), you begin to become aware of your own ego.\\"  From the cards.    If you are like me, and highlighted all your favorite passages in the book, you will love referring to these inspirational cards when looking for a bit of enlightenment.  Even if you've never read the book, the cards are filled with simple wisdom, that while very thought-provoking is not overwhelming.    I would highly recommend this deck to anyone who is a fan of Eckhart Tolle, or anyone who is traveling a path to spiritual wholeness.  Embrace the moment and move into your Being.

It makes me wish I'd have discovered this band sooner so I could have seen them live last time they were in my town. I'm already a huge fan of their studio music, their performance here is the epitome of music being performed somehow even better than in the studio. Their emotion and power is felt in one's veins. I will pay ANY amount of money next time they come to my city. They're all key tracks. All of them. This DVD is epic.
0452289963|5.0|Years of doubt, insecurity and years of an unsettled soul suddenly became exposed and revealed for what they are:  Ego and the Pain Body.  This short and wonderful book has changed my life in monumental ways and enabled me to embrace the present moment.  No longer will I occupy my now with the past which I cannot re-live, or the future which I previously feared.     Thank you, Mr. Tolle.  I have never met you, but after reading this book I feel that I know you, and I'm absolutly convinced that you know me!  Thank you for bringing meaning to the the many incomplete bits and pieces that were previously my life.  Thanks for enabling me to finally assemble them and see that they show the true being I am, but also the magic of the World and Universe in which I live.

B00005JPY0|1.0|And I'm saying this as one of the hardcore Batman fans out there.    By Batman I mean...the comic book Batman...as that is the only Batman.  Some of the animated series was good.   Actually, all of the animated series is good.  Even the new stuff, \\"The Batman\\".    But this film.  It wasn't fun.  It wasn't upbeat.  It wasn't intriguing.  It wasn't that dark.  It wasn't a part of the DC Universe.  It didn't advance the comic books or incorporate jack squat of it.  It wasn't well-representative of the characters.    It was just a monstrous money-making machine.    The world's most overpaid, overly celebrated cast and crew one day decided to say \\"hey, let's make a lot of money we don't really need by destroying a usually awesome comic book series and overadvertising ourselves to the point where we brainwash those just as ignorant about comic books and Batman as we are\\".    And the jerks succeeded.    They succeeded thanks to one man's death, one awesome character's name and a couple of his comic book elements being imitated (lamely), inappropriate happy meal-esque advertising (give me a break ....The Joker on cereal boxes? Did those Kellogs morons not realize that this character is a MASS MURDERER in a realistic setting?)    Don't get me wrong.  The movie was not bad.  For a rental.    But there was very little about this that was Batman...  The Batman of the comic book world, for the many ignorant people who are promoting this movie, is many things...most importantly \\"The World's Greatest DETECTIVE\\".  That's how Bob Kane, the creator, made it, in Detective Comics number 27.    Do I sound like a fanboy when I type this?  I hope so.    Because this is a great character and it is sickening to see how Nolan \\"reinvented\\" this character into a realistic setting while not understanding one important, the most important, aspect of the character:  this is the most UNREALISTIC character ever!    He's completely contradictory.  He's the world's greatest detective and a mystery himself, he's a loner and a super social smooth-talker, he's a Justice League member and non-super-powered, he's the richest man in the world and gets the most hardship.    This contradiction of a character is awesome in comic book form.  But it's not a character that can ever be real and therefore, never be well-represented on film.    What else.  I could list the ways in which this film messes with the comic book details.  And I'm not talking about the Justice League stuff.  I'm talking about the \\"dark\\" realistic Batman stories.  It couldn't even get simple facts like Two-Face's love life correct.  Or the fact that Joker never mentioned a father figure in the comics.  Or, like I've already said, the fact that the most notable part of Batman is not that he's \\"dark\\", but that he's a DETECTIVE.    Nolan could have made a vigilante film in which a rich boy decides to go heroically crazy and help a sick city.  But he didn't need to screw up the nature of Batman for that goal.  There are so many rich guy anti-heroes...Iron Man, Robin Hood, Zorro (whom Batman was based off of, in part) to name a few.    A good comic book film is one that is either fun, has beautiful special effects, or brings something to the screen that would be hard to bring to the screen.    Does The Dark Knight do any of these things?  No.  And it definitely was not fun...a bunch of brooding and backstabbings is not my idea of entertainment...that's no one's idea.    Some people just get too brainwashed too easily.
B0018RWMNM|3.0|The Lonesome Dove story is good enough, and the cast is fantastic, but the quality of the images on Blu-Ray vary from ok day-time images to night-time images that resemble the same kind of grainy reception that I used to get on an old Zenith tube television set with rabbit-ear antennas in 1974.  The crop-job to widescreen format is fine, I just have a problem with shelling out \\"Blu-Ray\\" dollars for \\"rabbit-ear antenna\\" images.  As I said, it is usually the night scenes where you see this issue.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Audrey Hepburn's best movie, and a Hollywood classic if there ever was one.  I saw this movie over 40 years ago at a drive-in movie theatre, but it's even better today on my new 65\\" H.D. TV screen.  It looks and sounds better than ever.  As I think about it, it might also be one of the best performances of George Peppard as well.  And don't forget Patricia Neal.  What an actress.  Am I in love with this movie and the memory of Audrey Hepburn?  You bet . . . This is one of the few movies that I can sit through time and time again.  And this new special edition looks absolutely terrific.  You will not be dissapointed, I promise.

0307120007|5.0|This is such a timeless classic!  However, I do have a complaint regarding the packing -- the box was broken on one corner, resulting in a bent page.  Perhaps some bubble wrap would help in future mailings of this book and others that come in their own box.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|Ostensibly providing insights (funny and otherwise) into the world of rare books and the lengths some book collectors will go to...it also has \\"religious\\" overtones due to a subtheme of devil worship.  This may not be a comfortable subject for some.  However, being an avid book reader, I found the storyline extremely interesting with some surprising twists and turns.  Johnny Depp, as always, turns in a superb performance.  The supporting actors and actresses were also excellent.  There was some gratuituous (and fleeting) nudity (not Johnny! sad to report!) that didn't add anything to the story snd could/should have been left out, in my opinion.  It is a very entertaining film with a satisfying ending.
0439023483|4.0|I read this book a couple weeks ago in a galley copy and enjoyed it immensely. While it is a watered down version of Battle Royale, it is still a good story, and it shows that the author is very capable. You have a strong female protagonist which the story is told form, which makes it a much more cohesive, and definitely less visceral story, as many of the deaths that occur in the book, occur out of your field of vision.<br /><br />It is extremely entertaining, and while it certainly is not for young children(under 11 or so I would say) it is a great addition to a many peoples libraries, and it is a much safer version of this type of story than Battle Royale.<br /><br />The whole tale behind the book, is the yearly occurrence of the \\"Hunger Games\\" which is a show of power of the government over the 12 districts which it controls(it used to be 13, but they nuked them many years before) and which 2 children(between 12 and 18) from each district are pitted against one another in a battle to the death. You meet your characters form district 12, and you get a \\"love\\" story which is quite good, and mostly understated. I would definitely recommend this book and look forward to the final two volumes of the series.

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Back in the day when DVD was in it's infancy one of the very first films I purchased was Blade Runner. I told myself that I would not buy it again till a High Definition version appeared. And here it is in all it's 5 disc glory.  Anybody who has a remote interest in film can't help but have this movie in their collection. It really is a true classic that helped define a genre, and is the bench mark to which many films seem to aspire. It's art direction characters and story are second to none and yet for a time it seemed we would never see the film that Ridley Scott intended. The production was fraught from the outset with script changes, the production losing its backers and studio meddling that led to a compromised film being shown in cinemas the first time round. Time however and hind sight has seen fit to bless Blade Runner and it's visionary director with cult status and we now have the final cut of the film approved by Ridley Scott himself.<br /><br />Apart from the Final Cut of the movie this box set features all versions of the film that you could possibly want including the fabled and rarely seen Workprint. So for completists this box set is a must. I found the documentary Dangerous Days fascinating and it's a real eye opener to see how far ahead of it's time this film was. Indeed when you look at the budget this film had and what went on screen it's hard to see how todays movies cost the millions they do.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the picture and audio quality of this movie are reference. When you have seen this movie on free to air ,dvd or even vhs it's like your getting a mere glimpse of the beauty this film has to offer. And if ever there was a movie that was worth the revisionist treatment then this one is it. Some people bemoan the fact that directors are now going back and digitally altering their movies and I have my reservations. Here the alterations are for the most part subtle and are there to enhance the quality of the presentation, to bring it up to date, and to fix stuff that just wasn't able to be fixed at the time it was made. But who cares with this 5 disc set you can have whichever movie you prefer. Who knows you might get to like a different version.<br /><br />They just don't make them like this anymore, so you owe it to yourself to go get it.to date, and to fix stuff that just wasn't able to be fixed at the time it was made.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|I finally got to see what all the fuss is about but I wasn't expecting Peyton Place.  The acting is great and every word uttered is clever.  Other than that, I found an assortment of mostly dislikable people in a 60s setting, with the negatives amped up to 10.  Those who lived through the period will recall that much of what went on was not malicious, it was institutionalized.  Like smoking, a lot of people just didn't know any better.<br /><br />By the second episode, as I watched the ad man falling from the building I thought, what a downer and as far as men and women are concerned, beneath the surface, how much has really changed?

0321525655|4.0|99 percent of PowerPoint presentation sucks. So begins Presentation Zen with an introduction from Guy Kawasaki. Or I should say, the book opens with a presentation from Kawasaki. Before getting to business, author Garr Reynolds explains that Presentation Zen is an approach not a method.<br /><br />This book doesn't give you step one, two, three. If it did, the book would turn into a method. An approach provides guidelines and direction. Reynolds looks back at the history of PowerPoint along with experts' slamming the software. People forget that PowerPoint is a tool not a method. The templates, however, may be partially at fault for the bad PowerPoint-based presentations we see today.<br /><br />So Reynolds says we can keep PowerPoint, but we need to dump the templates and their bulleted lists. Instead, presenters need to go for the right brain and left brain instead of leaning on one or the other.<br /><br />The book contains three parts: preparation, design, and delivery. Preparation explores creativity, limitations, and starting work on the presentation AWAY from the computer (\\"planning analogy\\" as Reynolds calls it) using pen and paper, sticky notes or whiteboards. Reynolds shows how stories and examples can help make your ideas sticky with your audience.<br /><br />He also encourages practicing restraint. It's too easy for us to fall into the trap of using clich&eacute;s -- not just in words, but in visuals like two hands shaking in front of the globe. Don't do it. Just don't. It's been done and no longer sticks with people. Here the book discusses the use of storyboards.<br /><br />In design, Reynolds takes the reader on a trip in achieving simplicity, which we know doesn't come easy. The Zen principles come in as Reynolds covers simplicity (kanso), naturalness (shizen) and elegance (shibumi). Rather than adding to the clutter, try removing things from a slide to simplify the message.<br /><br />I love chapter six because it contains many example slides -- before and after so you can see the power of changing slides from noisy to simple. I learn well from examples and this chapter covers every aspect including balance, empty space, repetition, contrast and more. I value this chapter because it provides a variety of examples covering different topics while chapter seven examples come from other people's presentations -- some you might recognize such as Shift Happens.<br /><br />The rest of the book offers suggestions on the giving of the presentation. After all, the slides act as an accessory to the presentation. If they're the presentation and contain the whole thing, then cancel it and send the slides to the attendees. Save them a trip and a boring presentation.<br /><br />Presentation Zen as a whole combines many of the expertise we've seen or heard over the years from other experts. So it's nice to get it in one little book. I've heard some of the ideas and comments, but I also pick up new ones.<br /><br />The little book contains a neat little package that will help readers throughout the presentation process from beginning with an idea to ending with applause. It'll serve well as a reference or a read from front to back and later referencing. It won't work as the only tool as it only focuses on approach. Some folks need more than that to create a successful presentation.ore and after so you can see the power of changing slides from noisy to simple.

B00008BLAS|3.0|I bought the original vinyl of this on the back of my enthusiasm for 'We're An American Band' and was absolutely not disappointed. These guys are gutsy and project such intensity and oomph. Along with many great tracks, their 'gotta join in at a fuelled up party' rendition of \\"Loco-motion\\" absolutely leaves Kylie's later 'boopy-doop' version for dead - hands down! \\"Carry Me Through\\"'s almost ethereal (for its time) style puts you in another place, on another plane, and I defy anyone to not find themselves toe tapping away happily with \\"Little Johnny Hooker\\"!

For example, a training department had hundreds of documents and couldn't see anything anymore. After analyzing all of their work, the team created a visual process to break it down.

It may take some time to get the hang of the process and turning complicated ideas into visuals the audience can absorb with little thought.<br /><br />This isn't the kind of book where you can scan a few pages and suddenly come up with a way to explain that doo-dad.

B0017MO10U|4.0|This review contains spoilers.  Do not read if you don't want to know what's in the film.<br /><br />I liked the move because I love Stargate.  I love its characters.  However,<br />-<br />-<br />-<br /><br />The movie was completely lacking in emotional exploration of the characters.  Delving into the character impact of separation and isolation in an alternate reality, and in the case of Daniel, the loss of a limb, might have added 10 minutes of time, but it would have significantly improved the movie.  I'm tired of lazy, sloppy writing.  Stargate is a great show for its themes and characters (and actors, all of them) but it has been poorly treated by its writers.  This show needs to be given to someone else, someone who gives a d@#m about art.

B0011NVC9I|2.0|Not surprisingly, this movie is not very good. I wasn't expecting LORD OF THE RINGS here, or even DRAGON SLAYER, so I entered with low expectations.<br />Some people think video games are better forms of entertainment and artistic expression than films. I'm not sympathetic to this view. Anyone who claims this is simply expressing an ignorant and sophomoric mentality. But watching BEOWULF I would say that sometimes a video game can be \\"better\\" than the movie. These days the line between some movies and video games strictly in terms of visual style has been erased. I don't care that much for the look of BEOWULF, but by video game standards it's cool. It's plastic and feels incomplete. The nerds that crafted the digital picture did do a decent job of fleshing out Angelina Jolie, however. I want to say I have seen this style of animation done better elsewhere, but where I can't recall. I think a traditional style of animation would have served this classic mythological tale much better. I give them credit for the generous helpings of blood and guts and some of the earthy depictions of people in the Dark Ages. If you got to write a report for school don't watch this popcorn flick as a substitute for reading the story. Or reading the Cliffnotes or whatever.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|A couple years ago I was staying with family that has digital cable. Let me digress: Ever read _Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_by Neil Postman? It's worth checking out. Anyway, I was hanging around the house a lot and this movie was playing on the HBO channels. At first I wasn't too interested to be honest. You know, seemed it might be a liberal Hollywood \\"message movie\\" and the subject matter didn't particularly appeal to me. I mean romance movies aren't my thing anyway and one about two dudes is just not my cup of tea. And there was so much buzz around it cause it's the \\"gay cowboy movie\\" and people are retarded and trip, in large part because of the very entertainment industry TV shows and magazines that are mainly responsible for generating the publicity for Hollywood products. But I started catching parts of it when I was hanging out channel surfing and ended up seeing the whole thing. ANYWAY, this is a very good movie, plain and simple. I was moved by it alright? I mean it got to me. And I made a point to tell friends. It bothered me that I felt even slightly funny about telling people I know that I liked the movie. I called BS on myself.<br /><br />The motivation for writing this here Amazon \\"review\\" for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is Heath Ledger's performance.<br /><br />Seeing Ledger in this role it was perfectly clear to me at the time that Ledger was going to be one of his generation's finest actors. I've heard from fanboys a million times over how awesome Ledger's performance as The Joker is and it really is an amazing performance and I completely agree. However, long before ever seeing THE DARK KNIGHT I knew Heath Ledger was going to be a superstar. I knew well before ever even seeing a clip of him as The Joker he was going to be great as The Joker solely based on his performance in this film and that THE DARK KNIGHT would make him a star.<br /><br />I'd also add that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a much better pictire than CRASH which won for \\"Best Picture\\" that year. Ang Lee is a truly great drama film director. ICE STORM and RIDE WITH THE DEVIL are also great and unique films.

B0002KVUKW|1.0|I saw some geek on TV -no, wait, \\"geek\\" is now a positive term- some  arrogant dork on TV proclaim that video games are superior to movies. NOT in some *specific* way, just better overall. I was not sympathetic to this. Of coarse the show was about video games and how awesome they are and cool it is to spend all your time buying and playing them. If your inclined to agree with this nerd's opinion what is there left to say? Thing is, this thing here, VAN HELSING, is the best possible argument for video games being better entertainment than movies you could ever come up with. This is one of the most horrible, absurd pieces of junk I've ever come across. The whole thing is like a stupid video game. But you don't get to play. It's like when your hanging out with friends and stuck sitting there watching people play a game all afternoon. And the game is lame and nobody has any stuff and your just sitting there.

B001CXW8CW|1.0|The best thing this movie has going for it are the actors, mainly Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckheart (sp?). And Ledger got, what, ten minutes of screen time? I can watch that on You Tube. I can't believe how many people buy into this stupid s---. The worst of it seems to be an almost complete lack of story or character development and how one idea is abandoned for another. I won't even get into the plot holes. Why have people been saying the movie felt slow in spots? Because the first hour was talking. And it wasn't even interesting. You can have a movie be all talking and still be interesting (12 Angry Men and Mr. Smith goes to Washington, for example). Was this suppose to be an action movie? Is it a drama? Is it a comic book adaptation? It seems to follow nothing, goes wherever it feels like going and makes up the rules as it goes along. Not the characters, the plot. Just atrocious screenwriting and direction. If this thing gets nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, or Best Editing I'm never watching the Oscars as long as I live. I'm half way to boycotting Fox for all their recent Batman references.

This album pushes their sound in new directions, mixed with some classic DT progessive elements.  I saw their concert tour after this album came out with a giant screen of strange animation where the band members fight off a big wolf beast using their musical talents as weapons.  The animation style was similar to the animated intro to the TV show \\"TapouT\\".  It was very odd, but somehow fitting for this album's direction.    'In the Presence Of Enemies' and 'Constant Motion' are my favorite titles (To me, these are also the most classic DT)
0307386171|3.0|Plot Spoilers--    Like someone else here, I read Atonement and wanted to try another one of Ian McEwan. This was it.   I understand what he was aiming for in the fact that \\"back in the day\\", couples didn't discuss their fears of sex. The story was a good one. It flows nicely, with the evening of the wedding night being gently interrupted by their thoughts on the past. We get glimpses of why Florence has problems being physical and why Edward has fears on performance standards.   Regardless, the ending was really disappointing. Time and time throughout the book Florence really had me believing she would go through with it. She told him lets go to the room, and did small gestures for him. Florence was freaking out, but at the same time everything was flowing nicely along. She started to calm down and let Edward come toward her. As long as she didn't see his erection, she might be able to make it.  But Edward, in all the tension and excitement, accidentally \\"lets loose\\" a little early.   She basically went running from the room, he found her down by the beach and because they couldn't discuss sex like how we do now today, it was over. The best she could do for him was \\"I'll be with you, but you have to have sex with others and never me.\\" Smartly, he refused. I think it's unbelievable because as a woman, (if I were Florence) and I really loved a man as much as she said she did, no matter the level or ignorance, this would have been discussed in the most private of terms.

0061537934|5.0|I had been on the library's waiting list for this book for awhile. By coincidence, my number came up shortly after my 20-year-old cat died. And a few years ago I said good-by to my First Dog, Keesha. So I melted as I read some of the scenes between Denny and Enzo.<br /><br />But the book has haunted me for reasons beyond my feelings for the dog and the Seattle location. It's really about human sadness -- about a person who lives a life where he doesn't quite fit. Denny, the dog says, doesn't really belong in Seattle. His marriage never feels right. His job gives him a lot of latitude to pursue his racing dreams, but he really doesn't belong behind a counter. His in-laws are a piece of work.<br /><br />Both Denny and Enzo lead pretty tough lives. Enzo has to spend a lot of time alone. On Denny's frequent trips, Enzo gets boarded with people who are kind but indifferent. He gets tossed in a garage and left alone in a house for three days. One temporary host - the Evil In-Law - cruelly feeds him a pepper and he gets a most, um, delicious revenge. I was cheering for him.<br /><br />Denny's tragedies make him a candidate for a modern Job. It's a series of bad things happening to a very good person. There's an understated but strong commentary on modern life. False accusations are not uncommon. A deadly illness means coping with an indifferent medical system. Money counts. Yet, as a lawyer character says, Denny is a competitor. Quitting is not an option.<br /><br />The novel really comes together when the dog realizes he is dying. He realizes some wonderful events will be taking place and, he says, \\"I won't be there to see them.\\" Animals of course don't know they will die, but their owners do. And in that brief sentence, Enzo captures the essence of the human condition: the ultimate pain of recognizing that sometimes you really have to say, \\"Never.\\"<br /><br />As I get older, I find myself thinking, \\"I may not be there.\\" Enzo loves his owner so much it hurts to watch. He isn't sad about dying: he wants to be there for Denny, not himself.<br /><br />The last few pages of the book -- a sort of postscript -- are a little over the top. I wonder if the publisher asked for them.<br /><br />But Garth Stein can write. Each word carries weight and the book's structure is flawless. The theme of anticipating a sad end, and the lyrical writing, reminded me of another \\"sadness with substance\\" book, I Heard the Owl Call My Name.<br /><br />So when I think of Garth Stein writing another book, I have to say, \\"I hope I will be around to read it.\\"ere for Denny, not himself.

B0019IB26I|5.0|This CD is a great mix of John's talent in front of a live audience -- plus some blues, and a few covers!!
B000AY74OG|5.0|This movie is not just for kids.  It is an all out family movie for ALL ages.  I highly recommend it for any parents, grandparents to buy and watch this movie.
0385732554|2.0|The first half of the book is great. It is one of the most interesting stories I have ever read. This is part of the problem. I was so excited and anxious to find out what happens next, that I was hugely disappointed. To sum it up, the ending is a terrible disappointment. It feels like halfway through the book, the author was in need of money, so they slapped together a few more chapters and shipped it.
0441013597|5.0|Although I had already watched both movie adaptation, I wanted to read this book. It was well worth it. Anyone who gave this novel one star is being dishonest, and I doubt they read the book. If someone didn't enjoy the story they should not give it one star unless the writing it self was poor, and Dune is written well. That is why it won both sci-fi awards for best novel.     I really like how more indepth the book is, which is always the case vs a movie adaptation. You learn so much about the characters, their motivations, etc, that the movies do not show.     If you have not seen the movies, then the book is going to blow you away. if you like this sort of thing. The last line almost made me cry, and only one book has ever made me cry, and that was Swan's Song. Where the red fern grows came close.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I did not become aware of this series until a friend recommended it.  I ordered season one because i was hooked on what had happened in the past with the characters.  The show is awesome!  It is a wonderful period piece of the late fifties/early sixties with complex characters and a spellbinding scripts for each episode.
6304711891|4.0|I don't like many Bay movies because he has very little skill in crafting a honest and detailed movie. Armageddon was a horrendous piece of donkey dung, everything that's wrong with Hollywood was detailed in that schlock!  The Rock is a slightly different proposition, it's entertaining and never tries to be anything but! The story is thin and the dialogue is typically bad at times. The action is excellent and Sean Connery makes the movie work!  The direction is very Mtv, the editing is silly at times - what's with the quick cuts? Why can't I enjoy the compositions? Pathetic! But still, the pace is consistent.  The acting is okay, Connery's presence elevates the material. Ed Harris is always dependable and Cage is pretty funny as Goodspeed.  The music is very patriotic and but fun.  Overall, entertaining, switch your brain off! After this, Bay descended into familiar MTV garbage!
0345495004|5.0|I enjoyed every aspect of this book. The writing was \\"from the heart\\". The lessons about the early days of the Women's Movement were fascinating. Mamah's life was filled with hard decisions. It was heartbreaking to see how much she had to give up in order to be herself and live a life of authenticity. We are lucky to be alive today, when women have real choices and are not ostracized for following their dreams.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|You have to watch it. I enjoyed every dialog, every detail. Very well done. It comes as well in french and spanish. I was interested in spanish for my kids.
1932100660|5.0|well written, absolutely excellent research and convincing arguments backed with study after study.   Everyone should read this book, regardless of present health condition.   However if one is suffering from any of the major diseases or ailments prevalent in this society, this book should be mandatory!!
B0009MAO46|5.0|What more can I say. My kids have watched the movie 3 or 4 times a day since they got it! I have watched it myself as well (not that much) and everytime I enjoy the story, the details, the manus... I just don't regret the purchase.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|A lot of people really hate on Slipknot because of their supposed lack of music ability but I do believe that they really pushed themselves on this album.  Over all it has a great intensive lead in with the percussionists of the band.  Not to mention there are even different solos in some of the songs (not that I am saying they never did) they just seemed to be much more apparent.  Only two tracks I don't really enjoy that much but over all end to it it's a great album to listen to.  I personally feel that this album is a great successor off of Subliminal Versus and stands alone as a great piece of work.  My only regret about this is not seeing them live when they were in town a few weeks ago.  If you enjoy this genre of music definantly pick it up we have had some great albums come out this summer and I would put this on the list of great albums to have come out this entire year.  Check this album out!
1400063515|4.0|Let me put it this way: I enjoyed some chapters more than others. The first two thirds of the book is an excellent introduction into epistemology and the problem of induction. To the lay reader without experience in such matters, epistemological issues will be brought forward in a highly entertaining and relevant manner. Many questions and ideas that I (and I assume most readers) have sometimes pondered (though not as eloquently) are articulated by Taleb here. For instance, our modern day categories appear to be arbitrary: for instance, why is that most pro-choice people are also anti-strong military? These ideas seem to have nothing to do with one another yest there is a strong tendency for these and other beliefs to be held together. What this illustrates is our innate desire to reduce complexity - and that is our problem; that is why we persistently ignore, forget, or underestimate about Black Swan events.    Taleb frequently speaks in parables. The most prominent being his differentiation between Mediocristan (governed by Gaussian probability) and Extremistan (where Black Swans flourish).  Since I know nothing about business and economics, I was surprised to learn that much of the economic modeling and predicting is based on Gaussian probability which of course is ridiculous. Taleb chooses to constantly mock the financial 'experts' for this reason. The author comes down so hard on Gaussian statistics that the casual reader may think such methods are fundamentally flawed (or an 'intellectual fraud' to use the heavy handed languae of Taleb). However the domain in which Gaussian statistics is OK is still large and important to learn. Possibly this is not the case for finance though.    The weak part of the book I found to be at the end where Gray Swans are discussed - these are events that are near to Black Swans but we have some mathematics to get some understanding of them. I found the transition from talking about White and Blacks Swans to Gray Swans to be poor.He should have spent more time on Gray Swans.     I expected some discussion of Pascal wagering but was disappointed to see only a small paragraph or two on it in which Taleb appears to misunderstand Pascal's point.    Overall, a good book to read. This has sparked my interest in the subject.
B001BMKOZW|2.0|Ok no joke I am a fan of System Of A Down and totally support what they are doing with these side projects and really opened this album up with open arms and an open mind.  There are songs that have System of A Down like sound in it but the band really should have spent more time developing their own sound more.  Some tracks felt very repetitive especially lyrically Darren seems to just repeat certain lyrics a lot towards the end of the track.  It almost seemed as if they couldn't figure out a way to wind down their tracks.  There were three tracks though that I can listen to without pressing forward on my cd player.  Over all I do believe after listening to Elect The Dead I believe that these guys are like Voltron, they make decent music apart but together they have an amazing chemistry.  Over all expect to hear some repetition if your ok with that then you will enjoy this album.  Over all personally I didn't like it and truly gave this album a chance and really wanted to like it.  But it didn't deliver.
1603420398|5.0|This book is like eye candy for crocheters! I love the lay flat spiral binding, I wish more crafting books came in this format. The motifs are fun and come in just about every shape imaginable. If you're looking to branch off from the same old square you're sure to find dozens of motifs that will inspire you.<br /><br />I've crocheted since I was 7 years old and into my 20's, I can tell you for a fact that I would have killed for reference books as fun and inspiring as this when I was younger. I'm very glad to be getting back into crochet, this book already has my fingers itching to cast on.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|All I want to say this is a great series.  The cast is perfect.  Not very good at review,but do recommend this series.  Can wait for Season Two.  This is worth it.
0061537934|5.0|I might never have picked this book up, but my sister-in-law recommended it, and I'm so glad she did. This is such a warm, wonderful book! Told from the dog's (Enzo) point of view, it's the story of him, his master Denny, and Denny's family.    It's written simply, but with so much depth and powerful emotion. Enzo lives his life as a dog trying to learn how to be a good human, since he believes that after his death, he will come back as a person.    I laughed in parts, cried in others. I give this one all 5 stars - I can't think of anything I didn't love about this book!
031606792X|5.0|Great twists. I laughed out loud while reading this book. Good balance between fun, drama, and suspense. I recommend reading the whole saga to anyone who is even slightly interested. Even the guys - you may be pleasantly surprised. Meyer's writing leaves nothing to be desired in her use of character and personality with humor laced throughout the conversations.<br />This book in particular was more graphic than the previous 3 but that detracted nothing from my experience.
0307455874|5.0|I recently turned 18 so this will be the first time I'm able to vote, but I have payed a lot of attention to politics since Gore lost in 2000.  Reading this book has shown me that not only is Obama experienced enough to lead, he is thoughtful enough to see all sides of every decision he makes.  This book is extremely well written and gives me hope for the future of the country and the world.
B00000IQV6|5.0|I have a hard time sitting still long enough to watch a movie, but this one kept me sitting.  The comedy is hilarious!  There are also some serious and sad parts, but they add to the greatness of the movie.  My favorite part was the children in the hospital and learning that they were actually \\"Make a Wish Foundation\\" cancer patients!  Highly recommend this movie!
B00150D664|5.0|U2 by U2 is not only a nice hefty book that covers every facet of the Dublin Boys rise to fame...It really captures some amazing photgraphs of the guys and what was going down during every album they put out...    It's been on the top of my coffee table in the living room and everyone who sits down is compelled to pick up this book and just flip thru the pages and just be overwhelmed by its unique combination of colorful lay-outs to the inside stories nobody ever heard before...    I bought the slightly damaged version over Amazon for $17 + $3 shipping...    There is barely a little ruffle on the cover and at that price...if you are a U2 fan...do not hesitate to pick this thing up...!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|My husband and I watch this video all the time!  Shania is so much fun to watch and this is the best video we've seen of her!
B001BMKOZW|5.0|Without a doubt this entire album makes up for System of a Down's hiatus. It is the perfect complement to Serj Tankian's \\"Elect the Dead\\" and it feels fresh and new. \\"Babylon\\", \\"Stoner-Hate\\", \\"Universe\\", \\"Chemicals\\", \\"Enemy\\" and \\"They Say\\" are probably some of the best songs on this album, a must have for any System of a Down fan, or anyone looking for something new.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The video is a great workout.  I could see noticeable results after 20 days.
0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchman's history of medieval times is fascinating and really thorough -- what it must have been really like.  Better from afar -- it would seem. Great book by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Being an annual reader of Pride and Prejudice and a lover of Jane Austen's humor and insight, I found this film to be at best disappointing. Austen's humor was lost in translation to say the least. Elizabeth Bennet was morphed into a dreamy eyed, slightly naughty, tousled haired temptress. Her father, Mr. Bennet, was, despite the acting talents of Donald Sutherland, transformed into a frousled, woolly, bumbling father who simply didn't know how to be a parent. All that aside, the photography is lovely, the costumes are beautiful, and the soundtrack is delightful, but this simply isn't Jane Austen. For a proper film version of this wonderful book try the A&E version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle or the BBC. The A&E version may six one-hour episodes, but, with minor alterations, it's magnificently produced, witty, beautifully acted, and absolutely true to the book and entirely in keeping with Austen's writing.
B000068PQ0|1.0|Okay, I admit that I shouldn't have jumped to hasty conclusions before giving an album a thorough listen.  If I had the opportunity to change my vote, I'd give this one 2 stars.  The only song I actually like on this album is \\"Fight Test.\\"  I have listened to the others, and they seem to be structured in a way to occupy an unnecessarily long period of time, and don't go anywhere.  The Lips used to rock much harder for one, but becoming mellow does not necessarily degrade the quality of music.  It just does not seem to match within their realm, and they need to simply stick with what they do best.  Every album they've released from the time they started until Clouds Taste Metallic is worth a listen, hell I'd even get Zaireeka over this one.  I have a slight hint of faith left that they can revert back to their rock alternative roots, at least somewhat if not totally.
B00079ZACM|5.0|I was 8 years old when I saw this film in 1939.  I wanted to become a man of honor such as Harry Faversham.  Near the same time I also saw the \\"Prisoner of Zenda.\\"  Those two films changed my life.  After high school I was accepted at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and graduated in the top fifth of my Class of 1955 B.S. Marine Engineering.  This led me to a career as a rocket engine designer/manager for 15 years followed by law school and 32 years as a sole practitioner CA attorney, 4 years as Judge of the Superior Court, Pro Tem and 2 years Presiding Judge of Municipal Court in AZ. I am also a Major, U.S. Army, Ret. Driven by two films about HONOR!
0446677450|4.0|I started really late in the game. Employed in dead-end jobs for the most part, it was only in my mid-thirties that I really began to get serious about money. If you're like me and don't know anyone to talk to about the matter, Kiyosaki's book is an adequate start, if only to help you rewire your brain into that zone of financial consciousness.    While Rich Dad, Poor Dad doesn't have all the answers and, as other reviewers have cited, may arguably contain disputable advice, the book has successfully encouraged me to learn more about financial education. And for that, four stars.
0345442970|4.0|In the events leading to Episode I, political ploys were unhatched that would allow the rise of Senator Palpatine.  \\"Cloak of Deception\\" is an appropriate title for a novel which explains the maneuverings of Palpatine before becoming chancellor.  As one might expect of a book based in political posturing, there is less action then one might expect in the Star Wars series.  Still, the book does not disappoint.    In order for the Trade Federation to serve as a powerful pawn to the Emperor, obstacles must be removed from their ascent to greater power.  Among these obstacles is the Nebula Front.  While raising ethical questions in the eyes of some, Sumpreme Chancellor Valorum seeks to allow the trade Federation to amass a droid army for protection from terrorist groups such as the Nebula Front.  In a compromise, the Trade Federation must make an unpopular concession which reflect poorly on Valorum.  Considering the original source of the idea, the motive is not surprising.       As this occurs, an assassination plot is unhatched against Valorum as Captain Cohl's creates mayhem in the Outer Rim.  Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, chase the \\"terrorists\\" only to find the motives of the group to be confused.  A mysterious figure behind the terrorists knows the true motives for which Cohl's group is paid.  With bureaucracy, power, and money intertwining to make motives less apparent, the book ends where \\"Phantom Menace\\" begins.    James Luceno may be the premiere writer in the Expanded Universe.  In this novel, I particularly enjoyed being introduced to characters not appearing this movies such as Yaddle.  Though the plot may seem restrained by the extensive dialogue, it is a necessary element in setting up the Star Wars movie series.
0385338724|2.0|Lexi wakes up from a conk on the head to find that three years have gone by -- and disappeared from her memory. Her sketchy boyfriend, Loser Dave, has been replaced by a gorgeous, rich (and quite stuffy) husband, Eric. Her best gal pals have become virtual strangers, and her hair has somehow become a gorgeous main, all the better to highlight her newly straightened teeth and collagened lips.    The only problem? Her new life doesn't quite fit the old Lexi. She wants things as they were, and is going to do her best to get them back.    Of all Kinsella's book, this is my least favorite. It has some of her traditional standbys -- a slightly goofy yet loveable main character, kooky minor characters, and a totally unbelievable yet charming premise.     The problem is, I felt like I was reading a bad novelized version of \\"Thirteen Going on Thirty.\\" And the movie was much better than this book.    It isn't a BAD book. It was just a little boring in spots, and not nearly as cute as the movie. Go with Jennifer Garner instead.
0375500901|5.0|Hello, Gabriel Allon, you've become a welcome addition to my life.    You really need to get married, though. No spy females, please.    Your creator is as smooth as a vodka gimlet made of France's Grey Goose vodka.    I love this review by Christine Cunningham:[...]    Following the standard rule of rounding, four and a half stars becomes five.    And who says we need to forgive the murderers of our son, the maimers of our wife? Gabriel does in Tariq in the end, as it should be.    An exquisite master art restorer living on the sea shore in Cornwall, England, Gabriel Allon, a lone wolf Mossad assassin, learns to live day by day by meticulous work and sailing a sailboat he restored. The spy is spied on by a young, lonely boy named Peel, whose is a narrative piece of thread I wished had been worked on more.    Allon is pulled back by Amri Shamron, a high level apparatchik Mossad operative and rejoins the hunt. Of humans.    He develops a romantic relationship with a closet Jewess, who is improbably a famous model, Jacqueline. Sarah's her real name. She is used to ferret out the most elusive Palestinian spy Tariq, who was responsible for blowing up Allon's wife's car in Vienna, landing her in an asylum and killing his son.    The intricate, chess-like narrative ends in New York City. Guns are involved, as is that odious former human, Yasser Arafat, who's presented almost nobly.    This is a very welcome beginning of the series staring Gabriel Allon. I have spent many enjoyable hours with him.    Thank you, Daniel Silva!
B001BR5F4C|5.0|I think a lot of reviewers are forgetting the fact that Kill Bill vol 1 and 2 are great movies. $40 for two great movies in high def isn't a bad deal.    Back when this was released on DVD years ago people kept howling not to buy it because you should wait until The Whole Bloody Affair comes out. Well guess what, years later it still hasn't come out on any format. Stop holding your breath for it. Its supposed to be what, 5 hours long?    Also, these are the theatrical versions and i'm fine with that. I own the japanese versions and theres not much difference. Definitely not enough to miss out on owning such a great movie.
0316067601|5.0|This was a great book. I could hardly put it down. I hope more people will read this book and know what our solders are up against in this war on terrorism. Marcus and his men are real heroes.
B0014QNGA0|5.0|The previous reviewer alluded to a bonus DVD accompanying this recital.  I can't comment on it because it is not included in the particular edition I received upon delivery by Amazon.  What I have is the recital itself, which, I suppose, is quite sufficient.  It's a real stunner.  To my ear, Florez' voice sounds even brighter and sunnier when he sings the \\"Fille\\" aria in Italian.  The vowels are opened wider, and the voice itself seems to ingratiate itself even more vividly than it does in French.  The \\"Puritani\\" duet is very, very well done, with Anna Netrebko singing a beautiful Elvira. We we get here is the traditional duet, which does not include the extra music included by Pavarotti and Sutherland on their complete London recording.  The \\"L'Elisir d'Amore\\" aria \\"Una Furtiva Lagrima\\" is spun out like silk, with some new variations I've never encountered before.  In fact, all the Donizetti selections are as well done as you are ever likely to hear them, with the duet from \\"Linda di Chamounix\\" (with the noted European soprano Patrizia Ciofi) proving that there's a lot more good music in this particular opera than merely the one showpiece soprano aria (made famous by Beverly Sills on her very first recording after she reached international attention).  The bonus track contains the two-tenor duet, where Florez is partnered with Placido Domingo no less.  Domingo, of course takes the lower line, which is appropriate at this time in his fabulous career (his continued vocal health continues to amaze me - I mean, at age 67, to sing this well, is a miracle), and he makes a grand account of it.  Florez, of course, sails through this music like a race horse at the flick of a whip.  I am a tremendous admirer of Mr. Florez, and I freely admit that I find him astounding.  Unlike the previous reviewer, I do not hear any opaqueness or   hints of strain in his top notes. While I enjoy and repeatedly play the \\"Arias for Rubini\\" album of Florez, I do agree with the previous reviewer that this recital is more enjoyable.  For anyone who wants to hear truly great singing of a repertoire long known for it's vocal difficulties, you can't go wrong with this.  The music just bursts from this beautiful Decca release.

B000AP04L0|4.0|Movie: 5 stars.  Extras: 3 stars.<br /><br />Last week I was reminiscing with an engineer friend about seeing \\"Office Space\\" during its 1999 theatrical run.  He remembers me laughing constantly throughout the movie, and that flashback to a simpler time in my IT career caused me to finally get this DVD just so I could see it again and check out the extras.  Of course, \\"Office Space\\" is still awesome, but unfortunately the included \\"flair\\" is little more than the bare minimum.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" centers on Peter Gibbons, a twenty-something programmer entombed at Initech working on the Y2K software update project (the only dated aspect of the film, but it could represent any office work scenario).  He's fed up with his mindless job, the lousy commute, uptight girlfriend Anne, and especially passive-aggressive boss Bill Lumbergh.  Cohorts in programming Michael and Samir have similar workplace issues, and all three commiserate while trapped in their cubes or over mid-morning coffee at T.G.I. Friday's clone Chotchkie's.<br /><br />One night, at the insistence of said girlfriend Peter sees a hypnotherapist to try and work through his malaise.  Things don't go quite as planned, and Peter emerges in a Zen-like state that enables him to step out and act without fear of failure, or really any fear at all.  Our hero quickly gets dumped by Anne, but winds up snagging a promotion and dating Joanna, the Chotchkie's waitress he had pined for from afar.  However, just as his Peter 2.0 life is going great he resolves to get back at Initech for its indignities, and that's when events begin to spin out of control.  To say much more would spoil the fun, but trust me when I apply the \\"comedy classic\\" label.<br /><br />All the actors from main roles to supporting players do a great job, and the jarring gangsta rap soundtrack fits like a pocket protector (after all, don't most of us want to bust out of our bland shells and live the glamorous thug life once in awhile?).  Case in point: Over time this flick spread through the corporate underbelly like a computer virus, and  it's hard to find any cubicle farm where the drones aren't tossing around lines such as: \\"Yyyyeahhh...not a half-day...did you get that memo?...someone's got a case of the Mondays...I wouldn't say I've been MISSING work...\\"  \\"Office Space\\" captures the white-collar world in all its soul-crushing splendor, from incompetent management and inane company rules to office politics and oddball co-workers.  Indeed, we can count both \\"The Office\\" television series as its demented twin progeny.<br /><br />As for the extras?  Wwwweeellll, there aren't many buttons in this jar.  The ones included aren't bad, but I wanted more than a short retrospective hosted by creator/director Mike Judge, some deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, and media for your PC.  Sorely missed are a commentary track by Mr. Judge and stars, along with, say, an extended cut and a longer documentary.  Even so, if you've ever spent time in a cubicle, or think you want to, then check out \\"Office Space\\" on DVD.

B000T05R8Q|5.0|First off, I love the unique bound case, its like a tiny tome of British psychedelia. But then I'm saddened that its chief architect paid a terrible price in creating it, but that's a tale for another day. Where Syd could have taken Pink Floyd will always be a subject of debate. But what is not debatable is that this a gorgeous package at a great price.
031606792X|4.0|The only think that really bothered me with this book was because I already new the plot. The plot for this book had been an over used idea that is used in Fan Fiction Stories. But what really ticked me off were the reviews for this book. Tons of people are crying about the fact the the characters get what they deserve in the end. Sure the whole book does not revolve around real dramatic issues. But it does express giving up everything for your love for them to be happy or being torn by love. So why after everything these characters have been don't they deserve there happy ending. Did all you cry babies want Bella to die and the message to be \\"you don't always get what you want.\\". Remember people this is FICTION!!!
B000BB1MIC|4.0|Heard good things about Gimore Girls and then found season one on sale at £13.99 so thought why not try it. Season one hooked me and I had to buy more. During my holiday at the end of July untill the second week of August I watched every episode of every season . It only took that long as I had to order two seasons from America.  Season 5 carried on the legacy of season 4 I was not dissapointed with my purchase. Lorelai and luke , Rory and Yale , Gilmore Girls and Gilmore parents things moved on and I wanted to know where they were going each episode drew me into the next the banta was there as always and the fast talking .   Still need to know how they can afford all that food and Luke never takes and money from them .
0307265730|3.0|When \\"The Interpreter of Maladies\\" was published in 2000 the only word one could use to describe Jhumpa Lahiri is phenom. Almost fifty years ago the young Southern writer Carson McCullers stunned the literary establishment with her debut novel \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,\\" and here was another young unknown writer expressing the extraordinarily emotional moments of the everyday and ordinary in pristine and polished, mature and haunting prose.    \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" is Jhumpa Lahiri's second collection of short stories. The title story is about a father, who recently lost his wife and who visits his daughter for one week. It's a story of two different people who have always misunderstood each other dealing in different ways with the grief of losing the most important person in their life. The father feels liberated, having thought that his wife was too demanding and strident. Recently retired he has also happily found a companion for his world travels. His daughter Ruma, who was very close with her mother, never allows herself to grieve, and instead opts to throw herself into motherhood, trying hard to repeat her mother's life. She leaves a legal career to focus on raising her son, is pregnant with a second child, and -- just like her mother -- is silently angry at a successful but absent husband.    Ruma takes one step further in becoming her mother by asking her father to stay with her. The father, now much wiser and freer, refuses, and wants to tell Ruma about his new companion but can't quite bring himself to doing it. In the end he subconsciously leaves a postcard to his companion where it can be easily found, and upon finding it Ruma is at first hurt and angry but finally mails it herself, thereby finally freeing her father.    This first story is by far the best story in this collection, and the rest in Lahiri's book disappoint with their triviality and inconsequence -- the biggest disappointment is a three-part saccharine story of two star-struck lovers which is just lame and silly.    There are two stories though that if developed to their full potential could have been great. There is a story of an Indian boy who goes to an elite American boarding school, and falls in love with the headmaster's daughter Pam, the symbol and embodiment of what he could never obtain. Two decades later he finds closure by attending Pam's wedding at the boarding school, where he makes passionate love with his wife in the same dorm room where he spent his teenage years haunted by his social ostracization.    And then there's another story of a sister and her alcoholic brother, and the hint that the gifted and handsome younger brother fell into alcoholism because of his devout love for his sister. It was she who snuck beer cans into his room, and when she went to college and they could no longer be together he might have turned to alcohol just to be with her again.    In both stories the promise that there's something deep and disturbing lurking under the surface is subtle. But it's way too subtle.    Jhumpa Lahiri is an extremely gifted writer, far more talented than any of her peers but it just doesn't seem as though she's trying hard enough. Lahiri needs to wrestle with her characters more, break away from them, and probe deeper into their dark psychologies. Her talent and her wisdom rival those of Raymond Carver -- the master of the short story -- and she needs to study more the brevity and depth of his prose. Lahiri's stories can be powerfully affecting at her best but Carver at his best is just absolutely devastating -- the beautiful poignancy of his prose reveals that he is haunted and plagued by his perceptions and understanding of the human condition in a way that no one can fully appreciate.    Alas, Lahiri's prose is beautiful and compelling enough for her to be able to get away with predictable plotlines and underdeveloped characters. Carson McCullers would never achieve the same success she had with her debut, and after reading \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" one must wonder if Lahiri would share McCullers' fate.
0385512058|4.0|A very entertaining book, a really enjoyable read, and a good idea book about networking.  Not all of us have a job the type Keith Ferrazzi does, but we can all shape our job a little more to enjoy it and make progress on it.  Thats way this book is also very useful -i would say - for everyone.  The only reason i rated this book 4-star and not 5-star is because a) i seldom rate a book 5-star, unless it has an all-time classic quality and b) this does not cover all the aspects of networking (which does not claim to do anyway).  Good job Keith.  For all readers interested in the topic - this book is well worth your money.

0399213015|5.0|I didn't grow up with English-language chidren literature classic books, so I was not thrilled with the book at first. My daughter was, and still is. We had The Very Hungry Caterpillar since she was about 3 months, and she keeps returning to it every two weeks or so. When she started to say more (at about 18 months), I realized that she knows the whole story by heart. I would make a pause in the story, and she would say the next word. Her favorite page in the entire book is Caterpillar's Saturday feast. Oh, by the way, I know it by heart now too, and I absolutely love both the story and illustrations. You can say that it grew on me.

0805082662|4.0|I cannot say that my daughter (now 22 months) was really fascinated by the book itself, maybe because we don't have it as a board book, so she was not allowed to handle it when we got it. She was probably 9 months or so. She is not into the animals, and she is still indifferent to a book. However, the story flow generated a game for the times when Anna is bored and getting fussy, for example, for longer car rides. I would say, Anna, Anna, what do you see? and then would make up the next verse, for example, I see my sandal looking at me. She likes this game, and I think it helps well with language development. Now she sometimes supplies the verse subject, for example, I see papa. I still have to come up with action, but it's a progress.
1932100660|5.0|This book has two themes: Food choices can create a healthier body, and there's a bunch of folks that have vested interest in keeping us from knowing this truth.    It is evident that man has survived by being a scavenger, but this study suggests that some diets are better at promoting a healthy body beyond mere survival. If you need more verification of the health benefits of a plant-based diet beyond this study, look at the world-class athletes that are vegetarian. How do you suppose they build muscle, bone, excellent health, and win at their sport?     While the study helped verify what many have proven by using their own bodies as laboratory, the inside information about the food/drug cartels and their government enablers is an important bonus.  We are never going to have good health in this country as long as these folks reign supreme with their vested interest of promoting their view of health information, and healthcare is seen as a commodity.      The book exposes the dumbing down of our people with the misinformation of the powerful that undermines the quality of our health and lives.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I was first introduced to this group by the brilliant final scene in the movie, \\"Vanilla Sky,\\" where the main character makes the decision to \\"jump\\" back into the real imperfect world from his taintedly-perfectly-fake-dreamworld he had been living in, and track 4 (my favorite) plays as it shows seemingly-misc flashbacks from humanity's past as he bails downwards off of a skyscraper heading like a missle for the concrete below, hell every time I see that scene I break down in tears.  But that's what this album is, tear-therapy, if you want to examine the emotions within you beneath the surface and feel that you need a good cry, put on this cd.  I might venture so far as to say it's especially therapuetic for survivors of abuse or those with PTSD, people deciding to or having already quit the government's drugs, and that sort of ilk out there.<br />  Hopefully my review puts it in perspective as to why nowhere near everyone will cherish this kind of music.  I'm a musician who has mastered the art for over a decade now but I've learned musicianship isn't about playing lightning-fast scales blazing up & down the keyboard or frets, that has it's place and all and I can do it but let's be honest, it's show-offmanship mainly used to dazzle audiences without much lingering affect in their souls.  I've learned that music is more about what it can bring out in YOU the listner, and this cd will take you places within yourself in a real way.  Thanks to this cd and some others I've found recently, psychotherapy is no longer necessary: \\"And how does that make you feeeeel?\\" It makes me feel like I need to put on some Sigur Ros and Sevin, doc, now please excuse me whilst from whenceto-heretoforth I find my headphones and take a nature walk far from your planet :)

I've been worried - \\"When will the time come?\\" or worse, \\"How will I KNOW the time has come?\\" Garth Stein wrote this wonderful book for me. As much as my husband and I remember Belle's life and times and the funny stories, she may remember,too! She knows who she was and who she now is. And when her time comes, she'll be ready. What a relief to me. I love her so and realize through this story that she will indeed be with me always. Call me corney, silly, crazy- I don't care! This book touched me and helped me prepare for one of the toughest things I know I will face. And I thank Garth Stein for that.

0307265730|2.0|Lahiri's work has become predictable: children of middle or upper class Bengali immigrants adopt American customs, causing consternation to their traditional parents/family. Most of this isn't even especially well written. She had some earlier successes, notably the Third and Final Continent, but this is just getting boring.<br /><br />Most of her characters suffer the same life altering but not necessarily fatal flaw: unwilling to  accept familial change, they simply turn away. Thus, a young man walks out on his father when he fails to connect with his new stepmother and step sisters and a young mother lets her father walk out of her life when she begins to suspect his travel companion is actually a girlfriend.<br /><br />In July '08, the Frank O'Connor Short Story prize committee announced that it was taking the unusual step of announcing Lahiri as the annual contest's outright winner rather that pare the long list of almost 40 names down to five and then announcing the winner at the festival. Apparently, the judges found her work to be so superior to the other nominees that they felt suspense was unwarranted. I for my part don't see it. The irony is that given the breadth of Frank O'Connor's work--childhood, love, soldiership, and on and on--Lahiri seems limited to the same old characters and ideas.
B000TGCR3I|3.0|Even though I loved this director first American feature in the Animatrix I have to say I was rather dissapointed with the overall feeling of this movie.

B00168HARG|4.0|This is a superbly-directly, excellently-produced program. Movie quality throughout... I was amazed at the quality and creativity of the show, which shows its high budget.    Lena Headey and Summer Glau are superb as thinking man's cheesecake, and not in a way that should turn women off from the show, even as it should drag men in. They bring genuine depth to their roles, in a way that's exceptionally rare in television. Even the supporting actors and actresses are well-cast and fleshed-out, balancing sci-fi action/danger with humanity and irony. It's hard to imagine the show without Summer Glau's elusive \\"humanity\\".    All that said, the mastering on the Blu-Ray collection is odd. The menus don't really work right, in the sense that you put a disk in, and it simply starts playing all 3-4 episodes from the beginning as if they're one big 3-hour thing. Yes, you can, if you try, find the top menu to select the individual episodes, but it's as if the folks creating the menus didn't understand the whole concept of separate episodes. The episodes are more like chapter stops.    The menus aren't really a problem.. as other reviewers have mentioned, the high-def picture is very good.. but you'll notice it. I don't really know what kind of person would resist buying a DVD collection because the episodes are somewhat difficult to navigate, but if that's you, you might want to think twice.

I'll never forget the first time I listened to this album . . . I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say I awoke to an ironic surprise.    But . . . the drummer is absolutely sick.  Neil Peart of Rush might be the greatest rock drummer ever, but what this guy can get out of a minimalist kit is astounding.
B001C48EFQ|5.0|Brilliant French film that is able to look at the world in the eyes and be proud of it. It creates a fable about a final apocalypse, a total mental manipulation, something like a mental genetically manipulated human organism, religion and particularly blind faith in front of a miracle, the belief that science and technology are absolutely invincible, the fear of a plague, the world divided in two, the good USA because they are protecting themselves against terrorism, though they are in fact the very heart of terrorism, the commanding heart please, maybe the real brain of it, and on the other side the rest of the world lost in corruption, pointless violence, war, death, alienation, suffering, misery, dying as a lesser evil than living, essentially centered on Paris, France, and the vast Russia and Kazakhstan. I just wonder why they spared China? It is all there and yet Kassovitz, a French man who should be like all French people at least agnostic if not atheistic, produces the most marvelous Christian fable you can imagine. The world is doomed but it can be regenerated and will be by a new Virgin Mary, called Aurora, a perfect name for a second beginning. She has been genetically manipulated in her brain enough to be a genius and to produce, by artificial insemination, the child that will save the world, bring peace and a new phase of development. But can this French Kassovitz do the same thing as the Australian Mel Gibson in his Apocalypto who restarted the world with a married couple and two sons, Adam, Eve, Abel and Cain? Of course not so the mother will die just after delivering. The child will be a pair for sure, but two twins born in the same batch, and the final dedication of the film makes them girls. So the female is the future of the male. That's the French touch. And that poor Toorop will be the genetically estranged father, though I should say caretaker of these two twins. That's a twist in the tale. I am sure the poor Jesus is twisting in his tomb, if he has one. But it is brilliant. I guess the absence of some Chinese mafia is the sign that their market is targeted. It should work, especially the good nun who is a Kung Fu fighter.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelineshas one.

0307387178|5.0|I found this book to be highly engrossing and quite frankly hard to put down, I stayed up till 3 a.m. reading it one night.  I think everyone can take something away from this book after reading it which is really a true compliment.  I have to wonder  about the people who gave this book  one star reviews  and who call Chris stupid, naive and foolish. People like you have no problem with governments drafting young people for \\"their\\" wars only to killed for whatever the goverments cause was.  Well Chris died for his own cause and I personally can't fault the man for that.  Secondly, each of us in the end has a chance to live life the way they choose or at least how they will approach mentally and this was his choice.  We must remember that we are reviewing actual books here and  how it was written not the actual person in the book.  I want to encourage everyone to read this book and then do some serious thinking afterward taking that inward journey which will only make you stronger.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|So, you're Judas Priest, a mostly forgettable but somewhat talented '80s metal band.  You get this great idea -- let's do our own \\"The Wall\\"!    Well, hopefully, you've got David St.Hubbins around to tell you not to do a two CD concept album before a festival crowd.     Unfortunately, JP decided to do it anyway.  If you read the lyrics, you get a somewhat coherent retelling of the Nostradamus legend.  If you listen to the CD, you wish you'd started to read the lyrics and fallen asleep like a normal person.    This album is long on irrelevant acoustic interludes, plodding Sabbath-like epics, and short on the kind of driving metal that made JP listenable.  Avoid this like the plague (perhaps that could be JP's next album title!)
0691131511|3.0|This book may, as its newspaper reviews suggest, fill a need for a general reader's overview of Byzantium, but it doesn't do it very well. I doubt the \\"two men in hard hats\\", whose curiosity (Herrin says) originally motivated her to write it, would be much stimulated or enlightened by the instant descent into theology (full of Greek terms regarding the nature of God) and architecture (equally full of narthices and pendentives). Theology and architecture (especially the former) are vital for understanding Byzantine history, but the general reader (this one, at least) would be better served by insights into why they were so important to the Byzantines, rather than plunging into the technical detail. Herrin, in short, fails to stand back from from her academic framework (which I suspect is a rather old fashioned one anyway) and give us the big picture in coherent terms. The book gets better as it goes on, and from time to time one is able to get some feeling for how Byzantium operated and how its people lived, but it's a gold-panning task.    Also, given Herrin's academic eminence, I was deeply disappointed to find elementary errors of chronology and fact in the first few pages (as I've remarked in another review, it shakes the confidence when a person with a mere general reader's knowledge finds simple errors in a specialist's work). For example: \\"... the last Roman emperor in the west was deposed in 476, leaving a half-Vandal, half-Roman general, Stilicho, in control of Italy\\" (p.13). Romulus Augustulus, the last emperor in the west, was indeed deposed in 476, but by Odoacer the Goth (even that magnificently bad film `The Last Legion' managed to get that bit right). Stilicho the Vandal had been murdered by his nominal master the emperor Honorius two generations earlier, in 408. Such an error (about events in Herrin's own specialist period) would expose her to professional sniggering if committed in a peer-reviewed scholarly work. I submit that when writing for the general reader the duty of scrupulous accuracy lies, if possible, even heavier.

B0016Q56C4|4.0|Brendan Fraser in \\"Journey\\" and in \\"The Mummy\\" is perfecting the role of the hero who is smart-dumb with a kind of a dizzy, dazed, sexy look. He's in action movies that have a light, bantering tone, but yet the stories have incredible creatures, scary chases, wild special effects, but a \\"Look folks, no hands, only kidding\\" kind of approach. This handsome, still boyish looking actor, manages to look terrified and can scream his head off in the face of danger. The character is bright, but you suspect there's a dumb streak lurking below the surface.<br /> He, a science prof, and his nephew, Josh Hutcheson playing Sean, go to Iceland where they join up with pretty Hannah, go climbing and end up falling to the center of the earth where there is a huge amount of space, plenty of light, a horizon, and apparently plenty of oxygen.<br /> Scary highlights: 1. Sean has to cross a deep chasm by jumping from one magnetic floating rock to another with one rock orbiting while he's clinging aboard. 2. Man-eating very toothy fish with real overbites attack the three on an elaborate raft that they were apparently to build in about a day without tools. 3. Prehistoric drooling monsters like raptors chase the uncle and nephew and almost gobble them up. 4. Huge, very hungry carnivorous plants attack Fraser and Hannah. Watch Fraser take care of the last plant, and you'll know why this is part braggadocio spoof.<br /> This is good escapist stuff that will entrance you as long as you don't start asking too many dumb questions. It's a thrilling adventure, scary and fun. Fraser is a winning action hero.

B000M53GM2|5.0|Goldeneye returned James Bond to film theaters after a six-year hiatus, and Pierce Brosnan takes over the role of the world's most famous secret agent. Brosnan successfully combines the suaveness of Sean Connery with the hard-nosed cynicism of Timothy Dalton.  Officially this is the first post-Cold War Bond film (and the first to be shot in Russia itself), but in reality it is the second, with Dalton's License To Kill being the true first such. Though the Cold War is over, the risks from it are still in existence, as the Russian mafia jockeys for position to control as much as it can.  Bond must tail an ex-Red Air Force jet jockey, Xenia Onatopp, who is having a torrid affair with the test pilot of a new high-technology gunship - an affair that proves deadly and which leads to an even bigger threat to the West.  The new head of Her Majesty's Secret Service is an obtuse bean-counter, and neither she nor the ticked-off HMSS bureaucrats she commands get along well, but at least she is willing to send Bond to correct a mistake she has made, the mistake in underestimating the importance of the chopper theft.  It leads to James' encounter with an old friend, and one of the few instances in the entire Bond series of a truly gripping encounter with what turns out to be an adversary. That it is so effective can be put to the strength of Sean Bean's performance as well as that of Brosnan.  The inevitable fireworks erupt, beginning with the destruction of the gunship and a terrific firefight in a Red Army base, before James tracks down his power-mad adversary and learns the full extent of his plan for vengeance.
B000K4WPCC|2.0|Since I'm a fan of horror and the occult arts, I thought it was about time I checked out The Covenant. Luckily for me, I rented it.<br /><br />Within the first ten minutes of the movie, it was clear to me that Hollywood made this for a certain demographic: teenagers who have short attention spans. This movie did not deliver but isn't that the norm nowadays when it comes to directing a film.<br /><br />The acting was subpar, making me believe that casting for this flick consisted of going to the local burger joint at an upper middle class town and pointing a finger at those people needed for an upcoming witch movie. Truly a sad thing.<br /><br />The plot wasn't all that bad but it needed professionals to develop it and not the crew that worked on The Covenant. I hate having to keep using this line but \\"it had so much potential\\" and that's the truth.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you have teenagers who like the supernatural like watching the television show supernatural, then by all means buy them this DVD. However, if you want you and your kids to watch something more thought provoking but centers around the supernatural or the occult, then buy them the MGM double feature DVD of Kolchak: The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler. Even though it's dated, you simply cannot go wrong here.

074322454X|1.0|Anthony Bates couldn't have said it better.  It's shocking that so many readers out there just gobble up Ambrose's \\"feel good history\\" as unquestionable fact, when in reality what Ambrose writes little more than entertainment for ignorant readers.  Everything Bate's mentions is true...the fact that other less fabled, yet equally brave and crucial formations that served in Bastogne get ignored by Ambrose is shameful.  Also, his knowledge of the German Army in all of his writings is down right pathetic and revolves more around old 'folk lore' than any type of dedicated research.  Ambrose does know how write an compelling story, I'll give him that...although there is a lot of better academic history out there, and it is not very hard to find.
B00006AG9F|5.0|Este es uno de esos discos que se quedan en tu memoria desde la primera vez que lo escuchas, y para muchos es el mejor &aacute;lbum de toda la carrera de este grupo (en lo personal su \\"Wings of Heaven\\" de 1988 es para m&iacute; su punto m&aacute;ximo), y apenas despu&eacute;s se encuentra esta maravilla, que para ser honestos, es la obra que me hizo conocerlos y desde entonces uno de mis grupos favoritos de todos los tiempos, con la elegancia de las composiciones del guitarrista Tony Clarkin y la voz &uacute;nica de Bob Catley, se forma la esencia de su sonido, melod&iacute;a y buenas canciones van llegando desde el inicio de \\"How Far Jerusalem\\" y en seguida la joya del disco \\"Just Like an Arrow\\", seguida por el tema titulo y al pasar de los temas te encuentras con un conjunto de canciones excelentes en su totalidad, donde tambi&eacute;n destacan \\"Two Hearts\\" y \\"The Last Dance\\", para terminar \\"Magnum\\" es uno de los mejores grupos brit&aacute;nicos de los &uacute;ltimos 30 a&ntilde;os y que siempre han impuesto la calidad de su m&uacute;sica por encima a las tendencias, y siempre conservando ese toque elegante que les caracteriza. Felicidades a estos genios que cumplen 30 a&ntilde;os de estar grabando discos memorables. Gracias Magnum!
B000ILYYJE|5.0|If you are a Doors fan/lover, then this box set will easily satisfy you. I do prefer some of their other versions to some songs, but most everything else was right on. It was worth the price, and Amazon did a great job on the gift wrap.  It was a memorable birthday present for my girlfriend, and even better for me since she moved in.  Now we share this great Doors collection.
032147404X|5.0|Take this little book on every photo trip you go on because you won't know what to do without it. Each page has one \\"how to\\" technique on it. Look up what you want to do, say \\"I want the background sharp\\" & he tells you what to do, if you need the technical reason you can look it up later in another book. This is a have to have.
0345479092|3.0|I bought this book when I was still pregnant and read it cover to cover.  The casual tone was a bit too much for me at times but over all, I found it interesting. However, there wasn't much that was new to me.  And, there were some things I thought that were a bit over the top such as walking your newborn through the house \\"introducing\\" it to the rooms and furniture.  I bought several books and this one was in the middle of the pack as far as usefulness. I got much more out of 12 Hours Sleep by 12 Weeks Old and Babywise than I did out of this.  That's not to say it's useless. There were things I picked up and have used.  But, I wouldn't recommend this be the first, or only, book you buy.
B000000HXK|2.0|2 1/2    An album not without it's intriguing art-rock textures, but eventually ends up sounding washed up in ambient haze without too much songwriting backbone to justify the lengthy indulgences.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|What a fantastic catalogue of music these guys have created. To me this album is the smoothest and most polished of all their albums. Every track is good and they all blend in to each other to give this CD a real entity of its own. The songwriting, singing, arrangements all hit the right chord (sounds corny but their 'search for the lost chord' was over when this collection of songs came together. I think this album has a different feel to any of their others which makes this one fantastic and most of the others ranging from imaginative/creative to a bit bland on a couple of later efforts. One of the most enduring bands of all time with a very steady line-up for continuity. Classic album.
0060589469|5.0|This was a thought provocing and very enjoyable read.  Although it isn't \\"action packed\\" or anything, that isn't the point.  The author's naration tells the tale of his philosophical journey cross country with his son on his motorcyle.  Not only was this book inspirational, but provides new insight in terms of how one sees the world around them.  A must read!
0316113077|5.0|Amazing, Elisa Strauss is very talented.  This book will inspire you to higher levels of cake decorating!
1581804849|4.0|Great book for anybody whos intrested in learning one stroke painting because it teaches you how to paint different kind of flowers and the instructions are easy to follow.
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|It's back.    If you have never seen this film before, I would *strongly* advise that you do some reading about Pasolini, his past films, his life and what motivated him. I would also do some reading on the film itself. If you do wind up purchasing the DVD, watch the extras on disc 2 before watching the film. At that point, you will have enough background and information about the film and it's creator to be able to watch the film. Going into this film blind is not a good idea.    As far as the film itself, Pasolini transposed De Sade's \\"120 Days of Sodom\\" to fascist Italy, in the republic of Salo, during the final days of the fascist regime. He also structured the film in \\"circles\\", similar to  Dante's \\"Inferno\\". What's left is a very bleak film, that holds nothing back and slowly descends into madness. The psychology and/or ideology behind this film will leave you thinking for days, which is precisely why Pasolini made it. In this sense, it is certainly one of the most \\"honest\\" movies I have ever seen, that does not pander to it's audience. Is it the greatest art house movie ever made? No. But, no movie will affect you like \\"Salo\\".    For people who would say that you should stay away from this movie, I would say decide for yourself, but do your reading before making your decision. This is a serious film, not a popcorn film, made by a true artist who knew exactly what he was doing. Criterion's current re-release of \\"Salo\\" is a huge improvement over the last version, with a much clearer picture, improved sound, and a great set of extras that provide an insight into the film. Criterion should be applauded for their efforts.
B000PXVXVW|5.0|The watch is wonderful! I've gotten so many compliments for it. The colors on the watch are beautiful. I've been wearing it for weeks now and it still looks new. It is water resistant and very sturdy. I am glad I purchased it.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|This is like my favorite stupidist awesome film ever.  I will watch it, without interuption anytime I see it, I cannot pass it up!  Even the Tv version is awesome!  This neeeds to be on Blu-Ray, it's begging to be on Blu-Ray, I'm begging for it to be on Blu-ray!  With all these extras of course, and maybe a new cast commenentary on cast memebers cellulite in HD, kidding!  Most awesome cast ever, a new commentary would be nice
031606792X|5.0|If you've not read the \\"Twilight books\\", now is the time.  I devoured this book in less than a day.  Stephenie writes compelling fiction without swearing or overtly sexy chapters.  She has a wicked sense of humor and an eye for details.  A must read!
B000V86OKG|5.0|I got hooked watching this replacement show on CBS, so I bought season one and instantly got more hooked!  I pre-ordered season two and pretty much had it all watched in 4 days.  There is great story writing in this show.  The acting is great.  Some of the twists and turns in the plot gave me goosebumps.  It is one of the best shows going and once you start to watch you can't stop and ask for more.  I agree with other reviewers, give Michael C. Hall an award already, actually the whole show.  Best Drama on TV.
B000I2IT44|5.0|This dvd is a must for any lover of great rock/theatre live shows.Porcupine Tree are truly of the hidden gems of the music scene with their mix of metal and laid back moments.The anti sell out lyrics of Steve Wilson compliment the music brillintly.I would say to any fan who likes rock music the way it should be to put Arriving Somewhere at the top of your list.
1416524800|1.0|After the first few pages, I should have known right off that Dan Brown still has that bigoted, narrow minded chip on his shoulder when an obvious Bill Clinton-type smarmy presidential candidate is labeled as a Republican. Because in Dan Brown world anybody remotedly conservative, or religious, is bad,bad bad bad and every liberal is good.  Well I guess there is a reason this is under fiction!<br /><br />Very convuluted....preachy and pretty much boring....the book started sounding like Charlie Brown's teachers...wah wah wah wah wah....  If you LOVE Dan Brown, you might like this -- and as is typical of all his novels, make sure you have a heavy, heavy dose of suspending your disbelief (and that's just in the first few pages)!!  Not worth buying, but maybe checking out at the library....only if you're on a desserted island and there's nothin' else to do..
0452287022|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was such a great story and I could not help but keep flipping back to the front cover so I could look at the beautiful painting again and again! I will definately read this again.
B0017MO10U|5.0|What a fabulous movie.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  The writing was terrific and the acting, as always was wonderful.  If you are a Stargate SG1 fan, you will not be disappointed.  I just wished it would have been longer!
B000009ED0|5.0|Seller really delivered at a fraction of the cost of retail and we received the product within days.  Thanks!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Fantastic music from a fantastic movie.  Upbeat and enjoyable. Great ABBA tunes sung by great stars.
0789318121|4.0|This is a solid book for any fan of \\"The Dark Knight\\". The pictures are spectacular and the production sketches are very interesting. Do understand that over half the content of the book is the script. That's a nice feature for some fans of the movie, but a let down for those more interested in visuals.
0786856297|5.0|Fans of Harry Potter will love this! It may be for children, but I enjoyed this book ALOT!! Good story plot & it will test your knowledge of Greek legends & mythology.
055358894X|2.0|I liked the characters and I think the story line would have been good.  I hate reading books where the authoir keeps switching between past, current and future.  It gives too much away about the past, and just gets irritating.  Just as you get engrossed in the current story you get whisked forward or back and lose the momentum.  Scott Lynch does so much of this that for the third time in my life I abandoned a book half way through.
0783229321|5.0|...the forced previews and trailers before the movie are annoying. I couldn't believe that I couldn't skip through that crap... I also must note that there was no use of the pause button while the movie was playing. If I wanted to pause the film to go to the kitchen, I had to stop the DVD.    But seriously...  THIS IS ANIMAL HOUSE!  Who really cares about the five minutes of previews and the inconvenience of not being able to pause the movie?      It's Animal House!  It's a classic!    5 stars.  Sit through the previews. Take that time to run to the kitchen. Come back and enjoy one of the all time great American comedies.
159102594X|4.0|I am very particular when it comes to my fantasy/sci-fi readings.  The blurb of 'The Blade Itself' did not inspire me with hope, and a cursory glance at the first couple of pages also didn't reveal any great gems.    But:    I have to say I haven't enjoyed a good story like this since I finished the last book in the Song of Ice and Fire series.  Abercrombie's narrative and characters are punchy, gritty and although his storyline contains what have now become stock-standard features for fantasy writers (e.g. a frozen North, a Prophet, etc), it felt like a breath of fresh air.      Because I was in the mood to read about some carnage, I have to admit that Logen was my favourite character - the berserker scene was fantastic.  But it was great that, although the characters were relatively archetypical, Abercrombie gives them an edge which makes them enjoyable.      Going out to buy books 2 and 3 today - the Amazon reviews I read for book 3 don't look that promising, but I will reserve judgment and put my two cents in after its done.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|I was a huge fan of Slipknot's sound in their debut release. It was a relentless and pounding album with a wide emotional range. Iowa was a traditional sophomore slump CD. Vol 3 was better but lacked some of the aggression of their debut. This release finally shows the crew return to form. Guitars are aggressive and angry while still remaining expressive, percussion is pounding, and the vocals are, well I'll go ahead and say it, pretty much the best metal has to offer.    If you found yourself a Slipknot fan at any point in their career, you should enjoy this release, and I recommend it without reservation.
B00005JPS8|5.0|The Dark Knight wasn't surprising... Everyone KNEW it was going to be AMAZING - and it was just that... AMAZING!  ...but there were many who doubted that Iron Man would be a good superhero movie.  Surprise, surprise.  It ROCKED!    Robert Downy Jr. was P E R F E C T in this role. He WAS Tony Stark.  The effects were great.  The story was entertaining.  It stayed pretty true to the comic book.  The supporting cast was wonderful (I really enjoyed Jeff Bridges in his role).  The end could have been a little more \\"satisfying\\"...  ...but overall, it was a very, very entertaining film.  Oh, and the line before the credits rolled (I'm pretty sure it was the last line of the movie) was great!    I still believe that The Dark Knight was the best summer movie to be released this year, and for that matter, the best superhero movie ever made, but I think Iron Man is right up there with the best.    Bottom line: Great movie.
0553381687|5.0|A complex epic with strong, sympathetic characters on all sides!  This is like WAR AND PEACE and GONE WITH THE WIND meeting JRR Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS, with one major difference: this author will spend chapters developing an engaging character who surmounts challenge after challenge and then suddenly, by a twist of fate, boom! the character is dead or crippled.  It can sure make those suspenseful scenes more suspenseful!<br /><br />A Game of Thrones centers on the fortunes of four noble families: the last daughter of the deposed king, Daenerys, called Dani; the Starks of Winterfell headed by Eddard Stark, called Ned; the Lannisters, the numerous family of the current queen and House Baratheon of King Robert.<br /><br />One can hardly praise this fantasy too much; it breaks the mold of heroic fantasy while upholding the tradition with style.  High honor, low treachery, magic, mysticism, vast grasslands filled with nomadic barbarians, icy wildernesses full of grim mystery, messenger ravens, direwolves...set forth by a master for the reader's entertainment.
B000001GX5|4.0|I wanted a specific Boccherini piece! I typed it into an Amazon search and this recording came up. Ordered and received just what I wanted! :) :) :) Good sound quaity. The other music on the recording is also good, but just an extra.
B00005MAM2|5.0|It really is unbelievable just how many animes derived and used something from this movie.  Obvious origins can be compared to Dragon Ball and Elfen Lied, but so many ideas were first featured in this film that later translated into full-length anime series.  Aside from setting the groundwork for future animes, this film was also one of the greatest, if not the greatest, anime film ever made (though my favorite is still Spirited Away).    The best aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the character development of Kaneda and Tetsuo, best friends in the film.  While Kaneda evolves into a more empathatic person, Tetsuo makes the most dramatic changes, from a jealous and weak individual, to an insane, angry, blood thirsty villian, to a frightened child who clearly realizes his mistakes.  Tetsuo has to be my personal favorite villian from any film, purely due to how well he is developed and the absolute human, kind-natured side to him that is apparent throughout the film.  Besides that, the movie is the orgin of anime for most anime fans, and is an absolute must-see film for anyone in my opinion, even for those who don't usually like anime.  I mean, who doesn't like an awesome story line, great character developemnt, big explosions with high intensity sequences, and a great ending in my opinion.  One of the greatest anime films ever made, and the film that really started it all for anime's popularity.
B000063V8U|5.0|Yep.  Season six doesn't disappoint.  If you enjoyed seasons 1-5 you will enjoy this one too.  There are a few super hokey episodes- more like w/ Kirk than Picard, but for the most part it stays true to the story lines.
B00004VVN9|3.0|My memory of seeing this when I was 15 turned out to be better than the film.
0307265730|5.0|Yes, we've been here before, as one reviewer says. But \\"predictable\\", NO. Lahiri writes about Bengalis who have left their country to raise their families in the US. The themes are recurring, some of the characters are similar and have similar experiences. You get the feeling that many of them probably know each other. But the characters are full-bodied and their stories have all of the immediacy and unexpected turns of real life. (The second generation gets a few surprises from their parents in this collection.) Her pitch-perfect word choice is enough to keep me reading. Just as when I finished her other books, I want more!
1572816112|5.0|To say The Deviant Moon Tarot deck is just another deck in Rider Waite Smith tradition would be an understatement.  The deck takes you into another world of ying/yang insectoid creatures populating a bleak industrial landscape.  Patrick Valenza subliminally inserted images from cemataries and an abandonded insane asylum into the images.  My first impression upon my receipt of the deck that it was too dark for me to do readings with for people I ordinarily would read for; but for those whose tastes lean to the unusual I'm sure it would work fine.  The symbolism of the images maintain traditional interpretations in most cases, but give it a new twist.  I think this is an excellent deck for collectors as well as those whose tastes and insights gravitate towards dark imaginings.  Valenza is a talented surrealist, and more than just in a deck of cards, the images belong in a museum as each are a unique work of art, making the old new again and reinterpreting it for our times.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|We all expect great things from slipknot...with that being said, we also need to take time to appreciate their evolution. This album is amazing! But you have to listen it to more than once or even 5 times. Then you will appreciate what they have done. Take the time and listen to their amazing talent to make music.   I don't know about you but every time I have listened to an album once it's easy to say that it doesn't live up to it's expectations, but if you give it a chance you will understand that SLIPKNOT has arrived again!!!  I was skeptical at first, but then I listened to a few times and realized that it ROCKS!!!   All i can say is to give it a chance....then make your decision.  Rock out you MAGGOTS!!!!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|It does not get any better than the Blu-ray version! Worth twice what I paid. This is the best example of what Blu-ray is capable of that I have seen. I watched this on a Panasonic 58\\" 1080p plasma, Sony PS3 and a mid-priced surround sound system. Seeing Lonesome Dove (Blu-ray) made the money I put out for this setup worth every penny!
031606792X|4.0|Well, It was interesting to get to the Jacob's sight.  I got a lot of fun reading it.  Though I'm pretty not good at English, It only took me 3 days to read this  So I can say this book is interesting.  Opportunity to see that bunch of vampires party.   And new family of Bella.    However Just a moment I thought the story little bit gets too far.   I don't understand that Charlie was able to deal with newborn Bella easily like that.  It's your daughter who became totally different peson.  Yes, It is still Bella, But with that look. Could 'daddy' just can say  \\"Oh, this is my daughter Bella inside of her new body. No problem after all.\\", No, I don't think so.   And the baby? Wow, I think at that point, She little bit lost her point on  this story.   Or I simply I did.  And about Jacob, imprinted to Bella's daughter. So great, poor Jacob became Happy. But still odd.   Something is apparantly missing.  At that time Bella and Jacob didn't seem to be best friend.   I don't get it. They didn't seem to care about each other at that point.  I know at the end still best friend.  But I thought some kind of deep emotion was gone.  Well, you could say that's because of Jacob doesn't love Bella that way.  But still, Thare was something missing.  At least I thought like that.    Oh, well. But I did enjoy this book.  So what Could I say anymore.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This truly opened my eyes to the struggles we went through building the United States. It gave me a revitized appreciation for the personalities and sacrifices of our founding fathers. Paul Giamatti was John Adams and Laura Linley was Abigale Adams. Thoroughly enjoyed it, often going on to the next part to see what happened rather than waiting until the following night.
B000BCE7QU|5.0|Both an amazing album from Prefab Sprout and Thomas Dolby's finest outside act production job, the long awaited (well, by me anyways) remaster/reissue of \\"Steve McQueen\\" reinforces the albums greatness. Appended by a bonus disc of Paddy McAloon re-imagining a few of the tracks acoustically, this is a rare album that has improved over time.<br /><br />First off, McAloon is basically a folk rocker. As the second disc shows how complex the songs are even before Dolby's additions, songs like \\"When Love Breaks Down\\" or \\"Goodbye Lucille\\" bob and weave the melody and guitar lines, even as the literate couplets that still sting (\\"heard you got a new girlfriend, how's the wife taking it?\\"). The whole album deals with love (\\"When The Angels\\") and loss (\\"Faron Young\\"), growing and trying to stay young (\\"Moving The River\\"). He was also a terrific tunesmith, copping from [[ASIN:B000PHX4VA The Police]] and George Gershwin.<br /><br />But while McAloon was trying to be \\"The Fred Astaire of Words\\" (a line from [[ASIN:B00000273P Jordan: The Comeback's]] \\"The Wedding March\\"), his bandmates backed him all the way. Perhaps the greatest impression is made by Wendy Smith, whose backing vocals added an extra degree of depth to many of the songs.  Also adding depth is the second disc's acoustic versions of eight songs. \\"Desire As\\" is the sole track that actually improves on its original, but hearing \\"Goodbye Lucille\\" as a straight up waltz is very cool, too.<br /><br />It's hard to find anything to turn you away from \\"Steve McQueen,' except maybe the fact that Prefab Sprouts cover of \\"He'll Have To Go\\" from the American [[ASIN:B00000264P Two Wheels Good]] is taken off. Otherwise, I have no problem tagging this with a five star classic rating. Get it before the limited editions run out.
0156034026|1.0|I am not shy about criticizing US foreign policy and our nation's hubris.  There are many legitimate reasons to dislike the US government.  This book is based on none of them.  In contrast to millions of people around the world, the protagonist was issued a visa to come to the US, attended one of the top colleges in the US and was selected over hundreds of applicants for a plum US job with a high salary.  He is surrounded by people who like him, look out for him and care for him.  Yet when the 9/11 attacks happen, he smiles and is pleased.  Why?  He doesn't really say - it appears to be based on his personal, cultural identity crisis and a reference to American belligerence (which, though true, is not tied in personally to the protagonist at all).  He seethes with anger when the US attacks the Taliban in Afghanistan.  He apparently but inexplicably sympathizes with his murderous, iron-fisted, women-hating neighbors.  This book seems to have been written in a hurry, the author neglecting to provide any legitimate foundation for the protagonist's antipathy to the US.  Certainly it could have been done and the reader is truly left wondering why the author chose to omit history in favor of assuming that the reader would agree the protagonist's feelings were justified.  It is particularly confusing when told from the viewpoint of a well-educated, supposedly intellectual man who should have seen that hard diplomacy is a much sharper weapon than violence.    I found the author's writing style (the protagonist speaking to a man with no voice and no apparent reason to be there other than as an excuse to poke more fun at Americans) annoying and disruptive of what little flow the book had.  Another stylistic tool - the dash! - is ubiquitous and entirely distracting.  Truly, this book could have been so much more had the author put more time (and perhaps research) into it.  It could have been a bridge to explain to a mass audience Muslims' frustration with America. It utterly fails in this regard and in the end I fear it will only be used as fuel by those who believe that Islam is a violent faith.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|what a great CD!!! I keep this one in the car and my family LOVES it!!!!!
B0012IV3RS|4.0|While I am not a Fulci inconditional, I am a fan of horror flicks. Among the Italian giallo style, this one is a pretty good -Fulci substyle- one. For instance, it is way superior to Sergio Martino's Torso and some others alike. The dialogs and acting are descent, and the main story is well conducted so you have several suspects for the Donald Duck voiced maniac. Lots of gore, nudity, sleaze, and soft core scenes. As usual you will se the \\"maestro\\" showing up during some brief not bad acting. I own an Another World Entertainment (AWE) PAL copy that looks comparable to this Underground NTSC version. It comes under a nice widescreen and a crisp clear picture transfer. While the feature lenght indicates 92 min, the actual movie is about 89 min.
006113399X|5.0|\\"The Redbreast\\" is a smart and sophisticated crime novel, an intelligent and cleverly crafted tale of honor, disgrace, and chicanery that will have you scratching your head, unable to pull away from a convoluted mystery spanning nearly six decades while probing an obscure but fascinating niche of WWII history.<br /><br />Written by Jo Nesbo in 2000, this Norwegian award winner was translated to English and released a couple of years ago.  It starts in 1999, with Oslo police detective Harry Hole nearly causing an international incident when botched communications disrupt a motorcade transporting the President of the US.  In an attempt to keep Hole - and Norway, out of the limelight, Harry is shuffled off to a government agency tasked with keeping an eye on neo-Nazi activity in the capital city.  Abruptly turn the clock back some fifty-seven years to the Eastern front, to a team of Norwegian nationals, voluntarily fighting the Bolsheviks for the Wermarcht.  From Oslo to Leningrad to Vienna and back, Nesbo takes the reader through contrasting images of frozen foxholes and gilded mansions, from traitors who betrayed Norway and joined the invading Nazis while maintaining a semblance of dignity to stone cold killers on both sides of history.<br /><br />\\"Redbreast\\" is one of those rare gems of fiction that illuminate dark corners of history while at the same time maintain the pace and suspense of the best pop thrillers.  The characters are well drawn and believable, though a word of warning: there are many, and some effort is required in keeping names, places and times in some order.  Nesbo is tediously precise not only in his research, but moreover, in dropping obscure hints and foreshadowing leading to a climax that was as credible as it was unexpected, a series of multiple twists and turns that you'll need your Garmin to track, while leaving enough ambiguity to launch a sequel.<br /><br />Nesbo will remind of the painstaking detail of LeCarre's finest works - \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\" or \\"Smiley's People\\", and may recall images from Turow's  \\"Ordinary Heroes\\" or Silva's  \\"The Confessor\\".  It shares the broodingly atmospheric Scandinavian fatalism of Icelander author's Arnaldur Indridason's outstanding crime fiction, especially the eerily similar and highly recommended \\"Silence of the Grave.\\"  This is an ambitious novel - and clearly one of the most engrossing books I've read this year - I'd highly recommend adding Jo Nesbo to that list of \\"must reads.\\"Cold\\" or \\"Smiley's People\\", and may recall images from Turow's  \\"Ordinary Heroes\\" or Silva's  \\"The Confessor\\".

B001AIRUP4|5.0|Just finished watching the Blu Ray transfer of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\", and it was absolutely gorgeous. The vivid colors, depth and clarity of the picture is one of the best catalog Blu Ray transfers I've seen thus far. At first, you can tell it looks great but the transfer really shows through when Jack Skellington enters Christmas Town for the first time...it's here where the colors and animation come to life the best. As far as the movie goes, I've always had a place in my film-lover's heart for this animated Gothic gem. Though I find that the story drags a little towards the end, overall it is wonderful.    As an extra bonus you get a HUGE SELECTION OF SPECIAL FEATURES including Burton's short films \\"Vincent\\" and \\"Frankenweenie\\", which both look gorgeous in high definition (especially Vincent). A must have for any Blu Ray collection!!
B000068FY0|5.0|If you like \\"Crime Of The Century\\", this 2002 version labeled \\"Newly Digitally Remastered from the Original Master Tales\\" is the best digital version available. Better than the MFSL UD1 Made In Japan, catalog UDCD 505 or any other version. This is a wonderful flat transfer.    This recording was remastered by Greg Calbi and Jay Messina at Sterling Sound, New York.

I have bought four copies of it now and give it as gifts to new brides, friends, and loved ones! After reading this title, I purchased The five love languages of children and that one is superb as well!

B00005JPO1|4.0|I'd like to defend this movie after reading some of the other reviews for it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my step-father, my husband and my brother and all four of us liked it a lot. Then I saw it again with my daughter, who never saw any of the originals but is a big Tomb Raider fan. She's 14 and she liked it. Then she went to see it again with her grandmother who doesn't like a damn thing, and SHE liked it. So I'm having trouble understanding the reviews of people who really trash this movie.<br /><br />I think Harrison Ford looks just fine. Far better than most men his age. He was believable enough. He still looks strong and seems agile. I know people half his age that are falling apart, so I can't see how anyone could accuse him of being too old to pull this off.<br /><br />Some of the stunts were no less realistic than were in the original movies. The CGI made the effects more believable, not less in my opion, so again I can't understand reviews that are trashing the CGI.<br /><br />As for the plot, I don't know what other people are complaining about. The UFO thing was big in the 50's. The timing is right for it.<br /><br />The character, Mutt, wasn't so fabulous, but I wasn't expecting Oscar material here. The silliest thing he did was swing from trees like a monkey, but in all fairness, grown up Indy fans need to realize many older fans were bringing little kids to see this movie and that sort of thing makes a kid laugh and remember the movie, as opposed to being bored. Adult Star Wars fans tend to forget this, too.<br /><br />People say Lord of the Rings was a masterpiece and yet, I hated it, but that's besides the point. Here is my point: Is Lord of the Rings more believable than Indiana Jones? Are those ugly trolls and monsters more believable than the elegant crystal skulls? Its fantasy. That's all its meant to be, yet I've read reviews that talked about how unbelievable the plot was.<br /><br />Suspend reality and enjoy the ride. Its a fun movie and I am speaking for 6 people here, (some of whom lack imagination), all of whom enjoyed it. If you want reality, watch the news. This is fantasy for the sake of fun. Neither Lucas nor Spielberg were out to make an epic that would win an Oscar for best drama or anything. It was just meant to be fun.lack imagination), all of whom enjoyed it.

B001ESZNPY|1.0|I don't know what direction these guys are trying to go in. But, i'm certainly not liking it at all. This cd is riddled with soft lullaby's. And, when they decide to get heavy, it becomes the typical noise, fast beats, double bass garbage that has no groove/rhythm....just like every nickel and dime band out there today. Did not like this cd at all.
B00009L1UP|4.0|This was Queensryche's commercial pitch, and was a pretty big hit on the radio.  Extraordinary vocals, excellent writing, and great hooks on most of the songs.  One of the great albums of the 90's.
0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein unveils in this hard-hitting book (naming names) extremely clearly the economic utopia and the shameful realities resulting from the neo-liberal policies of the Chicago School of Economics, also called `The Washington Consensus'.    What  Its defenders claim that the free market is a perfect scientific system, in which individuals acting on their own self-interested desire, create the maximum benefit for all.  But, as no country or city wanted to implement deliberately their policies, its powerful fundamentalist defenders, together with their long arm, the IMF, used and created shocks (wars, military coups, political upheavals, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, epidemics, energy and resource shortages) to force a second shock of radical social and economic engineering on traumatized populations.    Where  Naomi Klein analyzes brilliantly a long list of victims of the shock doctrine of which the most important are: Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Iraq, Russia, Indonesia, Poland, South-Africa, former Yugoslavia and its republics, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Thailand, New Or leans and the US as a whole.    How  This radical economic cure consisted intentionally in eliminating the public sphere, in giving total freedom to private interests and in providing only skeletal social spending. Sometimes with the help of the IMF as their obedient mediator, State and corporate wealth was cut into pieces and sold of for a trifle in debased currencies to private, mostly foreign, interests: airlines, phone and water systems, oilfields, all kind of corporations and factories (sometimes direct competitors), mineral deposits or farmlands.    Private bonanza, public hell  Those policies created a formidable bonanza for transnational corporations, oligarchs and investment banks.  For the majority of the population, the results were less than bleak, rather hellish:  Not democracy, but dictatorship  Not peace, but war, tortures or simply assassinations (the essence of dehumanizing)  Not freedom for the populations, but for the corporations   Not hiring, but mass unemployment (putting people in a starvation position)  Not civil liberties, but aggressive surveillance  Not clean commerce, but rampant corruption  Not broadly based wealth, but turning 25 to 60 % of the population into a permanent underclass  Not clean air and water, but environmental degradation    US  In the US, the core of the governmental tasks (the military, the police, fire departments, power, covert intelligence, disease control, public schools) was subcontracted to private interests.     Future  But the tide is turning against disaster capitalism. The IMF is nearly out of business.  Democratic socialism, always regarded by those in power as a greater threat than totalitarian communism, is clearly on the march, especially in South-America.    Naomi Klein's formidable book is a must read for all those who want to understand the world we live in.
0789318121|4.0|This was a nice book, and a must have for any true Bat-fan, however I wish it went into more detail on the actual making of the movie. It is interesting to read the original script and see how it differed from the final product. In short, great coffee table book, it just could have been better.

B001BKXUOQ|3.0|Earlier this year, Slipknot added the title track to hear online. I almost #$%@ my pants. I couldn't believe. I was not very fond of Subliminal Verses. This was heavy, Corey was screaming again, I started getting optimistic about their career again. A month or two later, maybe even more, they give us another audio orgasm, \\"Psychosocial\\". I was impressed with this song as well. I watched the video premier online, and like the confidence they presented, how creepy Shawn walked around with a baseball and little teenage girls screamed in horror. That's the kind of stuff that turns me on. Then the video I thought was pretty effing good. I'm looking online for a leak of the album for weeks. Then I finally found it about a week ago. I start listening....<br /><br />Execute - is odd which was expected for an intro. Adds to the eerie-ness that we've grown to know as Slipknot.<br /><br />Gematria - the beginning music sounded like it definately had some Slayer influence, that was awesome. Corey throws in his singing, I'm liking it.<br /><br />then from there on, there's only a few songs I really really enjoyed, the two songs I heard previously, \\"All Hope is Gone\\" and \\"Psychosocial\\" and  I was like, what the hell happened? Wherein Lies Continue was pretty good too.<br /><br />So I bought the CD/ DVD edition last night at Best Buy basically for the DVD, I myself am a musician, and I don't believe in ripping off artists. The DVD is really weird, somewhat in a good way, but it was completely disappointing. It's really random, I don't mind that at all, but I was really hoping for some recordings of Corey screaming, his screaming WAS so good. Instead you hear him sing, not to say his singing is bad, but I prefer his screaming.<br /><br />I guess you can say I didn't really want to allow Slipknot to go in this direction, but nobody feels the same way forever, you grow, and change, and mature. But, I feel like they accidentally put in a Stone Sour cd in what should've been Slipknot's fifth studio album.

B000E6EGZ0|5.0|ABOUT THE ALBUM: Puccini (Tosca): Leontyne Price, soprano (Tosca) Giuseppe Di Stefano, tenor (Mario Cavaradossi), Giuseppe Taddei, baritone (Scarpia), Fernando Corena, baritone (Sacristan) Carlo Cava, bass (Angelotti) Piero De Palma, baritone (Spoletta), Leonardo Monreale, tenor (Sciarrone) Herbert Weiss tenor (A Shepherd) Alfredo Mariotti tenor(Policeman), Vienna Philharmonic and Chorus, Conductor Herbert Von Karajan, Decca records, recorded at the Sofiensaal, Vienna, September, 1962<br /><br />Decca has reissued their older LP record classics into the Decca Legends CD, digitally remastered with greater sound, featuring renowed artists of the opera from over 40 years ago; including this classic Tosca starring Leontyne Price. For fans of the first great African-American diva of the opera, this is a slice of Heaven, as this recording seems to be made purely for her fans as it is a recording whose value and strengths lie around her expert artistry. Recorded in Vienna in 1962, the cast boasts Herbert Von Karajan conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano as Cavaradossi and Giuseppe Taddei as Scarpia. The recording has been remastered from the scratchy old LP so that it sounds powerfully alive and fresh, complete with sound effects and noises like the sound of cannon (in Act 1), doors opening and shutting, distant voices singing (as in Act 2's Cantata), church bells (Act 2)and the sound of gunfire (Mario's Execution) in the finale. The strength of this masterpiece recording lies in the outstanding musicianship of conductor Herbert Von Karajan and his Vienna forces and the virtuosic and experienced performance of Leontyne Price, who is a force of her own. Critics and hardcore operaphiles have critiqued this recording to death and the common assesment is that while Leontyne Price does a magnificent performance, it's a voice that lacks any real dramatic truth and that the Vienna Philharmonic and Karajan's masterful touch seems to overpower the performance of the singers. While these things are true, one has to take in mind that at the time this recording was made, only Maria Callas' 1950's Tosca performances were considered the best and this recording was made using the then modern recording sound and a brand new Tosca of a new age, a black soprano singing a role that had previously been the triumph of white sopranos and Leontyne had herself overcome prejudice and hardships to rule the opera scene as the first true diva assoluta. While unfortunately her co-stars aren't as youthful or \\"on\\" in this recording in comparison to Price, for one thing, fans of Leontyne Price should opt to own this recording in place of the 1973 Zubin Mehta Tosca with Placido Domingo and Sherill Milnes (Leontyne Tosca number 2) In that later recording, despite better co-stars who are singing wonderfully, everything is rushed and made quickly, without as much love and care, showcasing modern (for the 70's) singers' dramatic and stylish voices for a period of partnership with Mehta and RCA record label (Forza Del Destino was the other recording they did). Mehta's tempi are incredibly swift, visceral and energetic) and Leontyne Price's former command of the Italian text had become noticeably careless and instead she \\"whoops\\" through phrases and her voice, though more dramaic, darker and stronger (nearly Wagnerian) is no where near as beautiful and passionate as she sings in this Tosca. Placido Domingo's Cavaradossi is brilliant and his best Cavaradossi ever sung, and he's a far better alternative than Di Stefano. But the real reason this Decca Tosca is superior is its lead soprano. After all, in 1962, she was in her best voice, for this was the year she debuted at the Metropolitan Opera, the year she first entered the Big Leagues. This is her best Tosca hands down for this record captures her in the height of her prime, eventhough her co-stars are at their last stages of their respective careers. The '72 Mehta recording is a different animal than this '62 Tosca. The difference is one is purely musical and artistic and the other is more dramatic and hardcore so it boils down for your tastes in opera as either ear candy or dramatic potency.<br /><br />KARAJAN CONDUCTS TOSCA WITH THE VIENNA PHILHARMONIC:<br /><br />Karajan championed Leontyne Price early in her career, even before she came to the Met. In Vienna, she had already sang Leonora in Verdi's Trovatore to great acclaim opposite Franco Corelli at the Salzburg Festival. It was this role and this same production she took to the Met as her debut and the rest is history. Karajan's relationship with her as conductor and artist was one of pure respect. Karajan in 1962, too, was in his musical prime, and his many recording of classical music ranging from Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven to Wagner attest to his brilliance. He treats Puccini's score with dramatic flair and epic majesty, broad tempi (particularly in the Act 1 Finale but also in other parts such as the duets between Cavaradossi and Tosca) and also suffuses the score with painstaking attention to subtleties and lyrical sensibility in such moments as the Scarpia/Tosca scenes and all the motifs associated with the opera. It is as if Karajan treated us to a symphony of the score and then added the singers for harmony. Karajan is not considered a truly outstanding opera conductor (his only real rival and superior was Karl Bohm for opera) as he is a symphonic/classical music conductor but in the case of this Tosca we find him more than competent; he is amazing. He would again conduct competently Bizet's Carmen with Price (who never performed Carmen on stage but sang for Karajan on a recording). Karajan would return to conducting the score to Tosca in his later years in the 80's when he contracted Katia Ricciarelli, Jose Carreras and Ruggero Raimondi in another superb performance available on Deutsche Grammophone. Any devoted fan of Karajan should look into his recordings with Leontyne Price and these are found in other record labels and include the \\"live\\" Salzburg Festival performance of Verdi's Il Trovatore with the Price/Corelli/ pairing, Don Giovanni with Price as Donna Anna and with Eberhard Wachter as Giovanni; Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as Elvira. These recordings represent a time in which Price was in Europe and poised for success as a major soprano in America (this Europe-to-the Met path was the sure-fire way for an opera singer to succeed at the time due to the tastes of the Met administration under Rudolf Bing). This was perhaps Price's most momentous times, the mark of her success at at time when such things were otherwise impossible.<br /><br />LEONTYNE PRICE AS TOSCA<br /><br />Leontyne Price was in 1962 an experienced opera singer and people forget this. She had already sung Aida and her first Toscas in the 1950's. Basically, she was poised to conquer the opera world because her first performances were not the stepping stone roles in opera, but the major opera roles like Tosca, Aida and Madame Butterfly. Price was influenced by Callas in taking over the world of opera by storm and in the turbulent, Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's, it was the perfect way to revolutionize the opera and to make her own signature in the Movement. One of her early Toscas was broadcast on NBC and it had been viewed by many Americans despite protests by racist Southern stations that refused to air it. Tosca was never a challenge for Leontyne, nor the operas of Puccini and Verdi, for in them she found a vehicle tailor-made for her lyrico spinto voice, a rich, creamy, velvet, sensuous voice that nevertheless sailed through the highest most passionate fortissimi and yet floated through the softest and most emotional pianissimi passages, authentic heroine roles in the opera. For the entire performance on this record she is sensational and luminous. Her voice is appropriately vulnerable but spunky. Listen to the entire scene beginning with \\"Mario! Mario! Mario!\\" in which she flies into a jealous rage because she suspects Mario is having a tryst with another woman. She perfectly transitions from a voice that is indeed jealous and spoiled to a voice of genuine love for Mario. When Scarpia sets a trap to provoke her jealousy toward the end of Act 1 using La Attavanti's fan, note how she is torn between heartbreak and vulnerability to a madly jealous and vindictive woman. She is pure passion. Leontyne captures these moments perfectly, even if critics and detractors' reviews claimed she pays no attention to Tosca's subtle character traits or can't act. She DOES! I hear a voice that is so overcome by the music that she is forced to act, even if it's a little bit. In Act 2, when Scarpia tortures Mario so that she may reveal Angelotti's hiding place, she is a woman who is pushed into despair and who has been tormented, though the way Price sings it she maintains a noble bearing and majestic dignity. She is even \\"majestic\\" when she stabs Scarpia \\"Questo Il Bacio Di Tosca\\" and she does not scream or go on a murderous rage as most sopranos do. In Act 3, in her duet with Mario she is sublime and triumphant. Comparisons to Maria Callas have been made, inevitably but frankly, Callas and Price are two entirely different artists with distinctly individual approach. Callas was an actress and her voice was choked with the intensity of the emotional components of the heroines she portrayed. Callas sang with her gut, with blood and fire and this made her a legend. Price was intelligent and studied her roles academically but prioritized singing beautifully and elegantly, with attention to detail in the music. Nevertheless, depending on the conductor she was performing for, she could find the drama from deep in her black woman's soul and often it carried over into the performance. For her Aida was very personal and that is why that performance was her absolute best. Tosca was not so personal but she wanted to record a best-selling album to rival Callas and Tebaldi's, which were the previous winners, and to be in an entirely different category of her own. This recording shows off her youthful, spirited voice that masters everything about what Tosca is all about - power, passion, beauty, vulnerability, despair and romance. I didn't find a fault in anything except she cops out a the end when upon discovering that Mario is really dead, she goes a little looney and makes her voice sound pretty cheesy-dramatic. Thank God it's only for a few seconds but she seems to climax in a less noble way. She had already sang a very glittering Tosca so she logically ends it in a more campy manner. It's very annoying to hear her hysteria though. But even with this, I still prefer this Tosca to even Maria Callas' eternally popular 1950's EMI recording. Callas is no better or wose than Price and Price, too, has moments of grandeur and of flaw; but this Tosca is divine, so wonderful one has to experience it for themselves. It's amazing to hear this American woman triumph in a role that had always belonged to non-Americans overseas. And it was only the beginning. Aida would follow in the 1960's and she would continue to sing Verdi (La Forza Del Destino) Mozart (Don Giovanni, Cosi Fan Tutte, Figaro) and Puccini (Butterfly) Bizet (Carmen) before experimenting with various repertoires (Gershwin, Handel, Massenet, Britten, Wagner and Strauss)in concert form as depicted in the 4-CD set \\"Prima Donna\\" album. For rabid fans of Leontyne, this first Tosca is a must have and a keeper to add to all the other Leontyne Price memorabilia.<br /><br />THE TWO GIUSEPPES<br /><br />Yes, Giuseppe Di Stefano in '62 could not knock them dead as he did when he was singing the role of Mario opposite Callas and Tebaldi. Yes, there is, as the Editorial Review states, a crack in the voice as he belts out the duet in the last act. For the more fortissimo passages, he is screaming and merely putting up the volumeto his voice. There is no finesse or beauty of tenor voice but this owes to his age. He was cast with Price for his experience with the opera (perhaps Karajan or Price herself did not wish for Cavaradossi to be performed by a newbie)Even with the sad lack of technical artistry, his \\"E Lucevan La Stelle\\" the major aria is well-executed and I find nothing faulty in the duets in which he relaxes his voice along with Price and the orchestra. Yeah he's older bu he still has a voice! Note how he exclaims in stentorian fortissimi \\"Vittoria! Vittoria\\" in Act 2. So for fans of Di Stefano, this is also a fine recording to add to your collection. He does sound in-synch next to Leontyne, which is a must for Mario-Tosca pairings. I can feel these two really trying hard to sound like they're in love. It would have been a lot better for the success of this recording to have casted Franco Corelli as Cavaradossi, seeing as Corelli knew the role and had the perfect voice in its prime for it and it would have added to the Price-Corelli pairing that had already been seen with \\"Trovatore\\". Where was Corelli during the making of this recording and why didn't anyone think of contracting him ????? Corelli would indeed sing Cavaradossi later in 1967 in a recording (also under Decca) with Birgit Nilsson who is an entirely different and less romantic Tosca when you compare the Valkyrie voice next to the angelic Leontyne. To think of how Corelli-Price would have sounded together in Tosca! Corelli had the honor of singing opposite Price once only on record - the Karajan Carmen with Leontyne Price.<br /><br />Giuseppe Taddei, detractors insist, is also singing past his prime and lacks a je ne sai quais in his performance as the sinister, sadistic, lustful and evil Scarpia. Nonsense. His voice perfectly encompasses all the signature villainous traits. Plus, his Scarpia is quite LOUD and ANGRY sounding, which gives Scarpia an edge, a menacing and powerful alpha male quality that is absolutely necessary. To my ears none of the other interpretors - Tito Gobbi, Sherill Milnes, Samuel Ramey or Ruggero Raimondi possess the authentic intensity that Taddei employs for Scarpia. It's a matter of preference. There are many who want to hear a rich, lyric baritone who, despite being the monster of the opera, has to please musically to the ear. I don't see how his character needs to sound \\"beautiful\\" when his soul is so ugly. Listen to how Taddei, in his first lines, shouts: \\"Un Tal Bacciano in chiesa! Bel Rispetto!\\". Already, he establishes his commanding, evil quality as Scarpia. Karajan was wise enough to contract basso-buffo Fernando Corena as the comic relief role of the Sacristan. He is hilarious and he even uses falsetto for comic affect. He was also doing many of these kind of roles and his career with Decca continued in the 60's. Next to the dark, invective-style voice of Taddei's Scarpia, Corena sounds more like Leporello in Don Giovanni, only far more wimpy. It's such a fine contrast - Taddei and Corena and it's even more miraculous when one realizes that Taddei had in his own career sang Leporello! If a baritoen has a voice that can do both Mozart (Don Giovanni, Figaro) and Scarpia, then it's a very unique and very well-endowed voice. The only other similar flexible baritone who could do comic and dramatic roles was Dietrich Fischer Dieskau (who recorded for Deutsche Grammophone) but you can hear his take on Scarpia in the Decca Tosca with Nilsson and Corelli.<br /><br />So, please, opera fans, consider this to be the GREATEST TOSCA EVER MADE. If not, then certainly among the higher ranks of Tosca recordings commercially available. It's Leontyne Price at her absolute best, a passionate, golden voice full of bloom. These recordings (the others were with Leindorf conducting - Aida, Butterfly, Cosi Fan Tutte, represented her first step into the realm of the record industry, a way to promote herself as an artist in the mostly white opera world of the early 1960's. Her later recordings made in the 1970's show her in less stylish voice but find her to be incredibly dramatic and experienced, a veteran star. Her Tosca may not be to everyone's tastes and perhaps not the grandest of the grandest but she is competent. There are very competent Tosca singers like Callas, Tebaldi, Zinka Milanov, Monsterrat Caballe, Katia Ricciarelli, Renata Scotto, Carol Vaness, Eva Marton and Angela Gheorguiu, sopranos who brought their own signature and uniqueness to the most coveted role in all opera. But Price belongs to a different generation, a time when it mattered to be undertaking the role for personal reasons and for very revolutionary purposes. Need I SAY MORE ? This reissue has replaced the previous Decca Legends copies which are no longer commercially available (the other one had a black-and-white photograph of Karajan giving Price a big hug) and that one was a wonderful set of copies but they remastered it again probably for better sound and overall efficiency.ers, and to be in an entirely different category of her own. This recording shows off her youthful, spirited voice that masters everything about what Tosca is all about - power, passion, beauty, vulnerability, despair and romance. I didn't find a fault in anything except she cops out a the end when upon discovering that Mario is really dead, she goes a little looney and makes her voice sound pretty cheesy-dramatic.

If a baritoen has a voice that can do both Mozart (Don Giovanni, Figaro) and Scarpia, then it's a very unique and very well-endowed voice. The only other similar flexible baritone who could do comic and dramatic roles was Dietrich Fischer Dieskau (who recorded for Deutsche Grammophone) but you can hear his take on Scarpia in the Decca Tosca with Nilsson and Corelli.     So, please, opera fans, consider this to be the GREATEST TOSCA EVER MADE. If not, then certainly among the higher ranks of Tosca recordings commercially available. It's Leontyne Price at her absolute best, a passionate, golden voice full of bloom. These recordings (the others were with Leindorf conducting - Aida, Butterfly, Cosi Fan Tutte, represented her first step into the realm of the record industry, a way to promote herself as an artist in the mostly white opera world of the early 1960's. Her later recordings made in the 1970's show her in less stylish voice but find her to be incredibly dramatic and experienced, a veteran star. Her Tosca may not be to everyone's tastes and perhaps not the grandest of the grandest but she is competent. There are very competent Tosca singers like Callas, Tebaldi, Zinka Milanov, Monsterrat Caballe, Katia Ricciarelli, Renata Scotto, Carol Vaness, Eva Marton and Angela Gheorguiu, sopranos who brought their own signature and uniqueness to the most coveted role in all opera. But Price belongs to a different generation, a time when it mattered to be undertaking the role for personal reasons and for very revolutionary purposes. Need I SAY MORE ? This reissue has replaced the previous Decca Legends copies which are no longer commercially available (the other one had a black-and-white photograph of Karajan giving Price a big hug) and that one was a wonderful set of copies but they remastered it again probably for better sound and overall efficiency.

031606792X|5.0|Book 4 of the Twilight Saga is every bit as great as the previous three books. The book was so good I read it twice in the span of 4 days. Again, masterfully written, Stephenie takes you on the a wonderful ride through her characters' lives. Although, the book may be predictable in spots, most readers probably would not want things any other way.  Stephenie gives her readers the ending they have been waiting for.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|Why?! Why did they do this? I have held Silent Hill as sacred since the demo of the game that came with Metal Gear Solid blew my mind back in 1999. I have worshipped the games ever since for providing an intelligent, cinematic, atmospheric, and deeply psychologically disturbing experience that transcends gaming. However, the film-makers have taken random bits from each of the immaculate games and thrown them all into this mish-mash of nonsensical crap that demonstrates they have absolutely no understanding of the nature of the town. For example, monsters are based specifically on a person's subjective experience and past trauma/life events, which leads to the question: why the hell are there monsters that relate mostly to James (Silent Hill 2) in this movie? Pyramid Head does NOT belong in this movie. The straight-jacket spitting-acid guys do NOT belong in this movie. None of these enemies should belong in this movie.    Something else that should not belong in this movie is the survivors. There are no survivors. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!     I can't even say that for people unfamiliar with the game series that this would be a good movie, as the acting is dreadful, the atmosphere is nonexistant, the sets look really fake, and the music is placed randomly to situations that don't fit the composer's initial ideas and moods. To make it even worse, the complete story is summarised at the end to \\"dumb-it-down\\" which implies to me that the film-makers have no respect for the audience and assume we are all stupid. This is unlike the game which actually treats its audience with respect by leaving a lot of aspects open to interpretation, and lets you enjoy the intrigue and put the pieces of the puzzle together for yourself.     This movie should never have been made. It didn't NEED to be made. The games practically are movies anyway, except that you have a deeper involvement due to controlling the characters. The game is intelligent, stylish and atmospheric enough to stand onits own and does not deserve to be pillaged by misguided film-makers who aren't creative enough to come up with their own ideas, and, in this case, can't even be bothered doing research to understand the premise. PLEASE do not make another Silent Hill film.

B0000009RT|4.0|The first Mother's album was a huge step outside the normal rock and roll of the mid sixties, introducing it's audience to the Psychodelic era.  This album is historic if nothing else.  The music is an early Frank Zappa with the current culture influence, it sounds nothing like the later Frank and has rough edges.
B0000009SI|5.0|Some of Frank's best work ever.  Very deep introspection of his subject matter, superb music composition, and of course the muse of the satire that makes Frank so intriguing to listen to!
B0017MO10U|5.0|Basically if you're reading this then you're probably a Stargate SG-1 fan. One who has watched it ever since I got hooked on the show in the beginning as well as the Stargate movie way back in the day so when I say this movie was awesome, that means a lot. Time travel movies are always eeh at points because let's face it we have no idea how real or fake some situations might be. However this alternate time plot really gives this movie a great deep story and with the main bad guy being Bal, it's an instant classic. Definitely better than the first SG-1 DVD, The Ark of Truth, although completely different story but I have to say I like them both for what they are as well. If you liked the 1970s Stargate SG-1 episode when the team traveled back in time, unaware and unintentionally, than you'll love this movie as well.
B0001HAISG|5.0|When watching a movie version of a favorite classic, one's expection is high. I expected this film to be good, but found it to be much more exciting. In fact, it seemed to literally capture images from my imagination formed while reading as a child, and re-create them on screen. Watching it gave me a sense of motivation, and a renewed desire to play as my children do, right alongside them. My children were rivoted by this production. They have since made their own costumes to look like favorite characters and built a rustic pergola-style \\"Lost Boys Fort\\" out of sticks, ivy, and dried flowers from the garden! I guess they found it motivating as well!

061891868X|5.0|What shocked me most about Smolin's account of string theory is his claim that many of its leading lights have paid too little attention to mathematical rigor or even to a clean mathematical specification of their theory. If true, this is a major scandal. In most professions, this sort of sloppiness would be grounds for losing a job or even being prosecuted if something goes wrong. To hear that string theorists are perhaps not always intellectually sound is discouraging. They have raised exaggerated expectations about what their framework accomplishes (hype), and their methods have not always been sound (malpractice). Smolin is of course much more polite, and recognizes that many of the ideas advanced by string theory needed to be explored even if they prove fruitless or wrong. But his book does show clearly that something has gone seriously wrong with the internal governance of the physics profession.     Brian Green, a leading string theorist, says the following in his contribution to \\"The New Physics\\" (2006): \\"It might be argued that string theory has so far failed [] since it has not yet made very detailed connections with experiment.\\" He goes on to hold out the hope that \\"Ultimately, the tests of the theory are likely to come from cosmological observations that detect the state of the Universe during the first moments after the Big Bang.\\" Anyone who has read the cosmology literature knows how often inferences have to be piled on top of inferences in an attempt to arrive at a consistent explanation of what is observed from humanity's single vantage point and with our imperfect instruments. The kind of cosmology that would be needed to test string theory is not exactly around the corner. Moreover, I always had the impression that cosmologists are looking more to other branches of physics to help them make sense of their observations than the other way around.    Aside from his criticism of string theory, Smolin makes an inspiring argument for new and more diverseapproaches to unsolved problems in physics, among which he includes unifying general relativity and quantum theory, establishing sounder foundations for quantum mechanics, unifying all particles and forces as manifestations of a single fundamental entity, explaining the constants used in the theory, and resolving the puzzle of dark matter and energy in cosmology. The book helpfully names and discusses a number of theorists the author thinks are currently making the most interesting contributions to solving these problems. Without Smolin's expert guidance, it is unlikely that a reader would independently come across these fascinating contributions.    The chapters on the sociology of physics will be unsurprising to anyone who has worked in academia. However, if Smolin's revelations about groupthink and sloppy mathematics in the physics profession are even half true, they raise concerns about other areas of physics as well. Given the importance of physics to the fate of mankind, at least since the invention of the atom bomb, it is clearly time to develop new principles for the governance of this essential group of brilliant, but still human and imperfect, thinkers.

B00000DLVA|4.0|First of all: this album doesn't sound like \\"Life\\", \\"Emmerald\\" or \\"First Band on the Moon\\". If you want music like the one on any of those albums, go and grab them as you may get disappointed with \\"Gran Turismo\\" as a few reviewers here did.<br /><br />This is simply a different Cardigans sound, which reflects the healthy evolution of a band, moving away from positive cheesy fun pop for a younger audience to an electro-guitar-led trip-hop, much more labored, self-conscious album, a bit too far away from the mainstream. And that's just great from my side.<br /><br />Hypnotic. Inspired. Slow enough. Fast enough. Sophisticated. Stylish. Cool.<br /><br />If I wanted The Cardigans to sound always the same as they did on their previous albums, then it would be much easier to push the 'repeat all' button on my CD player when listening \\"Life\\" or \\"Emmerald\\".<br /><br />It would also save me some bucks by the way...

In the movie theatre when I 1st heard  Pierce sing I cringed initally. That being said, upon listening several times to this version, now I find I love his version of \\"When All Is Said And Done\\" It is just so darned Honest!<br />ABBA was never my cup of tea, however even I admit to really liking several of their catchy songs... I really love Meryl's versions of the songs she sings also...<br />If you love the film version, this soundtrack should be purchased as stand alone, to simply accompany that  & not to replace the ABBA/B'Way versions you all love so well...
B00005QCYX|5.0|A few house albums result so engaging and catchy as this one... Superb samplers, positive gooves and amazing bass guitars make this one simply a must for any electronica and dance music fan by bringing both house and disco music together with an elegant touch of style up to the highest levels.<br /><br />Imagine Daft Punk meets Jamiroquai, and revisit Chic's catalogue... sometimes it even seems Bernard Edwards being part of the band on the guitars.<br /><br />If you can manage to get the special edition with the additional CD full of remixes and versions, you just get prepared to never stop listening to these chaps.<br /><br />Great!
1596912863|5.0|Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in the world of Jane Austen?  Then, take a three week trip to Pembrook Park in England.  Pembrook Park, an Austenland for modern-day women obsessed with Jane Austen, especially Pride and Prejudice.  Shannon Hale brings Jane Austen's books back to life. The year is 2008, but in Austenland welcome to 1808.     Jane Hayes is an independent woman who is searching for the right man. The only problem is Jane's perfect man doesn't exist, unless you count Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy from Pride and Prejudice.  One day that all changes when Jane's Aunt Carolyn leaves her a vacation to Pembrook Park in her will.  Jane is reluctant to go, but convinces herself that it's the only way to get rid of her Austen obsession.    While Jane is in Pembrook Park she must look and act the part.  Her name is changed to Miss Erstwhile, and though eventually she fully takes on her role, a few modern conveniences nearly get her kicked out.    Her love interest, Mr. Nobley, which in every sense is Mr. Darcy, seems to take his job as a gentleman very seriously. It's almost too late before Jane and Mr. Nobley choose between losing someone they care about or taking a chance on love.    Jane loses her Austen obsession, but gains her very own Mr. Darcy.  I highly recommend this book if you love Jane Austen.  Austenland was an original story, but has aspects of Austen's works, which was my favorite part.  Take a chance on Austenland, and I'm sure you'll agree you made the right choice!

You won't be able to put it down.  A real bonus is his willingness to explain the impact of liberal hand-wringing and incessant criticism of military personnel serving their country in dangerous places.  It's not at all surprising to see reviews by liberals posing as military personnel just to attack Marcus Luttrell's experiences and viewpoints.  Posing is, I suppose, what they do best.  Buy the book, you will NOT be disappointed.

B000ZNRBK4|4.0|This plastic, circular hood should have come standard with the D40 or D60 18-55mm Nikon AF-S DX kit lens, but unfortunately it does not.  The hood's outside moulding is of the same non-glossy textured finish matching the D60's body perfectly.  It fits bayonet style over the lenses focus ring, thereby also allowing a filter and a lens cap.  The hood's inner ring also has notches that grip the len's focus ring, allowing for manual focus by gripping the hood without the hood sliding.  Hood may also be attached backwards onto lens for easier storage inside a camera case.  If not for its high price for a plastic hood, I would give it 5 stars.<br />------------------------------<br />Note: Hood can leave a shadow at bottom end of the picture when the D60's built-in flash is used and lens is at the wide end.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|So I had a bit of a medical insurance fiasco a few years back, in that I was self-employed and in a state that had few patient protections.  So when I tried to get independent insurance, and I had the money to pay, I was shut out of the system.  One large company decided I was a \\"medical risk\\" and I couldn't get insurance from any company no matter what I tried.  An insurance broker actually used the term blacklisted to describe my situation!  I eventually was able to get emergency hospital only coverage that I nicknamed \\"hit by a truck\\" insurance.  My situation changed when I broke down and got a corporate job that had a group plan, suddenly the same company that had shut me out, granted me insurance!<br /><br />I only explain my situation because I know from FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE how horribly our medical system can be.  I didn't read propaganda on a website or a book, I lived being shafted by a corporate giant.<br /><br />All that being said, this film is extremely well made.  Michael Moore somehow makes our medical system and all of its faults to be funny!  As hard as they seems to be.  The stories and examples he uses are real and extremely dramatic and heart wrenching.  A baby dying too soon because they wouldn't take her coverage, a woman losing her husband pre-maturely due to refused care, a family going bankrupt due to high medical costs, another woman getting bumped off of her insurance with no seemingly reasonable explanation, a homeless woman dumped on the streets.  These stories might be hard to believe if I hadn't gone through it myself, but trust me, the insurance companies play by their own rules changing them at will to make sure they keep their profits UP!<br /><br />My only real criticism is when Mr. Moore goes to the UK, France, and Cuba to show the stark contrast in care than that with the US.  The problems of both of their health care benefits are glossed over or not mentioned.  I think Mr. Moore did this for comic and dramatic effect but I can see how some have attacked him for doing so.  I would have liked examples from around the world highlighting the positive and negative.  I would have also liked to see more US doctors interviewed as I know many that are extremely frustrated by our pro-insurance, anti-hospital, anti-doctor policies.  Many doctors feel forced by the insurance companies on what treatments to give, what drugs, and they spend too much time, energy and money trying to get paid. But I guess if Mr. Moore had included all of that the movie may have been 5 hours long!!!!!<br /><br />No system is ever going to be perfect, but ours is surely broken.  If you want to see another great documentary about how the rest of the world treats its sick and healthy Frontline on PBS came out with an excellent piece called \\"Sick around the World\\" all of the countries they profile are capitalistic and they all use slightly different strategies.

B001C48EFQ|3.0|There are few things more annoying than an intentionally vague science fiction plot. \\"Babylon A.D.\\"--based on Maurice G. Dantec's novel \\"Babylon Babies\\"--takes great pains to keep audiences in the dark, only to bombard them with a series of revelations that not only make little sense, but are also difficult to accept at face value. I tried my hardest to understand what was going on and why, and while I think I now have the gist of it, I'm still left with a lot of unanswered questions. I have a feeling diehard science fiction buffs will get this movie and love it. As I left the theater, it was suggested that liking \\"Babylon A.D.\\" would depend on whether or not one reads science fiction; if that's true, this movie is nothing but an elitist showcase. Vin Diesel fans may not get the story, but hey, at least they'll get to see him in another action film. It's doubtful, however, that this movie will connect with general audiences, especially if they prefer stories that can actually be followed.    The plot, as far as I can tell, is as follows. Sometime in the future, when technology and big-name corporations have consumed Western society, an American mercenary living in Russia is called on to smuggle a young woman into New York. This man, named Toorop (Diesel), was once a veteran before being exiled from the United States; he now lives by the survivor's code, never trusting anyone and always playing by his own rules. The young woman, named Aurora (Mélanie Thierry), was raised in an isolated Mongolian convent, away from technology and all manner of temptation. Her protector, Sister Rebeka (Michelle Yeoh), makes one thing perfectly clear: the less exposure Aurora has to the outside world, the better.    No one seems to know why until the three start moving through Russia and across the Bering Strait as refugees; not only does Aurora frequently shift from complacent to emotionally distraught, she also seems to possess special abilities, such as being able to sense explosives and knowing how to operate a thirty-year-old submarine and feeling death. According to Rebeka, Aurora could speak nineteen languages by age two. Maybe this has something to do with why opposing forces are after her. One is a religious sect led by the conniving High Priestess (Charlotte Rampling); with the help of a self-serving Russian named Gorsky (Gérard Depardieu), she arranges for Toorop to smuggle Aurora into America, away from a group led by a scientist named Darquandier (Lambert Wilson). When the package is delivered, Aurora will apparently be the key to creating a superior, genetically modified messiah.    I'm making it sound more straightforward than it actually is. So much of this movie relies on secrecy, which would have been okay had the explanations made any sense. The implications are clear: in a now corporate-run society, a cult wants to gain power as the world's dominant religion, and they can reach their goals with the help of a super intelligent, scientifically engineered young woman. But implications can only take you so far. It's not enough to merely suspect what's going on. This is the kind of story that demands a great deal more than vague ideas and passing references. Maybe the film's ninety-minute length is to blame; it's quite possible the answers I sought were left on the cutting room floor. Consider Diesel's broadly drawn character, a man who emotionally kept his distance until Aurora came into his life. How this change came about is anyone's guess, but since Diesel's acting range is just shy of nonexistent, I guess it doesn't really matter.    But Aurora is the most frustrating character, mostly because the way she acts throughout the film isn't consistent with how and why she was created in the first place. There are times when she's cool and collected, while at other times she's militantly opposed to death and destruction, all of which she can sense beforehand. She seemed less like a miracle girl and more like a poster child for Bipolar Disorder. The way she interacts with Torrop is difficult to believe, especially as their feelings for one another deepen. It doesn't feel like a developing love so much as it feels like a plot device for creating more drama. It certainly didn't do much for the ending, which is so badly written that it might generate incredulous laughter.    What can I say in defense of this movie? Well, it was good-looking. I was particularly impressed with the futuristic New York City, the best-designed city skyline since \\"Blade Runner.\\" Every block is an explosion of technology, from choreographed neon lights to electronic images projected onto skyscrapers. Unfortunately, we never get to fully appreciate it--the shots come and go far too quickly. Most of the New York scenes take place on an isolated street, specifically the intersection where the climactic battle is fought. As fleeting as it was, this was still the only decent action this movie had to offer; every other action scene was lightening-fast and shaky, distracting us from seeing all the good fight moves. But the great failure of \\"Babylon A.D.\\" was telling a needlessly vague story about inappropriately mysterious characters. I'm sure select audiences will embrace this movie as a pinnacle work of science fiction, and they will no doubt see things in it that I failed to see. Let it be known that, for someone who doesn't read science fiction on a regular basis, I did the best I could.
0756404746|4.0|I chose this book off of a bookstore's recommended reads shelf.  The title grabbed me, and after reading the back cover comparing it to \\"Arabian Nights,\\" \\"Harry Potter\\" series, and \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" I decided to give it a try.  Perhaps it was too much like the Harry Potter rivalry, and perhaps the exposition was too long and confusing, but I enjoyed it start to finish.  I'm irritated that I have to wait until the Spring to read the next book.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is an exceptionally delightful and charming concert.  The singers are extraordinary.  Not to be missed!
031606792X|2.0|I have never written a review on Amazon before, but I'm about 300 pp into this book and feel compelled to add my two cents after reading other people's reviews and not even sure if I can finish the book myself because I don't like where the plotline is going.    I fully agree with other reviewers who have said that Bella is a selfish individual who acts recklessly and acts without regard to how her actions will affect others in her life, whether it be her parents, the Quiletes, or the Cullens.  I know this is a fantasy story, but her mind is beyond warped and she is totally not sensible or in the right frame of mind.  I didn't mind her senselessness as much in the first three books because it seemed to be moving the plotline forward, but in the fourth book, after the incubus is conceived, she just seems deranged.  It's one thing to be pregnant that young at 18 and I know it's more commonplace today, but to be pregnant with a vampire baby is beyond crazy.  I hope young women don't see her as a role model in any way, shape, or form other than to envy her for finding the love of her life.    I was on Team Jacob by the end of Eclipse, but in this book, I don't think she's deserving of either Edward or Jacob.  Like other readers have mentioned, what is it about her that they are attracted to in the first place?  She doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities about her other than that her blood smells good to Edward and that she constantly puts her life in danger and others come to her aid.  I know she's dealing with mythical creatures and all and that they possess supernatural powers, but I hate how defenseless and vulnerable she's been in all the few books.  She should have moved with Renee to Florida when Charlie ordered her to.  I'm not a strong feminist or anything, but I wish she'd grow a backbone and say no a couple of times for her own safety and future instead of letting her lust and desire and all-consuming love for Edward determine her actions.  I was happierwhen she mentioned early on in the book that she wanted to go to Dartmouth and be human for at least a few more months, but that obviously that plan went out the window once she found out she was pregnant.    I love a romantic story and all and I was spellbound at first by the Romeo and Juliet nature of Edward and Bella's relationship, but their love is just too out there and abnormal, and I'm not just saying that because she starts out as human and he's a vampire.  Bella loves Edward because he's beautiful and fascinating and talented and unbreakable; basically, everything she's not.  He originally is drawn to her because of her overpowering scent and he yearns for her blood.  Why is Bella never scared of this, at least for a moment?  Is that because \\"love conquers all\\"?  Oh please, give me a break.  Their love story would be somewhat more credible if she at least was fearful of him in the beginning and not so completely enamored and in awe of him.  I would have liked to have seen perfect Edward squirm and try to earn her love instead of being handed it on a silver platter.  Heck, I think Edward would have preferred that as well according to some of the books, but our heroine Bella is just not the sensible type.  Fearless she may be, but she totally lacks any rationale.    The only reasons I didn't give this book one star was that I'm not done yet and Meyer's style of writing is certainly compelling as it's only taken me a few days to read all four books in a row, but I am really annoyed with Bella's character.   She is totally one-dimensional.  And based on other reviews, I am sure I will like her even less as I get further into the story.

1400064287|4.0|I found this book to be valuable to me as a school teacher.  If the material I present doesn't \\"stick\\" with the students, then I haven't done my job.  This book will help you do a better job!
B001807OAA|2.0|I bought the 30th anniversary collection, and while the remastering of the original tracks were decent in their sound and overall quality, I was miffed completely by the fake live renditions of the songs. Obviously recorded more currently and with a few studio tricks needed to make him (David Coverdale) sound 20 years younger. Much of the backing music appears to be both outtakes from the original recording sessions and some of the final master takes heard on the orignal release.<br /><br />And while David's latest efforts are actually pretty good in how he's learn to cope with the fact that he can't sing like he used to, he still projects alot of soul into his latest recordings.<br /><br />But to pass off some lesser degree of deluxe edition of a once great classic album is the very same reason he failed to make it past the Slip Of The Tongue album in 1989.<br /><br />Allow us the chance to hear Whitesnake live in 1987/1988 while on tour and master it accordingly to a second bonus CD and you might just have yourself a pretty good reason to buy it. But to fool us like this is sheer pitiful and a good reason to never buy another single Whitesnake product again.

B000Z27HLS|5.0|I thought the story was interesting from beginning to end. The actors were convincing and showed great depth of character. I didn't want it to end and I wish there was a sequel.  It was well worth the price I paid. I was not familiar with this particular story and I was so pleased with the ending.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I really like the song \\"4 Minutes\\" but the rest of the songs are only so so.  I was disappointed in this one.  I normally like Madonna's work.  She and Justin Timberlake save the entire album with 4 Minutes, though.  I'd recommend buying the single song and not wasting the money on the rest.
0440241413|5.0|I picked this book up for a little light entertainment, and I was quite simply blown away by the talent of the author, Sophie Kinsella! I was captured by her story and main character from the very beginning. Becky Bloomwood is the essence of the compulsive shopper's dark side that lingers in all of us. (Well, maybe not all of us -- but it sure lingers in me!)<br /><br />Her plotting was intense! Every time I thought she had written herself into a corner, Ms. Kinsella brought the story to an even greater level of tension. Becky Bloomwood was perfectly drawn. As crazy as she was, I understood her every motivation -- even though I was cringing as she messed things up over and over again.<br /><br />If you are searching for an escapist read that will thoroughly entertain you, I highly recommend Confessions of a Shopaholic.<br /><br />The best recommendation I can give you is this: I've begun to order every single one of Sophie Kinsella's books from Amazon.com -- and I consider it money well spent! (Certainly, it's just what Becky would have done!!)
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|In almost 10 years together their talent really shows on this album. Tight riffs, drums, good use of the different vocal styles, and excellent production.     The biggest thing to me was the natural progression they're making. This includes guitar solos (sometimes a lost concept) and delicate acoustic guitar again. An all-around great record from beginning to end. All hail Corey, Joey, James, Mick, Paul, Chris, Craig, Clown, and Sid!!    Des Moines' favorite sons are back for more, and the maggots are ready to feed!!!!
B0013URJTG|3.0|I have been a PT fan for a long time and have always enjoyed the progressive movements of Steve Wilson.  Gavin Harrison is simply a virtuous drummer with crazy skills and texture.  Where's Gavin?  Gavin adds so much texture to the movements of PT that is so significant and beautiful to the pieces that it makes the album fall short just a bit since he isn't the drummer on this one.  The drumming on Shesmovedon by Gavin is so tasty on Deadwing that it makes it hard for me to listen to it on Lightbulb Sun.
B0017MO10U|5.0|This is a great episode.  It was good to see Don Davis as General George Hammond for the last time.  It was a parade of many loved characters, though Braytac and Dr. Fraiser were missing.   I love the alternate universe stories and this was just as good.    I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes Star Gate.
0030565812|5.0|I've always been partial to books that open ones eyes to the injustices and wrongs being committed in the world that get swept under the rug unless close attention is paid to them or any attention period. With that being said, when I ordered Mandela's autobiography it was a bit of a departure for me as a few of my books this summer have been.<br /><br />The only book that touched me in the way this one did was Kite Runner. Long Walk to Freedom encapsulates Mandela's childhood, struggles as a freedom fighter, political activist, long imprisonment and ends with his election as the president of South Africa. What struck me about this autobiography is that it wasn't boring and was actually informative. About the only thing I knew about Nelson Mandela before I read this book was that he was a political activist from South Africa that was imprisoned for a very long time. I had no idea what he went through to change South Africa into what it is today. I had no idea just how much patience and just how often Mandela was tried with seemingly no light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />I don't know that there is much to review from the book itself that hasn't already been discussed. Some have mentioned a lack of Mandela's childhood, but I didn't really think it was that necessary to put much about his childhood into the book. What really matters was the decision to become active against the apartheid of South Africa in his teenage years.<br /><br />I love books like this. For me, they help me to become less ignorant of the world and what is going on in it. I'll openly admit I do have some prejudice against members of certain races sometimes for either a) myths that popular culture has created or b) just my own damn stubbornness. I had had an inkling that the history of South Africa wasn't all roses but I had never known the extend until I read this book. As a person, Nelson Mandela is absolutely one of the greatest human beings I've had the pleasure of reading about. For those of us that suffer from depression and anxiety as I do, stories like Mandela's seemingly boundless determination and willingless to rise up again and again in the face of adversity is absolutely remarkable and incredibly inspirational. How Mandela can say that prison never broke his spirit even after 27 years is just unbelievable. Granted, Mandela didn't have much of a choice all of those years but to make the best of it and to keep his spirits up. It definitely puts things in perspective for me when I complain sometimes about being bored at various events or when I negatively think about an event I'm going to before I even give it a chance to see if I like it. In a sense, Mandela's book gives you hope that we can make a difference and one person does indeed matter in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />The only mild gripe I had was within the first few pages where Mandela is describing all the tribes with names and it almost seems like made-up code names, but then again for us Westerners anything with a few more consonants in it sounds funny at times I suppose. Overall, Mandela's autobiography is a very smooth and enjoyable read. It's just fascinating learning about a man that's been an inspiration for so many and lost so much along the way to becoming who he is today.<br /><br />-Travis Stein.from depression and anxiety as I do, stories like Mandela's seemingly boundless determination and willingless to rise up again and again in the face of adversity is absolutely remarkable and incredibly inspirational.

B0006HC0I2|5.0|Jean Gabin is sensational as a dapper old Parisian gangster who knows when his bedtime is.  Not so his lovelorn buddy who lets slip to his younger showgirlfriend Jeanne Moreau about their last haul.  When dope-dealing lug Lino Ventura catches wind and plots to rip them off, it's time for Gabin to start slapping people.<br /><br />Great scenes of Paris at night coupled with a terrific score make this a thrilling entertainment.  And the picture looks stunning on this DVD.<br /><br />It's amazing to think that Lino had never acted before this -- he's effortlessly menacing here.  But this is Gabin's show.  He's tough but oddly lovable too.  Never has the criminal urge to kick back and enjoy the good life seemed less cliche and more poignant.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|I have been a big fan of Donna Summer since I was a kid and love everything she has ever done!
0375836675|4.0|Markus is an immensely talented guy - I flipped over every page where he described something with such clever beauty that actually caught my breath while reading it. As result, my copy has so many bent pages it looks like it lost a fight with a rabid cat. This man is a unique author who can capture many fringe emotions (poignancy, heartburn, shame) that most authors ignore because they lack the talent to adequately describe them.<br /><br />Is the story particularly gripping? No.<br /><br />Is the pacing appropriate? No. There are many scenes that seemed irrelevant. In fact I once read that a \\"tight story\\" is one where no scene or character could be removed without the whole thing falling apart. This is not a tight story.<br /><br />Is the ending satisfying? Sort of. Yes. No. Although I give him credit for balls. The ending is a ballsy cop out.<br /><br />I also wonder why this is classified as a young adult novel. If \\"young\\" means that most of the main characters are \\"young\\" and they are struggling to find their way in the world, then yes it is properly classified. However the reality is that this is a fairly adult book and I wonder what criteria the editor ultimately used to put it in the YA category. The heavy emphasis on alcohol and sex (even rape) seems a bit ragged for the generally softer category of YA. Does this book fit in with the Twillight series? I don't think so....<br /><br />However I don't want my review to sound as negative as I fear it does. This is a fascinating work by a talented individual. Keep an eye on him, I think he has great work in him.
031606792X|2.0|The problem with this book is not the happy ending as so many have said. The problem is that the ending is very unbelievable, in part because it is so happy. There is no way that the events in question with the Volturi would have led to a fight. To me the even thought they pulled out of the fight, the rest of the vampires should have stood up for their belief. Meyer could have killed off the Volturi easily and taken out a few of the vampires not involved with the Cullens to help make a more believable ending. But she didn't.    However, this was not Meyer's only problem. The book is comprised of three books. The first two have their own plot while the third has it's own. It lacks a cohesive element. Sure Bella has the nightmares in the first but there is nothing in the second about these dreams so by the time the third book comes around the Volturi story seems to jump out of nowhere.     Lastly everything in this story was predictable. However, I find that is how it has been through the series. Meyer doesn't have the same gift that Rowling has for subtle foreshadowing.
B000002JEV|3.0|I like this album for the most part, I own every recording by LZ (except some rare imports), including DVD versions and DVD-A (5.1). The second disc is recorded with reasonably good sound for that period. The first disc is MONO not stereo, which ruins it for me. Still a good purchase for any true Zepp fan.

0930289234|5.0|Comic books have reached an intermediary stage in art. On one hand, there are classic comics like The Dark Knight Returns that have even the most jaded comic critics raving, and on the other hand, there are comics like Dazzler, which have no depth or complexity and are purely there for the entertainment of young, hormone driven teenage boys. Watchmen rises above this stage and becomes something that can only be called the greatest graphic novel of all time. It has truly proven that along with painting, literature and music, comics can become an art form. The levels of complexity within the characters, the numerous accounts of well done parallelism, the intricately woven mystery, the scope and breath of the emotions in the characters, all rival the best the other art forms have to offer. This is truly and unequivocally a masterpiece for the ages.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I liked this one better than the first movie about Ori.  I think that anyone who liked the series should get it.  I haven't seen the extras yet but will as soon as I can.
031606792X|2.0|I was so disappointed in what I view as an inept and amateur ending to this series; especially since there was such a pretty entertaining start and a good opportunity to go somewhere interesting with the story.  I don't know if Meyer, like Ann Rice, just began to refuse any desperately-needed editing  (on a technical level, some of the style errors are so glaring that I have trouble believing that an editor ever looked at the Breaking Dawn manuscript)  or if she truly just peaked with her first book.     I enjoyed Twilight for what it was: a light, easy, summer read.   As such, it was easy to overlook its obvious flaws -- such as the blatant Mary Sue and worse, Meyer's hyperbole about Edward's beauty.  My god, it was like Meyer got out her thesaurus and looked up every single available adjective for the word, \\"beauty\\" and used them everywhere she could.  It made Bella look like a nitwit to have her telling me at least every third page -- sometimes as many as twice on a single page -- how perfect, exquisite, fine, beautiful, gorgeous, stunning, attractive, dazzling, and handsome Edward's face, nose, lips, body, hair, eyes, and fingernails are.   It could be a drinking game!   Again, Meyer's editor failed to help her and someone should have told her that there really wasn't a need to hang two adjectives on every single noun relating to Edward. He's pretty; We got it. Really.    Meyers has Bella spend most of the books continually fretting that she's not good enough for Edward.  And you know what?--She isn't.   At the end of four books, there's very little reason shown in Bella's character, words, deeds, or actions that would sustain either Edward or Jacob's attraction.  Their devotion is unearned and it exists simply because Meyers deems it so--hence the MarySue element.    I admit that my irritation with Bella begain when she got all fainty at the sight of blood (seriously, what woman who deals with periods gets faint at the sight of blood!)  But because there were other nicely-done moments, I thought as the books continued, Bella would grow and evolve into someone stronger and someone worthy of my admiration or praise.  But that wasn't in Meyer's plan apparently.   It seems she likes her female lead weak and stagnant.     But still, there were some good scares and compelling moments in the first book, and I moved on to New Moon.  But as it progressed I began to realize the flaws of the first weren't a fluke of a newbie writer, Meyers has serious style and narrative issues.  But even so, she managed to make Jacob a much more interesting character (far more interesting than Edward, in fact) so I hung in there.  Eclipse continued the downward slide and then I read Breaking Dawn.       At the end, all I can say is that I experienced a great feeling of frustration.  Although I was happy to see Bella become a vampire, how we reached that point was just plain silly, even by Meyer's standard of writing.   Many of the specific reasons I was disappointed in Breaking Dawn have already been posted here, there's no reason to repeat except to say that I agree with many of the points raised in the \\"most helpful\\" two and three star reviews posted here. I know people are fond of the 5-star, 1-star thing, but the reality is, few things are either the best or the worst you've ever read.  Most falls inbetween.  So despite my disenchantment, I wouldn't give this book ( or the series ) just one star; it was not the worst thing I've read by any means, but its way down there.      I WANTED to give it a chance, and in fairness in the begining there were some redeeming qualities.   Having invested the time, I was curious as to what happened and wanted to see the journey through to the end.  I was only after I got there that I realized that I'd been hoping for dimensions and resolutions that, IMO, Meyer doesn't have the skill to deliver.  It all fell apartly badly.       Oh, and I must say:  Renesmee...Worst...name...ever !  LOL  Could you GET anymore cloying?    Sure, I get the appeal of the series to tweeners and adolescents.  What dweeby girl doesn't want the hottest boy in school to fall madly in love with her for no apparently reason whatsoever!  But the biggest issue for me was that by the end of Breaking Dawn, Bella's most outstanding quality remains just what it was in Twilight:  her desperate and unabating neediness.  I was hoping the vampire change would help.  But no!   She still only views herself as an extension of Edward.  The almost never-ending  kvetching made her into a grating whiner; there is not one thing anyone can do in an attempt to make Bella happy that she can't twist into a negative.  The prom, a birthday party, her nice car, even the wedding, are all just reasons for Bella to find something to be unhappy about.  Worse, her treatment of Jacob is just plain heartless:   I'll never love you, but I'm not going to let you go because after all, I need a best friend and you're good for that.  (oh, one more thing:  the whole Jacob-Nessie imprint is just plain squidgy)    But by the end of the 4th book, Bella's most memorable quality remains her grating and childish self-absorption coupled with unattractive neediness. She's just a total EMO.   And yet, every male that crosses her path falls desperately for her, because she's Bella.      I suspect Meyers just wrote about what she believes the ideal women should be: a premarital virgin girl who needn't bother to acquire too much of that pesky education or life experience before making major life-altering decisions.  She should be married at a young age, devoted to pleasing her man, and drown in too-early motherhood.  Despite the last minute sop, I don't believe for a second that college is in Bella's future -- she's signed on for an eternity going to high school over and over and over. (I personally couldn't imagine a worse hell, no matter how hot your boyfriend is!) This would be funny if there weren't so many adolescents (and grown women who should know better) who want to be \\"just like Bella\\".   They think this ending is romantic, when in reality it's just pathetic.    If others loved this series and thought this mess was a perfect ending for Bella, Edward, Jacob and all the rest, all I can say is that it's fortunate that either you saw none of the flaws I saw or upon seeing them, you were willing to overlook them.  Either way if it worked for you, good!  And I mean that --I don't view this as I'm right and you're wrong or I'm smart and you're not.  Different books speak to people in different ways.  I always open a book with high hopes and I dearly wish I had found something to like in this series.      I do see that some fans have railed against the posting of an less than stellar opinion in the opinion section of Amazon.  But of course, what are reviews EXCEPT opinions!  I suspect that what fans really mean is that if the opinion isn't Meyer-praise, you shouldn't voice it.   But to that I would answer that any writer who never hears a dissenting voice is not well-served and may begin to believe they can do no wrong.  I suspect that's what happened to Meyer.  She began to believe the positive press from Twilight.  Otherwise her books would have steadily improved instead of steadily declined.    So I'm disappointed and frankly, more than a bit ticked off at Meyer because I hung in there thinking she would deliver a payoff to only end up being wrong.   So I can't say I've walked away as an admirer of Stephanie Meyer's abilities as a storyteller or with any interest in reading anything else she may churn out.  In the end, all I see it as a promising opportunity that was badly squandered under the weight of writer's ego.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|Tom Cruise got a lot of favorable press at the time of this film's release for playing an unredeemed and unredeemable killer.  He is good, to be sure.  You won't quickly forget his steely, relentless hitman.  He's like demon from an icy hell.  Still, while not exactly a one-note performance, he takes a back seat to Jamie Foxx (literally AND figuratively) in this taut thriller.  Foxx, of course, has the advantage of portraying a Mensch, not a psychopath.  You feel for him every moment he is in the clutches of Cruise's madman.  And just when you think he might get out, he always gets sucked back in.  It is as nightmarish a scenario as any horror film.      Even the predictable elements (like the fact that Jada Pinckett Smith's character will somehow wind up getting embroiled in the mayhem) are fraught with twists and turns.  Her involvement ups the ante for Foxx's taxi driver hero Max.   He has already proven himself more resourceful and resilient than viewers might have guessed at first.  By the end of the film, Max proves himself more than the killer's equal, matching him manoeuvre for manoeuvre.      At the film's beginning, Max is revealed as a cab driver who knows Los Angeles like the proverbial back of his hand.  He can tell you exactly how long it will take to get from one point to another in that sprawling city.  Affable and modest about his talents, he nonetheless conveys quite early on that, in the contest of wills with this murderous outsider, he will prove to have home turf advantage.      And what a home turf it is.  As many have stated, LA by night is as much a character in the film as the two principles.  It's seamy glamour has seldom been better portrayed.  Contemporary Los Angeles takes on an almost surreal, foreboding aura.   It's like BLADE RUNNER, without the sci-fi elements.  That creepy.  And that good.
B0018PH3L0|3.0|Great new sound and picture quality but left out the scene where they examine the boy after he was bitten by snakes in the water.  The scene goes from the snake striking his face to the burial.  Pretty sloppy transfer.  Also it is not 16:9
031606792X|5.0|Having devoured the four books in four days, I must say....Fabulous! This is the only series, next to Harry Potter, that kept me up way past my bedtime, having wonderful dreams of Edward and burned a path to the bookstore in my car. I had heard of this series before, but since it was a \\"Young Adult\\", I never picked it up. I'm glad I did. As a 39 yr old mother of 2 boys(Ages 11 and 8), I am not ashamed to say that I loved these books.     If I have any complaints at all, it would be that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" kinda lulled for me after the wonderful wedding and honeymoon. I found myself opening the book to the back just to see if Edward and Bella would survive (Hey...a happy ending is a good thing). It picked up again quickly and carried to the end. Would I let my 11 year old read it? Absolutely. I am happy to see a book extol the importance of being married before having sex and a baby.     To all those that don't like how it ended, remember that this is Ms. Meyer's work and not yours. There were things in Harry Potter that I was not happy about but I would never criticize the whole series because of it. Think about this....When is the last time you got lost in a book that you lost track of time? I can and to me, that is a sign of a great book. One you don't want to put down or can't wait to pick it up again.  I will sleep well tonight. I'll be interested to see who will play Edward in the adaptation for the movies. I'll be there. Thanks Ms. Meyer for making my heart ache, break and swoon over the last four days.

Not only is it an excellent read, interesting whether you like him or not, but it's highly informative of what Barack's motivations and background are. If you have any doubts, are uncomfortable with Obama, or just don't know what he's about, I highly recommend this book. You may not become a supporter, as I have, but you will certainly be better off for knowing more about this man.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|We loved this movie and will, no doubt, watch it more then once as it is just a feel good movie.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|Psycho is a classic. But my gripe is with the way Amazon takes the entire cast list, orders them in alphabetical order, then lists the first few actors from that list. And they tend to do this for a lot of movies here, not just this one.    So in this case the \\"stars\\" of the film are Frank Albertson, Martin Balsam, Francis de Sales, and George Eldredge (as listed when you search Movies and TV for the film). And according to IMDB the last two were uncredited! Nice going, Amazon.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn was a wonderful ending to the Twilight Saga. I was so surprised and thrilled at what happened! The only downside to this book, and why I gave it four stars instead of five, is that the last half of the book was drawn out a bit much. I loved the book to pieces, but it seemed in some places that it was just written to add to the length of the book, not to really add to the story. Luckily though, I was so involved in the story before that happened, that I happily read through all the slow stuff in order to find out what happened! So in the end, it was still very much worth reading.

1580176941|5.0|I don't write reviews too often, but this book definitely moved me to write one. I have some time off after moving and wanted to teach myself a new skill, and my family loves sweets, so... cake/cookie decorating it is! Comparing to icing cakes, cookies are a breeze (at least to this novice.) The designs in this book are cute without being too twee, and are relatively easy to do. I made the wedding cakes and hearts, and both turned out great, despite NEVER having done it before! The cookie recipe is even good, and I was a little suspicious (I've just made the vanilla sugar base cookie.) Basically, be prepared to buy a little equipment (Amazon sells a great selection of cookie cutters, actually!) and spend some time. If you're making cookies for an event, start a day or two beforehand, or even make extra dough and freeze it for whenever you have a free weekend!<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. I checked out probably 5-6 cookie books, I was totally unimpressed with the rest. This is the one to have! (Love the recipe for Royal Icing too. It worked great and I can use those pasteurized liquid egg whites - no ordering online if I don't want to!)

Little bit of background into the making (did you know that Mikey Way lost his mind??), some great art cards, & I've used it to store my ticket from when I went to the first of the North American 'Black Parade' shows.

1843106698|5.0|I have suspected that my older sister (50's) has Aspergers for the past couple of years.  After reading The Complete Guide to Aspergers I feel confirmed in that thought.  Attwood outlines all the symptoms and I see my sister in so many of them.  He explains everything from childhood to adulthood.  I plan to send this book to my sister with a note and I just hope she reads it and can, for once, understand that there is a name to what she feels.  It is a fantastic book.
B001B71NOI|4.0|After parting ways with their record label, Interscope Records, Nine Inch Nails have redefined and reestablished themselves as a vital force in the industrial music movement. \\"The Slip\\" is reminiscent of \\"Broken,\\" their second LP, as far as feeling and emotion toward the record industry and the worlds around us are concerned. It's a vital, vengeful, heavy, loud, and brutally savage depiction of the music industry as a whole, and the way music, as an art form, is promoted, distributed, and depicted these days. Originally offered as a free download on their official site as a \\"thank you\\" to their fans' unrelenting loyalty, the album is offered in multiple downloadable formats including lyrics, original artwork, desktop wallpapers, icons and more, \\"The Slip\\" quickly became leaked to the world. Still offered as a free download, a limited edition CD of only 250,000 copies soon followed, along with a vinyl format released worldwide. \\"The Slip\\" was followed by a world tour that is quite simply one of the most intense performances of their career; visually, emotionally, and musically. With the return of long-time guitarist Robin Finck, the live interpretation of songs both new and old is represented with solid conviction. Dazzling lighting effects, a set list containing songs that span decades, overwhelming visuals, and a tenacity impossible to duplicate make this one of the best live shows of 2008. Do not pass up the opportunity to add \\"The Slip\\" to your growing Nine Inch Nails collection, or if you're new to the world of Nine Inch Nails, this album is a must have and is just as vital and important as such classics as \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" \\"Broken,\\" \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" and \\"The Fragile.\\"
B00005JNJV|5.0|The Batman film series since it began in 1989 has been on a rollercoaster ride.  It started out full speed with \\"Batman\\" and continued that way in 1992 with \\"Batman Returns.\\"  Then in 1995 with \\"Batman Forever\\" and later in 1997 with \\"Batman and Robin\\" Joel Schumacher took that fun Batman ride to a very, very low point...he basically knocked the coaster off the tracks critically injuring the many Batman fans in the process.  So it's no wonder that the series was in need of an overhaul.    Eight years later, and thanks to Christopher Nolan, the rollercoaster is back on the tracks and once again going full speed ahead.  He revamped and  reinvented the Batman franchise with \\"Batman Begins.\\"    Finally, we see why Batman became Batman.  We see what motivates him, where he learned those fancy kung fu moves, where he got his gadgets.  We see Bruce Wayne's transformation into his alter ego, Batman, and his battle against injustice in Gotham City.  It's always interesting to see why a superhero becomes a superhero.  That alone can place \\"Batman Begins\\" amongst \\"Spiderman\\" as one of the greatest comic book/superhero movies of all time.    That aside, what really gets this coaster rolling again is Nolan's vision of how a Batman movie should be.  Basing the film in reality, placing Batman in a realistic Gotham City, is ingenious.  Gotham is a city overrun with crime and corruption with realistic villains attempting realistic crimes.  Not the Riddler trying to read the minds of Gotham's innocent citizens via a TV box (\\"Batman Forever\\").  Overall, \\"Batman Begins\\" has made the film series more mature, aiming at an older audience with a much more serious film.    \\"Batman Begins\\" has truly marked a revolution for the franchise.
B000SDWEDK|5.0|If you like the original Black Sabbath, then this is the album for you!  Next to Paranoid, this may be their most elaborate and defined concept of what Black Sabbath was all about at the pinacle of their careers in the 70's.  Dark and gloomy yet heavy and riff pounding music which set them apart from any other bands of the time.  From Tomorrows Dream to Everday just comes and goes, the entire album will leave you beliving that Black Sabbath were and always will be the fathers of Heavy Metal music.  You will not be disappointed with this one!!!!

0061537934|4.0|The opening chapter of this book tells us that this is going to be an unusual story - one told in the voice of the dog, Enzo. And Enzo is dying. However, the book is much more than that. Garth Stein, the author, has Enzo remember his puppyhood as well as most of the details of his life with Denny, a race car driver. In the process he offers a philosophy for each of their approaches to life - the fear of a driver for racing in the rain and the way he can overcome fears and go on is a major theme in the book. Because it is the life story of a dog, pet lovers, especially dog lovers, are sure to be touched, but others will surely love it too.
031606792X|5.0|There is always a certain amount of trepidation that comes with reading a highly \\"hyped up\\" book. As soon as t-shirts, pre-orders and midnight release parties are mentioned, the standards are set so high that the work itself can rarely live up to the ideal that fans hold for it. This is why I was pleasantly surprised with just how good of a book Stephanie Meyer's Breaking Dawn turned out to be!    The story begins where the previous episodes have left off with the awkward but lovable heroine Bella Swan engaged to her true love, vampire and epitome of perfection, Edward Cullen. A storybook wedding is in the works, but even before the honeymoon is over Bella questions her rush to become immortal with Edward. For the first time the reader sees Bella truly face up to what she must sacrifice to become a vampire and yet before she decides anything her life is in danger and her character is once more revealed as one who will give up anything for true love. Although predictions for what would occur in Breaking Dawn were running rampant in the weeks before the book's release, Stephanie Meyer did a great job of keeping spoilers under wraps (you'll find very few from me) and she was able to incorporate plot twists and surprises, that even after reading four of her books, I did not see coming at all.    With Bella's life on the line, the narration of the book switches over to the point of view of Jacob Black, Bella's werewolf best friend. This was easily my favorite part of the story as Jacob's perspective offered a wry humor and a deeper look at characters like Seth and Leah, previously only in the background. Even those readers of the \\"Team Edward\\" persuasion likely enjoy how Jacob's relationships with the Cullens are more deeply explored and the interactions provide a new view of Edward and Rosalie, whom the reader has only ever seen through Bella's eyes. Jacob also shows a greater maturity in Breaking Dawn when he is called to make a choice that affects the lives of Bella and the Cullens, as well as his entire wolf pack.    The final third of the book switches out of Jacob's voice and the action really sets in as all the principal characters are in mortal - or perhaps, immortal? - danger. Stephanie Meyer does a great job of building the suspense up to and throughout the final pages of the story. Though there was a little bit of an \\"info dump\\" in the last portion (excessive explanation and back story), for the most part the pacing was really well done. The ending was satisfying and though loose ends were certainly wrapped up, one hopes that there could still be more stories told from the world that Meyer has built - after this reading journey, many of us are not quite ready to leave Forks!    Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse have already secured their place in the hearts and on the shelves of readers of all ages and Breaking Dawn earns its rightful place beside them. The 750+ pages are revealed only in the weight of the tome, as the reading time was akin to a much shorter work. For the willing reader, the Twilight saga is a series that will engulf the mind and captivate the imagination. Meyer is an expert storyteller who has brilliantly touched on the themes of what her audience craves - the desire to love and be loved; the need to feel strong or protected; and the dream of living forever. As eternal as the characters portrayed, Breaking Dawn sparkles like a Cullen on a sunny day!
031606792X|5.0|Spoiler Alert!  This ending to the Twilight Saga satisfies any fan of the series.  There's danger like in all of the other books, but it also allows the reader to experience the aspects of Bella's lifer, that we were sort of afraid would be left out.  We get to see Jacob's reaction to her wedding, while some readers may have worried that he would not be in the beginning of the book at all.  We also get to see her life married to Edward before she changes into a vamipre.  And finally, we know that she really does change into one!  (I had worried that some disaster would happen, and that she would never change.) I had tried to imagine how Bella would be as a vampire, I really like the way that the author portrayed it.  It was very believable, and very \\"Bella.\\"  I also loved that the author gave her a vampire's child.  THis is something that I would have never expected when I read the other books in the series.      So, this was a great ending to the series.  The ending was so final, I have not been able to read the book more than once.  I read all of the other Twilight books more than three times, but Breaking the Dawn is just too final for that.

0786948523|1.0|I have been playing Dungeons and Dragons since the first boxed set and I have looked forward to each new version and this is no exception. Each new version has tried to improve on the core Dungeon and Dragon experience until now.  This new version is not really a new version but an entirely new game with very little of the flavor or magic feeling of the original. Now it feels more like a version of WOW or another of the online games. I am not knocking the online games they can be great if that is what you want to play but if you are looking for an intense good old fashioned role playing session with a group of your friends this new version is not for you unless you are under 12. If you are an experienced role player I would suggest that you save your money and stick to 3.5 there should be a lot of second hand material for that around and several other good companies are still supporting it like Necromancer Games. I wish those people bought Dungeons and Dragons as they know what D&D should feel like. Also look for the games put out by pazzio publishing the company that used to put out the Dragon and Dungeon. In short if you are a veteran of the Dungeons and Dragons and enjoyed the old game save your money or better yet spend it elsceware there are a lot of fine games out there unfortunately this company is no longer make such products.

B0017WI5VQ|5.0|this woman can belt out the tunes.  so FRESH and exciting! i cannot wait to see her live.  she seems like such a beautiful soul with a great spirit.  the voice is incredible!!  i have not been so excited about a british singer  since alison moyet!  comparing her to alison is one of the highest compliments.  i hope to be graced with adele's presence in chicago soon.  i cannot get enough of this cd.  i bought it on itunes, then bought the cd for my car for the long commute to work.  she sings me into a good mood.  let's hope she is recognized during grammy time.  she is far better than amy winehouse, whom i must say is also a great talent, however adele seems to be smarter than winehouse in regards to focusing on her craft instead of drugs.  i think we will see more of adele in the future.  LET'S HOPE SO!  adele, if you read these reviews, keep on doing what you do, putting out quality music with an amazing voice of an angel.  shine one adele!!!  you are a BEAUTIFUL person with a true talent for writing and singing great music!
0385340990|5.0|I am a college English instructor, and I rarely find newly published books that I rave about. And I wouldn't be the first to pick up a book about yet another book club. But The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is worth every penny, worth every minute, and worth telling all your best friends and colleagues about. All ages and backgrounds would likely appreciate this sweet, funny, and bonechillingly authentic story.<br /><br />My husband's grandmother endured WWII in England, and recollects summers spent with her grandparents on Guernsey up until the war. Her stories of St. Peter Port, Guernsey's country lanes, and the locals are full of the same character of this historical-fiction. It all was real at one time: an idyllic British/French culture suddenly thrown up against Nazi invasion, Allied aloofness, and the heart-wrenching morning spent sending off local children on boats to the mainland for, hopefully, safe-keeping during the war.<br /><br />So the background of this riveting book is true, while the characters are both humanly believable and yet larger than life. (Weren't so many ordinary lives made larger by the War?) Just as in our lives today, philosophy, love, community, creativity, trust, endurance, and faith in goodness itself are what weave the best lives, and make the best stories.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is an important book, simply because it reminds us that by maintaining those greatest qualities within ourselves and others, we \\"come 'round\\" as my husband's grandmother says!<br /><br />Thank you, Mary Ann Shaffer, for reminding us of the many faces of our indomitable human spirit.

B000O5B5FK|5.0|Porcupine Tree is a progressive rock group which is known for their experimental approach.  This is still the case with their ninth album \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\".  The focus in this album is on the 21st Century society of video games, MTV, the internet, etc.  This album takes the subject head on, and it is a real treat for the listener.  This is a great album for people interested in progressive music.  It was released on April 16, 2007 in Europe, and a week later in the United States.    It opens with the title track \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\", a driving piece for the first half in which the lyrics are from the point of view of adolescent who sings about his life and the lack of anything of real substance in it.  Music, TV, internet, drugs, sex, and with all that the overall feeling is boredom.  The second half of the piece gives the listener a break from the relentless drive, but the lyrical content leaves the listener thinking that there is more trouble ahead.  \\"My Ashes\\" has the singer blaming his parents for his situation.  It is a haunting tune, and yet beautiful.    \\"Anaesthetize\\" is the centerpiece of the album at nearly 18 minutes.  It speaks to the emotionless boredom of the singer's life.  His is a life of apathy, and part of him is crying out, though it too cry's out in an emotionless way.  There is some excellent instrumental work in this piece as well, which holds the listener's attention throughout the piece.  After the first instrumental break, the song picks up again with a stronger driving line to it and the piece really takes off from there becoming harder and more full of energy as it progresses in contrast to the apathy and the boredom which is discussed lyrically.  Then, the tension breaks, as it did in the first piece, and the last part of the piece takes on a completely different feel, as if the singer has collapsed from the busy and high energy boredom of his life to find fulfillment in a small peaceful and slow memory from his past.    \\"Sentimental\\" is a beautiful piece, well constructed both musically and lyrically. In this piece, the singer talks about how he doesn't want to get old, basically because he wants to avoid the responsibilities of life.  \\"Way out of Here\\" is about searching for a way out the life he is stuck in.  The focus here is on his parents, and his inability to communicate with them.  Both the music and the lyrics are disturbing at times, which leaves the listener with a sense of unease.  \\"Sleep Together\\" finishes the album, and the implications of the lyrics are disturbing.  The music fits the piece and is relentless in its own way as the opening of the album.    Porcupine tree is Steve Wilson (vocals, guitars, piano, keyboards); Richard Barbieri (keyboards and synthesizers); Colin Edwin (bass guitars); and Gavin Harrison (drums).  In addition, there are a few guests on this album: Alex Lifeson (guitar solo on \\"Anesthesize\\"); Robert Fripp (soundscapes on \\"Way out of Here\\"); and John Wesley (backing vocals).  This is an excellent album for those who like experimental progressive rock, and for those who are looking to hear something different.

0743529030|4.0|This is a great book, and one of the handful of 'fundamentals' books that should be read by people of all ages, regardless of profession.  The earlier in life this book can be read (or listened to) the better, as it is critical to the building blocks of positioning life for success.  It is easy to follow, understand, and has excellent tools/techniques that can be applied immediately.  Probably a book that should be reviewed again every couple years.  Along the lines of the 7 Habits of highly effective people by Covey, this book is another key read for strategy of life.

0385340990|5.0|It is 1946 London. The war is finally over and Juliet Ashton is in the midst of her first book tour. She is a journalist and during the war she wrote a cheery newspaper column under the pen name Izzy Bickerstaff. Those columns have been collected into a book and, though it's selling well, Juliet more than ready to say goodbye to Izzy and start on a new writing project.<br /><br />While she is casting about for ideas she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, a farmer on Guernsey Island in the English Channel. He has found her name and address written in a secondhand book that he owns and asks for her help. Since Guernsey was occupied by the Nazis during the war, they have no bookseller in residence and he is unable to expand his reading. Would she have the name and address of a London bookseller who might be able to help?<br /><br />The resulting letters they exchange introduce her to other residents of Guernsey, mostly friends of Mr. Adams and fellow members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. One of the residents made up the Society on the spur of the moment one night when several of them were caught out by Nazi soldiers after curfew. And what a blessing it turned out to be, giving them something to think about and reasons to go on during the worst of the deprivation and starvation that the five years of occupation brought.<br /><br />Eventually Juliet decides on the theme for her next book and goes to Guernsey to start writing and meet her new friends. What she finds when she gets there surprises her and changes her life.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book. The post WWII England setting, the epistolary form, the realistic characters, the fact that much of it is about books, reading and love of literature. But most of all I loved the writer's wit and style that had me laughing out loud in places and broke my heart and brought me to tears in others. I read it very quickly and I kept telling myself to slow down because at the rate I was going it would be over far too soon. But I couldn't. So I'll just have to read it again and again, like going back to an old friend.<br /><br />It is a shame that there won't be any more books by Mary Ann Shaffer, but what a gift she has given us. I can't recommend this book highly enough.n. But I couldn't. So I'll just have to read it again and again, like going back to an old friend.

A few months ago I wanted to buy some new and different music so I bought a few Fu Manchu albums with King of the Road being one of them.

I like all the rest of the tunes on this album but, those are my two favorites.  If your a hard rock fan this album is for you.  Fu Manchu Rocks thats all I have to say.  David
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Hugh Grant is pitch perfect in his role. He's been quoted as saying it's the only movie he can watch himself in and not cringe. I've always been a fan of Hugh Grant, but was pleasantly surprised when I caught it on DVD. I've watched it again numerous times and have fallen in love it. As with any movie that withstands the test of time, repeated viewings reveal that this a much deeper movie than it purports to be upon first sight.
031606792X|3.0|I truely enjoyed the whole of this series.  #4 was a good read, regardless.  I loved the new characters introduced, and the fact that everyone we invested our time and hopes in, got happy endings.  Every loose end was neatly tied up, in sometimes odd (and stretching) ways, but not unpleasantly.  A fun and complete end to the main story.
0439813786|4.0|[[VIDEOID:25950701]]A Caldecott Medal Winner. A fine achievement from Brian Selznick with this blend of graphic novel, novel and  flip book. It has a scripted movie-like feel, evocative of the wonderful era of silent film. The words and illustrations work well together to unfold an engaging tale. I really liked it as an adult. It's a little too 'old' for my younger children, but I believe that older readers in 9- 15 year old bracket will get a lot out of it.

B0009MDPYM|5.0|I see many people only gave this movie 3 stars but I have to say I really liked this movie.  Maybe it's because I'm a horror writer and have been a horror fanatic for all my life but this movie was different from most of the horror that is being circulated around today.  What makes it different?  Well, for starters, it is thought provoking.  You can't just waste 2 mindless hours watching a Jason or Michael Myers hacking up everyone who crosses their path.  This movie has a level of depth to it that is rarely seen in today's cut and hack horror.  That was automatically a bonus for me.  Reeves character is conflicted, not one that is some religious freak pouring out all his righteous anger on the demonic entities he encounters.  Even Gabriel, God's angel, was conflicted in this movie, losing sight of who's side he/she was really on.  In most of the cases, there were no true lines dividing good from evil and in my mind, that is more true to life that typical representations.  This movie was entertaining, action-packed, interesting and fun.  I highly recommend it to all horror fans.

I believe that the movie was well balanced in presenting both sides of the death penalty argument.
B00110K62U|1.0|For about the past  15 years i have been a fan of Les Miserables. I have been in the Military for ten years  and this musical keeps my sanity straight when i listen to it every so often. I have seen the play and received the dvd  concert with digital surround  (dts) released by WELL GO USA  that my fiance got me, that has two separate disc a part 1 and 2 with no english subtitles. Then my fiance and i were ecstatic to find that there was a new dvd with the concert in one disc, which includes interviews of how it was made. I was sold and my fiance wanted a copy and  so we got one online. After receiving it and finally had time to enjoy the concert in one dvd without interruption, i found that there was a screw up between 25 and 26 on act two when Gavroche sings Little People. The screw up was already mentioned on the other reviews so let me tell you how it ruined my night. First i was going to break the dvd i felt like why would somebody do such a thing. For something that well known of a musical ,how can someone get so careless and miss a whole part of it. The little boy Gavroche is one of my favorites too. Second this disappointment caused me irritation through the nite that i couldn't sleep. I had a feeling of discomfort, i guess after years of being in the military you get used to a life expectancy that when something goes wrong it interrupts my way of thinking and how i feel.  Third i hope i get  what is right in return to get the revised dvd and if not compensate me for this emotional mess i had to go through.

078324228X|1.0|In June 1966, two men entered a bar and grill in Paterson, New Jersey and opened fire.  Two people were killed and one was to die later of injuries.  A fourth victim survived.    Eventually arrested for the murders were Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter and a friend.  Carter was a one-time contender for middle-weight title whose career was on the decline.  He had an extensive criminal record.    Carter was tried for murder in 1967 and found guilty.  The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed his conviction, and he was put on trial again in 1973.  The jury (which had two blacks) found him guilty within a matter of hours.  The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the conviction.    In 1988, the federal Court of Appeals affirmed a decision by the District Court that prosecutors had withheld material evidence.  New Jersey decided not to try Carter again, believing that a good case couldn't be made after so many years.    Contrary to what Carter and his apologists now say, he was never found innocent or exonerated of the murders.    The prosecution of Carter was not the strongest murder case brought in New Jersey in 1967 or 1973, but there was ample evidence to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, as even the New Jersey Supreme Court (not known for its conservatism) held.    This brings me to \\"Hurricane.\\"  Even by Hollywood standards, the movie takes incredible license with the facts, not only with the trial but also Carter's life.      The production values are excellent and Denzel Washington's performance is outstanding.  It does drag at times.    For more information on the case against Carter and this movie's misrepresentations, see Cal Deal's web site.
B0012Q732O|4.0|My daughter (15 yrs old) wanted this, so I purchased the DVD, thinking it would be  a typical teens' adventure film, long on action and short on sense. I was pleasantly surprised..... the plot is limited, and more than little free with the geographical locations of historical events, but the filmed settings and scenery are spectacular, the acting more than credible, and there is nice story line with a satisfactory \\"good guys win\\" ending. It kept me entertained throughout, even on the second viweing. So if you are looking for a film both the adults and kids will like, its a great choice.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|One of the hardest tasks for a historical drama is to get the historicity right.  John Adams succeeds in this task at almost every level.  Small things count.  The first visual that screamed authenticity to me was a small leather fire bucket hanging on a wall at the Adams house in Boston.  It was the same period fire bucket I saw on an Antiques Roadshow episode.  You get to see exactly how men wore their hair under those powdered wigs.  Hard life and hard living are shown throughout including hardscrabble farming, mud, dust, worn clothes, disease, and close quarters.  And then there are the events and places: George Washington's inauguration from both our point of view and his, awful army encampments, hot and intense debates in court and in congress, foreign courts, shipboard life, and the surprisingly cruel aspects of the fight for freedom.  Finally, the actors in John Adams do a superb job.  Paul Giamatti brings Adam's dyspeptic frustration to life along with his unremitting drive.  Laura Linney portrays an Abigail who shows caring, spine, and intelligence in equal measure.  All other revolutionary characters are shown with amazing visual accuracy beyond their portraits on our currency.  Altogether a treat for the history enthusiast.
B0017APQ1K|1.0|The movie is a great, but we're talking about the Blu-Ray version of it. This is the worst Blu-Ray transfer I have yet seen.  I already had the original DVD version, and expected a 1080p top quality transfer for the Blu-Ray, which this is not. I went back and watched some of the DVD version on an upscaling player, and it was indistinguishable from the Blu-Ray; both were well below the usual quality of a Blu-Ray.  This may sadly indicate a growing trend, where an existing DVD transfer is run through an upscaler and put out on Blu-Ray, with the lie that it is a 1080p transfer. Judging from the many favorable reviews on this forum, many buyers' eyes or video system cannot tell the difference. I guess that is what the scoundrels who put out this Blu-Ray were banking on. I've just learned to be more careful about buying a Blu-Ray of something I already have on DVD.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|You don't need to like any genre of music... You don't need to be their fan... at one listening you will fall in love with this album. I have received some amazing responses from people whenever they hear this album playing: \\"what are you playing?\\"...\\"Hey! this sounds good\\" \\" This is happy music\\"... This album will help them cut across countries and cultures. Coldplay's latest effort is truly commendable.

B0017XOF5A|4.0|Spoiler Free Review  The title there is a joke since this is the third movies in the series, along with The original feature that spawned the series, and the \\"Ark of Truth.\\"  I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as I expected. The twists in the end caught me off guard, because you won't expect what eventually happens to resolve the storyline. It felt a little bit cheap, like a 2 part TV episode more than a epic movie finale. On the other hand if, it didn't end the way it does, then it would have felt like a rehash of a previous episode. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see it.    My biggest complaint is the time traveling and alternate timeline themes didn't do enough to capture your imagination the way \\"Back to the Future\\" films do. But if you are a Stargate Fan, this is a can't miss DVD/bluray.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|...if you loved the movie, must have this CD to take you back to the visual in your mind, and the music from the past that's in your history and your heart.
B000003TBP|5.0|After years of absorbing classical and jazz, I have recently begun to gain an education in other styles of music. I had not heard of Beck prior to having it recommended to me. I am so glad I picked up this album! The sounds, the revolutionary ideas, the crazy songwriting... all come together to make this an amazing album.<br /><br />I am not an expert in this music, so I will leave the detailed, long-winded reviews to those that know what they are talking about. I like it!
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Al Green is back at his best.  There's not much else to say about him; this CD reminds us why we love to hear him sing.  gz
B000RZIGSG|2.0|I tried numerous times to like this '80s classic but I can't. Flashdance has a weak plot, bad and I mean BAD acting from Jennifer Beals, the only thing that saves this train wreck is the dancing. I give two stars for the hot as fire dancing and the soundtrack, otherwise than that, Flashdance is just too flashy for me.
0789318121|4.0|This book is about on par with the hardbound that was released for the  first film; nice format but unless you are a TRUE fan of these films it  may leave you a bit underwhelmed. There are enough nice photos, but I  myself have never been a big fan of reading scripts, which is included  in this volume in its entirety.     But the fact that you are here reading user reviews for it shows that  you are interested enough! Buy it; you like it!    -John in Santa Cruz
B000002O1Q|3.0|The movie looked promising on every level.  Seeing it in a theater, it fell extremely short of my expectations.  Good actors who for some reason delivered lines in this movie like they were reading it off a cue card.  And played it so \\"stereotypical\\" of the \\"character type\\" they were portraying it was sometimes \\"smirk inducing\\".<br /><br />That said...in the end it is kinda fun to watch.  I bought this soundrack 'cause it is a great  sample of some great rock acts of the 80's (without sounding 80's). You've got the \\"voice\\" of Contact (who had a hit with \\"10.9.8\\"), Marylin Martin (w/ Stevie Nicks doing some of the best b/g vocals on her own song), Maria Mckee doing Tom Petty \\"justice\\" yet again.<br /><br />If you can it's probably best to buy a download (where??) of the cuts you like.  Hearing all the songs in context of the film is fine.  At home it's a different story.  My rating is 50/50 but after all these years<br />I've made an effort to track down the DVD and this CD so parties involved must have done something right.
B000001FB3|5.0|Rainbow is never a disappointment! This music is wonderful. I'm glad I bought it!! Thank you very much.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Having been a Judas Priest fan for a long time, I can say that this album is not the usual Priest. However, I can also say that it's the best I've ever heard! It is truly a masterpiece on so many levels. Unlike the usual Priest, best listened to on a fast drive or a hard run, 'Nostradamus' is best appreciated at high volume in a dark, candlelit room. Intelligent, dark, and thoughtful, this work combines great instrumental performances, Halford's amazing vocal ability, and a well-researched interpretation of the life of a compelling historical figure. Well done!

B00003CXDV|5.0|Just a rousing good time for those of us who are star trek/science fiction fans.  The premise is fun and the cast is perfect.  We have watched this movie repeatedly and quote lines from it all the time.  It always makes us chuckle.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|There are some parts of this movie that are a bit outragious but for the most part it is pretty entertaining. After renting it I liked it enough to buy it.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|High action movie keeps you at the end of the seat. Its one of the best collection in my library.
B001EN71DG|1.0|Ok, according to the Digital Bits website ([...])THERE IS NO NEW CONTENT on these DVD's.    I am beginning to believe that George Lucas has OCD, what with all of these ritualistic repackaging re-re-re-rereleases of the same darn movies.    Either that or he's getting senile and has forgotten that he has already shoved these DVD's as far down our throat as they will go.  If you're going to screw your loyal fans out of more money by selling the same DVD's that you have been selling for years, with cute new boxes, atleast add something new to the DVD's! If Return of the Jedi had the deleted \\"sandstorm scene\\" that would have been something new. But instead, Lucas had his marketing team yank the same DVD's that are currently on the shelves (so much for their \\"limited edition\\" and \\"limited time\\" release) throw them in a sparkling new box and he wants us to pay nearly $[...] for them!    Need some extra spending money, George?    The Star Wars movies are being prostituted. And it's getting sickening.     Maybe if we all boycott these \\"new\\" DVD sets, George will get the message.    But, most wont. Most will buy them, thinking that they have new content.      The Star Wars money machine rolls onward.    And another thing, George...how about you stop importing action figures from China? We have enough lead in our water and in our paint...we dont need anymore.    Mr. Lucas, my padawan, charging money for repackaged movies.....greedy it is.  Greed will lead you to the dark side.      Apparently you do not live what you preach in the Star Wars movies.    No insult intended.    Just an opinion from a big Star Wars fan who has given thousands of dollars to the Lucasfilm empire......a fan who thinks that this money making tactic is disrespectful to your fans, and to the movies that we love so much.    Yeah, I get it..\\"It's America, and Lucas can do whatever he wants\\"....typical sith propaganda.
B000O59AFC|5.0|Its really a collectors edition. All the 1st part of the movie series are the best, like wise..........
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Subtitles. Might keep people away. But it shouldn't phase you a bit. This is a truly excellent movie. A well crafted adult movie, that reveals so much on how love is affected by time.

0792164903|5.0|Love this movie! One of Tim Burton's best! Jonny Depp is a brilliant actor; and Christina is haunting as usual. Love this classic tale of terror from Washington Ivring! Taken straight from the imagination of Tim Burton- brought to life for us all to see!

0060594888|4.0|As a corporate director of HR for a fortune 500 company, I am continually searching for material I can share with the management staff.  This book was an excellent fit in our learning resources center.<br /><br />While achieving success is rarely accomplished with shortcuts, this guide provides what I believe are important guideposts that will keep you on the right trail. Many people fail to achieve success because they leave the trail for other pursuits.<br /><br />It is really surprising in the business world at the number of people who really do not know what they are trying to achieve. Indeed, I would dare to say that most people don't have a clue as to where they are going.  They are simply meandering down the path hoping for few problems and a warm place to sleep at night.<br /><br />This book stresses the importance of people deciding what they really, really want to do in life.  My only negative critique is that the book seems to define success in financial terms (which is par for the consumer American nation).  As the wiser amoung us know, success takes many forms of which money is only a small part.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and intend to share the wisdom therein with other managerial types within my organization.  I believe the advice is solid and obviously, the author is \\"qualified\\" if for no other reason that his huge publishing success.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.  Michael L.

B0002W4SWC|5.0|OK, I am an avid fan of Jane Austen, but Bridget Jones is NOTHING like Austen. Anyone with the slightest of ideas on the subject can see that.<br /><br />Helen Fielding wrote both the novel and the screenplay to Bridget Jones's Diary and yes, it is loosely based on Pride and Prejudice. Can I repeat loosely!!!  After seeing The BBC version of Pride and Prejudice Fielding based the male character of Mark Darcy on Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, because of course she was taken by him and Colin Firth's portrayal.(as so many of us also are)  Other than some basic character traits they really are two completely different tales about different sets of people in drastically different times.<br /><br />But with all Austen-isms aside, Bridget Jones(Renee Zellweger) is a strong, typical woman who is all too familiar to many of us.  She finds answers to problems in vodka and Chaka Khan, has issues with her body and is after all the wrong men! There is something about Bridget all of us can identify with.<br /><br />Yes, slightly more promiscuous perhaps, maybe a bit more of a gutter-mouth but she's a character none-the-less.<br /><br />Bridget is full of spunk and won't let anything or anyone keep her down, and in that aspect she is a real inspiration.<br /><br />Mark Darcy(Colin Firth) and Daniel Cleaver(Hugh Grant) are enjoyable in there opposite of the spectrum characters, both after the affection of Miss. Jones.<br /><br />Set Austen aside, and try it for what it is.
B000OK8QBG|5.0|Well this one doesnt need a review. You seen the dvds, now get the book:)
B0011N1WE8|4.0|Poor Penelope(Christina Ricci) has been born with a curse that has given her the nose of a pig. Years and years have passed and after a faked death, eye-loss of an LP newsman paparazzi, and attempt after attempt to find a suitor; Penelope has begun to loose faith.<br /><br />Of course that is until she meets 'Max Campion'(James Mcavoy) who although has never laid eyes on her seems to see who she really is inside. He gives her the passion to run away from her stifling parents to discover life and who she is behind the pig nose.<br /><br />\\"Do you have any other pig parts?\\"<br />\\"No! \\"<br />\\"With such a large nose, do you smell better than the rest of us?\\"<br />\\"You tell me.\\"<br /><br />Being the huge Mcavoy fan that I am the long wait for the film to FINALLY come out gave me a scare, but it is truly wonderful.<br /><br />Visually stunning in every-way, this film is whimsical and wonderful, the set and cinematography are breathtaking and surreal. Also Penelope's wardrobe is offbeat and stylish and the soundtrack was beautifully chosen.  Sigur Ros' Hoppipolla gives me goosebumps and it fits the scene perfectly.<br /><br />All around good performances from the whole cast, not to mention a different role for Reese Witherspoon.<br /><br />A heart-warming tale for the romantic in all of us! Some fairy-tales do come true!
031606792X|5.0|I bought this book for my 11 year old daughter, who is hooked on the entire series. Here's what she says. \\"Breaking Dawn was the best closer to a series that you could possibly have. Her books keep getting more suspenseful after each turn of the page, which is what I love about them. I look forward to reading any more of Stephenie Meyer's books.\\"  She has read each book in this series at least three times.
0767836324|5.0|Without a doubt 1991's HOOK is my favorite movie of all time.<br /><br />Granted, if you are a 40-something year old about to view Hook for the very first time you may have trouble truly enjoying, or even understanding it.<br /><br />The tale of Peter Pan(Robin Williams), the boy who ran away to Neverland; always wanted to have fun and never wanted to grow-up! But what happens when indeed he has grown and he's been away from Neverland for years.  Now he must return to Neverland to save his two children from the hands of villainous Captain Hook!(Dustin Hoffman), only things are complicated; He's old, he's fat and Peter has forgotten how to fly(not to mention the fact that he ever was Peter Pan at all!)<br /><br />\\"Don't mess with me, man, I'm a lawyer. \\"<br /><br />Since as far back as I can remember this film has held a special place in my heart, and it is still true today. Night after night my father and I would pull out our light-up swords and fight in the dark, quoting classic lines from the film. It is one of my most treasured memories and I have Hook to thank for it.<br />Watching Peter Banning slowly uncover all the facts and hardships he's encountered to find his happy place and fly are touching.<br /><br />Hoffman and Williams are both brilliant adding different facets to these characters then could have been imagined, and they really have the ability to pull it off! Every character cast is fantastic.<br /><br />Hook is solely for those who are in-touch with their inner child, what is truly important in life and tying to find a balance between staying true to yourself and realizing we all must grow up.  If this isn't you, I don't assume you can even begin to appreciate it. Then again I supposed it's because you're far too enlightened already....<br /><br />\\"You... You man! you stupid, stupid man! \\"<br /><br />It absolutely never gets old.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The movies themselves are only part of the treat. The Extra material is fasinating and thought provoking.
B001C48EFQ|3.0|In a distant future where corporations rule the world, Toorop (Diesel) a merc banned from the US for terrorist acts is hired by Gorsky (Deperdieu) to take a young woman Aurura (Thierry) to the US.  When he arrives at the pick up spot, Sister Rebecca (Yeoh) joins them.     It seems everyone is after young Aurora, who knows how to operate an antequated Russian sub without ever having been on one and could speak 19 languages from the time she was two.  Just what does this girl have?   Toorop suspects it's a virus and if that's so, in a rare fit of compassion, he's going to kill her and burn her body.    Turns out, what she's carrying is something a good deal more nefarious and could actually change the world.      We've got some nice action in what's a rather obtuse plot.  Honestly, PD James' \\"Children of Men\\" is a very similar story (Minus a few key twists) and is much better executed than this screen enactment of Dantec's \\"Babylon Babies.\\"      Was it worth seeing?  On a Sunday afternoon with not much else to do, yes.  If you like Vin Diesel, Yeoh, or Thierry, yes.  If you like really well-plotted sci-fi, it's not such a good choice.  You have to work at figuring out what actually is going on.     Rebecca Kyle, August 2008
031606792X|5.0|Come on guys!  Those who bash this book need to look deeper into the meaning of it all.  We can't all have it our way!  This book, along with all the others, allow the reader to feel like they are in the story.  It IS believable and I personally love it.  The ending is just as it should have been.  I felt totally complete.  I have read all her books over three times and on my way to reading it the 4th time. I can't put them down, all of them.  I just hope they make the other three books into movies and use the same actors!
B00006J3WH|4.0|This Cd is alright...okay, it's awesome somehow. There are many good tracks, many funny ones and many crap ones as well. I love \\"Under Your Spell\\" by Amber Benson (Tara), she's talented, if you don't wanna buy the CD, just check out her song because it's good. The lyric is nice and all, I can definitely feel love here in this song, the video clip is also cute. Anthony's songs are good too, check them out. Sarah Michelle ain't that good at singing but she managed, so are the rest of the team. Don't like James Marsters' voice.

0321544080|5.0|Lots of anecdotal information mixed in with a quick blurb on how the picture was shot, that is what makes this a fun & informative book to read, more for the intermediate or begining photographer that intends to move their \\"hobby\\" to the next level or find out how those cool pictures are done, cool moral booster too because you find out that not evey shot a Pro takes is planned that way nor turns out all the time...definatly one of the better books to buy.
B0017MO10U|5.0|This movie was just as fun as the series, and a great plot, if a little predictable, but it had to be to turn out right. Good sci-fi, I wish they'd  make a few more!
B000I2JDEY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I like how the directors of the movie move the fear of Virginia to the humbling of Virginia. I like how Burton comes up with his plan to overcome Woolf in the movie. I even wrote a thesis on the movie. My professor loves the article and praises me in her letter that she wrote back to me. The movie shows a side of Taylor that beginning Theatre students are exposed to. All in all, I enjoyed being exposed to an old movie that still has relevance to today. Eric Davis
0321525655|4.0|I remember getting my hands on Harvard Graphics way back when and being so excited about how it would revolutionize presentations.  But basically, though the software has improved since then, we use it the same way. Reynolds shows it doesn't have to be that way; you don't have to shoot your audience full of bullet points. I think you could probably get the gist of his message by reading his excellent blog - the book could have gone further beyond that, I think. In any case, if you suffer from presentation fatigue in your workplace, show this to your boss and your team members. For sure buy the book if your boss won't be impressed that you found a cool business tip on a blog.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is one of the best classic movies. It is so funny and no matter how many times I watch it, I never tire of it. Chevy Chase is a riot! Great casting with Beverly D'Angelo and Randy Quaid.
B000P0J02E|5.0|The songs reproduced on this CD serve to transport you to the bow of the Black Pearl, and to the deck of the Flying Dutchman, and to Davey Jones' Locker and Beyond!!

B001ACY8D2|5.0|Endalaust is an interesting album to me. If my impressions of the band's general sound from listening to ( ) is accurate, which I'm pretty sure it is, then Endalaust is a significant departure from that. It's less post rock and more hippie indie wanky stuff, in a very entertaining way. But plenty of bands have changed their sound, what's interesting to me is how they don't abandon their old ways. Their earlier sound slowly creeps back into the album while it's playing, eventually completely taking over again. It tells a story just with the evolution of its sound more than any album I can remember. It seems to me like a youth growing older, or maybe an adult reverting to childhood, I can't tell which. But it's really beautiful anyway.    \\"Gobbledigook\\" is the single with the music video featuring happy, dancing, naked people; imagery that really fits the song pretty well. The pounding drums make the song for me, and the off-beat guitar and high pitched voices accompany it well. The next few songs continue with the same feel, using strong beats, plinking keys, and catchy vocals to catch the attention. \\"Festival\\" is a more traditional long, slowly building track that reaches a soaring climax, although it has a quality that differentiates it from similar songs they've done before. It's just the choice of instrumentation, but it captures all the power of that technique while still sounding new. \\"Ára Bátur\\" reminds me the most of their old sound, but as it goes on an orchestra builds up and reaches a swelling crescendo so powerful that while listening to it in the car, I forgot to make my turn.  The next few songs are lower key, softer tracks, none of which astound, but they're nice enough to listen to.  The last song, \\"All Alright\\", is the band's first sung in English, although it doesn't make a difference when I can barely understand him anyway.  It's a nice enough way to close out the record, though.
B000002H97|1.0|Years later, I'm still disappointed.  Years later I still cannot listen to this album all the way through without cringing.

630463949X|5.0|I've been watching this DVD on and off for the last ten years. It still brings tears to my eyes, still makes me laugh, and still makes my heart well up. Fleetwood Mac is a phenomenon, and they prove it with this DVD. The performances are all amazing, and they are truly all at the top of their games.     I was born 30 years too late... if only to see them, Zeppelin, The Who... I guess I'll have to be satisfied with this amazing DVD. Wonderfully put together and wonderfully performed!
0316067601|5.0|This book should be required reading for ALL politicans and reporters.  I had to read this in complete privacy and solitude.    I read each word at least 5 times to make sure I honored the hero's the author is telling about, including himself.  I knew I could never become a SEAL so I chose another path, but I was fortunate to have served with a number of them.outside their community  and this author is actually quite modest in his appraisal of them and their deeds.   For any military personnel or former military personnel I can only say one thing, BUY AND READ IT , you will cry and swell with pride all at the same time.   Thank You Sir for your service and writing this book.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|I am a musician, and over the years I have grown to enjoy and play most genres of music from rock n' roll to jazz to electronic music, but I have never lost my love of heavy metal.  I am 35 now.  I first heard this album as a mullet-headed, scrawny, pimply 16 year old a few years after it came out. I dubbed a cassette copy from a friend and completely wore it out.<br /><br />There are nearly 600 other Amazon reviews here, so there's not much to say that hasn't already been said about Reign In Blood.  Still, indulge me - I just want to make a few comments about how influential and timeless this album is.<br /><br />To me, Tom Araya's vocals have always been one of Slayer's greatest assets.  He can't really \\"sing\\" per se, his voice of more of an aggressive, unhinged bark, full of aggression and rage.  Within his limitations he has a surprising range, too.  To me his vocal style is more effectively aggressive than the standard cookie cutter, Cookie Monster-like cookie cutter death grunts and shrieks that are now a hackneyed clich&eacute; in metal bands.  Plus, you can understand most of the lyrics by just listening - a lyric sheet is required for most metal bands.<br /><br />Also, at the time this came out, with the possible exception of Venom, nobody was as blasphemous as Slayer.  I don't think the band has ever really been Satanists, and I think they would probably describe themselves as atheists more than anything else.  I look at the satanic imagery as more of a broadside against organized religion, Christianity of course in particular.  In fact the lyrics of lot of the more Satanic songs, particularly on this album, would be quite cheesy if not for the raw rage with which they were delivered.  Slayer is interested in showing us the darker corners of human nature, not in converting us to any one worldview.  But if you've got a grudge against religion, Slayer is the band and this is the album for your angry moments.<br /><br />Lombardo's drumming on this album is phenomenal, too - the guy practically invented the double kick drum technique that is now such a standard element of death metal.  He's a little looser here than on most of their other albums.  This was the mid 80s - no one had ever heard a drummer play so fast.  There were a few English grind bands like Napalm Death doing blast beats, but blast beats at the time were more of an expression of punk aggression, not really a metal thing.<br /><br />A few of the criticisms of this album are justified.  For one, there is little bass presence to speak of, the same problem that plagued Metallica's otherwise excellent ...And Justice For All.  For another the unrelenting attack makes these tunes sound kind of similar at times - the familiar \\"all the songs sound the same\\" critique. That can be true of metal bands in general, particularly in the years since Reign In Blood and with the personalityless grunts and inhuman roars have become the norm for metal.  There is also a case to be made that some of the satanic stuff can seem a little ridiculous, again true for a lot of metal bands in general.<br /><br />It's good that they made this Reign so short - I don't see how keeping this level of intensity couldn't start to grate if it went on much longer.  After this record they began to explore more varied tempos.<br /><br />But to this day, Araya's demonic shriek at the beginning of \\"Angel Of Death\\" still chills my blood.  He sounds like a scaly, horned demon swooping down from a lightning-filled black sky to devour souls!  The aggression and intensity do not let up from there.  There are hardly even any gaps between the songs.  It's a blistering, full-frontal assault from beginning to end.  Some metal albums can be a little cheesy, but not this one.  It's genuinely scary and perfect for frightening your parents, as it certainly did mine. It's an album whose legendary status is entirely justified, and continues to inspire new generations of metalheads to raise their hands in the \\"devil horns\\" salute.  It's that good.

B000065VA1|5.0|So, Peter Gabriel's 1986 album, his fifth official studio record, is probably my favourite Peter Gabriel album. There's a great blend of textures, feelings and moods, and I feel it's the most consistent Gabriel solo album I've heard.    There are a lot of talented guest musicians on this album. There's Stuart Copeland's distinctive hi-hats in \\"Red Rain\\", Tony Levin's often quirky bass on tracks like \\"Sledgehammer\\", a gentle Kate Bush in the reassuring \\"Don't Give Up\\", a spirited Laurie Anderson on \\"This is the Picture\\" (I must get into her stuff one day). There's even a backing vocal by world musician Youssou N'dour on the vividly emotional \\"In Your Eyes\\".    The textures of the tracks, though produced in a similar way, evoke different things. \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\", with their slick poppy production, for me evoke the skyscrapers of the big city, while tracks like the soothing \\"Mercy Street\\" conjure up an earthier quality, mainly thanks to Peter Gabriel's vocals. His singing is top notch here, big and bold and yet vulnerable when it needs to be.    The lyrical subject matter focuses a great deal on relationships, particularly in times of trouble, in a variety of ways. There are other subjects covered too. There is the story of the man who wants everything bigger and better in \\"Big Time\\" and the tribute to troubled poet Anne Sexton in \\"Mercy Street\\", plus the image rich \\"Red Rain\\" and \\"This is the Picture\\".    As with all the 2002 remasters, the booklet comes with a booklet filled with photos, this time of the So Tour, behind-the scenes of the Sledgehammer video and of the recording of the album. There's also, as always, full lyrics and a list of who plays what (though I think some people are listed as doing things on the wrong tracks, like it says that Laurie Anderson does a guest vocal on track 9, which is \\"In Your Eyes\\", rather than on \\"This is the Picture\\").    It's probably Peter Gabriel's most accessible album, so I'd recommend it to anyone who is curious about his solo career, though all of his material is worth checking out to a greater and lesser extent.
031606792X|3.0|I didn't hate this book but I not jumping with joy either. Acutally I couldn't finish it. I realised half way through reading it that I didn't care how Bella and the Cullens defeated the Volturi. It didn't hold my attention like the other books in the series did. I found Breaking Dawn far too long and boring.
B000TGCR38|4.0|This film chronicles the Dutch resistance against Nazi aggression in WWII following a Jewish protagonist named Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries. The decisions Rachel/Ellis must make to maintain her cover in some extremely difficult situations will make some viewers uncomfortable, but I challenge those who view BLACK BOOK to ask themselves what they would have done?    This is not in the same vein as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or PATTON-there are gunshots here and there, but the blood and guts in this film are the consenquences that come with Rachel/Ellis's actions (wonderfully portrayed by Carice van Houten). Strong performances by the supporting players as well (particularly Sebastian Koch who played the Nazi Muntze). A fantastic film, 4.5 stars!
0061150142|5.0|What a fantastic story. I could not put this down. It is not only beautifully written, but poses many questions about teen suicide. Especially those of us who have teenagers and think we know them and what they are thinking. A must read!
B0001I561E|5.0|Great availablity of a vaulted Disney movie!!!  Not available ANYWHERE else... believe me, Ive looked.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|In the 1960's Julie Andrews played a part in two of the most definitive musicals of the 20th Century. Disney's Mary Poppins and Rodgers & Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, both gave someone a clean cut fun and heart warming experience that had many people humming the songs for decades. Out of the two I would say The Sound of Music is the better and has left me with a huge level of admiration for Dame Julie Andrews. She has an amazing singing voice, and a class and grace unmatched by any fellow actress.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a young clumsy nun named Maria who is considered a nuisance by most of her fellow sisters in the convent. One day she is sent out to the Von Trapp family as the house led by Captain Von Trapp is after a new governess to take care of his 7 children. The Von Trapp household is led like one of his old navy ships, where he commands his children with the blow of a whistle forcing them to march and work, but there is no play. Maria becomes determined to teach the captain and the children what it's like to have fun, and one time whilst he's away to Vienna she takes her chance to let the children have fun and teach them to sing. This leads to a heart warming story which allows the children to sing and represent their home country of Austria.<br /><br />In my personal view this film hasn't aged a bit, I haven't seen it for a few years and actually think the last time I watched this was when I was 10 years old (I'm 22 now). Watching it again today, unlike most films from my childhood, my opinion of this has not changed one bit, I still love it as much as I remember doing so all them years ago. The intro actually gave me chills as I began reminiscing of this film and how good it actually was.<br /><br />The music of course is the main focus of the film, it has some of possibly the most catchy and memorable songs that could have you embarrassingly singing along at the top of your voice. Health Warning: You could end up with a sore throat after trying to sing-a-long. The kids are amazing with their music pieces as the general harmony of them is shocking, even considering their age with the youngest being 5. Of course Dame Julie was on top form and served as the delightful support for the child choir.<br /><br />The setting of the film in 1930's Austria actually gives this film a beautiful look, which gives you the understanding just as to why the character of Maria is such a happy person. If I were certainly living in such a beautiful country I have no doubt I would be the same. The film was primarily shot on location with very little need for purpose built sets or cardboard backgrounds. Because of the beautiful environments if done right it will look even more spectacular on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I don't think this classic is really for a new audience as most young viewers wouldn't really appreciate the light hearted attitude and general good feel of it all. It wouldn't fit in with todays standard of films, it doesn't have violence, it doesn't have crude language and it doesn't have a smidgen of nudity. It's a wholesome film for the entire family, it doesn't need parental guidance or anyone to explain the film. I would say that although it's unlikely to captivate any new or young audiences, it's a film that will certainly convey a good and hearty message of love and positivity..

B000BPG2JC|5.0|I had read about this author from another source, and curiosity led me to buy this book.  What a wonderful surprise!  It's a comfy, down-home type - sheriff doesn't want to be the bad guy and have to kill some one, but that doesn't mean that he won't if he has to.  This book led me on to buy the next in the series.  Unless you're looking for a book that is heavily laden with bordello scenes, you'll enjoy this.  Am looking forward for my next book (I should say, books as I ordered the next 2).
B00168ML1G|5.0|Looking at this year what will most people say was the best comic book movie of 08? Dark Knight, exactly but next in line is without a doubt Iron Man and that's for many different reasons. Out of the 4 comic book movies I can name off the top of my head that were released this year, Iron Man was definitely the coolest, with Dark Knight being the most authentic, Hellboy 2 being the biggest fantasy and Incredible Hulk just being the most insane. Robert Downey Jr. without a doubt made this film what it is, he delivers his very special brand of charisma and acting talent to a very cool and charismatic character. A lot of people have said that you couldn't have gotten a more perfect person to play Tony Stark and they weren't kidding.<br /><br />To those not familiar with the comic or have not yet seen the film, Tony Stark/Iron Man is the owner of the worlds premier weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. In the movie he is kidnapped by terrorists who hold him until he agrees to build them a specialist weapon, he agrees but instead builds an indestructible suit which he will use to break himself out of his prison. He manages to break out, but comes to realise what he's been doing has been the main force in a lot of innocent killings, so he designs a better version of the suit which he will use to help those in need.<br /><br />Downey Jr. has always been known as one of those special actors that will constantly put on amazing performances in little known movies, and very rarely gets a chance at a big time role. Iron Man is one of his biggest roles to date and he gets to star along such greats as Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard. Speaking of Paltrow, I don't think you could have gotten a more perfect role for Tony Starks P.A. Pepper Potts than the Oscar winner. The villain of the film is one hell of a scary guy, Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger is actually one of the more intimidating comic villains I've seen to date. Played by Jeff Bridges, I honestly think the guy deserves a round of applause for his role.<br /><br />All in all a great movie with some spectacular special effects, great action and actually a great message. Watch it, I promise you wont be disappointed.applause for his role.    All in all a great movie with some spectacular special effects, great action and actually a great message.

B001B71NOI|4.0|This album is quite pleasing: good rhythm, nice feelings while listening to that \\"good old NIN style\\" (common, we all like when Trent's shouting, we like that indus sound, which means good old saturated guitar, good percussions &cool atmosphere on the electro part to me) and also a good following to the Ghosts previous album.<br /><br />Of course, I'm one of those people that think that the more \\"venomous\\" aspects of NIN's years were what gave the best sound & feelings, anyway I still find it to be good music in general, although I would personally \\"put down\\" a bit the electronic / \\"noise\\" parts for more \\"metalesque\\" parts.<br /><br />Anyway, to sum up the whole picture, I would say that this album is quite refreshing & for those of you that are undecided to buy or not this one, just download it for free & legally from the official web site, then honor the authors for their work.
B001ACY8D2|2.0|What happened to my dearest Sigur Ros? Why so mellow?  I understand everything/one must evolve. But why in this direction? It simply lacks the intensity found in their earlier works. It should `work', but it simply fails to click with me.  Track by track analysis:   Globbdigook- Downright pop. Or freak-folk, depending upon how you look at it. Catches you at first listen, but ultimately, like nearly everything on this album, lacks substance. The `lalalalala'ing? Are you kidding me? I know I shouldn't play the compare game, but people.  Listen to Untitled One (Vaka), then this in succession. Serious drop in quality.   Inní mér syngur vitleysingur -A bad circus. Chaos. Sudden explosion of sound. Appears like it's trying to be catchy, but it isn't even that. I'm amused by the fact some of it sounds like it's in English though. `A thirsty anger' `kinky' `we flip and throttle' .  Góðan daginn- My favorite of the album. It's a comforting song to me. Completely different direction than my older favorite SR tracks. However, it just works for this song. It's beautiful.  Gives me hope for some other potential off this album. I feel some actual emotion here!  Við spilum endalaust- I have nothing to say about this. Evokes no emotion from me.  Festival- Starts slow. I like to think I have patience for buildups, but I lost it here. 4:45, finally hearing signs of life again. I like it when the strings get a little more emphasis opposed to the blasted overused drums.  Nice when the buildup reaches its full point. Yet I manage to forget this every time until it gets to that point.  Með suð í eyrum- I don't have a proper version of this currently, and am not able to acquire one at the moment.  Ára bátur- Initially reminds me of Samskeyti. I'm gooing to be honest here, no idea why I don't like this.   Illgresi- I've never listened to a SR song and consciously thought \\"I wish this was in English\\" until now. There's nothing to focus on. In situations like this I typically suckit up and listen to the meaning the artist is trying to express, but I get nothing but slight sadness. If it felt impassionate to me I believe I would feel differently about this song.  Fljótavík- The beginning was encouraging. I'm not sure what makes this song different from Ilgresi for me, but this one feels more emotional. A feel a little Vaka off ( ) here. A stronger track off the album. The ending is quite beautiful and touching.  Straumnes- The transition from Fljótavík to this does seem very cohesive. Very relaxing song. Depending on who you are Iguess this could be a positive thing, but I prefer their intense side personally. Not a bad track though. Arguably a filler.  All Alright- I never thought they would ever create a song with English lyrics. I'm really a fan of the lyrics, simple but evocative all the same. The actual music lacks the intensity of say, Untitled Eight, but what can one do?   This doesn't even really seem like a two-star review. When everything else SR produces is just so damn euphoric, a slightly above average album [even that's pushing it in this situation] from them warrants two stars. I attempt to respect their right to change. It's just incredibly difficult for me to lose a band I've been so emotionally connected with for so long. ( ) is one of the top three albums I've ever heard. The passion on that album is untouchable. It's almost like they're afraid to go back into that territory, with each proceeding album more and more mellow. But what do I know.    The new music `should' work. For some reason it just does not connect with me. I can't make it through the entire thing without a `Cold', `Untitled Eight' ,'Avalon', `Svo Hljott', `Olsen Olsen', or `Ebow' listening.

0743454537|5.0|[[ASIN:0743454537 My Sister's Keeper: A Novel]]      Can a Parent love too much? Or is too much never enough?    Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.    MY SISTER'S KEEPER is a story that struck a cord with me. As the sister of someone who suffered from a life threatening illness I saw first hand the struggles that parents go through to protect their child. Is this a controversial story? Some could see it as such. But for me it was a powerful, though heartbreaking story of real life. These things happen, and as a parent I could not fault Anna's parents for making the decisions that they made. Did it mean they loved her any less? Absolutely not. If I were in the same situation would I have a baby just to save another child? I don't know. But what I do know is that I would do everything in my power to save my child. Who could fault anyone for that?     Jodi Picoult writes a heartbreaking, emotional page turning story that I would recommend to anyone. Will it cause people to talk? Sure. Will some people disagree with the decisions made within the story? Absolutely.  But I'll be surprised if you guess the ending!    I give this book 5 *****stars.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Johnny Depp certainly got himself another hit on his hands with this one, much to the delight of his considerable fan club and every other Broadway baby out there. While I don't know if Johnny Depp is the world's greatest singer (he won't be doing opera anytime soon) he proves that he can carry a tune well enough to make this a musical worth seeing, and fans of prior versions of the show should be pleased. Helena Bonham Carter keeps up her pace as his consort with that flair of hers we all know and love.<br /><br />But it ain't just Mr. Depp and Ms. Carter. Even without him and his gifts \\"Sweeny Todd\\" is art, a sensitive version of the old legend of the killer that speaks of his personal tragedy even as it recognizes his darker and, dare I say, it comedy. Simply put, \\"Sweeny Todd\\" is a great story in every sense of the word. It has it all: comedy, tragedy, romance, cannibalism. What more do you need? Visually it is a gem, from the river of blood that opens it to the scenes that vary between the streets of London and the cramped spaces of the homes and pie shops. It does not sweep broadly, but pulls you into claustrophobic conditions that force you to examine the characters. Every one of them is real. Every one of them, good or evil, earns your appreciation in a character-driven story that refuses to be two-dimensional.<br /><br />This is not about a barber that kills people. This is about what people will do when they are desperate in their passions of love and hate. We see goodness, innocence, love. We see revenge, evil, pain. We see everything in between, serious and funny alike.<br /><br />The songs are incredible and do their part to move the story along in their lyrics of passion and black humor.<br /><br />Isn't it great that musicals are back in vogue?

B00139W3NE|1.0|True, it's been a about three or so years since I've read Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, the books upon which this film is based, if you didn't know. But as that time three years ago was my second time going through the trilogy, I still like to think I had a decent memory of them along with a decent opinion. At the risk of offending fans, I always felt Pullman's characters--Lyra, Mrs. Coulter, Will, the whole gang--to be on the weak side of characterization, a few hops from being completely two-dimensional. STILL, I thought the story and theme to be on another plane entirely, certainly enough to make the books as famous as they are and even flesh out an entertaining movie.<br /><br />I promise, I tried my best to like this movie, for the sake of those books. For the sake of Sam Elliot and the goddess Nicole Kidman. Heck, even for that cute little new girl. They all did their best, but frankly this movie was fluff, and it's hard to work with fluff. How could they take such thought- and controversy- provoking books and turn them into fluff? I'm hardly an atheist, but I had appreciated the story's urge for free thought, free will, and a keener look at authority. The smidgen they put in here was all too welcomed, but not enough to give this movie proper heart and soul.<br /><br />What we are left with is a rushed train of lovely cinematography, scenery, and special effects that accompany an equally rushed plot. Yes, there is a lot of story to get into this movie, but making that the priority left me cold toward these characters who were weak in the book and utterly two-dimensional on screen. I felt like I was an infant teenager being instructed in the ways of generic fantasy. Talking bears? Soul-daemons? Other worlds? Texas as a country? Wonderful, fantastic ideas that appeared on the big screen like toys in hurried images.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but while the director was having fun with the camera, the audience was confused by the random jumping from scene to scene, plot to plot.<br /><br />So maybe it was a tragic result of putting a plot-based rather than character-based story in a movie that led to all story and show and no emotional depth. Maybe it was a tragic result of playing it safe by removing all blatant references to religion. Maybe I'm just a whiney book purist.<br /><br />All I know is that the result was flashy, heartless, and boring.So maybe it was a tragic result of putting a plot-based rather than character-based story in a movie that led to all story and show and no emotional depth.

B000X418UO|1.0|This movie ranks number one on my top 9 movies list. What could be better than this movie? Nothing. It had an all star cast, and had the most original plot of any movie. No other movie has had a group of convicts hijacking an airplane before (Ignore the movie US Marshalls and a few other exceptions). But honestly, this was the greatest acting performance by Nicolas Cage ever. It is a shame he didn't win an academy award for best actor. And how about that John Malkovich. He played a psycho criminal so well, that if you saw him in real life, you would crap your pants on the spot. Dave Chapelle was wonderful too, playing an all too fitting role of a crackhead, just added to the realism. Then there was Colm Meaney. Everyone knows him from being that guy in Under Siege, and his new upcoming role playing apart from Seagal again in the yet to be released Half Passed Dead (I know good movies, and let me tell you, HPD will be number 6 on my top 9 list, and I haven't even seen it yet). Nobody can forget John Cusack being the anal retentive \\"nature boy\\" policeman. Ving Rames played a convincing criminal as well. But the greatest character in this movie was Steve Buscemi. Little do you know, but Buscemi was not acting in this movie, he actually is like that in real life.  But enough of the cast, back to the plot. What an amazing scenario, to have the criminals overtake an airplane and try to free themselves with Nick Cage (who is in the Italian-American Hall of Fame mind you) stuck in the middle of all of it. You must watch this movie to see what predicaments the criminals get themselves into, and how Nick Cage, aided by Cusack and Meaney on the ground, tries to thwart their plans. I feel this movie should have won multiple academy awards for best writing. The dialogue between characters, especially Malkovich, was nothing short of phenominal. So while I sit here and write my second comment for this movie, YOU need to go watch it. I guarantee your life will be complete upon seeing this movie.  A Masterpiece. Belongs in the Walt Disney hall of fame.

0060989157|5.0|I just finished reading the The Dirt and it was, honest to God, one of the most compelling books I have ever read. I am a huge Motley Crue fan but the great thing about this book is that you don't have to be a fan, heck you don't even have to like music to enjoy this book. This book is about music, but just barely. There is a little bit about Nikki Sixx and how he came up with lyrics and such but other than that there's not much about the music itself. This book is very different from Aerosmith's \\"Walk This Way\\" and Slash's autobiography. Those books have a good deal of information on the actual music. \\"The Dirt\\" stays away from it. Instead, it tells the amusing, shocking, and sometimes utterly revolting stories of the band members while they were in their teen years, when they were just a young upstart band in West Hollywood, and when they became international stars and went on tour. A worthwhile read.

B00005JPSM|2.0|No Reservations, starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Abigail Breslin, has a weak script but solid performances. If you're into food, you will probably be able to look past the film's weaknesses and enjoy it.<br /><br />First of all, the movie is about two chefs. Kate (Zeta-Jones) is the executive chef at a tony New York restaurant. She is something of a control freak, and her work has become her life. Her sister (a single mom - the dad is nowhere to be found) and niece are coming up to visit, and enroute, they are involved in a car accident. The sister dies as a result, and she leaves her daughter Zoe (Breslin) to Kate. In the midst of this personal crisis, Kate must deal with a new sous-chef in her kitchen at work. Nick (Eckhart), an established chef in his own right, takes the job because he wants the opportunity to work with (and learn from) the well-respected Kate.<br /><br />As Kate adjusts to being a mother, and as she tries to guide Zoe (and herself) through the tragedy of loss, a romantic relationship with Nick slowly develops. Kate finds herself confronting her own tendencies to sabotage love (she hasn't had a relationship in 3 years) while figuring out her new life.<br /><br />While this script is no Oscar-winner, I liked the performances of all three principal actors. Plus, the movie is about two people who cook for a living, and food figured heavily in the scenes (which I can certainly appreciate).<br /><br />This is an inoffensive dramedy, overall, but I wouldn't consider it a must-see. If you love food movies, I would more heartily recommend Babette's Feast; Like Water for Chocolate; Eat, Drink, Man, Woman; and Big Night.
031606792X|5.0|Almost needless to say, this book was phenomenal.  If you have read ANY of Stephenie Meyer's work, add this to your list!  But dont forget to read Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse first!  I also love Amazon for contacting me on how to receive this book the quickest and the day it came out even after my order had already been placed with a different delivery method.  Thank you Stephenie and Amazon for such a wonderful experience!!
0143038419|3.0|I just finished Elizabeth Gilbert's eat pray love, a memoir about a year she spent abroad coming to terms with herself, her life, and her choices.<br /><br />After a heart-wrenching divorce and a failed rebound relationship, Gilbert decided to spend a year abroad, dividing her time between three countries: Italy (learning Italian and eating tons of delicious food), India (learning about prayer and meditation), and Indonesia (trying to find the balance between earthly pleasures and the divine).<br /><br />What was interesting about this book: Gilbert is a great writer, and the tome is written in a conversational style that I really like. You finish reading feeling as though Gilbert is someone you know, a friend. I also liked the concept of the book - visiting different places for specific reasons in order to somehow learn more about yourself and life in general. (I love traveling, and I think it teaches you alot.) I found Gilbert's journeys very interesting, and she weaves a good bit of history and philosophy into this book, which makes reading it educational as well as entertaining. I liked the section about her time in Italy best, as I have a fascination with that country. (Though one comes away from the book with a nearly palpable longing to visit Bali.)<br /><br />What became tiresome: Gilbert is the kind of person who has to spend a year abroad to work out her issues. This can be grating at times. There were moments when I wanted to shout, \\"Quit whining! Suck it up, girl! You are a well-paid writer, traveling the globe! It ain't that bad!\\" Gilbert herself acknowledges this, though, because she is nothing if not self-aware. In fact, she come off as a bit *too* self-absorbed, in my opinion.<br /><br />Regardless, though, I enjoyed reading the book. I loved some of the ideas about religion that Gilbert included, and it has definitely piqued my interest in yoga.
1892005034|5.0|\\"Nonviolent communications: A Language of Life\\" is an update to an ancient philosophy of life, seldom practised, that empowers one to become aware of the links between language and emotion from which physical and psychological violence in human life emanate.  What makes Rosenberg's update worth reading is its articulation of a means of recognizing in our selection and interpretation of language the clues to revealing our real human needs.  The book offers a framework for gently uncovering the \\"viruses of language form\\" in which we either lose ourselves or ignore others in unwitting emoto-linguistic ignorance.  It reveals, by extensive reference to Rosenberg's own rich experience in mediation and conflict resolution around the world, how these conventions of form often obscure our true needs and those of others rather than help us discover what these needs really are so that we can cooperate to get them met.<br /><br />Acknowledging that the insight and empathy, whether for other or self, required to do this is rare, Rosenberg's book will nevertheless be an enlightenment for almost all of us of an extraordinarily practical kind.  It is also an inspiration and an encouragement to try out the \\"NVC skills of language and listening\\" he skillfully advocates and illustrates.  If NVC leaves you wondering where in the real work, market, and election places of the world you are likely to be safe doing so, that can be a stimulation to discover the power of Rational Emoto-Linguistics to ground your \\"I\\" concept in a yet deeper truth.
0679735909|5.0|I just finished reading A.S. Byatt's Possession, and I have been completely blown away. It's a long book (555 pages), but, in my opinion, it's totally worth it. If you are an English major, this book is a dream come true for you. Byatt writes a modern classic, complete with literary allusions, tons of symbolism, and a gripping storyline.<br /><br />Roland Michell is a lowly academic, studying the life and work of Randolph Ash, a major poet. But he's not a recognized expert on Ash, he's hardly making any money, and he spends his time applying for jobs that he never gets. His relationship with his live-in lover, Val, has soured, and he's desperately looking for a non-confrontational way out.<br /><br />One afternoon, Michell is at the English National Library, requesting an old and never-perused edition of one of Ash's own books. Within the pages, he finds undisturbed notes by the famous poet, in addition to two drafts of a very urgent, emotionally-charged letter to an unknown woman (not Ash's wife).<br /><br />Siezed by unbridled excitement and curiosity, Michell clandestinely pockets the letters, determined to find out who they were meant for. What begins then is a rousing tale of literary investigation, romance, and good-old mystery.<br /><br />In his search, Roland meets Maud Bailey. Maud is a descendent of Christabel Lamotte, a poetess of some small fame, but not nearly approaching the popularity of Ash. Bailey is a professor at a college, and she is an expert on her ancestral poetess. Her concentration on Lamotte has moved her in the circles of feminist/women's literature.<br /><br />Together, the two track the movements of Ash and Lamotte and slowly discover all of their secrets. In the process, Maud and Roland come to know one another in a unique way, changing their own personal and professional lives.<br /><br />It may sound like boring stuff, but I cannot praise this novel enough. The novel is rich with the symbolism that Byatt is so fond of, and she sets her work again in the Victorian period (as she did in Morpho Eugenia), which she obviously has a great knowledge of and affinity for. She deftly creates the poetic works of both of her Victorian writers and sprinkles them throughout the novel.<br /><br />Also, much of the novel is epistolary, using the letters between Ash and Lamotte to illuminate their relationship and explain their fascination with one another.<br /><br />This is a do-not-miss book.

B0010OMXKA|5.0|Fantastic!!  Since his first cross-over CD/DVD, \\"Under The Desert Sky\\", I have awaited another such set.  I have listened and viewed it many times and it just gets better.  One of our most prized operatic voices heard today.  The wonderful artists that appeared on stage and performed with him were outstanding.  The backdrop of the Tuscany countryside was beautiful and well chosen.  I look for more of these entertaining concerts which I prefer over classic opera.

B0016NF06O|4.0|I came to this one with less than great expectations.  Willie's previous recording of the Great American Songbook, which included \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Georgia on My Mind,\\" was scarcely a threat to Merle Haggard's similar venture let alone Frank Sinatra.  The voice was a \\"country-sounding\\" whine accompanied by an obvious, mechanical rhythm section of the sort you'll hear at Opryland.  Not so on this occasion.  He sings with life, humor, adventurous phrasing, and responsiveness to the contributions of his heady musical accompaniment.  His strains may not be as sweet and sustained as in the past, but they're more assured than ever.<br /><br />\\"Bright Lights Big City\\" sets the tone with a convincing roadhouse feel (a blues in the \\"geetar key\\" resisted by all jazz musicians--E, or 4 sharps!).  Yet to the careful listener there are inventive twists to the arrangement, such as the single-note exchanges between trumpet and sax and the nearly imperceptible \\"bi-tonal\\" inserts (all serving to simulate a traffic jam). Even \\"Stardust\\" manages to keep the party in gear, taken at a fairly bright tempo that Willie sings so confidently you have to wonder if he's aware that Hoagy Carmichael originally conceived of the tune as an up-tempo number.  And on \\"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\\" Willie takes Hank Williams along with him to participate in what turns out to be a genuine Bourbon Street parade. And \\"That's All\\" is a rampaging gospel jubilee-shout featuring a non-plussed Nelson with an entire chorus played by Marsalis on an unbroken single note!<br /><br />Wynton Marsalis has always impressed me as a spokesperson for the music as well as a virtuoso, \\"impressive\\" player, though rarely \\"connecting\\" with the serious jazz listener as could Pops, Diz, Clifford, Lee Morgan, Jack Sheldon or Miles (or a Fats Navarro, Kenny Dorham or Bill Hardman).  But Wynton is right for this one. He explores the full range of his custom-made Monet trumpet, including its \\"vocalizing\\" capability, and, equally importantly, knows when \\"not\\" to play.  The two performers strike a near-perfect balance in what is rightly billed as a joint session (though Willie appears to have been insufficiently briefed about his musical partner when he credits Wynton \\"Marsaylus\\" at the end of the program).  I can honestly say that I've never appreciated either musician as much as on this occasion.when \\"not\\" to play.

B00006F2TV|5.0|I remember when this movie first came out I was somewhat skeptical about seeing it but I finally gave in and was surprised of how good it was and how faithful it was to the comic book. The story itself is basically how Spider-man came to be. On a field trip Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) gets bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers from the bite. He not only has to struggle with making ends meet he has to struggle with a destructive lunatic called Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe)and also revealing his true feelings about his long-time friend, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst).<br /><br />This movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J.K. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately. The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily. My only gripe is I could do without the weak one-liners that appear once and awhile in the movie. All in all fans of the comic book as well as the cartoon series wont be disappointed.
B00005JM0B|5.0|For all those people who say that there's no plot - go back and watch the film properly. There is a good story which culminates in the very last scene.  The gags weren't half as bad as I expected them to be and those little moments of comic relief were necessary, 'cause the rest of the film was pretty damn serious.  It's a very good continuation of the Terminator story and it's a brilliant movie when you keep in mind that it's part 3!  Yes, this film is a bit different. Not that much different. Did I miss Linda Hamilton? No. Did I miss Edward Furlong? Hell, no! Did I miss James Cameron? - Hm, there's a certain emotional factor that Cameron would have inserted during the whole film, instead of just the ending.  Anyway, especially for a follow up of an all time classic, I will give it 10 / 10 stars.  There's one major plot hole ... but you can ignore that easily.  Go watch it.  Btw. the chase scenes are better than the one in the Matrix. Here, things get crushed for real. A lot. :)  My 2003 cents.

First, Juliet is trying to find a topic for a book not having any luck, when one day an unknown gentleman writes her a letter because her name and address are in a favorite book of his.

The characters are so charming and it's such a wonderful story. Highly recommend!
0385338082|5.0|As usual, Sophie Kinsella delights her fans with a lively story of a girl after our own hearts.  Like Becky Bloomwood (Shopaholic), Emma Corrigan is a pure delight as she fumbles and frets over her decisions, especially when on a plane flight where she experiences heavy turbulence - Emma's not a happy flyer - she freaks and turns to the stranger sitting next to her and reveals all of her deepest secrets.  She is so relieved when the plane finally lands safely and although a little embarrassed about her confessions, she's figures he's a stranger and she'll never see him again, so what's the harm, right?  Well, next thing you know, once Emma's back at work, she eventually discovers that her airplane seatmate is none other than Jack Harper, her company's founder and he's in town and (gulp!) he remembers her and everything she told him!  That's when the fun starts!<br /><br />Emma tries to find ways to avoid Jack at work, but he always seems to find her and learns that a lot of the secrets that she shared with him are in fact, about some of her coworkers.  Emma's been in the running for a promotion for the longest and she tries hard to save face, but Kinsella keeps us in stitches as Emma is exposed again and again - her secrets even find their way on TV!<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, coincidentally, while on a flight and although I did experience a little turbulence, I didn't reveal any of my secrets to the person sitting next to me - then again, I was sitting next to my sister, and she already knows my secrets, or almost all of them!<br /><br />The other characters in this story add weight and dimension to this funny tale.  From her co-workers to her parents, to her roommates, Kinsella adds depth to the story and entertains readers with the details of the characters' charming idiosyncrasies that are so much like our own, yet she finds the right situations to pair them with and the combination is hilarious!  This is chick lit at its best and a fast read that readers will love - highly recommended!ended!

I will use Amazon in the future just as I have in the past and just recently.  I would recommend your service and also the cd to anyone.

B001BKXUOQ|5.0|The new slipknot album is amazing. Im going to be honest i new the cd would be good, but i didn't realize it would be this good. The problem with bands today is they have a first hit cd and they quickly go down hill on each cd they put out after that. Slipknots only get better. This cd was well put together as a whole. Each song has something a little different about it and still harder than ever. Much more musical talent, and less confusion. They have gotten so much better as a band and by the way they work and put music together. You can hear more of Corey Taylors smoother vocals which i think helps and gives it some variety. He has a great voice. Can't wait for the next one and the next Stone Sour. Keep rocking.   P.S. Corey Taylor if you ever read this put out a solo album just so you can do a bunch of songs like Snuff, Zzyzx Rd., Bother, Vermilion Pt. 2, and Through Glass. Im a fan of the softer stuff. Come to Tallahassee, Florida!

031606792X|3.0|Despite my reservations with this series as a whole thus far, I quite enjoyed the first half of this book...the first part as told by Bella and the following section told by Jacob. This part told by Jacob had to be the most interesting in the entire series, and I think the werewolves should be considered as the basis of future Meyer series. My biggest problems with the series to this point, has been the fact that what Bella and Edward has seems to be more obsession than true love.  There has been nothing through the series to illistrate exactly what made them fall for each other, OTHER than the 'omigod he looks stony perfection' and 'ah,my dear clumsy Bella, my love' and I just don't get it.  Then there is the fact that along the way Edward does some things that harbor on abusive/controlling and Bella says 'its okay cause he is doing it all cause he Lurves me'.  Worse, she is willing to throw away her life, and her humanity for this vampire.  She has no dreams, no hobbies, no aspirations of further education or a career.  These books bring to the forefront the idea that all a woman needs in life is a man to take care of her.  Ok, I am off my soapbox.  Breaking Dawn was interesting throughout.  As I said, I was completely drawn into Bella's wedding, her honeymoon, and all that.  I especially found Jacob's story including his challenge to the pack and its subsequent consequences thrilling.  I am more than willing to agree that Stephanie Meyer can create an intriguing story across the pages.  Things turned sour with me as the story raced to its conclusion.  The whole imprinting part turned me off, even though I had read a spoiler earlier and knew that part was coming.  I thought it would be ok, but it wasn't.  They spent too much time in the book reinforcing the idea that it wasn't a creepy thing, but come on...it is.  I didn't care for the object of Jacob's imprinting either, although I wanted to.  I think, in just this case, it would almost have been better for her to be more human than vampire.  Although characters in the book were won over by her, I just never was.  Then, the worst yet.  The finale..the big confrontation.  It was anti-climactic.  All of the planning and tension and it melted down to near nothing.  Although it can be unpopular with fans, I have a great admiration for an author who can kill off a supporting or reoccuring character because in the end, it makes the story stronger.  It makes the other characters stronger..(nods to Kim Harrison, here)  In four novels, filled to brim with danger and paranormal elements, not one supporting character is sacrificed.  I find that just plain unrealistic.  I read recently someone said that even in sci-fi or paranormal stories, the inner threads have to remain consistant so that things feel realistic to readers.  This book fails here.  The relationship between Jacob and Bella changed to such a degree and so immediately it felt unreal also.  I'm not sorry I read these books, and I'm sure I'll see the movies, but I have to question what this could have turned out if Meyer had been more faithful to her own story and characters.o be more human than vampire.

I don't want to give anything away, but I liked the way her past,(Bones) and her new life,(FBI team) came together. I thought it was really cool, especially the end.  It's an excellent book- five stars!  I can't recommend it enough!  (Though you should read Book 1 first, to get to know the characters and better understand what's going on.)
031606792X|4.0|I loved most of it. I had a little problem with the s-e-x, not because it was graphic - it wasn't. It was only alluded too. It was just...unexpected. One of the ways I \\"handsell\\" these books to parents is the absence of sex. So many young adult books have it - which isn't bad - unless it's gratuitous. But these appeal to avid readers who are a little younger - say 5th grade and up - so I was surprised and a little grossed out!<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the writing from Jacob's point of view. It helped me to picture him more clearly, and I was already a Jacob fan! It was funny and thoughtful and surprising. Even the chapter titles were funny: Waiting for the damn fight to start already, Some people just don't grasp the concept of unwelcome - I mean,you can tell Stephenie Meyer was enjoying herself. And I loved the end of that part...<br /><br />Throughout the book, I felt that we got to know more about Edward's family and I wish there was a part from his perspective. I can't wait for Midnight Sun to come out.<br /><br />All in all - I loved this book and can't wait to read it again..and again!
B001BGTWXI|1.0|I am not a hard core Slipknot fan. I have only been to a few of their concerts and pushed/beaten my way to the front.    I felt like what they did with Vol 3 was a step in the right direction and that they would evolve. In my mind, I was thinking they'd have an album that  would combine and CUBE what they've already accomplished. Beautiful, brutal, complex, progressive...    Unfortunately, they retread common \\"metal\\" territory. If you want to be \\"anti-establishment\\" and show how \\"different\\" you are, but listen to top 40 rock radio, this album is for you.    I am praying to the gods of metal that there is some juicy material buried in the mix or that comes out when played in reverse. If not, this album is a complete waste to me. I should have bought...just about anything else!!
B00003CXA6|4.0|I love this movie to death, in spite of all the flaws mentioned in the reviews found herein.  I personally feel we're lucky the producer made this film at all, and that it turned out as well as it did.  But I will not dwell on the movie content, and focus instead on a technical point that keeps me from giving this DVD 5 stars.  While the DVD picture is superb compared to the washed-out look of the VHS tape, the audio has been re-mastered, and in the new soundtrack the former bold crack of the guns is now quite muddy and muted.  The original VHS soundtrack is still available on the DVD as an option, but this is only useful if you speak French.  I much prefer the original VHS mix myself, and believe a 5-star DVD should give viewers a choice of soundtracks - all of of which would be in their own language.  While I will definitely keep this DVD in my collection, I have also purchased a back-up set of tapes for the long-haul.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|OMG please go buy this movie and support it so we can get a Serenity 2. I blame myself for being a dumbass for not watching this movie/firefly series sooner.  When I initially saw this series I was like \\"Space cowboys? What a dumb idea I am not watching this corny crap.\\"  2008 and I finally watched Firefly for the first time and I was blown away. The acting, the special effects and stories was excellent.  I watched the entire series straight and rushed out to get the dvd.  Holy crap!!! One of the best Sci-fi movies ever!!!  It's because of stupid people like me that the movie didn't do well at the box office.<br />I am sad that there are not more episodes of Firefly, it should have gone down as one of the best TV series of all time, if only more people gave it a chance, but I have noone to blame but myself.  Please, give the series a chance and you will feel the same way as I do.

B0017ZB8M6|5.0|When I first heard Katy's first single, I wasn't all that into it. A couple months later, the song was finally stuck in my head and I listened to the cd on Amazon to see if it was good or not. Then, on a whim I bought it--and I defnitely don't regret it! This debut album is simply fantastic and much more original than what has been coming out. From what I have listened to on the cd, Katy has a sharp, creative tongue and doesn't hold back for anyone. She starts out with the incredibly strong song, \\"One of the Boys,\\" about being just another friend to the guy she loves, and ends with the incredibly inspirational song \\"Fingerprints,\\" which is about doing your part to make history in some way. While there are a lot of cracks about \\"I Kissed a Girl,\\" Katy is a truly great performer and her cd is much, much better than her hot single. She is definitely worth checking out and I hope she has staying power--we need more music like hers!

1400032717|5.0|Author Mark Haddon has created a realistic fictional autistic teen with an amazing way of describing the life and people that surround him. But what I love most about the book is how much the main character, 15-year-old Christopher, reminds me of my son Nigel (aside from the fact that Christopher is incredibly good at math, and Nigel is at the opposite end of that spectrum). I love experiencing Christopher's usually detached observation, his mannerisms that are so close to home for me. I could identify with the intense love coupled with the equally intense frustration that his father feels raising him alone. When I read Christopher's thought processes (portrayed so well by Haddon), I recognize what my son has been able to convey to me about his own.<br /><br />I love reading about Christopher's determination to do things himself, and his love of animals is touching and also familiar, as are his attempts to understand the complexities of emotions and his need to always give the exact minute when telling time. He tries hard to manage his sensory issues and asks people for help when he needs it. He is persistent about the things that are important to him, like taking a high-level math test, and being a detective.<br /><br />I won't say anything about the plot of the book because it is so captivating; the only way to appreciate it is to read it and experience it yourself. And besides, it is a mystery. I wouldn't want to spoil it. Christopher points out at the beginning, \\"This is a murder mystery novel,\\" and in trying to solve it, he discovers another one that changes everything. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is tender, moving, and beautifully written. It's also a quick read, which is good in a way, because you'll want to read it again and again.

The writing<br />is so bogged down with self-declarations, think-alouds, ruminations,<br />and personal \\"isms\\" belonging the character and her husband that I<br />couldn't stay interested to save my life. Added to this was King's cursory<br />lapses into catatonic detail mode in which every detail of every dust fleck<br />that lands amongst the characters is exposed and analyzed. The book<br />needed some serious editing before going to final press. Long story short,<br />I cut Lisey's Story short and left it at the pool side cabana. It's not a quick<br />read by any means, and not a book for those individuals whose time is<br />precious.
0385341075|1.0|Perhaps, in some way, this could be considered good literature. But, there is one thing it certainly ISN'T, and that is interesting. It's also not \\"sheer magic,\\" as the back of the book attests. Be wary.
0517147688|3.0|I have one problem with this book.  It smells like it has been in storage for many years. I don't know how to get rid of the odor.  I am hoping that by leaving it out of the bookshelf and open that the odor will disappear in time.  If anyone has a suggestion, I would sure like it.<br />The book itself is very nice.  I thought if I sent it back, there would be no guarantee that a replacement would not smell the same.  I noted that the book was printed in CHINA!
1595141715|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Using dual narratives to tell Hannah's story (why she committed suicide) and Clay's reaction to her reasons for committing suicide keeps the reader intimately and immediately involved throughout the novel.  The importance of our words and actions becomes painfully clear as Hannah becomes submerged in a quagmire of rumor and betrayals which lead her to feel there is no other way out.  This is a powerful read for all ages!

B000KX0IOK|3.0|Inner city teacher uses creative methods to engage his students on issues of history and social change, all the while nursing a hefty drug habit.  In the process, he strikes up a friendship with Drey, a young black girl who is one of his students.  She carries with her the \\"secret\\" of his drug use.    \\"Half Nelson\\" is a gritty movie, bordering at times on a documentary.  Ryan Gosling gives a superb performance of the drugged out teacher.      Tidy resolutions elude the movie in this slightly depressing but powerful tale.
B001AX60KU|1.0|I have been a Elvis fan since 1962 and have seen RCA make one blunder after another and this collection is no exception.  When I first saw the song selection, my immediate reaction was this is definitely not complete.  No where to be found is take after take of the production numbers.  Elvis was a perfectionist and as usual did take after take to get it right.  I bought the set anyway because I buy anything RCA puts out.  I am that devoted of a fan.  When I listen to disc 1, I thought to myself that the original album probably left off \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\" due to limited space on a record but there is more than enough space on a CD.  To call it \\"complete\\" there should be nothing in the TV special that is not included on the CD.
031606792X|1.0|I read this book knowing that it would be terrible. The first three books of the series were terribly written, but quite entertaining. This book, however, was not only badly written, but ridiculously stupid. I strongly urge anyone thinking of reading/buying this book to NOT. Buy something worth while, like Austen, Faulkner, or someone along those lines. This book is not worth the time or money.

Totally looks like she illegally burned these disks.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Ms. Beatrix Potter is a child of privilege in England at the turn of the century.   As such, her role in life is to find an eligible man-that meets to approval of her social climbing mother and to marry.  Renee Zelwigger's charming and sensitive portrayal makes you want to cheer her lovingly rebellious nature.    Beatrix  rejects all suitors brought to her and instead concentrates on her passion...  drawing and stories based upon the animal creatures who she has created from her experiences in the country and her whimsical sense of humor.    Despite her mother's objections, Miss Potter seeks and finds a publisher for her first book.  The publishers, a dour pair of brothers, see it as a way to dissuade their youngest brother from his desire to join the business.  His failure at publishing, and they firmly believe the book will fail, will send him back to be a companion for their aging mother.  This will please both the mother and the older brothers.    Instead, the youngest brother, played most charmingly by Ewan McGregor, helps her to bring to book about a naughty young rabbit to print and a most successful sales record.      While working to publish other of her stories, the couple falls in love.  From this point, I hope I have interested you enough that you will want to view this movie for yourself.      Let me just finish by saying, this woman for whom society had one plan, by her strength of character and and purpose, followed her own plan and left a legacy of some of the most beloved children's stories, and from the profits made, save a charming part of the English landscape for all posterity.

It certainly has its moments, however, the real prize here is the 12 minute live distillation, from N.Y 1978. This has all of the essential moments from the album, seamlessly joined, and, played with no little abandon. This one rocks.
0316143472|5.0|This is just another example of the brilliance of David Sedaris.  Now, not as ordinary in his lifestyle, David embarks on new adventures that most people would care to forget or just let pass into obscurity. His style and sincerity remain the same.  Go David. This book needs to be read twice in succession. Once to injest the initial shock, again to savor all the wit and irony of everyday stories being turned into hysterical anectdotes.

0375836675|5.0|Between working as a cabdriver, playing cards with his friends, and taking care of his coffee drinking dog, Ed's life is anything but stimulating.  When Ed foils a bank robbery everything changes and the first mystrious message arrives in the mail.  Ed's adventure begins; delivering messages that he must himself learn, to people he has never met.  In doing this, his view of the world changes forever, and he learns more about his friends and family than he could have thought there was to know.     Originally I read I am the Messenger because of how much I liked The Book Thief (written by the same author) but the story kept me going all on its own.  From the start I was hooked on I am the Messenger.  The narration by Ed leaves little room for improvement and the story kept me guessing until the end.  The book shows you that even people who think they have very few talents and lead very unexceptional of lives can make a big difference in the lives of others -- just by caring enough to do so.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|Jason Statham got an excellent part in this one.  I thought it was a very good movie.  The fact that it was based on a true story added to the heist being an intense one.  If your attention started to lag (it did not) Saffron Burrows was there to pick it up.  If you like Statham, buy it.  If you don't, rent it.  Definitely worth your time.

Gerber's tips, knowledge and methods will surely lead Entrepreneurs into a better understanding of how business works, what is needed to be done and how to do it.    Since I started reading the book I started using a highlighter to mark what I considered was interesting and finally noticed I would have had to highlight it at all since all the pages have 100% valuable information for all of us trying to make our business successful.

031606792X|4.0|Not to get all John Motson on you here, (I'm female, 31 and I hate footie...) but this book was, for me, a nail-biting final where I was supporting a team I really, REALLY wanted to win. That team being Stephenie Meyer.    Meyer said this book was written the way she wanted, so fair play to her. After all, it's her story and she's shown that she is a brilliant writer. The fact that I read it straight through in eight hours, and enjoyed every minute means I'm giving it four stars.    BUT... and there is a but. And I'm not the target demographic for this kind of teen fiction, BUT this book was written in a more mature style than I anticipated... Meyer's a God-fearing type o' gal, so I was resigned to the fact that Edward would not be getting any action. How wrong was I?! And to top it off, they have a BABY?? Didn't see that one coming. And then they call her Nessie. Lord help us all.    I don't mind any of this stuff, being a grown-up. I just don't think the average 10 year old will get much out of it (apart from asking some confusing 'vampire biology' questions).    And then there's the fact that nobody dies... (apart from a character that we meet for all of ten pages) And guess what, everything's just peachy keen at the end. I love a happy ending just as much as the next person, but after all the trauma, trials and tribulations that the main characters had been through, I was just expecting a teeny bit of tragedy to balance everything out.    However, The Twilight saga has brought me a huge amount of entertainment and anticipation over the years, so I'd just like to say that I'm glad my team won... on penalties.
B001EL6EH2|5.0|Casablanca is undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time. It is simply a fantastic movie. It holds many prestigious ranks among critics and movie goers. It was awarded the position of number 3 as the greatest movie of all time for the American Film Institute. It is on the top 250 on IMDB.com, it also won the academy award for best picture and probably on the favorite list of anyone who knows what a real movie is. It is the true benchmark film for all love stories with an all star cast. It's about lost love being rekindled in the time of World War II when the Nazi's controlled most of Europe. Rick a popular American night club owner who is not particulary on anyone's side. His former lover comes into his night club with a husband who is a freedom fighter escaping from the nazis. They need passage to get out Casablanca which is not an easy task because most people there are stuck and can't leave because it is hard and dangerous to get a plane to come to Casablanca for aid. Rick just happens to have special transit papers that cannot be recinded and now must decide to let the woman he loved slip through his fingers again or be with her forever. I would recommend this film to anybody because it is just a masterpeice. BUY IT!

B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins was such a relief for Batman fans. Finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction. This one is definitely the 2nd best Batman movie to date.. and I say that because The Dark Knight was just so damn good. Even if you're not a \\"superhero\\" movie fan, you'll like this one. This takes away the \\"supernatural/superhero\\" aspects of other comic movies, and turns it more realistic. Highly Recommend.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|I bought this movie after hearing the soundtrack which grabbed me by the throat and wouldn't let go. This is the story of how Batman became who he is. It was action-packed, well acted and very entertaining. The process by which Batman created himself with special effects and psychology is intriguing.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Hats off to KWS and all the people involved in making this tribute cd happen. I bought this with good, but not great expectations. Happy to say, I was blown away after 1 go-through.     Watched the DVD first, and as many other reviewers have said, it alone is EASILY worth the price of admission. It was a very professionally done performance documentary and one I'll certainly view again. Listening to the audio cd always makes me think of the performer segments from the documentary.     Again, I couldn't be happier with this set. KWS is to be commended for paying tribute to these older, and largely ignored musicians. They still have so much to offer, and their music blows away any of the garbage found on the radio.    Way to go Kenny! Any possibility of a Volume 2?
0930289234|5.0|I was originally suggested to read this by a teacher of mine, and I was a bit hesitant due to the medium. After reading through it the first time I became more and more aware of how intricate and how well thought out the story truly is. It is without a shadow of a doubt a masterpiece of literature. The story is enthralling, captivating, and alluring. There is so much said in the comic panels themselves, each with a subtle touch that speaks about the issues beyond what is described by the words.
006113399X|4.0|The Redbreast is an exceptionally well-crafted and atmospsheric novel weaving the skein of two storylines together, one concerning Norwegians who joined the Waffen SS in WWII and fought on the Eastern Front believing they were defending their country from Soviet annexation, and the other a murder mystery involving neo-Nazi's in modern Oslo. The contemporary murder is investigated by Norwegian Police Inspector Harry Hole and the puzzling case begins to lead Harry into a dark era of Norwegian history and he finds that to solve the mystery in the present he must first solve a baffling mystery from WWII. The author, Jo Nesbo, makes stunningly good use of his plot to show that the past is much more complicated and complex than it is often presented later and personal ethical, moral, and political choices in a confused time can lead righteous men in different directions.<br /><br />I was extremely excited to get this book after reading the blurb on Amazon. A murder mystery, set partially in modern Norway (a beautiful country I would love to visit) and partially on the Eastern front during WWII, covering both real Nazis and neo-Nazis, seemed like it could be a great read. I haven't been as excited to get a book by a new author in a long time actually. When I received the book and read the dust cover I got even more excited...apparently this book was voted \\"the best Norwegian crime novel EVER\\". As if that were not enough, apparently Jo Nesbo is a well-regarded pop music talent in Europe with several top ten hits and is also an economist. My wife noted that he was also exceptionally good-looking. I decided, with a little effort, to not hold all of this spectacular over-achievement against Nesbo, and just try to enjoy the book. I jumped Redbreast to the front of the crowded reading queue and got started.<br /><br />Before I venture into my thoughts on this novel let me preface my comments by saying that this is an exceptionally good book and I very much liked it. There several items which as I was reading struck me as noteworthy and which I believe are worth sharing here. These are not meant to be negatives, just observations that interested me.<br /><br />The first hundred pages were slow going and I wasn't gaining much traction. There was nothing wrong with the writing but the story wasn't immediately engaging. After you cross that first hundred page barrier though the story picks up steam and becomes riveting. There were a few  things about the book which could be a little off-putting but I think they are understandable in context. There is some dialogue that can seem odd, but I'm sure that it has to do with difficulties in translating from Norwegian. There are always unique cultural thought processes and manners of expression which do not smoothly translate from one language to another. These odd bits are noticeable but they do not detract from the story. Actually they made me pay more attention. There is much less character development of the protagonist, Harry Hole, than I would have expected. In thinking about the book I believe it is for two reasons. Nesbo has written seven books which feature Harry Hole. This is the third in the series but the first two haven't been translated yet. I wish they had been because I would have preferred to start at the beginning, and not having the background from the first two novels does make it harder to figure Harry out and to identify with his character. You do get there, but it takes much longer when you are essentially dropped into the middle of his life-story without any context. I'm reasonably sure the missing character development can be found in the first two books. The other reason there may have been less character development of Harry is that significant chunks of the book are about other protagonists. Another item which struck me was that if the reader is paying attention they will solve the mystery about 90% of the way through the book, but it takes Harry a little longer. There wasnothing particularly wrong with this, it's just that in my experience the reader either gets to understand the mystery from near the beginning and then we cheer the protagonist on as they fit the pieces together, or its the other way round, the protagonist fits the pieces together for us and all is revealed to the reader by the competent sleuth at the denouement. I actually kind of liked struggling with Harry to solve the baffling mystery and getting there just a little ahead of him. It was just that I felt this was unusual enough to be worth noting, perhaps an approach unique to Nesbo or perhaps something we'll see more of in the future from other writers. One last unusual item, especially since some readers may be bothered by it, was that there was a tangetial murder that was not solved and a bad guy who was not nabbed. Perhaps this will be revisited in one of the succeeding Harry Hole novels when they are translated, or perhaps this is Nesbo realism. You can't catch all the bad guys all the time.<br /><br />As I said, the foregoing are not meant to be negatives. I found the book to be thoroughly enjoyable after the first one hundred pages of set-up. The mystery, which bounces back and forth from WWII to the present was a truly excellent one that will leave you baffled and then thoroughly satisfied once the pieces fall into place. In fact, I think the mystery was handled exceptionally well. Although it didn't start this way, this novel did develop into one of those books that you don't want to put down. There was also one particular scene in the book which spiked my tension and stress levels way past any other reading experiences lately and I admired the skill with which Nesbo crafted that scene. I found myself wanting to shout warnings out loud to the character...that is some pretty strong writing when you become so involved you start to talk to the characters in the book! All in all, while I don't know if this is the best crime book ever from Norway, it is still a very fine crime book indeed and I will definitely be reading anything by Nesbo I can get. In fact, I think the biggest weakness of this book was simply the lack of preparatory Harry Hole novels. I hope they translate them soon.rong with this, it's just that in my experience the reader either gets to understand the mystery from near the beginning and then we cheer the protagonist on as they fit the pieces together, or its the other way round, the protagonist fits the pieces together for us and all is revealed to the reader by the competent sleuth at the denouement.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|The HBO series on John Adams is outstanding.  Perfectly cast, beautifully researched and produced, it tells the compelling story of the plain-speaking, plain-living New England farmer who was one of the key driving forces behind the American Revolution, without whom it might never even have occurred.  John Adams, the second president of the United States, has been a mostly unsung hero of the American Revolution.  It is high time that he got the credit he deserved for his role in the founding of the American nation. Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney and crew bring Adams and his co-revolutionaries to life and make us love them for what they were: human beings of exceptional bravery, intelligence and integrity.  And it's a great drama as well.      Having said that, however, the hype about the painstaking detail to historical accuracy needs to be taken with some salt. The producers may have gotten the buttons and the chairs right, but they did take liberties with the known facts about Adams' life and work. He is portrayed as a bumbling idiot in France who can't speak French and so must depend on Benjamin Franklin to communicate. In fact, Adams spoke French better than Franklin and was commended by the King of France for his prudence and wisdom. The Adamses didn't leave their children behind when they went to live in Europe - they came along. Nabby didn't meet William Smith on her father's return from Europe; she met him there. Smith was very much the author of his own downfall and an appallingly bad husband. He was not the victim of a jealouse father-in-law as insinuated. And so and and so forth. But overall, the series gives a fair portrait of Adams' life, personality, and contributions to the founding of the nation.    This series should be made part of the curriculum of US history classes from now on, with the caveat that it serve as a basis of discussion, not as pristine historical fact, and that it be accompanied by a discussion of what actually happened where fiction diverges from reality. The entire nation owes Tom Hanks and his crew a debt of gratitude for finally bringing to light some hidden truths about the men who created the United States.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Please don't be put off by the title.  After you`ve seen \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space,\\" you'll understand why it is a cult classic.  A dark comedy, this film is both humorous and terrifying, and there are scenes that are simply grotesque.  Many people are afraid of clowns and this movie will only reinforce that fear.  Hollywood has capitalized on this fear by making numerous movies where the killer was a clown.  The alien creature in Stephen King's \\"It\\" assumed the appearance of a clown.  The maniac in \\"House on Sorority Row\\" was obsessed with striped balls, jack in the boxes, and clowns; he even masquerades as a clown.<br /><br />  The theory purposed by \\"Killer Klowns\\" is that these aliens visited our world many years before and hence were the basis for our modern circus clowns.  A theory that is both silly and grotesque along with many other elements of the film.  Citizens of a small community are encased in pink cocoons that resemble cotton candy, but it is an acidic substance that dissolves flesh into a liquid that can be slurped through a straw.  These clowns remind me of spiders that wrap their victims in webs and then liquefy their organs so they may be sucked through a straw-like proboscis.  This should have been emphasized in the movie.<br /><br />  \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\" has an extremely high body count.  (An entire town is practically depopulated.)  There are numerous - and grotesque - death scenes.  This movie was released towards the end of the famed slasher frenzy that dominated the eighties.  In fact, it serves as a great parody for both slasher and invasion films.  I highly recommend it for hard core fans of horror, like myself, and fans of the slasher frenzy era.
B000H5TVO4|5.0|A fun romp through most of their hits, this collection unfortunately shortchanges much of their later work in favor of their early successes. This makes sense in a way, especially for U.S. audiences who may have checked out after \\"Crash! Boom! Bang\\" and aren't familiar with their later albums, especially since you could only buy those as imports. But for the world at large, who kept up with the Swedish duo, there are simply too many singles to fit on one disc (hence the Ballad and Pop Hits compilatons they released a few years back). Yes, it's called \\"20 Greatest Songs\\", but what constitutes that is up for debate. In my opinion, this works best for newbies and those U.S fans who only want the songs they remember and a few they don't. As for the new cuts, they're nice but not up there with the best of Roxette.

While spending a summer holiday in Barcelona, Vicky and Christina are given a \\"best offer\\" from Juan Antonio (the dreamy Javier Badem), to fly away for the weekend. Vicky is hostile to his offer-she knows what she wants-a drama free relationship with her fiancee. Christina finds the offer and the man interesting and states her desire to go. To protect her friend, Vicky goes along for the ride, but finds herself caught in the undertow of love and succumbs unexpectedly to Juan Antonio's gentle seduction.<br /><br />The three return to Barcelona and Vicky returns to her work and her plans for marriage. Christina begins a relationship with Juan Antonio. Juan's ex-wife, Maria Elena (the gorgeous Penelope Cruz) tries to kill herself and Juan tells Christina they have to take care of her until she gets on her feet. Oddly, the ethereal Christina acts like a salve in the tumultuous relationship between Maria Elena and Juan Antonio. The three of them fall in love and life is going along swimmingly until Vicky begins to feel a familar desire-one which Maria Elena correctly labels \\"perpetual discontent\\" in an emotional tearful moment.<br /><br />In the meantime, Vicky continues to yearn for Juan Antonio, and her discontented Aunt schemes to set the two up. They meet for a seductive lunch, but seduction is in the head as much as the heart and taking from an earlier scene where Christina tells Juan Antonio that he shouldn't blow it with with something small-the wrong pair of shorts for example, he blows the seduction of Vicky completely with the wrong kind of life-a life of drama which the staid Vicky can not really imagine being a part of.<br /><br />This film has it's problems. First and foremost, Christopher Evan Welch talks over some of the scenes-almost like he was presenting script direction, \\"Vicky felt x, while Christina felt...\\". I'm a fan of \\"show, don't tell\\" and would have preferred to \\"get it\\" on my own.  With this style of presentation, Allen feels a bit controlling, as if he's going to tell his audience his message because we're too dumb to infer it on our own.  But whatever the problems with Vicky Cristina Barcelona, I loved it. I love Allens exploration of culture. I saw Annie Hall when I was five and I've been intrigued with Allens brand of dysfuction ever since.<br /><br />Vicky Christina Barcelona is a gorgeous film, you'll enjoy the background shots of La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. Like earlier Allen films [[ASIN:0792846109 Manhattan]] or [[ASIN:6304907729 Annie Hall]] where New York goes a long way in effecting the psyche and neurosis of the characters-Barcelona and the charm of the spanish country side disenchant Vicky and Christina with the lives they are living back in the States. Setting is never just a backdrop in an Allen film.<br /><br />A great film with gorgeous actors and a contemplative script. Worth seeing.<br /><br />If you enjoy Vicky Cristina Barcelona, I'd recommend [[ASIN:B0011NVC8Y Margot at the Wedding]], [[ASIN:B000X418V8 Eagle vs. Shark]], [[ASIN:B0004Z310M The Housekeeper]] and all of the Pedro Almodovar films, particularly [[ASIN:0767847105 All About My Mother] and [[ASIN:B00005JLQW Talk to Her (Hable con Ella)]].ristopher Evan Welch talks over some of the scenes-almost like he was presenting script direction, \\"Vicky felt x, while Christina felt...\\".

B000UNYJXQ|2.0|Please don't get me wrong. I agree with Moore's points 100% regarding the state of health insurance and the power pharma companies exploitat in the United States. As a matter of fact I agree with pretty much all of his points he makes in whatever TV show or documentary he's entertaining us with. Unfortunately he often bends the truth a bit too much to make for a believable case and Sicko is no different.<br /><br />Moore is once again far fetching with some of his evidence. I grew up in Western Europe. And if you think that the French middle class couple portrayed in the documentary is your typical French family you might want to dig a bit deeper. I suggest you look into why cars were burning in a dozen French cities two years ago and you will find out about the turmoils France is really going through in terms of \\"social well being for all\\". It isn't by far the pretty picture Moore is painting here.<br /><br />As for the health care system in Great Britain: It has been for decades the laughing stock of other Western European nations. Why? Because it is an absolute disaster and has been for as long as I can remember. The British governement has been struggling for many years in revamping its system. It certainly isn't plagued by the idiosynchracies and corporate power plays the US health care is going through. But once again, you're better off not believeing that you're going to get better health care by moving to London.<br /><br />I'm giving Moore 2 stars for raising an issue that needs more attention however as someone who condones objective documentarians instead of propaganda I am reluctant to give Sicko more. Sorry, Mike.
031606792X|5.0|This book was truely amazing. It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. This book was NOTHING that I expected, but I am happy it turned out this way. I love this book to death. I am extremely sad the saga is over (except for the book from edwards point of view), but it was a great ending to the perfect love story.     SPOILER    Life may never turn out like this, in a neat little bow. But happy ending aren't always possible in our lives and we deserve to have our perfect and maybe unrealistic happily ever afters in books. Who wants to read a book where nothing good comes of it, that's just depressing.
1400095204|5.0|I am not sure how I wound up reading this book, but this author is absolutely amazing.  This book grabs hold of you even before the first page.  The title alone made me curious.  I could not put this book down and I didn't want it to end.  I could feel the emotion written on every page of this book and I felt like I was actually living in Nigeria during this time.  The characters, their dreams, their happiness and their heartache all felt so real.  I thought the storyline flowed incredibly well.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.  She has a rare gift and I don't understand how anyone could rate this book less than stellar.
B000002P2V|5.0|If you really listen to this CD/Album (in the old days), there are some hidden gems! I still remember the news about Keith Moon and wondering what are the Who going to do? They have a great new album out and no  drummer.    New Song, Guitar & Pen, Trick of the Light and Music Must Change are all  great, along with the John Entwistle's songs!    Pick it up you won't be disappointed!!!
B001BGTWXI|5.0|All Hope is Gone is as good or better then Slipknot's self titled album.  While the raw passion and head slamming riffs and beats still permeate through the album, the maturity of the music indicates a clear progression of Slipknot's growth as artists.  It may be an album that is being more accepted into the mainstream but is that really a bad thing?  I think it's about time that more people can see Slipknot, not just as crazy headbangers with scary masks, but as the gifted artists that they are.  And as far as the comparisons to Stone Sour go, don't you think of Slipknot when you listen to Stone Sour?  I'd say we're pretty lucky that Cory and Jim are such diverse and prolific song writers.    All in all, Great Album.  A must buy if you like Slipknot or enjoy well crafted, hard hitting metal.
B00065MDSG|5.0|I've had the first King Crimson album for quite some time now, and I've always been a fan of theirs. This album, their sixth, released in 1972, is my new favorite. Can you imagine? Six albums over three to four years? Nobody does that these days, nobody! And don't even get me started with the Beatles! This is about \\"Crim\\", although I admit I love the Beatles as well... I'm still trying to figure out \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part I\\" on my guitar, and it's quite challenging! In the words of Sean Penn's character in \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\": \\"Awesome! Totally awesome!!\\" Does anyone know of any available transcriptions of their music?
B00005JNJV|5.0|I got this product for my father and he was very content. It was all he wanted for his birthday--well, except a Triumph TT of course--and he was going through a batman craze after seeing \\"The Dark Knight.\\"     Nothing to criticize.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|For two years I had only albums \\"Smash\\" through \\"Splinter\\" and thought that was all that Offspring encompassed. With the release of this new album, I am delighted to be proven wrong.    There has been much improvement all around. Dexter's singing is better and brighter, and he throws away fewer of the words (something he has done on earlier albums). It's well-arranged and organized, the lyrics are well-planned, and there is so much joy in this album. In their five-year absence from the studio, the talent has not worn away. Gone are the cynic tones of \\"Americana\\"; the dark lyrics of \\"Conspiracy\\"; the experimental colouring of \\"Splinter\\". It is not another \\"Ixnay\\" or \\"Smash\\", but it is nonetheless enjoyable for that.    Songs like \\"Hammerhead\\" and \\"Half-Truism\\" are very energetic and lively; \\"Nothingtown\\" is very entertaining, \\"Stuff is Messed Up\\" has a sudden burst of lyrics at breakneck pace, and the ballad number \\"Kristy, are you doing okay?\\" is quite nice.     But on occasion, they seem to be looking backward in their career. This is most obvious in \\"Trust in You\\", where the chordal and melodic pattern is very similar (if not identical) to the song \\"Smash\\", an early success. Yeah, there's some sillyness on the album, but it's all very enjoyable. And it is 13 minutes longer than \\"Splinter\\", which is great. Much more to enjoy. The book of words is also well-designed, although I would have kept the words for \\"Half-Truism\\" in an order that can be followed, and not put the lyrics of \\"You're gonna go far, kid\\" in that box that has to be turned every which way to be read - especially in dark green against a black background, which is hard on the eyes! Beyond these little flaws, it is an excellent album and I'm happy to own a copy.
B0012Q732O|2.0|[[ASIN:B0012Q732O 10,000 B.C.]] was a movie I looked forward to for a long time.  I really had high hopes for this one.  I love fantasy cinema of the past as much as science fiction.  [[ASIN:B0000VD12I Conan - The Complete Quest]] is one of my favorite series of movies.  And that cool tiger on the poster had me expecting some great special effects.<br /><br />Well, the special effects were very good.  And the score was good at times too, though it did seem over-done after a while with very few softer parts.  But that's where the good ends.<br /><br />For starters, this movie really made me resent the over-use of narration in movies.  When you watch the deleted scenes and alternate ending, it's clear the narrator was telling the story to the next generation.  Yet the final cut of this movie doesn't let you see that.  It didn't really matter though, because I found myself alternately wondering \\"is this just a little over-dramatic\\" and \\"they spoke english with a British accent in 10000 BC?\\"<br /><br />And of course the historical inaccuracies were unavoidable.  I understand some want to give them a pass on that, but then they shouldn't have named this after a year.  Apparantly, all white people had dreadlocks 10000 BC.  And all the races of the world were within a few days walk of each other too.  Still,  I can accept a movie as a work of fantasy except when the story is weak.  And the story is very weak.<br /><br />The movie starts off with cheesy prophecies and the young hero speaking way more seriously than a kid could about \\"eternal love\\" in his heart. Never mind, everything that happens was in a prophecy.  And oh yeah, no matter where this guy walks everybody knew his father. In fact, the entire story line is unbelievable even as a fantasy movie because it's inconsistent with itself.  It gets funny fast.<br /><br />Other than the aforementioned deleted scenes and alternate ending, there's no special features to speak of.  Some of those scenes have some incomplete CG sequences that made me laugh too.<br /><br />If you are not too critical, sure you can enjoy this.  But there are just too many better movies to watch to really go out of your way to see this.  Wait for it to play on cable.<br /><br />Avoid.If you are not too critical, sure you can enjoy this.

1579126235|4.0|\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is arguably Agatha Christie's best known novel, which is a status it more or less deserves.  The book features Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, in one of his earliest appearances (his eighth novel).  The plot is a clever one -- a murder takes place on a luxury train and one of the 12 passengers must have committed it.  Poirot is travelling on the train, and he is drawn into the mystery by one of the executives of the train company who knows Poirot and also happened to be on the train.  A few of the passengers seem like obvious suspects, but Poirot takes his time and does not draw any rash conclusions.<br /><br />Many of the plot devices in \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" have been borrowed from Christie by later, lesser authors, so the novel may not seem as fresh as it once was.  I'm a relative newbie to Christie's writing but enjoyed this book quite a bit, particularly the colorful and interesting characters.  I marked it down one star because some of the plot twists are not very believable and the novel relies on a few coincidences.  However, even with these issues, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a very good to excellent mystery novel that is sure to please fans of the genre.<br /><br />I read the rerelease version by Black Dog & Leventhal.  They have done a nice job with this hardback series, including an attractive dust cover and quality paper.  However, I'm not sure that the novel is worth the extra price you'd pay for a typical soft cover version.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Just an incredible series! Got to love the music that opens every episode. I liked the way Bronowski meters his speech. Five stars.
B0017MO10U|4.0|As an avid fan of everything in the Stargate Franchise, I was eagerly awaiting this film.  I wasn't disappointed.  The movie is an action-packed rollercoaster ride.  I felt like I was back during SG-1's height, going on a mission that had little chance of success.  But, like always, the odds aren't always a good indicator of our heroes abilities!      I thought there was more payoff in the Ark of Truth, but would recommend Continuum to any die hard Stargate fan or even someone that has never seen an episode of SG-1 or Atlantis.
1400079276|5.0|The brilliance of Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore appears to me more in what is unexplained than what is evident in the literal text. Although I am initially drawn to books that contain a rich and unique plot, a quality that Kafka displayed throughout the entire novel, I was actually more fascinated by the ever present notion that the story would ultimately reach a definite climax yet without truly knowing how it would attain this goal. The story is driven by surreal events, intentionally left unexplained such as the true cause behind the school children fainting or two characters ability to converse with cats. What compelled me to continue to read the book was Murakami's capacity to mislead the reader and never allow him to see how the story would conclude; yet despite the constant supply of metaphors, symbols, and stories I never lost sight of the plot nor misread the characters thoughts and feelings, a rare instance in a book such as this. Another aspect that drew me in was the author's occasional remarks directly to the reader through his characters. There are times when I was literally told over and over that the character Colonel Sanders was a concept, a narrative device of Murakami's that could address the reader himself. Most important to me as a reader however, is a story's ability to bring together all the details from throughout the novel and gave each a purpose in the conclusion, very much like how the \\"shot\\" in A Prayer for Owen Meany is ultimately the action that saves the children in Owen's dream. Kafka succeeds so well in this area that I feel compelled to read it again just to see how each piece fits into the conclusion.   Kafka in the Shore surpassed all my expectations and changed the way I read surreal books such as this; the characters were all unique and enjoyable to analyze and connect with, while the bizarre occurrences throughout the story made for a spectacular plot and leave plenty of room for interpretation. I look forward to an opportunity to discuss it with anyone I can and explore the deeper meanings and metaphors in this incredible story.

0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed chapters 1 and 2.  The first chapter about her travels in Italy were wonderful -- I felt I was there.    Chapter 2 was good and I'm glad she shared this very person spiritual trek.    My thoughts when reading the last chapter were that something didn't fit with the earlier parts of the book.   There seemed to be a disconnect in some ways between earlier stories and chapter 3.   Almost as if the author wanted to end the book, but ran out of steam.    Paula Leslie - Palo Alto, CA
B000957O82|5.0|In this comedy, Hitch, the \\"date doctor\\", helps discouraged single men connect with women. He doesn't just advise them--he hangs around and monitors their performance. He begins by saying that women don't really mean it when they say that they are just into their careers, etc. He coaches men according to the principle that most communication is through body language. For instance, he tells men that, when a woman wants no kiss at the end of the date, she just takes out her keys and opens the door. But when she does want a goodnight kiss, she fiddles around with her keys. That is the signal for men to watch for.<br /><br />The \\"date doctor' succeeds with even seemingly-impossible cases. Albert, a taciturn, nerdy, heavyset, completely-bumbling fellow, gets dates with no less than Allegra, a popular beauty queen. Spectators can't believe it. In time, this makes it into the tabloids, provoking such a furious response in Albert that he trashes the store carrying the tabloids and gets himself arrested.<br /><br />Hitch's own girlfriend is Sara, who is highly cynical of men in general. She reacts with contempt when she learns of the very existence of a \\"date doctor\\", and then is furious with Hitch when she learns that he is in fact the one. She even throws things at him. Sara and the other women feel manipulated at the thought of their men's actions having been coached come-ons, not genuine romantic expressions.<br /><br />So Hitch's world seems to fall apart. The heartaches are unbearable. Can Hitch win back Sara? Will Albert get Allegra back? At the end of the movie, Hitch makes a statement that is very ironic in view of what he had been saying all along about men, dating, and women.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was one of those who actually got to see the show, one episode, when it was on ABC.  I'm not even sure which episode it was, but I caught the tail end of it, and then it was gone.  When I showed up on MTV I had just gotten cable, but I saw it disjointed because I would catch an episode here and there.  Suffice to say I really love the show for its writing and acting.  It can start to get a little melodramatic, but come on, it was the 90's, who wasn't melodramatic.  I loved the little insights that Angela would say in a passing manor.  Because, even though they came off as just a throw-away thought, there was actually some deep thinking behind those thoughts.<br />Today's \\"teen\\" shows have nothing on MSCL, because they're based in some fantasy world where everyone is rich, beautiful, and only goes to school to socialize.  No one deals with problems that go beyond blank sleeping with blanky, while also with blankwitz.  I mean come on, I don't know what fancy world these people live in, but none of my friends were hopping in and out of each other's beds.  My point is, today's shows are meant for escape, not for real introspection.  All these years later I still find something new when I watch the show that makes me go, \\"Wow, things don't change.\\"<br />The \\"book\\" is good, but is more like a bunch of trivia information than an actual book.  Would be be cool is if someone could go to the writers of the show and ask them what they were planning for season two.  That would make a good book.
0618918248|3.0|Dawkins is a highly skilled master of terminological inexactitude whereby he briskfully overlooks the employment of primary sources in his documentation outside of the science arena.<br /><br />In this book it becomes clear that Dawkins is a master revisionist historian/scientist with a finely tuned sense for highly biased, selective observations.  The problem is, he knows next to nothing about history or theology.  Naturally, this catapults him into a revisionist camp.<br /><br />A difficult question is posed in regards to where I should begin in correcting his historical record.  Thankfully many prestigious scientists and historians have corrected the record.  That is not to say he gets everything wrong, but more than one might expect from someone in his position.<br /><br />Dawkins is not a historian nor does he claim to be one.  Is there any original research in this book?  Does taking quotes of context qualify as original research?<br /><br />Upon further investigation it is undeniable that Dawkins chooses to view the world through tinted lenses.  He chooses not to understand historical realities, and his liberal usage of secular quotations is disturbingly out of historical context.<br /><br />My surely unheeded recommendation for Dawkins is to stick with the life sciences and evolutionary biology.<br /><br />I heard Dawkins speak in a public forum at Oxford University.  His understanding of the biblical claims are so rudimentary, it would be like a Rabbi or Pope debating an astrophysicist, whereby the Rabbi or Pope starts his argument against science as such, \\"I genuinely do not know much about astrophysics, but...\\".  Dawkins is similar to Hitchens in that they both have a cursory understanding of biblical history and theology.<br /><br />I am not making any claims about the biblical texts, because I am not qualified to assess their validity.  Dawkins is also not qualified to provide an evaluation regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible.  Not surprisingly he views the Hebrew Bible through Christian lenses that are somewhat hostile to the Jewish interpretations of scripture.  It is all the more interesting that he has burrowed himself into a hole of self-avowed atheism.<br /><br />Why is Dawkins afraid to debate Gerald Schroeder.  Dawkins proves he is nothing but a charlatan when he chooses to debate religious quacks such as Shmuley Boteach.  Dawkins is wise enough not to box the heavyweights.  Schroeder not only knows more about science than Dawkins (dual PhD from MIT), but knows more about the Hebrew Bible than Dawkins.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|This will not be everyone's cup of tea, and considering the subject matter, I did not think this film would be mine either but thanks to some creative work from the writers and director, and a perfected performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, There Will Be Blood was a pleasant joy ride of entertainment.<br /><br />The film begins with music one would expect to hear out of a horror film, while the director has us gazing across a desert on a sunny day, in the western U.S.  The music is erie and perhaps grants us immidiate forshadowing of what is to come throughout the film.  I did not realize it at first, but there is no spoken dialouge for the first 15 minutes of the film...I practically jumped when the first words came across, as the 15 minutes of spoken silence where quite effective, giving us an insiders look at the stages of extracting oil in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br /><br />Daniel Plainview's persistence pays off, as his oil business steadily grows and expands, while raising his young son in the early 20th century.  From the get-go, Daniel is not the nicest or most honest man around, and any gentlemenship he displays is out of business rather than kindness.  For awhile we only know the business side of Daniel, yet desire to know more, which eventually comes around but not until later on in the film.  The desire to understand this man more kept a certain suspense going.  Things are fairly calm throughout the first hour of the film, and you expect (even hope) for something to go wrong to make things interesting.  They do, certain tragedies strike and tensions build, primarily between Daniel and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the leader of the local church.  The deeper meaning of the story begins to unfold, when we discover the villainous (in his own ways) Plainview and Sunday are more alike than different as would like to believe.<br /><br />Though the film has it's moments and messages that are interesting and make a point, it's the performance of Day-Lewis that is unforgettable and make this film sharp.  He brings all the right elements as a perfected actor should, allowing the role to come alive as if it were the very real thing.<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Characters - 4<br />Drama - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4and make this film sharp.

0553588486|3.0|Read the 5 star reviews for what makes this a good book, as I agree with them.<br /><br />However.......<br /><br />#1 - It's much too long, the last three or four chapters are the best in the book, the first 5 are fantastic as well.  But the filler in the middle was like the first 15 minutes of a bad movie when you are saying to yourself \\"if the plot doesnt show itself in the next 5 minutes I'm not watching the rest\\".  BUT, plow through it, skimm some if you wish (especially the \\"SANSA\\" chapters) and you will be rewarded!  The feeling that I was left with was there was no overarching main plot line, and there isnt, there are three.<br /><br />#2 - Way to much forced stupidity, the author wants us to beleive that all good people are 90% stupid and slow and only 10% witty and smart.  It's forced it seems, and it's insulting to me as a reader.  Thats why it only got 3 stars instead of 4.5!
0425166805|5.0|Yes, as nonfiction this book stinks. But as fiction it's one of the most important works of the last fifty years. The concept of aliens pretending to be gods is now a staple of science fiction, and all the great science fiction that uses this scenario (like Stargate) owes a lot to this book, not just in ideas, but in getting the idea into the popular consciousness.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is an \\"Awesome\\" DVD.  These guys sound better than they did years ago. The venue from Australia was great and the fans are more considerate that in the states.  At least you can hear all the music and crowd is not a distraction to the concert. Watched this concert at least 5 times and it never gets old. Hope they have another \\"Farewell Tour\\" soon.  Wish this would come out in just the CD. Will purchase that one too.

B0017MO10U|4.0|This is a good movie in the series of Stargate, I am waiting for the next installment
B0010YSD7M|3.0|It was nice to have a little more SG-1 to watch, but otherwise this movie is unimpressive. Predictable plot, and out of character behavior by the principles made it a bit Ho-hum.    Borrow it, don't buy it.
B000RPCK1U|5.0|I have never been disappointed with a James Bond movie and this one is no different. I think Pierce Brosnan is great as James Bond and I loved this movie. One of the parts that I really thought was cool was his BMW. The car chase in the parking garage was awesome!! This is one of my favorite Bond movies.
B001BGTWXI|4.0|Just like its predecessor, All Hope is Gone will take some time until I fully appreciate it and then I may upgrade it to a 5 star album. Some of the songs are not that good such as Dead Memories but the good ones are extremely well done and catchy. I'm addicted to Psychosocial and Butcher's Hook right now and I think Corey's vocals are the best ever in this album - probably the best vocals ever done on a metal album.
B000H305U0|5.0|To my surprise, when I first heard this cd, on amazon, I liked a few of the songs. I bought the cd, I listened to the whole thing, I was addicted to it. It is very different. Very poppy,with different sounds to it. I think that Justin will have a bigger carrer as a solo artist then in a boy band. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes music like Michael Jackson or Prince.
B00005JPD0|1.0|This movie had me going right up until the final act, and then I watched it spiral out of control, as story and acting took a terrible u-turn and crashed on landing.<br />Now I'm not a big Denzel fan, but for the first 2/3rd of the film, he actually did a pretty good job. But whether it was the writer or the director(horrid want-to-be as good as my brother, Tony Scott), the last 30 minutes left me and my girlfriend shouting at the screen, \\"Move your butt, aren't there people to save!\\".<br />It's been awhile since I've viewed a movie where you can actually pinpoint the moment where everything derails, and all concept of time and logic is lost in the ashes.<br />Avoid this one.
B000I2MRHE|3.0|This product was pretty good, and seemed to serve the purpose for which it was intended.  However, it was a little smaller than I expected (perhaps a picture with a baby on it would be helpful to gauge size), and my baby didn't react to it any differently than he would have to tummy time on the floor directly, i.e. he screamed to get up after about two minutes!  The cute distraction items (the bee, birds, butterflies, etc.) didn't seem to take his mind off the fact that it was tummy time nonetheless, so it was a bit of a wasted product for me.
B000PVC3WM|4.0|Great features, hard to find it in a retail store. Good price. Protrek and Pathfinder are the same, in the watch is written pathfinder no protrek. protrek is the brand for latinamerica.
B00005QB42|4.0|this cd has been out for a whilenow and i finally broke down and bought my own copy.  the first three tracks,and the last one, are the best in my opinion.  I am glad I added this to my collection.  Her voice is beautiful and I can use this in my yoga classes.

0345495004|4.0|I read this book for my book club. I wasn't excited about it, since I am not a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture, but it's more about his personality and now I understand the architecture concepts more. Next time I am back east I will go visit Falling Water which is very near my in-laws' house! Great book, lots to talk about at our book club meeting. Unexpected ending...
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Not as bad as I thought it would be. Too much hype for the dirty bits. Modern, mainstream hardcore porn is just as disturbing (or not). As a work of art it was everything I thought it would be: a masterpiece. Well cast and well played. If you like the dead end point of decadence and romanticism, this is it. I probably don't need to go into detail about it's selling points. If you are already on this page you're probably going to get it based on hearsay. The coprophagia did really get to me as much as the notion that they were eating a mixture of cookies, chocolate, marmalade, condensed milk and dried fruit that had probably been sitting under flood lights for a while. The sight of old, warm food kinda gets me the same way feces does. C'est la vie! The ending is quite pleasant. Made me chuckle. All in all a must!
B00000K19E|5.0|What more can I say? Nothing like this movie had ever been seen before. It revolutionized cinematography wth \\"Bullet-time\\" and created a multi-million dollar franchise that spawned two additional movies, a video game, an animated film...Great story, great effects, if you haven't seen this yet, where have you been?
0345479092|5.0|Could not be better! 5 years ago, I received this as a gift from my aunt while pregnant with my first child.  As a result of taking the advice in this book, my little boy slept 6 hours a night by the end of week one and was a healthy eater and sleeper the rest of his infancy.  My friends and family were in awe.  I bought this book for a friend of mine who is currently pregnant.  Great as a gift, great reference book, great for all new mommies who are unsure of the 'how tos' of infancy.

B000F6IOC0|4.0|I did not see Underworld until late 2008 because I had suspected that it was a vampire movie rip-off.  When I finally did see it, I was pleasantly surprised and immediately purchased Evolution which I found to be equally entertaining.  It is a reasonably good script with good acting and technical work and some interesting color effects.
B00180R06I|1.0|This movie was terrible and I didn't think that it lived up to the hype advertised.  It was so bad I returned it and requested my money back.  Picture was awful, sound was terrible and definitely not worth the money I spent.
B001BSQ8TW|5.0|Awesome in scope, bold in execution, breathtaking in shear visual presentation...<br />this IS Ms. Riefenstahl's masterpiece, Triumph Of The Will. (Triumph des Willens)<br /><br />Ostensibly shot as a \\"documentary\\" of the 1934 Nuremberg Party Rally,this film is propaganda at its pure and horrifying best. Techniques that were groundbreaking in<br />its day are still used by cinematographers around the globe today...whether it be for sporting or political events, to use in commercial ads and motion pictures...from Star Wars to The Lion King.<br /><br />Although originally intended for German audiences, the film eventually made its way throughout \\"Occupied\\" Europe...and it's easy to see how so many Europeans (one may be surprised to discover that more than a third of the German Wehrmacht consisted of willing \\"foreign\\" volunteers) were inspired to take up the Germanic crusade for \\"western Christian values\\" against \\"eastern Bolshevik barbarism\\".<br /><br />Given the age of the footage used, one shouldn't really complain about the quality of this film.<br />There are the obvious \\"skips\\" and artifacts that could perhaps be removed by modern digital re-mastering.<br />The sound does leave something to be desired, but then...that may have been the case even when the film was \\"new\\"...?<br />The commentary by Dr. Anthony Santoro, although informative at times, is just too monotone and dry.<br />And I'm not going to pretend to be fluent in German, but I also own this in an older VHS format...and the translating subtitles ARE subtly different between the two.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very powerful film, and worth watching from an historical perspective.<br /><br />Ohhh, and I have often wondered...<br /><br />For all the footage that WAS shot, what ended up on the cutting-room floor, does any of it still exist...and what would this film look and feel like were this footage to be re-added?!?
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|What can go wrong at a funeral? Seemingly everything, as this extremely funny dark comedy will show you.

B0017MO10U|3.0|I didn't like this episode very much. It lacked the exciment of the Stargate series, it was boring and lame. I don't recommend it.
0930289234|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  This is a very well written graphic novel.  However, it was built up so much in my mind that I found myself somewhat disappointed in it.<br /><br />The ending is very anticlimactic, which hurts after such a long story.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that I couldn't put it down, by any means.  In fact, some nights while reading this, I had a hard time picking it up.<br /><br />This is one of the better stories I've read, but I don't think I'd call it the best graphic novel of all time.  Or, at the very least, it certainly isn't my favorite.

B0011NVC98|4.0|This was a fascinating, epic performance of perhaps the most thrilling epic poem in all of western literature.<br /><br />While the original poem is left far behind, with Grendel's mother posing as an evil seductress who tempts Beowulf with riches and fame if she will merely mate with him, the flavor of the original remains.<br /><br />Interesting to me was the juxtaposition of Christian imagery, with a reference to Jesus Christ which is not present in the poem, against traditional pagan mythology of monsters, dragons, and superhuman feats. While Beowulf the poem does feature (exclusively Old Testament) biblical allusions and implies knowledge of Christianity (references to heaven, hell and final judgment, metaphor of the dragon as Satan), it is not a Christian poem.<br /><br />The movie appears to try to point out, and the likely case, that Beowulf was written at a time when Christian theology was only beginning to become known in 6th century Denmark, and somewhat better known in 8-10th century England. So Christian references appear alongside proclamations of allegiance to Odin, and acknowledgment of Roman gods as simply another possible ally.<br /><br />Beowulf himself appears as a savior, who is greatly tempted by Grendel's mother with promises of eternal fame and fortune, and peace, if she will only provide him a son and the dragon-mead flask.  Ultimately, Beowulf realizes her promise to be an empty one, and that morality cannot be supplanted by convenience; thus he goes to fight the dragon -- and his own son -- and ultimately is killed himself.<br /><br />The animation is slightly less wooden than in Polar Express. But it works better here, for the characters appear stoic in their relationships and bravery. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Hrothgar; Angeline Jolie less so as Grendel's mother.<br /><br />I do recommend this film to anyone; especially if you have just read the poem, or are about to do so.
B00008DDSC|4.0|I finally saw this film. I've always liked Maggie Gyllenhaal (Mona Lisa Smile, etc.) and she carried this first lead role like a confident pro. Indeed, she was fine, as was James Spader, more in control than the roles for which he's known. My favorite of all, however, is Jeremy Davies. A very earnest and complete performance. Steven Shainberg has crafted a film that shocks, amuses, and finally leaves the audience with a happy feeling.
B000002P2W|4.0|I recently rediscovered this album, along side with Quadrophenia, after an absence of over 20 years.<br /><br />I always thought Quadrophenia was The Who's best album, and viewed The Who by Numbers as their worst.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Quadrophenia is their best, IMHO. But The Who by Numbers has aged better, because The Who's fans of have aged.  Whereas the one is a coming of age story, the other is a plaintive attempt to come to grasp with the consequences of decisions made, paths chosen, and success attained, only to find that it may not be success after all.<br /><br />I remember that critics hated this album, with its self-loathing and self-pitying. \\"Success Story\\" explains the reaction before it even happened: they wanted to become rock stars, and they did, with all the good and the bad that comes along with it.<br /><br />So \\"How Many Friends Have I Really Got?\\" seemed pathetic in 1975; in 2008 it rings somewhat more true.<br /><br />This was The Who's (and Pete Townshend's) first really personal album.  For the first time, he moved from high concept albums (Tommy, Who's Next which grew out of the never realized Lifehouse project, and Quadrophenia)to a collection of unrelated songs that nevertheless portrayed the songwriter's thoughts and attitudes at that point in his life, and where he stood in the world. Subsequent albums would continue to do the same.<br /><br />From the perspective of performance, this is a brilliant collection. Daltrey's voice is superb, ranging from his famous growls to plaintive ballads.  Townshend clearly has become, by this point, a brilliant orchestrator of a rock band, successfully getting more out of less, by eschewing the synthesizers of Who's Next and Quadrophenia, and reducing the band to guitar (and banjo etc.), bass, drums, voice, and some piano.<br /><br />I think my favorite song has become \\"In a Hand or Face\\", as it displays typical Who anger versus humility.  \\"Blue Red and Grey\\" is a very pretty song, as is \\"Imagine a Man\\".<br /><br />This is not the first Who album someone should buy -- that is still either Who's Next or Live at Leeds (the original release), followed by Tommy & Quadrophenia. (Honorable mention must go to The Who Sell Out.)  But it is a must own, especially for those of us who listened to this album 30 years ago.hould buy -- that is still either Who's Next or Live at Leeds (the original release), followed by Tommy & Quadrophenia. (Honorable mention must go to The Who Sell Out.)  But it is a must own, especially for those of us who listened to this album 30 years ago.
B001202LRM|5.0|I remember when this album first came out I was in high school and, to me at the time, this was some very hard hitting original stuff. I bought the album twice at the time because I lost one and the tracks on those I purchased were different than the ones listed here. This is because once Slipknot hit radio waves they re-arranged the album. I have no idea where you would still find the original today, it's probably worth a good chunk of change.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is still a masterpiece. Some metalheads might hate on this album but they have no reason to. If it never saw mainstream then they would love it as well.
B000UR9T82|4.0|Just as you might have seen in the theatre, BD provides better sound and vision for all the viewers, especially HD resolution does come in handy compared to the old cable TV channels. Somehow I didn't give it a 5-star it's because the box looks kind of damaged outside. The fact that I want to keep it a collection, which a rough look on the ouside doesn't adore me too much. Well...I guess that's the only flaw I could come up with. Besides that, videos quality and sound look just fine to me.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|When people hear I love this movie so much they usually giggle or look at me funny. Given that it is corny it is still an awesome sci-fi flick. Even more so, and on a level that I can't quite describe in words, I was in the infantry and for some really bizarre reason this movie has more in common with the infantry than most films that try to actually be more non-fictional. That's my opinion though. Nevertheless, an excellent film that never gets old, no matter how many times you've seen it, so it's worth the money for a DVD.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|I still love this movie.  I have since I was young.  It's fun, funny and utterly charming.  The story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is told as a vehicle for Paul Newman and Robert Redford who were at the height of their popularity at the time.  Robert Redford actually became a bigger star and Paul Newman really never lost much popularity.  He was always big!  This established them as a team which went on the make The Sting.  Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head is a classic song and a great interlude in the film.  It just drifts on to its sad denouement.  Highly recommended.

B00005JPUN|3.0|There's this one crazy scene where Nicole Kidman (Carol Bennell) is driving with her son Ollie, and a lot of the \\"changed people\\" hanging all over like a bunch of cockroaches, trying to breakthrough to kill her. It was hilarious when she hit a storefront and \\"they\\" all went flying like a bunch of bugs.<br /><br />The pace is very tedious, and sometimes you wonder why Carol, a psychiatrist can't keep it together without being emotional; which is what the \\"pod people\\" notice immediately. Oh well, she manages to \\"cap off\\" a half dozen \\"pods\\" including Daniel Craig (Ben Driscoll-he survives) her colleague in a drugstore attempting to escape, rather than give in and<br />join them.<br /><br />I'm not a real fan of Nicole Kidman. There are times in the movie when you just want to shout out \\"kill\\" or \\"run\\" when Carol should kill, or run. I sometimes wonder why Nicole Kidman is given this type role; always the very weak-willed and vulnerable stereotypical female who just barely keeps it together just to survive. But then again, just like in \\"Lethal Weapon,\\" \\"Rambo,\\" or \\"Predator\\"  you're gonna' need the good old calculator to rack up the Nicole Kidman \\"kills.\\" Not bad for a female non-heroine. Just Kidding.<br /><br />Darn. They end up stopping the pandemic with widespread inoculations. Just when you think they (the uninfected) were going to start wholesale slaughter of the \\"Pod People.\\" Oh yeah, Jeffrey Wright (Ride With The Devil, Syriana, Lady In The Water, Casino Royale) also starred as one of the Scientist buddy's to Daniel Craig.

6305428042|4.0|This is a really nice kids movie, and I loved it as a kid.  You won't regret giving it a spin.  However, as a purchase be forewarned - if you have a widescreen TV this will not conform to the shape, as it is NOT ANAMORPHIC.  It will show up as a box inside a box.  So if you plan on only viewing on a widescreen TV, I can't recommend it.  You can zoom, but the picure quality suffers.  Hopefully Disney will put out a special edition around Halloween someday.<br /><br />Update:  Disney has released a Bluray version - I definitely recommend getting that one.
6305718954|3.0|Stigmata isn't painful, but it does have the stigma of not being very good. It is a horror film but in this case the monster that terrorizes our young protagonist is Jesus Christ--or someone carrying a message from him. It compares to The Exorcist and The DaVinci Code, but is not as good as either. By straddling the two genres of horror and dramatic Vatican thriller, it succeeds at neither. The stigmata scenes aren't scary and they overuse sloppy special effects. Why is there always water dripping, and why does Frankie Paige, a hairdresser in Pittsburgh, always smell flowers whenever she is having an episode? And how do two hairdressers living together afford such a large albeit somewhat scummy but artfully decorated loft?<br /><br />The film is based on an interesting premise, that the Vatican is suppressing certain gospels that have turned up by Peter, Mary Magdalene and even Judas. This plot pivots around one written by Thomas--and such a text does exist though its veracity is questioned. The film, however, is a little sloppy with the details, claiming it was written in Aramaic, a language spoken in Jesus' day, but it is actually in Coptic, an ancient Egyptian language based on the Greek alphabet. Here is a quote from Stigmata that was taken from The Gospel of Thomas, verse 77:<br /><br />-------------------------<br />[Frankie is possessed by Father Alameida]<br />Frankie: Jesus said... the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, not in mansions of wood and stone. Split a piece of wood... and I am there, lift a stone... and you will find me.<br />-------------------------<br /><br />At one point our stigmatized hairdresser ostensibly writes Aramaic on the walls of her loft, but the director actually had her write in ancient Hebrew because he thought it looked cooler. But I quibble. I am not sure if, as Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) claims, that St Francis of Assisi was the first to receive stigmata, but I have a whole pack of fact checkers working on it and you will be the first to know should they unearth any verification. Another interesting factoid gleaned from Father Kiernan was that the nails in a crucifixion actually go through the wrists, because palms couldn't support the weight. This is in spite of all the crucifixes you see showing the nail through the palm. Another Vatican cover up?<br /><br />Though not a great film, it is at least mildly entertaining, with performances by Patricia Arquette as Frankie Paige--the stigmatized hair dresser, Gabriel Byrne, Enrico Colantoni as Father Dario, and Jonathan Pryce as the sinister Cardinal Daniel Houseman.<br /><br />Patricia's character, Frankie, for short, is named Francis, and this is an allusion to St. Francis of Assisi, the first person believed to be stigmatized. Patricia is younger sister to Rosanna Arquette, and also a sister to David Arquette, and therefore is sister-in-law to Courtney Cox. She is also the grand daughter of star of stage and screen, Cliff Arquette, best known for the character 'Charlie Weaver' that he created for the Jack Paar Show. An interesting bit of Patricia trivia is that Tom Waits' wife called Patricia a Bonsai Aphrodite, and Tom used that line in the song \\"Black Market Baby\\" from The Mule Variations. She is quite the Bonsai Aphrodite, though I didn't recognize her at first, but upon further investigation I found that she played the medium, Allison Dubois, on the TV program: Medium.<br /><br />-------------------------<br />[Frankie is possessed by Father Alameida]<br />Father Andrew Kiernan: Frankie? Frankie... who are you?<br />Frankie: The messenger is not important.<br />-------------------------<br /><br />If, as Marshall McLuhan posits, The Medium is the Message, and the messenger is not important, what does that portend?<br /><br />Other Patricia Arquette film credits include Ed Wood, with Johnny Depp; Little Nicky, with Adam Sandler; a dual role in Lost Highway, directed by David Lynch; and finally, she played Linda Loveless opposite Charlie Sheen, who (in quite a stretch) portrayed Chuck Traynor, in Deeper Than Deep. Though Stigmata is not her best work, she at least had the best line:<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Dr. Reston: And are there any problems with a significant other?<br />Frankie: Yes...<br />Dr. Reston: Which is?<br />Frankie: I'm not very significant.<br />-------------------------<br /><br />This could serve as the film's epitaph.<br /><br />Gabriel Byrne was the priest who investigates miracles and debunks them with science. Byrne is from Dublin, and his slight bit o' brogue didn't seem out of place on a Catholic Priest. I last recall seeing him in Little Women with Winona Ryder, but he also played Byron in Gothic, and was one of the usual suspects in The Usual Suspects. In 1999, besides Stigmata, Byrne was also in The End Days. Both performances earned him Razzies for worst supporting actor, but Stigmata also won him a best supporting actor award--but it was from Blockbuster.<br /><br />Jonathan Pryce is probably now best known for playing Governor Weatherbee Swann from The Pirates of the Caribbean. I liked his off beat brother-in-law Norman in The Rachel Papers far better. Other notable films worth the Pryce were Brazil, Glengarry Glen Ross, and De-Lovely. De-Lovely was a bio pic of Cole Porter starring Kevin Kline, and Pryce's character Gabe sang Porter's \\"Blow, Gabriel, Blow.\\" However, as the embodiment of Vatican corruption and cover-up in Stigmata, he didn't really measure up to my expectations.<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Cardinal Daniel Houseman: [while trying to strangle Frankie] I'll not let you destroy my church!<br />-------------------------<br /><br />Not buying it, Pryce!<br /><br />Enrico Colantoni might be familiar to you from Just Shoot Me! where he played the photographer, or from Veronica Mars where he played Veronica's father, a former cop turned private eye. Now he is playing a SWAT cop on a new show, Flashpoint, but we will see if that isn't just another flash-in-the-pan.<br /><br />According to the credits, Portia de Rossi played Jennifer Kelliho in Stigmata, but I would have to watch it again to see who she was and how she does. Portia has also had her most successful roles on television, notably as \\"Ice Queen\\" lawyer Nell Porter on Ally McBeal, Lindsay Bluth F&uuml;nke on Arrested Development, and Olivia Lord on Nip/Tuck. By the way, Portia married Ellen DeGeneres on August 16, 2008 at Ellen's house in Beverly Hills, California attended by Ellen's mother and her mother.

B000TEUSJU|5.0|It's nearly 30 years since Caligula was released onto an expectant, or is it more correct to say an unexpectant, global cinema audience. And they were not to be disappointed. Stage and cinema royalty including Sir Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud and Dame Helen Mirren (only Gielgud was knighted at the time) joined Malcolm McDowell and a collection of Italian and European actors in an orgy of violence and sex which included graphic XXX pornography taken directly from the pages of Seutonius' chapter on Caligula in the second century book The Twelve Caesars.<br /><br />This marvellous 3 disc DVD set contains fascinating documentaries featuring extensive interviews with producer Bob Guccione and writer Gore Vidal shot at the time of production.  The full uncut 156 minute version features on the first disc. The second disc has a  shorter version which has wonderful commentary tracks by Mirren and McDowell. Alas, the 200 plus minute Guccione edited version, which was rumoured to have been shown to preview audiences in Italy, is not included in this set and in fact may no longer exist.<br /><br />It is now well known that the film that Vidal wrote and Director Tinto Brass shot are not what was finally released after Guccione took control of the editing and shut Brass out of the production. To bridge huge continuity gaps Guccione and his editors extensively used out-takes and rehearsal footage rescued from rubbish bins. The documentary material provides fascinating information about what might have been a masterpiece had Brass been allowed to edit the film he shot and do pick up shots, retakes and the shooting of much needed new scenes which would become self evident in the editing stage.<br /><br />Thanks to the documentary material, we get to fully appreciate the incredible production design, the magnitude and details of the various sets and the beautiful costumes made by Production Designer Danilo Donati and his team. This is not always evident in the finished film.<br /><br />There is a wonderful interview with the very erudite John Steiner, a British actor who built a short but spectacular career in Italian exploitation films in the 1970s. Steiner shaved his head to play the slimey Longinus character. Now a real estate agent in England, Steiner's witty comments about the making of the film are worth the price of the DVD set alone.<br /><br />As time goes by Caligula will continue to be restudied and reassessed. No doubt it will gain in stature but unlike the other Caligula film of cinema legend, the `lost' 1937 I Claudius featuring Charles Laughton as Claudius and Emlyn Williams as Caligula, we have ample material to study and assess thanks to this excellent DVD collection.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My first exposure to this Joss Whedon series was through the movie \\"Serenity,\\" and I thoroughly enjoyed watching that movie. At the time, I was unaware of who Wheden was, or what other works he had on his resume. Admittedly, I've never been a fan of Whedon's previous forays into television, such as \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel,\\" believing them to be directed mainly at pre-pubescent teenagers and bored housewives. Luckily for me, I was ignorant of the connection to Firefly, and was able to keep an open mind when watching.    Firefly completely blew me away with how captivating and engrossing each episode was. From the writing, to the camerawork, to the direction of its quirky and loveable cast, there was not one thing I could find fault with or look at harshly. Well, the fact that this was the only season produced is a big gripe, but that's directed at the network that foolishly cancelled it. You will love it, I can assure you.      I will give one important warning to anyone thinking of buying this DVD collection though: Make sure you have ample, and I mean ample, amounts of free time before starting the first episode. You will NOT want to stop for anything once you get started, and it will be hard not to go back and rewatch the whole series once you've finished it. It really is that good!!     5 out of 5 stars, in my opinion. Enjoy!

0321544080|4.0|This was a great read.  It mixes a lot of the \\"practical\\" behind the scenes aspects of putting a shoot together with the technical parts of how the shot was taken.  McNally is frank about the hardships and sacrifices of trying to become a professional photographer and doesn't pull any punches about the effects on his family life.  But for the most part the book is light hearted and fun to read.  It's probably not the best book on the technical aspects of lighting/photography, but if you have any interest in portrait/slice-of-life photography you'll definitely enjoy this.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|If you read any review that pans this album... they are wrong !!!! It has all the elements that a great album should have. Highs and lows... Hard and soft. The song writing is the best of thier career. You can't stay grwol & scowl forever ...so this is the best point to move forward from there. Thank god they dumped Rick Rubin. He is so washed up it aint funny. I don't think he has produced anything good since... I don't know when! Just buy and you will not be dissapointed. Way better than thier previous work. By far!!!!
B000YAA68C|4.0|Hilary lights up the screen and so does her co-star.   Good acting jobs including a co-starring role from the great Kathy Bates. (Remember \\"Misery??)    Good story, and a great movie to watch with my wife Debbie.     Jeffrey Dean Morgan is also extremely good in a supporting role.  Like the guitar playing :)
B000007489|5.0|There are 49 prior reviews. MINE is number 50.  Add me to all the other 5 star reviews.  Like so many others, my prior exposure was via Repo Man.  Well, some 25 years or more later, I bought this record by sheer accident at a pawn shop.  (Also for full price on Amazon just bought Circle Jerks 'Group Sex', which I'm pleased to report stands the test of time; a slam down memory lane.)  What a discovery.  As great as is 'Institutionalized,' S.T. is hardly a one-hit wonder.  All of the other songs on this record are punk perfection, intense, but musical and topical.  (I shot Reagan!)  If they'd kept this lineup together, they would have eclipsed Dead Kennedys and would be the U.S. answer to the Clash.  But I suppose Punk was dying by the early '80s when they hit the scene, so it's best to go out in style before they devolved into metal.  The Wikipedia entry is fascinating.  Seems like anyone with a guitar in L.A. has been in this band.  Anyhow, I'm so totally impressed.  In high school I listened to a lot of Clash, Gang of Four, Buzzcocks, Bowie, Talking Heads, Kraftwerk, Hypstyrz (here's my plug - best SST classic Minneapolis garage punk band you've never heard of -- BUY IT before it goes out of print, you imbeciles).  Anyhow, I digress.  This S.T.  album should be on anyone's top 100 rock and roll albums, and certainly top 20 of punk albums.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This is a good documentary for the simple reason that it showed insight on the 2000 election and the second Iraq War.  I still can't believe Gore lost the Presidency even though he really should of won.  I was definitely against the war in Iraq and this documentary proves why it wasn't necessary.  Although Moore points out the flaws in this country, some of his claims about the military are exaggerated.
B000M53GM2|4.0|A post-Cold War James Bond might have seemed unthinkable to some.  \\"Bondmania\\" was a by-product of the tense political and military stalemate that endured between the Soviet Bloc and the West for nearly four decades.  Against all predictions, the Cold War ended (thankfully) with more of a whimper than a bang.  As a country, we found ourselves  shout cries of joy and heave a few sighs of relief, but if it seemed to some to be \\"the end of history,\\" it also must have seemed like the end of a perfectly good storyline for filmmakers and pulp fiction writers throughout the Western World.    It took a few years, but by the mid-90s, there were new cultural anxieties to be addressed and a new James Bond to meet the challenge.  GOLDENEYE's relatively complex plot reflects those emerging anxieties, ones that we should have seen coming in '89 and '90, but were too euphoric to see.  A new Russia, in social and economic turmoil, and still in possession of thousands of WMD was never exactly a comforting thought.  GOLDENEYE capitalizes on the great uncertainties of the post-Soviet reality and comes up with a complex, murky plot alluding to warring Russian factions, its Eastern Bloc version of a \\"Wild West\\" mentality, and the political and moral chaos in which the nation found itself.  Throw in a British traitor (who, we learn, has his own axe to grind against Britain and the West) and you've got as nightmarish a political and military backdrop as the 60s era Bond flicks ever played against.    Pierce Brosnan waited almost a decade to play Bond.  The famous REMINGTON STEELE imbroglio that kept him from accepting the role in the 80s may well have been the proverbial blessing in disguise.  He himself has stated that, at age 33, he would likely have been still too boyish and callow for the role.  He may have been being overly modest, since he pulled off his TV role pretty well.  But he is correct that a good James Bond probably needs to be a bit older, wiser, more worldly and sophisticated--although still fit enough to not seem ridiculous in the stunt shots (whether he does his own or not).      In a post-Cold War World where political realities were both shaken and stirred, the new James Bond needed to possess a new kind of sophistication.  He had to at least be aware of the changing status of women, and his scenes with the new \\"M\\" (Dame Judi Dench) play on this changing reality.  Yes, by some standards, James Bond, once the coolest guy in ANY room, could be viewed as a dinosaur, and a SEXIST one at that.  That he really comes to genuinely care for his \\"Bond girl\\"--no, make that Bond WOMAN, the beautiful Russian computer whiz Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco)--helps with the obligatory make-over.  Does he transcend chauvinism?  Hard to say, but with as savvy and capable a female counterpart (to say nothing of the savvy, capable and exceptionally vicious female VILLAIN played by Famke Janssen) on hand to counter his every sexist instinct, it almost doesn't matter if Bond is fully converted or not. He's headed in the right direction, at least.    And at least, he doesn't make any \\"Auntie M\\" jokes in Dame Judi's presence.    I've read that, despite their box office success, the Pierce Brosnan Bond films were the least profitable of the series.  That probably gets into the kind of beancounting that M mocks herself for in the film.  However, it does suggest that, worldwide in the '90s, not as many people were interested in a \\"new James Bond\\" or ANY James Bond.  It's scarcely Brosnan's fault that the franchise was losing steam.  In the new Millennium, well, there's hope that the Daniel Craig version will re-invigorate the enterprise.     But timing is everything.  We were sorting out post-Cold War realities in the '90s, and it was difficult to see just what kind of hero we really wanted.  Now, things are getting plenty scary again, and the time is once more ripe for a steely, urbane and invincible James Bond figure to emerge.  If it can't be Sean Connery, well, Daniel Craig will certainly do.  But, in his day, Pierce Brosnan was no slouch.
B00005QB42|5.0|For what it is, a meditation CD, this is a perfect offering.  The lady's voice is incredibly beautiful, the melodies are haunting and uplifting, and the significance behind the words is both meaningful and calming.  Though it is definitely repetitious, mantras sung over and over, I have listened to it probably 50 times so far, know the words by heart, can sing the harmonies to her tracks, all levels, and find it  lends to repeated hearing.  I first heard it played very softly at my yoga class, and it caught my attention enough that I asked about the artist, then ordered the CD for myself.  I love it.  I come back to it again and again, for stress relief, for the energy boost that comes from the music but also upon consideration of the meanings.  It's lovely, a blessing. The production values are superb, the musicianship lush and complementary. Wish I could sing with her live.         Get this CD if you value your sanity.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|I hated this film. However I did love the soundtrack very much. It's far better than 'Begins', and I found it very epic and majestic.
0765360969|5.0|This is a great book series. It has a real cool magical fighting system, and the next book is just as good. It is definitely worth reading. I loved it.
B00002SSRZ|1.0|I borrowed this disc from my sister to see if it was worth laying out a premium for it in the aftermarket.  Buyer beware...this is a poor production.  The bass is almost non-existent.  The highs are overblown and the mix unto itself is bizarre.  If you want to pay a premium for an audiophile version of Abraxas then treat yourself to the stereo SACD.  It's really ashame as this would have been great album in 5.1 if done properly.
B000FC10MU|1.0|This is one of the few books that I couldn't finish.  Discussed it with my friends.  They couldn't finish it either.  It was hard to read, the plot (what plot?) was incomprehensible.  Didn't care about any of the characters. I read about 3/4 of the book before giving up.  I dislike not finishing a book I started but this one wasn't worth my time.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Shoot 'em Up is an over-the-top homage to 25+ years of action movies. Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) is a carrot-munching stranger who just happens to observe a pregnant woman being hunted down by a bunch of thugs.  He springs into action, killing the thugs and saving the baby, but losing the mom.  As is instantly apparent, Smith is no ordinary hero--he is a Special Ops killing machine who just happens to be at the wrong place at the right time.  The rest of the movie involves Smith trying to get the baby to safety and unravel the mystery of what is going on.  All the while he is pursued by the relentless & evil Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), who, in Smith, has inexplicably found an adversary that matches him.<br /><br />This movie is loads of fun, but is definitely not to be take seriously.  It somehow manages to glorify gun violence while preaching gun control.  To achieve this feat, the writers squeeze in every cliche imaginable (for example: not only was Smith's family murdered, he unknowingly sold the guns to the man who killed them).  Despite the cartoonish nature of the violence (especially Mr. Smith's lethal skills), both Owen and Giamatti are great in their roles and some of the lines they deliver are instant classics.  Giamatti is surprisingly effective as the hen-pecked bad guy, a welcome turn from his traditional roles.  All in all, a great movie to watch if you're willing to stop thinking for 90 minutes or so.  Its also a great advertisement for the benefits of eating carrots (which I've started doing).
031606792X|5.0|The storytelling in Breaking Dawn is excellent. Stephenie Meyer has a rare gift for knowing her characters and allowing them to be true to themselves. Bella's story ended the way I hoped it would, unfolding in a logical way from its beginning. It is a good book; people should read it through (perhaps after rereading the first three, to catch all of the threads) before passing judgment.
0316143472|4.0|I'm sure David Sedaris takes his stories from his experiences - the fun (for me) is wondering what really happened versus where his imagination took over.  No matter - his stories are full of his world-view that often made me laugh out loud.  Very entertaining.
0930289234|3.0|There is no doubt that this is a brilliant piece of writing-for some reason I just couldn't finish it-I guess it seems to me the story is not about a grand idea(I may have to read the ending to see if I'm wrong!)and if I'm going to invest the time I want something like Asimov's Foundation which involves the future of all mankind-this book may involve that theme, but about halfway through there is not enough of a tease to keep me interested and try as I might I was skipping pages just to get a ahead and finally stuck it on my bookshelf unfinished. I'm hoping the movie will tell me the ending!!
B00005JPUN|4.0|THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THIS IS FOR Kidman....Like Jodie Foster, Kidman plays a great woman in distress and she drags you with her every step of the way. Great fun.   OH! And Craig looks great with that mascara!
0061544493|4.0|I was not sure what I was expecting out of this book so I had no preconceived notions when I bagan. I really enjoyed reading this. I am a girl so naturally I love fashion. I found this book to be for me. I cant afford half of her recomendations, but its a fun book. One can apply many of her suggestions into our world of reality paychecks. I have always thought she has such a great style. I only bought this because I am a huge fan, but that doesnt mean one would neccessarily have to be a fan of VB to get something out of the book. Plus she's much funnier than I would have thought.
0399230033|1.0|A very poor book compared to \\"Goodnight Moon\\". Just mooching off the the \\"good night\\" kiddie book market.
0452289963|1.0|This is pure trash and a waste of your time but it is terrific, I'm sure, to people who are lost in this world.

B001BGTWXI|4.0|Ok people. The first album I heard by Slipknot was their third album. I love that album, I hold it in high regard as their best album they've made so far. I worked my way back and loved those albums as well. I can strongly say that I am a Slipknot fan. This said, I was a little bit uneasy about this album when I heard their two songs \\"Psychosocial\\" and \\"All Hope is Gone\\" on their website. It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. It sounded to random and unfinished. I ordered the album, played it, and I have to admit that this album is NOT bad. Every song has at least one great part to it, whether it's the chorus or the end or the beginning. I enjoyed thier slower songs like \\"Snuff\\" and \\"Dead Memories\\", but I liked thier faster more 'hardcore' songs like \\"This Cold Black\\" and \\"Wherein Lies Continue\\" also. If you enjoyed the Slipknot albums before this one, you will like it. It's not thier best, but it's worth having in your collection. I strongly recommend getting this album if you are a Slipknot fan or at the very least a fan of their 3rd album.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I am a huge Supernatural fan and the second season didn't disappoint me in any way. I love the non-stop action and the way the brother's relationship is always front and center. Supernatural isn't for everyone but if you love destorying monsters, crazy humor, sexy men and shows that all have wonderfully highlighted storylines, it's the show for you. I give the second season 5 stars. And am happily waiting for the third which I've pre-ordered.
0743496736|2.0|While I thought the story was interesting and kept me engrossed enough to finish it, I could not suspend my disbelief over some of the actions of the characters, and not all the characters seemed fully developed enough to be believable.  They all seemed to be invented to be played like chess pieces through the plot the author devised.
0930289234|5.0|I can't personally comment on the book since I didnt get a chance to read it. I had looked for this in every bookstore in NYC and it was out of stock everywhere.  My son who is an avid reader enjoyed the book immensely.  Although he left the book for me to pick up and read at my leisure, he ended up taking the book along with him when he left for college.
0062511408|5.0|Mejor libro que e leido hasta la fecha! Altamente recomendado! Te captiva ni ganas te dan de dejarlo de leer!
0938045695|4.0|I learned about kettlebells from a trainer at my gym, and bought this book to learn more about them.  Pros are easy to read, good humor, and easy to follow instructions.  Cons are the pain you'll feel after doing a simple workout consisting of swings and get-ups, and the money you'll part with to get his other books (he's a good pitch man, but I won't criticize him for that, because he's just living the good American capitalist dream).      You must be prepared, however, to find an RKC instructor and take some classes, because the instructors that are RKC qualified are all trained on the same standard Pavel covers in his book, and taking just a simple introductory class will definitely 'grease your groove'.  If you try these swings and get ups on your own with just reading the book, it's a lot like learning golf without lessons.  You may find yourself in bad habits that are very hard to break.  I took a class that covered the swing and the get-up, and it was definitely the smartest thing I've ever done for my body.  I found I was horribly restricted in my hip flexors and hamstrings, and therefore my form was lousy.  once my form was fixed, I knew was it was like to really get a kettlebell swing workout, and my hamstrings are screaming the day after.      This book is much better when used as a companion and reference to you when taking some RKC classes and getting the movements down from someone in the know.  Between the book and a three hour class, I've spent $100 but I can say that I've probably blown several times that over the years paying for gym memberships that I've never used.  If you buy yourself a good starter kettlebell and have a track near your house, you can start the RKC minimum program without difficulty, and in two months your body will look (and feel) like never before.    One last thought....get yourself a good stretching book.  Pavel has a couple, but I've not read them and therefore cannot recommend any particular title.  You WILL become more flexible in doing these (you'll have to if you want to save your back).  If you're tight in the hamstrings and hip flexors, you DEFINITELY 100% must take a class with some RKC instructors so you don't wind up doing permanent damage to your back.      RKC....better living through pain!!!
1400063515|3.0|page 14: I still do not understand why the author thinks that an educated person is supposed to guess better than a layman about the outcome of a war. In fact any person is as much expert in that endeavor as any other.      page 21: I still can not see the relationship between war and finance in the context.      for a philosopher examining problems in induction the boundary between true/false is not well drawn.    page 44: I wonder if he is naive. What does he expect in finance business, all reasonable people?. It is finances, it is almost expected that some people take unreasonable risks(with diabolical intentions sometimes) out of greed or out of wishful thinking. These factors are often excluded from his analysis.    I guess he also confuses the word \\"actuarial science\\" with \\"science\\". He frequently uses the word \\"science\\" for \\"finance\\" that has no roots in any of pure sciences, nor there are any independent mechanisms connecting the past and present.     From a person guarding against certainty it is ironical to see evolutionary psychology in use on page 53.     page 56: While talking about negative empiricism Taleb says \\"If I see someone kill I can be practically certain that he is a criminal\\". No, by no definition of \\"criminal/crime\\", killing necessarily implies crime (e.g. self-defense), all the while ignoring the gender bias. I do not want to be a killjoy here, but when accusing people of faulty logic in one paragraph, one can not afford to make an incorrect implication right in the next paragraph.    It is weird for a self-declared skeptical empiricist to resort to psychology while attacking mathematicians.    The references are not cited in the text, though listed in bibliography, which means its not clarified which piece is taken from which reference.    When the author generally ridiculed \\"fitting equations to something happened in the past\\" he swept all of cosmology into irrelevance with one stroke of pen.    page 87: We are social animals; hell is other people. // Nice quote    page 97: Got it wrong about hippo campus. This is where short term memory is translated into long term one.      He wants to attack actuarial mathematicians most of the time but ends up generalizing to all mathematicians. As a self-declared skeptical empiricist he is skeptical about truth in mathematics, what he does not understand is that even pure mathematics has engineering applications (e.g. control of hard drive motor). Nature does, to some extent, follow mathematics. This shows lack of depth in analysis.     page 107: Taleb criticizes \\"hardened by the gulag\\": The report is probably talking about psychological hardening which is supported by a neurobiological process described in \\"In search of Memory\\" by Eric Kandel. The author assumes it to be physiological hardening and refutes it with the rat example. In the next paragraph he calls himself philosopher.       page 129: In what Taleb describes \\"scientific mentality that is arrogantly called Enlightenment\\" agrees with Samuel Huntington's claims in The Clash of Civilizations that \\"the orthodox people do not share with the West the principles of Enlightenment\\".    page 129: He shouts \\"Life stands outside Platonic fold\\". No. pretty much all of engineering and many of pure sciences lie within and are verifiable and/or testable at the same time. These fields pretty much changed the society/culture for almost a century now.     page 154: Towards the end of the page - the author's question has geography in it and it is not surprising that the answers had that too, yet he complains about it.    page 182: He wanted to dispel Ludic fallacy and here is one instance he falls right into it. Talking about left and right handedness of people he brings Plato into picture, ridicules him and then says that the left and right handedness of molecules (stereo isomerism) matters considerably in this. There is no known evidence that stereo isomerism  plays a role in this and he does not present any.      What he fails to realize is that for people money is not the most important aspect of life. It is important but only after family and relationships, so even if his analysis is right(I think it is) his calls may go unheeded.     He also does not realize that people, whatever profession they are in are partly there due to financial security and not always to do their jobs perfectly. If the system is staying afloat with Guassian approach they would not need to change it. If they are shown tangible benefits with some results of the fractal analysis they may listen to the author. After all, at least some are after money.     chapter 18: He complains why philosophers are not questioning financial experts when they invest their money. A philosopher's job is not about figuring out details of finance, it is about figuring out details in philosophy which may or may not interfere with finance. A philosopher need not necessarily act upon his/her own arguments.       page 296: If what the author says about uncertainty is assumed to be truth about uncertainty(I do), even then in the authors own words towards the end of book, people may not necessarily heed his advice, especially as author says he put lots of things like culture, before truth, let alone acting on the truth.     As the author puts earlier, the Black Swan helps in getting rid of a big player and benefiting masses; so why fight (even negative) Black Swan in the first place, (for nationalists) as long the money stays within the country.    The author really does not make it clear early in the book the boundary between what he is attacking and what he is defending. Since the author mentions Richard Dawkins' book The Blind Watchmaker, he can take a cue from Dawkins' books about defining the boundary strictly and at the beginning so that the reader stays focused during the reading. Only after reading half the book was the boundary clear to me.    He claims himself to be humble at times but there are times where he delivers unreasonable and unfair criticism, sometimes just jumping to conclusions, like the on page 107.     By generalizing his attacks on Platonic ideas including mathematics, Taleb ignores much of physics. Mathematics still is useful in physics, the most rigorous science.
B000002LND|4.0|By the time this collection was released in 1990, Madonna had already made about 90% of her most essential recordings, so there certainly are several great songs here. However, this collection is flawed in a couple of ways. Some of her most essential songs, such as \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Borderline,\\" \\"Like A Virgin,\\" and \\"Like A Prayer\\" are all here, as they well should be. However, if you listen closely, you'll notice that many of the songs sound considerably different than they did on the LPs or cassettes that you had in the 80s. Also, some of the songs (noticeably \\"Borderline\\") have had quite a bit of their original length chopped off. Finally, there are some less-than-subtle omissions. \\"Dress You Up,\\" \\"Angel,\\" \\"True Blue,\\" and \\"Causing A Commotion,\\" which were all big hits, are curiously absent. What Madonna needs at this point is one of those Columbia/Legacy \\"The Essential\\" anthologies, because it's impossible to collect all of Madonna's greatest on a single disc, and it's somewhat surprising that after this much time, this album, along with GHV2 (which concentrates exclusively on the 90s) are the only Madonna hits collections available.
0321544080|4.0|This book if filled with brilliant images, and some great auto-biographical narration. However, while some of his explanations may work for beginners, I feel that most may become frustrated without some more in-depth information. As a senior, working on a BFA in photography, I found this book to be incredibly helpful and insightful, but it does require some foreknowledge. I am looking forward to discussing some of these things with my professors, so that I can better achieve some of the techniques that he discusses. A couple of years ago, though, I think that I may have been disappointed, and unable to get much from the book. Certainly, any experience level could appreciate and learn some amount from this book. I think it's important to keep in mind that, really, no photograph should be replicated just for replication's sake. Is it realistic to apply this knowledge to my photographs? Yes! Would I try to copy exact ideas, etc? No. I just don't see the point of reinventing an identical wheel. If that's your intent when thinking of buying this book, I don't think you'll find it satisfactory. Just my honest opinion....   -E
B000MXPE7Y|4.0|Well, let's get the weaknesses of this film out of the way first. Matt Damon (playing the lead role of Wilson), while likely cast for his ability to bring a silent, brooding, inscrutable intensity to his roles (which this lead role requires), is not really a good fit--too boyish in his looks, not enough gravitas to be playing someone as powerful as a CIA head guy, even one in his early years. I just didn't buy him in this role at initial viewing, though it had nothing to do with his acting abilities. And in fact, once this initial impression is gotten over, one recognizes that Mr. Damon actually delivers a very solid, nuanced performance; and his boyish looks actually become an asset whose strength lies in a sense that his character is, actually, a 'puer aeternis'--a perpetual boy who never learned what it means to be a true man in the sense that fatherhood would require. Next, Angelina Jolie was grossly miscast as the lonely, bitter, betrayed housewife--though Ms. Jolie manages. I believe these casting miscues distracted from the film's forward motion, and so cost the film greatly I think, with much of the viewing public.    But on to the strengths. I must strenously disagree with the Amazon editorial review of Jae Ha Kim, who gets it backward: While elements of casting were weak, the plot/theme was brilliantly played out, with a perfectly paced 2 hours and thirty minutes (roughly). De Niro's decision to use flashback sequences to tell this story required this kind of extended time frame, as they are less direct from a plot-telling standpoint; and the 'flashbacks' device very usefully allowed the audience to focus on how Wilson has arrived at his present position, plot-wise and thematically; the flashbacks also created tension and suspense, as this film is very much a 'whodunit.' The cinematography was also meticulous, complementing the director's attention to plot detail, which added (along with the flashbacks) to an effect of seeing the unfolding of events through Wilson's very meticulous eyes.    And beyond the plot development, we have what makes this film excellent, and highly underrated: The themes of 'loyalty' and 'fatherhood' set against a backdrop of National Security. The 'loyalty' theme involves the question, \\"which loyalty is most important: To country, to family, to fraternity (i.e., secret society running things), or to self?\\" The 'fatherhood' theme involves the exploration of Wilson's own failures as a father to his son, which are instigated psychologically by his own father's failure to BE a father to him (Wilson's father takes his own life when Wilson is a boy); it also involves Wilson's becoming, in a sort of twist, a 'father to his country' in becoming one of the founding 'fathers' of the CIA. De Niro (Directing) interweaves these two themes brilliantly. And in this, the film's true plot (from a thematic standpoint) is about Wilson's personal journey from fatherless boy to a man who's own attempts at fatherhood are undermined and betrayed by his psychological inability to be a good father to his son. The terrible irony is that the personal qualities that compromise his own fatherhood abilities are the very ones that make him an effective spy. Pointedly, the film askes, \\"is this a worthy tradeoff?\\" And using this thematic query as a launching pad, this film is rightly seen as being a critique of not only the CIA, but of the nature of international \\"spying\\" in general. Boys are left fatherless through confused notions of \\"loyalty\\" to--what? And are the costs worth it?    Ultimately, this film seems to be arguing that a person's inability to honor himself and his family first, both corrupts and aids, ironically, his attempts to honor so-called 'greater' national and international interests; that America herself, in a way, is left fatherless by those running it, because those running it lack the psychological ability to understand what true \\"fatherhood\\" (either of a child or a country) means, by virtue of themselves having been left fatherless by their predecessors' own misgebotten sense of loyalty. At the same time, the film poses the question, \\"what if, in the world of spying and counterintelligence between nations vying for power and survival, self/family values are not an asset, but rather a liability?\\"    Thus the film's title, \\"The Good Shepherd,\\" offers both a sarcastic irony, and a lament. An irony, as we watch these fatherless fathers of the nation fail their own families by giving greater loyalty to secret societies and notions of national \\"duty,\\" and by compromising their own moral high ground through twisted values of leadership. And a lament, for the world we live in is admittedly dog-eat-dog, and would appear to require a set of twisted values on the part of our leaders to ensure our survival.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|As one of the newly uninsured in the US (I have VA medical coverage which is NOT considered 'credible coverage'by insurance companies!) I cannot locate a policy which I can afford and which affords me coverage for so called pre-existing conditions.<br /><br />I was furious when I realized the inmates in Guantanamo, US prisons and our Congress have better insurance than the average American citizen! The most powerful and industrialized country in the world and we do not take care of our own. Moore hit the nail on the head with this one!
B0000AOV85|5.0|Any one who loved the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" should see this. Especially for all you musicians and recording engineers. I bought the album when it was first released on vinyl and wore it out, and bought it again.  And bought it again years later on CD.  This DVD is a must see for all true Floyd fans.
031606792X|5.0|I enjoyed the lastest book, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" as much as I enjoyed the other books.  I wasn't disappointed in the ending and I liked the fact that Stephanie Meyers could add to this Saga if she desired at a later date using other characters as the focal point with Bella and Edward in the background.  I found the book to be a love story with a lot of character strength.  This series has been fun to read.      okumura923
1416524800|5.0|I was already a fan of Dan Brown's from The Da Vinci Code & Angels and Demons, two books I absolutely loved & devoured. I don't think I have ever read books as fast as I read those two. They are brilliant. Deception Point has the same fast-paced style that keeps you turning the pages incredibly fast. Structure-wise, I like how Dan Brown uses short chapters to make the pace feel even quicker.<br /><br />Like many of you, after reading those two books I immediately sought out anything else written by Dan Brown. Once an author grabs you, you want more of what they have to offer. Deception Point is an excellent thriller in every way. It kept me riveted the whole way through. Not only does it have Dan Brown's trademark excellent research, but it also has wonderful character development & engaging relationships between the main characters. They seem like real people, and you care about them. I honestly did not want this book to end. It has twists and turns, and kept me guessing the whole way through. The story itself is utterly fascinating, a very clever thriller that is fantastic but also has enough to ground it to make it believable. A truly excellent read, highly recommended.<br /><br />Rai Aren
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig's blue eyes and body beautiful (and Eva Green's) are a draw...as well as the Bond storyline filled with action and romance. If you love British films, you should enjoy this one.
B0019X3YXM|5.0|Witty, entertaining, and clever--I loved this film. I thought the art direction and overall editting was top notch, and the story was wonderful.  It was devoid of stupid humor, which seems to be all the rage nowadays. That doesn't mean it wasn't funny, though!  Some moments of the movie brought tears to my eyes, and some moments had me laughing. All the moments in between weren't in the slightest way boring, either. I'm real picky about movies, especially those considered to be romantic comedy. This one is very well done.  I'll be watching the original version tonight, and I'll see how they both compare. Till then though, this has got to be one of my favorite films of the summer--right there with Penelope and Charlie Bartlett.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Happy music and a happy, feel good movie (Director, Nancy Meyers) (Music by Hans Zimmer). When I need a romantic comedy pick-me-up, I also reach for Love Actually, Wedding Date, You've Got Mail, Walk in the Clouds, Must Love Dogs, Mamma Mia...
0783225849|4.0|While i dont like the \\"slasher\\" films that i see coming out these days, I found the archtypal slasher film \\"Psycho\\" to be quite good. A few complaints aside, i can see why the film is considered a classic. Im actually quite new to Hitchcock's films but i quickly took notice to his signiture style. The film builds tension extremely well. The muisc is key in developing this. Even in scenes where the dialouge seems innocent enough the music made me apprehensive to what would come next. Hitchcock's unique cinematography is appealing to me as well. I think my favorite aspect of the film is Anthony Perkins' acting. He pulles off both sides of Norman Bates' dual personality extremely well. My only qualms with the film was that it was hard for me to follow Marrion's \\"motivation\\". In other words i didn't realize her intentions to steal the money untill she met Bates. Also, i think the psychiatrist gave to much information away at the end, taking away all the mystery that Hitchcock had so masterfully built throughout the film.
B0016A2FFG|3.0|This cd gets 3 stars because it's the great Al Green singing, the production values are super and the backing musicians are some of the best. The material is forgettable and does not compare with his earlier hits.  The arrangements seem like he is trying too hard to be what is happening today, almost a hip-hop feel at times. While the rhythm section knows how to make the music groove, I prefer the backbeat and groove of the Hi Records rhythm section.  I cannot think of a single track that stays with me.  I have not listened to this for awhile, and while looking at the track listings to comment on a some of the songs, none stand out to remember them well enough to comment.  I recommend one of his greatest hits albums or really anything else he has recorded. He is so good you can't go wrong buying anything with his name on it, including this one.
0780626966|5.0|The DVD'S were brand new and it shows just as clear if not clearer than the original's when they first came out.  And it was also cheaper to by from amazon.
031606792X|5.0|This is the happiest of all four books. All the characters get what they deserve and couldn't be more content in the end. I think it was the perfect ending to the Saga and I hope you enjoy it too. We live in a very cynical world and it's nice to be able to escape into such a happy fairy tale for a change.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|First of all this is a great record musically.  Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, the sound quality is horrendous.  How a recording engineer can put his name on the credits of this is beyond me.  I read a review recently that this same recording engineer admitted the compressed sound was not great, but not bad either.  His hearing must be in really bad shape.  Unless musicians stand up and protest such travesties of their recordings, we will continually be subjected to this.. Luckily, Neil Young and Bob Dylan are examples of artists who care about both the musicality and sound quality of their recordings and have set great examples with recent releases.  Please let the recording industry know and more importantly, the artists, that consumers want to hear good sound in addition to good music...
031606792X|4.0|This wasn't my favorite of the Twilight Saga, but I am happy that I have closure.  I can now sleep at night. I didn't really like reading from Jacob's perspective and I thought the imprinting and pregnancy thing was a little weird. I also prefer Bella as her accident-prone self instead of the super strong Bella.     Before this book was released I went back and forth with the idea of Bella being turned. I was for it, then against it.  The way the author wrote it, there was no other choice but to turn her. I am happy that she  got to experience all things human that she wanted.    This wasn't nearly as good as the first three, but I gave it four stars for a happily ever forever.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|Peter Jackson's Tribute Remake To The Classic 1933 Movie King Kong is Incredible. Peter Jackson proves that his success from The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy was no fluke.

Thanks to This Remake, King Kong is popular once again.

0307455874|5.0|It so happens that I'm finally getting around to writing this review just after the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention and just before Hurricane Gustav is about to make landfall at New Orleans. Both events underscore the importance of Barack Obama's book, The Audacity of Hope, in the public discourse of the early 21st Century. I think it's irresponsible for any American--and especially anyone who plans to vote in November--not to read it.    The next election for President of the United States is a contest between reason and emotion. At last week's convention, some of the greatest minds in the world today appeared in support of the most highly educated group of office-seekers in history (including both members of the Democratic ticket and their wives). From the euphoria evident in television broadcasts, a casual observer could get the impression that the entire event was about feelings. But it wasn't. It was about justice and poverty, nuclear proliferation and terrorism, the state of the planet and the state of humanity. Thoughtful speeches were made by brilliant people who have devoted decades of their lives to understanding these complex issues and struggling to make the world a safer, happier place.    Then Senator McCain made the astonishing choice of Sarah Palin--a woman who apparently believes in creationism but not global warming--to be his vice-presidential running mate. I believe that history will show that this was not a shrewd political move; it was an impulsive act by a famously impulsive man.    I first read a book about global warming in the 1970s. Even then, scientists knew that unchecked human expansion and the increasing burden of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would bring about dramatic changes in weather patterns, resulting in much greater variations of temperature and more violent storms than the earth has experienced in the brief period of human habitation. Hundred-year events would become annual events, and five-hundred-year storms would begin to be seen with some regularity. So why are some people still surprised that it's happening?    We are decades behind making the changes we should have been making to preserve the planet in a habitable condition for our children and grandchildren (much less generations beyond those of this century). In my opinion, we can no longer afford the luxury of political correctness or the laissez-faire attitude that one opinion is as good as another. We need someone leading the most powerful country on earth who is extremely well-informed, clear-headed, skilled in communication and consensus making, and concerned about the things we all should be concerned about. As this book makes abundantly clear, that person is Barack Obama.
0670020745|5.0|I selected this book wanting to read about the author's right brain experiences. For me this part of the book alone would have made it remarkable. But the information on how she healed and the implications for caregivers likewise were eyeopening. I wish I had read this book before the brief period my father was in a coma before he died. It has given me a new respect for the plasticity of the brain and the implications beyond strokes and I immediately began another book on that topic. Finally, at a personal level, the book has made me aware of the ability to shut off those annoying left brain dialogs as needed and move into a more joyful, compassionate place. This is a hopeful, wonderful book.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mixing CGI and hand drawn animation, Disney bring us one of it's greatest animated films, 'Mulan' is better than half the live action films that have come out in the last 10 years. Beautiful animation, exciting action sequences and an wonderful story make this a must see! The battle on the snow covered mountains in breathtaking and reminded me of one of Frank Frazetta's paintings. Most everything works in this film and Eddie Murphy provides a memorable character as Mushu the dragon in this exciting adventure movie. The 2 disc set is full of goodies and sports a great DVD transfer and audio.

1881273156|1.0|My ex (note ex)and I went to a marrage counselor and she recommended this book. It resulted with him buying me things (gift giving) and asking if I needed anything at the store (acts of service).  My ex was very content thinking he was following the book and making things better and it gave him the excuse to avoid the real problems. Neither the counselor or my ex listened to the real issues and couldn't understand why things wern't getting better. People should raise their standards and not marry anyone who doesn't know the ridiculous basics in this book....be nice. It kept us from getting to the real issues but I had nice gifts by the time I'd had enough and left.

Now what did I do with my lip gloss?...
B0000CFW87|5.0|They are calling it Neo-classical. It's the classically trained voice, singing with some \\"pop\\" quality, and singing newer compositions including modern instruments.<br /><br />Josh Groban has a fabulous singing voice, and the selection of songs on this recording is nearly flawless. I love the fact that he is helping to bridge the gap between \\"pop\\" and \\"art\\" musics.
B00008RH3L|4.0|With a bit of tightening-up, this powerful period piece could be even stronger.  I'm merely suggesting some editing out of a few unnecessary bits and shortening of some rather lengthy scenes.  That said, this film features a complicated plot, a superb cast, quite a bit of gangster/Prohibition era violence, beatings and shoot-outs, great music, and beautiful photography by Barry Sonnenfeld, who went on to become a director not long afterwards.  The Coens did not fare well with this at the box office, as it places many demands on the audience, but it is worth seeing at home if you have the patience to pay attention to it and stick with it.   Gabriel Byrne is riveting as the troubled and put-upon main character, while the very emotional John Turturro proves that no one is better than he is at begging for his life.  And if you like hats, well, you will be in hat heaven!
B0002JP4L4|3.0|Footloose starring Kevin Bacon made him a star and even though he is not the one dancing in the film, his charisma and acting chops makes this dancetastic movie worth a viewing or two. Lori Singer looks so much like Daryl Hannah, I can't tell them apart! John Lithgow is a riot, he knows how to make his characters memorable. Good flim for its time but pretty much dated now.
B001AEF6C2|3.0|This is not as strong an 80s comedy as some of John Hughes' other work is, but it is all right for a brief comedic diversion.  The acting is just okay, Kelly LeBrock is cute but not all that energetic, the music is mostly synth, and the wacko science that disrupts the household does not make a lot of sense, especially during the party scene, when a missile shows up along with some crazed bikers.  These distract from the basic storyline.    Otherwise, it is amusing enough for a cheap rental, but I would recommend Hughes' other work instead.
031606792X|4.0|'Breaking Dawn', by far the most bizarre, in the 'Twilight' Series, served as a light at the end of the tunnel for the saga. Nail biting drama and surprises await behind every page.

1572815612|5.0|This beautiful redrawing/coloring by Mary Hanson-Roberts of this most traditional deck is complete with a depth of color that many other versions of the same are lacking. If what you are seeking is a softer alternative to the bold colors and heavy black outlines of the \\"traditional\\" Rider deck, you've found it.<br /><br />Interpreting this deck is like resting on a soft pillow. This is my original working deck, and is still my second working deck, after the Robin Wood. It's an excellent place for beginners to start. There's no wondering why the images created by Pamela Colman Smith are singularly the most popular in the world. These images are timeless and are traditionally known as being easy to read, as well as providing depth and insight for the more advanced.<br /><br />This deck is pencil-colored with delicate, soft lines drawn around the faces and figures, and soothing rich colors within the cards. The backs are a fully reversible gold and indigo star field. The Fool in this deck is absolutely gorgeous with his gentle yellow sky and snuggly robe. The High Priestess is absolutely beautiful.  You will want to be enveloped by the velvety wings of Temperance.<br /><br />I found this deck to be excellent when coupled with [[ASIN:1578630487 Learning the Tarot: A Tarot Book for Beginners]] by Joan Bunning, which uses the Universal Waite for illustrations. This book gives a solid grounding in how to read Tarot, and along with this deck, you will be well on your way!
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is no light read. It's not meant to be taken to the beach or casually skimmed over during the course of a weekend. The fact that it's narrated by Death Himself should clue readers into the serious themes held within its pages. I admit that I had to be patient with the narrative at first -it seemed disjointed and difficult to get into, but the language was so vibrant and clever that the book wouldn't let me go. As a result, I was incredibly moved by the ending and can offer up the rarest praise: I will reread this book again in time. It is just that good, that powerful, and that important.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I LOVEE THIS SEASON! Donna is aMaZiNgLy played by the one and only Catherine Tate, and of course the Misters Tennant and Davies (as well as the entire Doctor Who team) deliver once more! The episodes are amazing!! And I cried for like two hours when I saw the ending! Its soooo sad, but sooo good, too!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE DOCTOR WHO!!!!!!!
B000MG1ZFQ|4.0|I was introduced to this record by Lester Bangs, who brushed it off as drek camouflaged by \\"horns, strings, and anything else they could bring in.\\" But this is probably as good as the Doors ever are, frankly. Take it or leave it: this is a real Doors album, and so it is no ordinary rock'n'roll record; in fact, sometimes it sounds like Frank Zappa parodying this period of the Doors. I have never presumed to know what the Doors' intentions were in the fields of irony or earnestness (note the \\"stronger than dirt\\" ending of \\"Touch Me\\" for obvious self-parody), and ambiguity is really afoot here. But compared to most rock made in 1969, this is a not only a solid record, with tight performances, but one with a compelling variety of textures and signatures, from the straight raunch of \\"Wild Child\\" to the odd-timed, poignant \\"Shaman's Blues\\" (one of their ten-best songs), to \\"Wishful Sinful,\\" a forgotten single, all bestringed and as weirdly compelling as anything R.E.M. has tried to do with similar charts (oops, is that good thing? Irony! I say thee, Irony!, then), to the 9-minute \\"Soft Parade,\\" which shows the Doors at full tilt in collage-mode. Tight as Booker-T and the MG's, with lusty and liturgical lyrics, like Updike through a kaleidoscope, it is introduced with one of Morrison's oddest rants: \\"when I was back in seminary school. . .\\". Not \\"seminary,\\" but \\"seminary school.\\" That inspired f-head! Here he is sublimely alone in the Western night . . . Stronger than dirt.

0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is a great read for anyone interested in a unique and compelling story of a personal battle of a violent teen with his surroundings and inner-conscience.  A Clockwork Orange draws in the simple reader with its raw brutality and violence and leaves them greatly affected with the social implications of this literary masterpiece.      Regarding the Russian-English slang spoken by the protagonist, Alex, and his fellow hoodlums; it's initially hard to comprehend, but after the first chapter, one should have no problem reading it.      This book is more than just a thriller - it also touches on the psychological and social aspects that are prevalent in today's society.

B000U0O9FM|5.0|The Fight Club book version in my Opinion is much better then the Movie. The Characters are both explained more and there actions detailed to a greater degree. The situations that in the film made me laugh in the book because of the better explanations made me laugh harder and longer. If you have never seen the movie definitely read the book first you won't be disappointed.
B000002J0N|5.0|Although some tend to think that CSN was better when accompanied by the highly credited & overrated neil young I definitely prefer the trio.  When present Neil young provided a more grungy anti-government feel to the music that I didn't prefer or appeal to.  CSN alone had more polished & balanced albums when young wasn't involved.  They dealt with topics of daily life & struggles of relationships whitout being too adult contemporary.  There are great songs here including cathedral which is almost progressive in nature as it deals with themes more commonly undertaken by 70s genesis, yes, rush, & elp. a song before I go, shadow captain, & cold rain are great examples of more emotionally charged songs pertaining to tough days, situations, & grief.  the songs take more time to develop than on other CSN albums & almost become coneptual in feel.  The vocals are more stirring & emotional.  The instrumentation is very organic & minimal but still provides direction & depth to the voices.  Dark star & fair game deal more with realtionships & are good efforts.  I would say that this album & daylight again are their best efforts in terms of consistentcy & balance.  this is their best album though.
0143113100|5.0|Although I'm not in the field at all, I found this book enlightening and fun to read. The author illustrates his points about brain plasticity through case studies and mini-biographies of groundbreaking researchers and therapists in the field, including the story of a woman born with only half a brain who amazingly adapts. Easy to read and non-technical, the book traces the history of prevailing scientific thought on brain structure and function, makes a convincing theoretical and practical case for plasticity, and shows how powerfully and positively plasticity concepts can be applied to real life situations to rescue \\"hopelessly\\" damaged people from their pain and suffering.
B000002KKX|3.0|1978 christopher cross = unknown.  Then in 1979... Though a giant success (multiple grammies in 1981), this album & cross have been written off as middle of the road & adult contemporary (which is somehow immediately negative).  If people really examine the talent of cross & the elements of the album they may be surprised at the respect cross garnered in 1979.  1st of all this album has a huge list of guest musicians & vocalists - lenny castro, nicolette larson, JD souther, henley, tim b schmidt, eric johnson, michael omartian & most notably michael mcdonald whose vocals are very evident throughout the album.  Cross is a very underated guitarist & vocalist.  The musicianship is incredible thru & thru. The album begins with say you'll be mine which is poor but gives insight to the direction of cross's vocals & musical direction.  Next is really don't know which immediately demonstrates his vocal range & guitar playing & features mcdonald's great vocal range which complement's cross's.  Never be the same is also great song & features great piano & guitar performances.  Ride like the wind (well known) is another great cross/mcdonald collaboration & has a great hook with some good tempo changes.  The light is on features henley, jd souther, & tim b schmidt (eagles) which continues their backing vocal list (others include seger & boz scaggs).  The eagle contribution also provides further depth in a great album demonstrating some respect from the established music scene.  Sailing is good but known & no more to say.  An overlooked song is minstrel gigolo & is sings thru sombers moods with great drumming & vocals.  I think this an album that began the 80s with an intellectual earmark.  Though cross couldn't have been rewarded more for his effort by the industry he has been disrespected by those who feel mainstream ballads are all for the birds. that's crap
B00005JKED|3.0|I finally sat down and watched this film and was left with a feeling of \\"ok?\\"<br /><br />Denzel Washington does a great job in his role.  He is fun to watch as he took Jake Hoyt(Hawke) through a day on the streets of LA to see if he will fit in his Narcotics unit.  Washington does a good job playing an amoral character as he toys to with Jake to see how far he will go into the dark side and make amoral choices.<br /><br />Times I was wondering if Alonzo is simply evil or a master of the mind screw as he seems to be testing Jake.<br /><br />There are many tense scenes but overall the script is not that great as it seems to center on Alonzo posturing.  Even in the end I did not finding myself disliking Alonzo which I think was the intent of the writer.  Overall, the script was not tight.  What of the amoral men of Alonzo's unit?  Would they not go after Jake?  The corrupt officials you see in one scene?  Many questions are left unanswered.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad film.  I think it's overrated as even though Washington does a great job; I don't think script was tight enough to have you debating if Alonzo was evil or truly a master at testing how far a person will go.<br /><br />There are extras and I only looked at a couple of things as the majority did not interest me.
B000068FWC|4.0|although being supertramp's most commercially successful album (#1 in uk & US), breakfast in america is also very intellectual & musically aggressive.  By the time they recorded this album, hogdson & davies were at odds about the material & album name.  As each of them shared arranging, writing, & lead vocal duties, they were beginning to want more control.  Davies did not like the song breakfast in america or the name of the album.  Davies liked working title or hello stranger as album title & wanted to leave BIA off the album.  Obviously there was a consensus & hodgson won the battle.  That's music... it not only challenges the listener but the artists as well.  as they look for their role in the band with ideas & control, a great piece of art is produced through argument & consensus.  The album is much more pop oriented with 4/4 patterns than previous albums but still retains aspects of their symphonic/progressive rock roots.  The album opens with gone hollywood & reveals strong high-octave backing vocals by hodgson which remains the trend throughout.  The song contains the tempo changing & heavy piano playing characteristic of the previous tramp efforts.  The logical song follows & uses a rock/jazz electric organ/piano which would remain a staple in the album as well.  Hodgson's vocals are incredible here showing an edgier & more aggressive singing style.  Goodbye stranger is my favorite davies song besides school & has a great organic groove accompanied by more hodgson vocals. Breakfast in america follows & has unique carnival-like sound that has great vocals as well.  Then the epic take the long way home starts with its eerie synth srings & more carnival-like stuff.  2 overlooked songs are nervous wreck & child of vision as they possess the same power-charged vocals & heavy keyboards.   Although less progressive the album is quite consistent & almost conceptual with pessimistic social undertones which was a common theme in the late 70s in music (rush/genesis/elp/queen).  Supertramp also mimics pink floyd in a way with their alternating vocals within songs.  It is also very ahead of its time from a production standpoint.  Also clarinet became a rock 'n roll instrument after this thanx to helliwell.  Sibenberg's drumming is also quite aggressive & inventive.  The drumming, though, is partially harmed by the low tuned toms which produces a muffled sound.  All in all a great album that closes the seventies & welcomes the 80s.
0060935464|5.0|Few characters in all of literature are as captivating as Scout.  Read it just so you can know her.
B000P7V45S|4.0|much more commercially successful than all of their previous gabriel-era albums combined (in terms of sales), the continuing foursome proved that there was life with their new frontman.  As collins took the mike genesis seemed to reinvent their sound & motivation with a more diplomatic approach in the studio (where before tony & peter had most of the mucical control).  The sound of \\"trick\\" retains some of its symphonic keyboard sound but encompasses a much harder & aggressive drum sound from phil.  Although considered a reveered progressive rock album trick of the tail has many more basic 4/4 rhthym patterns than some of its processors.  The album blasts into dance on a volcano (probably the most rhythmically sopisticated on the album) indicated a much harder-edged sound with vocally charged energy.  The song is in a very weird time signature.  Robbery, assault, & battery is a great piece of muscianship which uses some sequencer bits (1st for genesis to date).  ripples is an awesome saga that tells of a finite life accompanied by charged acoustic guitars (rare for collins-era genesis) & moog synths. Squonk is one of my favorite genesis songs & resembles kashmir (according to banks).  A trick of the tail is an often overlooked song & is great song.  Los endos ends the album with an explosion of great progressive rock expression & became a great live performance.  mad man moon & entangled show a new softer side of the band but still retaining great musicianship.  This album shows how easy it was for collins to become a lead vocalist.  He was obviously very focused & motivated when considering his arrangements.  They're charged with emotion & strength & would only get better through the years.  I think this album is also improtant beacuse they proved that peter wasn't the main driving force.  Rutherford & Banks did most of the writing & collins was the main arranger.  Steve was absent during the intiial writing as he was recording voyage of the acolyte (forcast of thefuture).  the album was coproduced by dave hensctchel (well known - elton, queen, oldfield).  The album is heavily dominated by collins's & banks's sound & per usual, hackett's guitar is soft & unaggressive. The new package is okay but drowns out the keyboards & drum acoustics.  The dvd features are good with the original genesis live & interviews.  GOD STUFF!!!  but as for all of the new compressed remasters they aren't as strong as the 1994 remasters.

0307386171|4.0|Unlike McEwan's \\"Saturday\\", this story does not take place all in a single day,but still, most of the story centers on the events of a twenty-four hour period. The author's inimitable use of foreshadowing made this reader want to climb into the story and \\"do a little counseling\\". The inability of the two central characters to communicate their inmost emotions leads to unbelievably sad and irreparable consequences for them.  Fortunately, the story can be read in one or two sittings, so the final resolution isn't long in coming.

B00008438V|4.0|I recently picked up a copy of weird science on dvd and when watching it noticed some of the original dialogue was cut. The scene when Gary and Wyatt first start to make the girl Gary makes a comment on enlarging the size of her breasts. On this dvd you can see his mouth move but no words are heard. Why this little bit of dialogue would be cut is beyond me but none the less it is so this is really not the movie in its original form. I was 14 when this movie came out and i watched it alot when it came out on vhs and i even have a copy of it on vhs from about 15 years ago with the missing dialogue intact. Hopefully on the new release in september they will have this corrected.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|great movie.  russell crowe does a bang up job.  he reminds me of richard burton and if he keeps his ego in check should be a fan favorite for years to come.
B001BGTWXI|4.0|The idea behind 'All Hope is Gone' is that Slipknot is trying to say that the hope of figuring them out is gone.  The album runs similar to Volume 3, but in my own opinion, slightly higher.  While I do not like every track on this album, they are all very well produced and performed.  'Hope' definately has the best rhythm of all the other albums to date and easily the tighest production, but this is also where it begins to depart from the other albums.  The album lacks the raw savagery of loose, animalistic playing.  The guitars are more focused on tight rhythms and intricate solos, versus the older albums, where they tended to have a more beastial sway to them.  The drums are much more studied and almost seem to be the only Slipknot sound which is carried over.  The turn-table is fairly mute and the bass is mostly back-up.  The vocals are strong, but at points a tad too sappy, which draws away from the previously murderous, maniacal voice which added to the mystique of Slipknot.  Talent shines brightly on 'Hope' and it is overall a very well made album, but it does seem to be hollow in spots.
0061139378|4.0|This is the first work that I have read from Neil Gaiman, and I am pleasantly entertained. I chose to read this in quick form as I am an animator and most recently saw the \\"making of\\" for the film adaptation currently being produced by Laika. I liked the premise of the film and this book certainly did not disappoint. I feel the story is seductive and interesting, yet it seems obvious that the writer has made some concessions regarding character detail and overall exposition to progress the story and keep the pacing. It is a quick read and although a bit derivative (alice in wonderland meets a nightmare before christmas ...a bit of stretch to be sure, but it is closer than you would think.) In the end, aside from some abbreviated portions that sacrifice character motive, I feel that this short book is a good read for most readers who enjoy a bit of whimsy and imagination in their stories. In truth, although I do not have children, I would caution against having younger readers explore this book as the latter chapters introduce somewhat frightening subject matter, including everything from a disembodied hand to an amorphous shape changing creature...Overall, it is a well crafted execution and something to be enjoyed...
6302439566|5.0|I have read many substandard and insulting reviews about this movie and I have to say \\"GROW UP\\" It is amazing how many people take a movie and dismiss it as total garbage. It doesn't matter what it is, It could have been a blockbuster motion picture that sold billions of dollars yet some poor sap will find anything to write that is insulting about any movie. Perfect, was by no means a blockbuster hit nor the greatest movie I have seen, yet it was fun, entertaining and had a good plot. If those people who are paid to criticize movies would take a closer look at the caliber of the movie and it's title and say \\"oh yeah, now I get it\\" The word perfect is used quite frequently in the film to generalize a situation or make a sound statement, as does the fit bodies featured in the film.  Take a look at this film with an open mind, dismiss it however you choose. I thought it was a good movie. It has all the aspects of human nature we all want to portray but sometimes can't, looks, personality and popularity. It seems those that do the reviews for movies have none of the above.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|Adele is a true artist.  I can't stop listening to this CD.  Every song is different and fantasic.  She sounds years older than she is.  I can't wait to see what she comes out with in the years to come...

B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie, with excellent and easy English subtitles, is elaborate and subtle but totally clear. It is about a Totalitarian government (The GDR or \\"East Germany\\" before Reagan forced the USSR to tear down the Berlin Wall) which wants to KNOW EVERYTHING about you, ostensibly to protect the Socialist State against its enemies. The \\"Stasi\\" or state police, like all puffed up self serving bureaucracies, love to develop and maintain \\"files\\" on everyone and they see in this activity great potential for career advancement. The Stasi are the vilest of bureaucrats using any method to turn people against each other and to develop \\"informants\\" who in turn betray their friends, leading to personal and professional ruination or imprisonment. The heroes battle this system and the plot turns on the inner transformation of one of the Stasi officials. Great Movie.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I am a huge fan of Linkin Park, and i was vastly dissapointed in the album as the sound was not LP worthy.

0385340990|5.0|Prepare for another glowing review, because I've just decided that this is my favorite book of the year so far.<br /><br />After wrapping up her very successful book tour, Juliet Ashton has no idea what to write next about her post-WWII world.  She receives an unexpected letter from Dawsey Adams, a resident of Guernsey Island, who has a book that she once owned and read it constantly while his island was occupied by Nazis during the war.  Juliet begins a correspondence with Dawsey and eventually, the other members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, but she has no idea she'll find so much more than an idea for a book through these wonderful people.<br /><br />These characters are enchanting.  I fell in love with them just as Juliet did, and the longer the book goes on, the deeper I fell in love.  This book is entirely written through letters, and at first I found it a bit disconcerting, but soon it made sense.  It's hard to describe, but there is something that is comforting and wonderful about reading this book; like it could reaffirm our faith in humanity, despite the atrocities that went on during the occupation of the island.  It celebrates life and love while directly placing them in the shadow of World War II.  Putting life in perspective, making us realize how lucky we are, I'd say, with a cast of marvelous characters and a distinctly enjoyable prose style.  It's a story that doesn't surprise you, but pleases you when it goes above and beyond your expectations.  It creates a world that I honestly never wanted to leave, and as soon as I finished I wanted to read it all over again.<br /><br />This book deserves the hype.  I highly recommend it to absolutely everyone.

B000R7GKQE|4.0|The second season of supernatural really fleshes out the bond between Sam and Dean Winchester.  While the first season has more mysteries in the beginning, the second season introduces more allies and I think more of the episodes in season two stand alone.  Overall each season of supernatureal seems to get better. This season is proof of that.
031606792X|5.0|This fourth installment of what has become known as the \\"Twilight\\" series is a must-read for anyone who has found themselves sleeplessly reading the first three novels in the course of a very late night. The 700+ page book is as addicting as the first book by Stephanie Meyer, if not more so. The outcome could not have been better for Edward, for Jacob, and, of course, for Bella. Theirs is a completely intertwined love that will last beyond the end of time. It makes me want to be a vampire!

B001AW9DKK|2.0|This is NOT the \\"Déjà Vu\\" album played live as you might be led to think! It is most of Neil Young's protest-album \\"Living with war\\" played live! It's not at all what I expected from the title. I feel I've been conned this time. I hold the \\"Déjà Vu\\" album to be one of the best ever! It's as fresh today as it was 38 years ago! This is yet another cd that tells you that they are over-priced, but so cheap to make they shouldn't cost more that 5$ at the most. And that might also reduce home-burning cd's.

B000SFJWLU|4.0|As many other reviewers have already said, this album is much in the vein of Pantera and Nu-Metal, with Low stung mellodies and many pace changes throughout each song.  There is a lot of screaming and anger/angst released on this album.  I feel reguardless of the musicians backgrounds, they do hit thier target audience of teenage to 20 something males right in the teeth with grinding riffs and melodies to get a mosh pit going. Favorite tracks are The Bleeding, White Knuckles, and The Devil's Own.  Go out and purchase this album if you are a fan of Nu-Metal and Pantera.    FYI: There are two versions of this album out there,The original 10 track version and the newest 13 track version which includes 3 new tracks \\"Never Enough\\", \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\", and \\"The Bleeding\\" (acoustic).  Amazon is not listing this yet, but look for it at your favorite stores and websites going for the same price!!!!
0451457994|5.0|The most realistic depiction of space travel I have ever seen or read (if you don't count the NASA documentaries). The incredible meets the mundane every day. It isn't better than the movie, but neither is it worse. Personally, I prefer it to the movie because Clarke can actually explain to you what is happening during Bowman's transformation, whereas in the film you are stuck with some crazy surrealism and a guess as to what has become of Bowman.
B00001R3GF|5.0|This is one of the best Stones albums ever!!! I love the way they poke fun (especially about New York in Shattered.) Every song on this album is different in its own way and you just cannot sit still. If you can sit still during this album you are surely dead.  After dancing around for the whole album I am pooped.  It is GREAT.  One of their best.

0452277752|5.0|This is a collection of four early Stephen King novels, written under the pen name Richard Bachman. The voice is pure King. The stories...not so much. They are some great stories, but this book is probably more important to King fans and completists than it is the average reader.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|\\"The Bank Job\\" is an adrenaline rush from start to finish.  Generally these type of films don't work for me because the capers themselves aren't really that interesting.  This film, however, brought to my mind such classics of the genre as John Huston's \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\" and Stanley Kubrick's \\"The Killing\\".  I think the reason for that is the aftermath of the heist is the most interesting aspect of the film where interested parties other than the police, such as the underworld and the Crown, try to nab the culprits.  This film is also a step forward for Jason Statham.  Statham, the unofficial king of the Labor Day weekend movie dump (see \\"Crank\\" and \\"War\\"), gets to work with a prestige director like Roger Donaldson here and carries the film in glorious fashion.  For those who don't mind a little rough stuff this flick is not to be missed.

B000J10ERO|3.0|When I originally saw the movie in the movie theathers back in 2006, I remember it had enough qualities to make it a good popcorn movie but ultimately it felt kind of empty.      My main issues with the movie are that it's bogged down by the melancholy that's portrayed by the alienation of Superman and I did not buy Brandon Routh on the screen as Superman.      How many times do we have to see Superman standing alone above the city in front of a setting sun appearing to be deep in-thought as a Christ-like figure??  Instead of sludging through the movie like it's some sort of melodrama, why don't you have the most powerful being on the planet take on a problem with a much wider scope, more powerful villians (e.g. Brainiac/Doomsday), and more action with the tempo picking up at the end of the movie instead of another plot with Lex Luthor coming across more Kryptonite to use against Superman.      As for Brandon Routh, the only time I found him to be believable in the movie was the first 15 minutes when he portrayed the Smallville/Kansas version of Clark Kent.  When the movie progressed to Metroplis, I felt like he was trying to imitate Christopher Reeve's version of Superman.  I believe he should have abandoned the nebbish/comical take that Reeve perfected in his movies and should have played Clark with more originality.  Also, he never demonstrated the proper amount of authority (or maturity) and charisma when he was Superman.  When he ran down the street, taking off his work clothes and showing the \\"S\\" on his costume, he looked like a nervous wet-behind-the-ears kid...instead of looking like the confident modern-day Hercules who's grown into being Superman.    I just hope for Man of Steel, they correct these issues and develop a movie that does Superman justice.
140004281X|4.0|Alice Munro's collection was not uplifting, but it was unusual and worthwhile because of the author's uncanny ability to marry strong imagery and often unsettling glimpses into her characters' personal motivation. I was very impressed that she did not avoid introducing confused and muddled characters.     Initially, it was difficult for me to adjust to the author's writing style (syntax), but as I moved through the book, it became a metaphor for the author's meanderings through a collection of fascinating psyches.  The dialogue is good, but the strength of this author is how well she conveys the thoughts and emotions that are not always shared with other characters in the story. Not all the selections were equally impressive, but I found almost all provocative. Ms. Munro has the uncanny ability to command our attention for the duration of her storytelling.     As for the publishing technique.  It confused me that this book physically resembles a novel with numbered chapters. Most short story collections present title pages for each short story. This format did the author a disservice and confuses purchasers.
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|I miss the good old days of action flicks when they were helmed by great directors like McTiernan, Cameron, and Harlan and you had average Joes like Bruce, Arnold, and Sly saving the world.  Everything today is so CGI.  About the only actor today that meets the standards of yesteryear is Jason Statham.  The latest installment of \\"Die Hard\\" has it's cake and eats it too.  For sure there's alot of CGI but Willis makes you believe that he's getting his butt kicked by a Harrier.  The story combines post-911 paranoia, cyber-warfare, and old fashioned shoot-em-up in comvincing fashion.  The action in this flick never lets up.  In the center is Willis returning to the John McClane character like a favorite old shirt not unlike Harrison Ford in the recent Indiana Jones film.  So have your soda and popcorn or as McClane would have it a beer and hot dog and enjoy the fireworks.
0060837551|5.0|I first read this book in 1977 when it was released and it was the best book I had ever read.  It started me on a lifetime of loving multi-generational family sagas with characters I could never forget, characters such as the indomitable Meggie Cleary whose story is the heart of THE THORN BIRDS.<br /><br />We first meet Meggie on her fourth birthday.  She is the daughter of Fee and Paddy and living in New Zealand with her brothers Frank, Bob, Hugh, Jack, and Stuart.  Later, more brothers would be born---Hals, Jims, Patsy---but Meggie remained the only girl, a steadfast spirit born to love the land and one unattainable man.<br /><br />Paddy's older and childless sister, Mary Carson, has the Clearys come live and work on Drogheda, her vast Australian sheep station.  It is there they meet Father Ralph de Bricassart, Mary's friend and confidante.  He and Meggie are immediately drawn to one another, and though she is merely a child, a lifelong bond between the two begins.  A bond both all-encompassing and all-forbidden compromises both their lives and gives the reader a deeply poignant love story that transcends time and conventions.  A woman who can love only one man and a priest who can never love a woman more than he does his God makes for a powerful tale that leads from the outback of Australia to the most hollowed halls of Rome, enchanting Greek Islands, and London's bustling streets.<br /><br />Meggie suffers through a miserable marriage and bears two remarkable children.  There is Justine, the headstrong girl who turns her back on Drogheda to pursue the life of an actress in London, and Dane, the perfect son who Meggie loves most, but must give back to God to atone for her sins.<br /><br />Searing in its dramatic love story and rich with the local color of Australia, THE THORN BIRDS is a remarkable novel, one often compared to GONE WITH THE WIND.  Having reread it now after thirty-one years, I am struck again by its beauty, its enduring themes of love, betrayal, and redemption, and can only give it the highest of recommendations.ly give it the highest of recommendations.

B001B71NOI|3.0|(This is a review of the product itself, not the music..)<br /><br />Great album, not the strongest of Reznor's, but one of his most outright heavy efforts since \\"Broken\\" and a welcome follow up to Year Zero. Be warned, however, that the copy I received has a distinct warp on one edge of the vinyl. Although I should have learned my lesson after getting 5 warped copies of \\"With Teeth\\" from Amazon earlier this year I still clicked \\"buy\\" and took my chances. Due to returning what feels like too many warped LPs I just gave up on returning this one and am instead dealing with the frantic jumping of my sub-woofers from the first track on each side. It certainly doesn't help that this record has such a low volume in comparison to nearly everything else I own so it must be CRANKED to a ridiculous degree to get as wonderfully loud as the CD or digital download versions. I should feel like a sucker for buying a \\"free\\" album in the first place... this is the only NIN vinyl I regret purchasing. Music is great, packaging is gorgeous, sound transfer to vinyl is just \\"alright\\" (even at 180 Grams), and the product is borderline defective. Question to Amazon: \\"How are you storing these?!?!\\" Stick with the FLAC lossless available from nin.com. It's free and sounds superior to this usually mind blowing format. There is quite a bit of surface noise on the disc as well, likely due to having to turn it up so much. A few pops on first spin as well. I have decent equipment, so this is rather annoying.<br />This may not be news to you, prospoective buyer, but some digital recordings just don't translate well to vinyl. Bjork's \\"Vespertine\\" has hissing on the vocal \\"S\\" sounds, fuzzy hi-hats and distorted chimes. No good. Another recent Nine Inch Nails release, \\"Y34rz3r0r3m1x3d\\" translated wonderfully, having gorgeous range and depth with rich lows and crisp highs.<br />\\"The Slip\\" is more or less in the middle of those two examples in the way of transfer quality. Tolerable but not great.<br />If you're a hardcore collector then I suppose there is no swaying you. For a casual nin/vinyl enthusiast, I wouldn't recommend this music on this format merely on the grounds it just doesn't pound the same way the other formats do. Hope that helps someone out there.re collector then I suppose there is no swaying you.

0756404746|5.0|I don't see how I can describe this book. It is, without any doubt, the finest book I've ever read.  It is fantasy at it's finest, an original story in a field of hacks.  I love fantasy novels, and I don't even particularly care if they're original or not.  But then this book came along, and it destroyed my conceptions of what fantasy should be.  Ironically, from a person who read primarily fantasy, my two favorite books before I picked this one up were Dune and Neuromancer.  This one is so much better than either of those that it's hard to compare them.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.

I bought it without reading the excerpt, and was happy to discover the book is narrated by the main character, Enzo.  Enzo describes his life with the family, the funny stuff, the happy times and the extreme difficulties Denny (Enzo's master) faces later on, with such intelligence and insight only a dog could provide.<br /><br />I will warn you- crying... the sobbing type of crying... will occur.

B00005AAFS|5.0|This is the first Rammstein album I've owned and contains some of the first Rammstein songs I'd ever listened to.  Having a taste for alternative rock and some heavy metal, I was studying abroad in München (that's Munich), Germany, during the summer of 2001 and found out that one of their new albums was out.  I went into a local record store there and purchased \\"Mutter\\", almost on a whim (having up to that point only heard their single \\"Links\\", and watched the awesome music video thereof).    Having written a few reviews on here almost upon purchasing other albums, I have no idea why I'd never bothered to write one for Mutter.  Quite frankly, it's up there as one of my most favorite albums of all time!    I'm not going to go song by song by song, but I will tell you that I feel that every song on this album is worth a listen - those that lack musically make up for it in lyrical depth and cleverness (very typical of Rammstein!).    Nonetheless, highlights:  -- \\"Adios\\": A fast-paced, punk and grunge-like tribute to a musician who dies of a heroin overdose.  Hmm, wonder who that was.  -- \\"Zwitter\\" (Hermaphrodite):  Don't let this addictive dance track's beat hide its clever lyrics from you.  From my interpretation, it's about two lovers (perhaps spouses) who become so in love and entwined that they essentially merging into one, making activities such as say, buying roses, completely moot.  Furthermore, this couple/hermaphrodite is (as per the lyrics) not offended when to go told to f*ck itself.  Not kidding.  -- \\"Mutter\\" (Mother): Title track.  Absolutely gorgeous verses and symphonic backing.  Wish there were an actual chorus, though.  Interestingly, my mother loved the song (and she doesn't know a lick of German).  -- \\"Nebel\\" (Fog): Amazingly haunting orchestral backing to a track about a man and his dying wife.  -- \\"Links\\" (Left): Amazing irony and contrast between the musical feel and the lyrics.  The former reminds one of a Nazi/militaristic march, but the lyricsare about the band being quite the opposite!  The video is probably the best music video I've ever seen (you may wish to look it up on YouTube).  -- \\"Mein Herz Brennt\\" (My Heart Burns): \\"Rolaids\\" puns aside, this lyrical tribute to Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\" is a great example of where a staccato orchestra can really make a song frightening and yet cool!    There are other highlights, including the first European single, \\"Sonne\\" (Sun) (about a champion Polish boxer; the original working title was in fact the name of the boxer, which at this time I forget).  Others include the pressure cooker \\"Feuer Frei!\\" (Fire Away!) as well as the fan-mobbing \\"Ich Will\\" (I Want).    There may be a couple I left out.  But that doesn't matter.  What DOES matter, though, is that this album is the only one out of the 10 I've reviewed (as of September 2008) to garner FIVE stars.  The other great albums I own (including others by Rammstein) only get four.    So, in conclusion: For an 11 track rock-solid hard-rocking album with a deep teutonic and gothic underside, \\"Mutter\\" is the first place to shop.
0316067601|2.0|This book would have been a good article in a magazine but not a book.  Mostly it is about SEAL training and the background of the author( heavily ghost written).  Not to take anything away from the accounts of the men, but this just isn't substance for a book.

B0000062FJ|5.0|This was another favorite of mine from my childhood, my older brother had it, and I used to listen to it over and over, as he tried to teach me how to play Black Magic Woman on the six string acoustic.<br /><br />The thing about this album is it is so different from anything else, not only in the fusion of Latin-jazz-funk into the rock, but mostly for the introduction to the \\"voice\\" of Santana's guitar. There are a few vocalist, who you can easily identify within a bar of any song, but there are also a few musicians, and most notably, Carlos Santana, whom you can easily identify with a bar of instrumental. Amazing collection of artist, with an amazing collection of songs and Carlos Santana makes this one of the very best albums of the late '60s.<br /><br />So here's the deal, for those of you that remember, if you don't currently have a copy of this great album, well, you know you should! And.. for those of you too young to have heard this entire  album, you really owe it to yourself to see what it is all about. You won't regret it.

0316010669|5.0|A very interesting and clever book. We know more than we might think when it comes to making judgments. Malcolm Gladwell provides excellent examples of how we can improve our decision making by paying more attention to our intuitive side. He's not suggesting that information gathering and research be ignored, only that we also consider the benefits to be derived from learning and making decsions in a different way. His examples are fascinating and the book's long term high ranking is well deserved. It's a hard book to put down.
B0017HRCQU|4.0|Batman begins is a great movie, there is no doubt about that as I'm sure you all know. That's just it though.. its the only thing great about this set. The postcard picture's are nice but whatever you know? And the comic is alright but it doesn't really have any of the character's you wanna see, it's just the bank job from The Dark Knight so it's no big deal. In the end I can only recommend this movie the the truly HARD CORE hard core fans of the new batman movie's. For me (a fan of batman but not a hard core fanatic) just the blu-ray it's self would have been a better buy.
0307383415|4.0|Having read \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" and been incredibly inspired by it, I expected more of the same thoughtful discussion when I moved on to \\"Dreams From My Father.\\" Was I ever surprised to discover an American Novel - with soaring descriptions, gifted human characterization, and appropriate suspense. Those who read this book hoping to get an inside look at a potential president will get what they paid for. Those just hoping to read a good story about the American experience will find what they want as well - even if they had never heard of Barack Obama (due to living on another planet, no doubt). As a white woman in the younger generation, with a less jaundiced view of race relations, I cringed early on at all the racial obsessions Barack entertained as a young man. Then I was grateful to get this inside look at what are true issues for my fellow citizens of color. (It's been a while since I read Alice Walker and Toni Morrison.) Once I understood that Obama was presenting his struggles with identity as an honest attempt to explain the complex issues that being interracial present, I relaxed and appreciated the candor. My only criticism, from a casual reader's perspective, is that the departures from narrative on his MULTIPLE soul-searching musings go on for pages and pages and toward the end of the book seem extensive. His editor should have just trimmed some of those for the sake of flow. The ease of reading isn't quite what it is in \\"Audacity,\\" but obviously it is far and away above what most attorneys can produce in attempts at entertaining fiction.

0688172377|2.0|Surprisingly enough, the author did not have much of a story to tell.  The author tells a pretty good story about her life in Somalia. Once she leaves Somalia, her life goes uphill, however the book pretty much goes straight downhill from there.  Instead of a storyline that flows, she pretty much compiles some not so interesting stories into random chapters.  I have never read a book that was so choppy.  One chapter does not flow into the next, so it was really hard to remain interested in the book.  The author was certainly blessed to make it to where she did, but her journey didn't necesarily translate that well on to paper.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Tom Selleck does a very creditable job as Jesse Stone.  For fans of the books by Robert B. Parker, he fits the image of the very human and somewhat flawed former LA homicide detective turned small-town police chief.  The story follows the book pretty well, until the ending, which is quite different from the book yet still satisfying.  I enjoyed seeing the characters from the book come to life, but as an avid reader I almost always prefer a book to a movie.  I like using my own imagination instead of seeing the action through someone else's interpretation.  But I would highly recommend this series, both book and movie.

0385340990|5.0|It's January, 1946, and although WWII has been over for six months, England is still suffering severe hardship and rationing. Journalist Juliet Ashton in a glow of success because her book of wartime columns is a huge best seller, receives a letter from Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Islander Dawsey Adams asks her for some books. So begins a series of correspondence from a number of the Guernsey residents and others. The Germans occupied Guernsey from 1940 to 1945.<br />\\"Pamela\\" by Samuel Richardson, the first real English novel, was an epistolary novel, a novel written in the form of a series of letters as is this book. This novel is very successful in using the epistolary method to develop a plot with real narrative drive, authentic characterization, and create a believable setting.<br />The literary society of the title was created as a ruse to fool the Germans--to prevent arrest for breaking the curfew, broken for the sake of a clandestine roast pig dinner. Incidentally potato peels were used for pie crust by the desperately hungry Guernseyites.<br />The heroine of the story is the courageous and self-sacrificing Elizabeth who looks after everyone but herself and is imprisoned in a concentration camp. Many European slave workers were brought to the island where they suffered greatly.<br />It's almost like a cozy mystery except it has a grim picture of the German World War II occupation of the island.  It is reminiscent of \\"84, Charing Cross Road,\\" also an epistolary novel. In contrast this book has a fuller, richer story, but it deals less with bibliophiles and has fewer literary references which gradually dribble away as the story progresses, and the author concentrates more on characterization and the occupation plot. The chief narrator, Juliet Ashton is looking for a beau so romance enters the picture.<br />At the risk of being called a chauvinist, I think this is a women's book, although I and many men have found it a rich reading experience. It's hard to find a good book to recommend to girls age twelve up to one-hundred-ten, but this fits the bill.<br />It's an inspiring book with an old-fashioned charm to it because there's no profanity or cutting edge cynicism. Readers learn a lot about how the islanders suffered during the Big War.

0143039601|4.0|The Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac ***1/2<br /><br />Both uplifting and boring. Kerouac's Dharma Bums was always one of his novels that depending on my current state I either like it or was bored. Reading this on a plane ride to Los Angeles, California it left me cold.<br /><br />As always the book feels positive and is writing with excellent style, passion, and literary craftsmanship. It is inspiring and refreshing to read a piece about someone in search of bettering their spirituality while still being able to not pass judgement on others.<br /><br />That is all great, but honestly this lags. The extent of detail placed on minor things that really don't effect the plot by any stretch create boring passages. This is the only Kerouac that ever bored me and it bores me to no extent.<br /><br />While he wrote from his own experiences it seems to me that he sometimes became lost in something that was really only interesting to him at the time. As honest and heartfelt as that is that doesn't make it any more entertaining.

B000000W8C|5.0|As weird as it may sound, it took me probably 10 years to really appreciate this album. It is not that I did not like it at first. I really liked it after a couple of listens and afterwards I still really liked it. However, looking back at the type of songs that this album features makes me think this album is just beyond words. I would put this album as the best all time only if they included \\"The Rolling People\\" and \\"Let The Damage Begin\\" on this because they were also written, I believe, during these sessions. So many unbelievable rocking and tripped out tracks on this album such as \\"This Is Music\\", \\"A New Decade\\", \\"Life's An Ocean\\", \\"Stormy Clouds\\" and the reprise. \\"Life's An Ocean\\" is just one of the greatest songs ever written. And also their best live song in my opinion. It also has great softer songs I guess you could call them in \\"History\\", \\"On Your Own\\", and \\"History.\\" Truly an album for the ages.

0345495004|5.0|Loving Frank by Nancy Horan is, in its simplest form, about a woman with deep emotional struggles set in the backdrop of the early nineteen hundreds. But this novel is anything but simple. This is the story of Mamah Borthwick Cheney who had to make tough choices in an effort to follow what her heart was feeling and about the high price she had to pay.     At this point I needn't tell you that this story isn't about the legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright, but about the sordid details of the affair and the way the tabloid blew this relationship way out of proportion. It's funny when you think about it, really. Today, nearly one hundred years after the event the media still craves the blood of celebrities who make similar decisions.     If there is anything bad to say about this novel (and I'm reaching here) is the book takes a few chapters to get the steam engine going. Bud like I said, that's really stretching. Nancy Horan does an exquisite job in bringing this story to life. You'll find yourself sympathizing with Mamah Borthwick Cheney as her love for Mr. Wright tears apart this seemingly love stricken woman. From the inspiring choice by one family and the consequences that resulted this is a must read for all fans of true love.     I'd also recommend reading the highly rated novel: The Fates by Georgiou: [[ASIN:143823323X Fates (classic)]]
B001ECQ6YW|1.0|I saw this movie with my children today and on a scale from 1-10 I give it a ZERO. There is one character who broke out of jail and came back  to get some \\"parchment with a magical message\\"  which he believed he deserved to receive.  In order to get that parchment, he violently tortured, and attempted to kill the man who brought him up and loved him dearly. Never mind that this character is  ten times the size of his mentor. This character will scare small children to death. He is VERY VERY VIOLENT,WITH A DISPLAY OF SUCH ANGER THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SEEN BY AN ADULT MUCH LESS A CHILD. SUCH A CHARACTER WOULD BE CONSIDERED  MENTALLY ILL, AND CHILDREN WILL THINK THIS BEHAVIOR IS APPROPRIATE WHEN THEY THINK THEIR PARENTS ARE UNFAIR TO THEM. THINK TEN TIMES BEFORE LETTING YOUR CHILDREN SEE THIS MOVIE.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|HAARP is a must own set for any Muse fan. Most of the live versions are better than the studio recordings, especially Knights of Cydonia and Starlight. A few of my other favorites are Map of The Problematique and Stockholm Syndrome. If I had to nitpick I would say some of the slower tracks dont fit in that well but overall its an impressive performance not to be missed.
1603420398|5.0|I agree with all the previous reviewers. Perhaps the description of the book by Amazon is a bit misleading as it only has crochet motifs and no projects. However, it is very inspiring and jam packed full of helpful tips and information on how to crochet the different motifs and arrange them. All the motifs are charted and written out. 28 circle motifs, 26 hexagons, 31 triangles, 33 squares and 23 unusual shapes. Indexed and page of Japanese crochet symbols which are used in the book. The book begins with a workshop but is not meant for absolute beginners. I'm looking forward to playing around with the motifs and perhaps just making some kind of weird blanket with as many as will combine. Could be a good stashbuster too. Highly recommended.
B001BEC3YA|3.0|Beware of DOWNLOADING Track 1 \\"Tailgunner\\" it is actually Track 2 \\"Holy Smoke\\".  If you don't believe me listen to the preview for both Tracks 1 & 2 they are exactly the same.  They both play the preview for \\"Holy Smoke\\".  I have notified CDNOW over a week ago and they still haven't fixed the problem.    This review has nothing to do with the music it is only meant to warn people not to download Track 1.  You will only be disappointed.
B000M341QO|5.0|I like this movie so much I bought it, and I am cheap.  Jack Nicholson is one bad mfer, and Marky Mark is the best actor in the movie.  I even admired that retarded baldwin dude's acting skills.  Too bad dicrapio dies at the end.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This movie is great. And Christian Bale's performance and dedication to the role is exemplifying.  I cannot believe that it is the same man when he is like 95 lbs!!  Great movie, worth watching.
B001C46P3E|4.0|I'm willing to wager that the reason why so many people gave this film such a negative slant is due to the fact that they were expecting to see the same old shoot em' up, blood n' guts Vin Diesel film that so many of us have become accustomed to.  I have to admit, I REALLY had my doubts about it myself before I went to see it, and I thought I was going to completely agree with the negative reviews.  Boy, was I wrong.  This was a surprisingly, do I dare say of a Vin Diesel film, thought provoking (gasp!) and even (gasp!) touching film.  And to top it all off, Vin Diesel (a real big gasp) showed us that he could, yes, ACT! The one in this film, however, that REALLY demonstrated some real star power was Melanie Thierry, the one who so brillantly played the character,   Aurora.  Her facial expressions alone were undeniably convincing and her whole demeanor truly demonstrated superior command of her role.  I said to myself, and others, that this girl nailed the part!  I think we could very well be seeing a rising superstar if she keeps exuding this excellent chemistry and talent.  The part that even got me choked up was when she softly whispered to Vin Diesel, \\"That's the first time you have said my name.\\"  Wow!  I was completely in awe of her presence and she really carried most of the film.  However, this is not to say that others didn't do a good acting job in this film, either.  Both Vin Diesel and Michelle Yeoh, I felt, were perfectly cast, and also really demonstrated highly competent performances.  Aside from the surprisingly great acting, the story was extremely fascinating and also it was a very wry, yet extremely thought-provoking commentary on the way that this planet is heading--straight to Babylon--a world where love and compassion are seemingly feelings of the past and people have practically become gods to themselves through misuse of technology and other means.      I really recommend that one go see this film and not to listen to all the negative reviewssurrounding it.  The only thing that kept me from giving this film a five star rating was the fact that there were a few plot holes in the film that were left unexplained and this is the one area that I had to agree with the critics on.  However, the brilliant performance of Melanie Thierry, as well as the intriguing story, make this aspect seem rather trivial and with the way it ended, it seems quite likely that there will be a sequel, which I am already looking forward to.
1400079276|4.0|The brilliance in Kafka on the Shore is the author Haruki Murakami's ability to fully expound by story's end his answer to the question he poses at the start of the book: is life pure coincidence, or is there a greater force that causes lives to, sometimes unknowingly, parallel each other?  The answer to this lies in the double-meanings and irony scattered throughout the novel, but I believe that Murakami's answer is not definite.  By the conclusion, I feel Murakami wants to convey that although fate can sometimes determine the course of one's path in life, a human has the capacity to be able to distinguish when his/her life has fallen into the hands of fate, and when he/she can choose their direction in life individually.  Furthermore, this philosophy is flexible and malleable enough to connect to readers, allowing each one to take from the story an even more personal meaning from this idea of parallelism and coincidence.    For the most part, I never read fantasy novels, and although the preternatural elements of this book, mostly found in parts of the story concerning the character of the elderly Nakata, were a pleasant shift from the realistic storylines in the novels I habitually read, I felt that the meanings of fate and choice behind them were significantly more powerful.  However, these supernatural occurrences supplement the book precisely enough that they never seem too unreal to be acceptable in conjunction with the storyline of the novel, another great accomplishment on the author's part.    My only issue with this novel was the character of Kafka Tamura, the protagonist of the book.  I felt that he acted too old for his age, passing the point of maturity, more towards the point of possessing unrealistic qualities of a boy that is only fifteen-years-old.  Regardless, I was able to, upon finishing the book, appreciate the bildungsroman aspects of Kafka's story.  I loved that Kafka's journey was more than just trying to find his place in the world, as is the journey of many protagonists of coming-of-age novels.  Kafka also came to his own understanding of the concepts of coincidence and choice, a journey that people of all ages participate in, and a journey that the reader also takes with him, simply by reading the novel.      I ended Kafka on the Shore with a feeling of overall satisfaction, most likely attributed to having had all the double-meanings explained and parallel storylines of Kafka and Nakata finally converge.  This story has a delicate balance of the imaginary and the real, and if you are not one for the chimerical novels of this world, then I suggest you give fantasy a second chance with this book.
031606792X|4.0|The end of the series has a happily ever after feel, which for vampires is the best that they can hope for. At first I was disappointed that there wasn't a big battle between two sides, but realized that one of the books ideas is that we don't have to do what is expected.  I enjoyed reading the book, and the series, and especially had fun looking for Mormon influences in Ms Meyers writing.
0143038419|3.0|Who hasn't dreamed of packing up your things and taking a year off from life to travel? Elizabeth Gilbert does exactly that in Eat, Pray, Love.     My first thoughts are that I enjoyed this book but found it sluggish in the middle. Gilbert starts out with a fast-moving, easy pace, and when she stops her tale about Italy and moves into India, the pace slows considerably.     Gilbert has an uncanny ability to observe people which quickly becomes apparent in the stories she tells revolving around the colorful characters she meets in her travels. My favorite is Richard from Texas who she meets on her spiritual journey at an Ashram in India. You can almost picture his swagger...maybe imagine him as a modern-day gunslinging cowboy. His sarcasm puts Gilbert in her place on more than one occasion. Descriptions of him and similar characters made the section about Gilbert's spiritual journey in India a bit more tolerable. She spent too much time discussing philosophies and theories of Yogic masters. It felt more like a New Age self-help book than a travel memoir.     Italy was most likely my favorite section of the book featuring people with names like Luca Spaghetti. How can you not like someone with a moniker like that? It was a decadent description of Italy from the food to the sights to the people. I thoroughly enjoyed it.     The Indonesia section (or more aptly, Bali) was interesting but in a quiet, non-assuming way. By this point in the book, you get a sense that Gilbert's journey is nearly complete and visiting this particular country is more about tying up the loose ends than continuing to learn something about herself. Most of her learning was accomplished in Italy and India. She finds herself surprised at the events that take place there, but in the end, she discovers that it isn't something she hadn't already set herself up for beforehand.     Overall, it was a good read...but because of the sluggish pace in portions of the book, I'm giving it three stars. It's well-written and the language is lush, but it was just a little slower than I prefer.
1400079276|4.0|Murakami's \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" goes beyond a typical coming of age story.  Kafka Tamura is a young adult struggling to escape his father's oedipal prophecy and his mother's abandonment.  His journey is paved by hardships, both internal and external, and his triumphs and failures are extremely powerful.  In the five hundred pages of \\"Kafka\\" it is impossible not to develop an emotional connection with the protagonist.  Although his life is hardly relatable, (having a father that eats cat hearts, falling in love with his mother) his intensity and raw emotion make his struggles feel like your own.  Murakami crafts his characters with a delicacy that makes them feel real despite the book's unrealistic plot.  The characters of \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" make the book extremely gripping, and Kafka's eventual success is deeply moving.    The only qualm I had about \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" was the style in which it is written.  I am not too familiar with Japanese writing, or translations from Japanese to English, but the language felt a little too basic.  The sentences often felt slightly empty, and the word choice felt too simplistic.  I felt that there was a disconnect between the complex plot and characters, and the unsophisticated language.  The simplistic prose of \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" seemed to muddy the intricacy of the story.
B0000844I8|5.0|This was a gift for my husband!  We love the movie and the television series they have come out since the movie!  It still just as great watching it at home as it was in the theaters!!!

0316168815|5.0|I tried reading this book when I was about 19. My Mom had bought it and told me to read it since it was really good. I got about half way through and I couldn't handle it anymore. The thought of a little girl getting killed, the emotions her and her family went through etc. tore my own heart apart. I knew the story was 'fake' but children get killed everyday so it def. got to me. I then picked the book back up in early winter of 2008. I told myself I would read it from front to back no matter what. By this time I was taking care of a 2, 4 & 6 yr old (daycare provider) little girls so it made it even HARDER to read it! It took me about a month to finish and I'm pretty glad I did. The ending wasn't what I expected but I would read it again. The few negative parts during the book was how the only person that cared was really the Father. The Mother was very in-sensitive and the sister seemed to move on quickly. Oh, and how they never found the body! I guess over-all I would recommend this book, but be prepared to tear up a couple times!
B00004YYDI|5.0|I ama a fan of this movie. When i saw an uncut version i just had to ceck it out.The story of the emotions of the little girl.was well done.
031606792X|1.0|I am amazed at the comparisons of this series to Harry Potter. There is no contest. Although I enjoyed completing the series after being somewhat impressed with Twilight, I was so frustrated with Bella by the end of book three, I was hoping the Volturi would end the series early! She couldn't have been written any more immaturely....not a great role model for young adults. Breaking Dawn is the best of the four books, and certainly keeps your interest. But I found myself thinking this is just a Nora Roberts love story and character thrown into a vampire world. It lacks the color, the complexity, the genius of the Potter world. So if you are a fan of Nora Roberts (headstrong, doesn't-know-she's-beautiful heroine who falls in love with handsome, no-woman-was-ever-good-enough-before hero, then you'll enjoy this series.

B000002BPS|5.0|This is a really good Offspring Album (not as good as Smash, but not many albums are). I think most of the songs are really catchy and good. Cool to Hate is my favorite/most fun song on the album, and Gone Away is a just a great song plain and simple.<br /><br />Sometimes I forget how much I really liked The Offspring when I was younger, but whenever they come on my Ipod, I remember all the good times I have had to their music.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|10,000 BC is an imaginative interpretation of the past that connects us to who we are today.  It is timeless mythology that could be told to hunter and gathers around a camp fire, and also touch our human yearning for mythology today.  Our need for mythology has not changed in 12,000 years.  We are basically the same humans.     10,000 BC celebrates the beautiful social bonding humans have with each other, and says this quality is really what makes us civilized.  It completely made me rethink what we typically call an \\"advanced\\" civilization.  Does \\"advanced\\" mean technology, mathematics, and great architectural achievements?  Or is what truly makes us advanced is how we love our families, friends, and villagers, and how we can work together, using this social bonding to give us meaning?  It made me rethink respect for the Egyptian civilization and the great pyramids.  If you think about it, the pyramids are great accomplishment of human stupidity.  What \\"great\\" civilization would expend huge amounts of human effort to build enormous, pointless structures?  Was the Egyptian civilization really a totalitarian social structure that relied on huge amounts of slaves to carry out the religious wishes of the minority?  The next time you think \\"wow\\" about the Egyptian civilization, think about the probable human rights vialoations needed to build the pyramids, then your \\"wow\\" might change to \\"yuk\\".     D,Ley grows into the hero in this epic story.  At first, he really just wants to save his girl.  Romantic love is his basic drive.  As his journey unfolds, he learns of his father.  He learns his father was a great man that allowed his people to believe he was a coward just so he could keep his struggling tribe together.  D,Ley's first attempt to rescue his girl Evolet shows lack of experience and impatience.  Tic'Tic, an older and wiser hunter, and friend of D,Ley's father, takes the time to pass his wisdom to D,Ley.  He teaches D,Ley some men take on a circle of responsibility that encloses many people.  When D,Ley has achieved full hero status, he leads thousands from various cultures to \\"take them down\\".  Joseph Campbell would have loved it.     There is also something about 10,000 BC that is genius.  10,000 BC turns mythology inside out and shows how myth is intertwined with prophecy.  Tic'Tic teaches prophecy can be fulfilled in many ways.  Prophecy is what aids our hero.  Without the prophecy, D,Ley could not have gathered such an army, and could not have exploited the weakness of the Almighty.  D'Ley fulfills these prophecies because people want to see them fulfilled.  When you watch 10,000 BC, you are watching the mythology unfold in all its accidental luck but ultimately fueled by our greater human qualities.  Qualities such as love, friendship, loyalty, courage, respect, and honor is the real driving force, not prophecy.  These qualities are really what makes our hero and his people the more advanced civilization.  When you watch 10,000 BC, you may not realize it, but you become a participant of mythology.  Your very own yearning for great, meaningful story telling is awakened.  The alternate ending shows the narator concluding the story to a future generation.  I'm thinking they should have stuck with that ending to bring home the fact you are watching a fictionalized story packaged as a handed down myth.  This would have helped some people \\"get\\" this movie.  It justifies why the saber-tooth tiger was so big.  It's a story.  Stories exaggerate for effect.     Many people have criticized 10,000 BC as being historically a farce.  Well, watch the bonus material on the blu-ray about the book \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\" by Graham Hancock.  Hancock is interviewed and talks about maps found showing land mass before the ice age in their predicted location given continental drift.  This is a complete unaddressed mystery.  It suggests there were advanced civilizations way earlier than 2,500 BC.  So \\"10,000 BC\\" takes some liberty on apossibility for this mystery.  We don't know everything about our past.  But what makes \\"10,000 BC\\" so great is that it helps us realize to understand the value of our current civilization, we need to understand our fundamental nature as hunter and gathers.  Our basic social instincts come from living in small groups.  A civilization that drifts too far from our social origins will eventually fall, as many \\"advanced\\" civilization in the past have.
6304493711|2.0|I've finally seen what people have said is the \\"best modern romantic comedy\\" around.  They're joking?  There might be that movie in this mess somewhere, but the script and editing kill it.  Charles (Hugh Grant) is a very attractive character and nicely written in his strengths (friendship, openness to the possibility of true love) and flaws (perpetually late, a complete lack of discretion).  Carrie (Andie MacDowell) is less engaging. For someone supposedly so \\"experienced\\" (she lists 33 lovers), she apparently has no idea what she's doing in her relationships.  She's attracted to Charles from the beginning but does absolutely nothing to encourage him other than invite him to have sex with her.  (If Charles is a \\"serial monogamist\\" then she's a \\"serial monogamist\\" who cheats.)  It makes one wonder how much is really there, how long before she's explaining to Charles that it just isn't working out, and there's this new guy who's now the one.  After all, according to the script as shown, they've barely talked to each other.  The script is much too obvious. There are real clunkers of forced scenes including one where it feels like someone said \\"oh wait, we haven't made this person awful enough for what's about to happen to her so let's give her one really bitchy line.\\"  Charles's friends are a fascinating group, but only good acting prevents them from being cardboard stereotypes.   The film has no idea whether it's making meaningful statements about relationships or being a screwball farce.  It could have been cut either way.  As it is, it feels as deeply real and as cheaply funny as the unmoving waves in one backdrop.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|First of all, the songs on this album are strong and very good. But the production of the 'sound', and mastering is horrible. All instruments have the same volume, no dynamics.. I got bored after the second song.  This cd is only enjoyable in the car, or on a Ipod..
B000HOJDPM|5.0|I already owned, the US version of \\"Decemberunderground\\", but it was worth it to buy it again for the 3 bonus tracks and the DVD, as well as the cover.

B0010X8NF0|1.0|\\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" written and directed by Wes Anderson.<br /><br />Three brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) have been convinced to come together on what is supposed to be a spiritual journey across India. All 3 brothers are still dealing with the loss of their father and the fact that their mother didn't come to the funeral and has disappeared without informing anyone as to where she has gone. Each is bringing his own set of baggage be it emotional, physical or a combination of the 2 and the underlying family tension compounds an already uncomfortable situation. What Francis hasn't told his brothers is that the main point of the trip is to see their mother whom he has located...<br /><br />This movie is so terrible that I am left almost speechless. I am still trying to figure out how someone read this script and gave it a green light. The only and I mean only redeeming feature of this movie is the short film at the beginning \\"Hotel Chevalier\\" and the assets that Natalie Portman brings to it.<br /><br />The Good: There are very few positives where this movie is concerned. All of the actors gave good performances but the characters they were portraying weren't interesting in anyway. The look of the movie overall was good but again the story that was unfolding within the interesting looking picture was not interesting or entertaining in anyway.<br /><br />The Bad: The story/plot is terrible and from the start I was asking myself \\"why am I watching this\\" coupled with \\"why do I care\\" and the answers were simple. The DVD was already there and I didn't care. The characters were all ludicrous and that combined with a terrible story leaves nothing redeeming.<br /><br />Overall: This might be worth a rental just to see Natalie Portman in the short \\"Hotel Chevalier\\" but there isn't anything else worth watching. Avoid \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" at all cost.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I have been watching this movie incessantly for the last three weeks.  What I enjoy about this movie the most is the lack of big dramatic acting, which invariably is used in modern day cinema by actors cast to play in mildly-unrealistic to completely-incredible roles. Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright are great enough actors to make the story feel like watching a real life situation.     The bulk of the emotion in this movie is told in the actors' facial expressions. Scenes in this movie in which Zach is attempting to deal with the inner turmoil of his newly-revealed sexuality, would have been tainted and unbearable if they had been filled with exaggerated and unnecessary words. Instead you can see/feel the insult and hurt felt when Trevor Wright's he frowns, nose crunched, and in his eyes you can believe the character is thinking something along the lines of \\"Please God, just give me a hole to crawl into.\\"    In addition because there is so much unspoken passion in this movie it makes it all the more compelling when Zach raises his voice, which happens all of three times. The first time, his sister confronts him about his relationship with Shaun and the potential detriment to her son. Zach's immediate response is defiant, a statement that he is standing up to his sister for the first time. It is an indication that the character is beginning to grow out of submission.     The second time, Gabe confronts him about his relationship with Shaun. Blindsighted and unprepared to deal with this reality, Zach raises his voice to his best friend in defense. You can see that Gabe doesn't exactly know how to comfort his friend either and immediately backs down, without letting him know that he does not wish to lose their friendship over this.    The third time, in the final scene, Jeanne's boyfriend demeans Zach's would-be-son. At this point the audience is clear on the fact that while most of the character's growth has involved his sexuality, most of the character's LIFE has revolved around his nephew. To hear this abrasive, offensive NOTHING attack Cody like this is too much after everything that Zach has been through, and Zach lashes out with a passion that actually brought a tear to my eye. We should all have someone who cares about us so.    The worst example of acting in this movie comes from the character of Billy, who has all of three lines in the darkness by a fire, and is merely there to establish the aspect that Zach's friends' lives continue to move on while his own remains fairly static.    Not a single word, facial expression, or stance is wasted in this movie. And if you're a straight guy who is afraid of GLBT-themed movies out of discomfort at seeing full frontal male nudity, have no fear. 'Shelter' is tasteful, heart-warming, heart-wrenching, and I haven't seen another movie quite like it.
0439023483|5.0|I received an early review copy of this book, and I've been recommending it to teens and adults all summer long! On top of that, keeping track of the review copy has been a challenge; everyone who's flipped through a few pages found it impossible to put down.     As the other reviews will tell you, Katniss ends up a competitor in the Hunger Games, where young people from all around a post-apocalyptic nation come together to fight to the death...and maybe keep their families at home safe and well-fed. Katniss has another motivating reason--her younger sister \\"wins\\" the lottery, and so she chooses to take her sister's place, even with certain death facing her in the Games. A stay of execution is found in the pageantry and ceremony of the Games, but it's not long before Katniss is in the arena, and must figure out how to survive.    I think this book is so appealing because it combines elements of so many genres: science fiction/speculative fiction, adventure, reality television (yes, really), romance, survival stories, and so on. There are also a number of interesting moral questions to discuss in how the government is run and the choices that the teens make during the Games to survive and to conquer their competitors. Don't expect a breezy children's book where no one needs more than a bandage and a pat on the head; there are no pulled punches.     I disagree that the ending of this book would \\"only make sense to a woman,\\" as another reviewer said. There's no way to explain further without spoiling the ending, though, except to say that the ending deliberately does not tie up all of the loose threads. The Hunger Games raises many questions, and is all the better for it.    Highly recommended.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Every so often a band comes along that breaks new ground and spreads life messages with unfaltering confidence and high artistic vision, and, once making it big, never sacrifices its artistic integrity.  The first of these was the Beatles in the 1960s.  U2 rose up in the 1980s.  In the 1990s, Radiohead rose and was set to become the next of these bands.  But when their fourth album, 2000's \\"Kid A,\\" broke too much ground for mainstream listeners to handle, those listeners twirled around to face Coldplay, a fresh-out-of-college English band that had just released their debut, \\"[[ASIN:B00004U9MS Parachutes]].\\"  Since then, music fans have been heralding Coldplay as the next big thing, the band that could rise up and lead the music world like Radiohead and U2 have been doing.      But they've been like that brilliant student who never quite applies his or herself to the schoolwork, the student who is trying to do his or her best but just can't.  Their debut was good, their sophomore effort, \\"[[ASIN:B000069AUI A Rush of Blood to the Head]],\\" was excellent (ranking on \\"Rolling Stone\\"'s list of the 500 greatest albums in history), and their third album, 2005's \\"[[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]],\\" was very good, though not a whole lot more than the band trying to sound like U2 (lead Chris Martin's biggest influence).  The band needed a teacher.  For their fourth album, they hired Brian Eno as producer - the most brilliant move they could ever have made.  Eno produced the most brilliant and groundbreaking albums of David Bowie, Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel, and, yes, U2.  He's just what the band needed.    So now we have Coldplay's fourth album, \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends.\\"  As promised, it's the beginning of a new era for the band.  Whether that era is one to be cheered or ignored is up in the air.  While some will appreciate the band's more complex, refined, and much more inspired style, evident on songs like the ethereal \\"Cemeteries of London\\" or the soul-grabbing title anthem, \\"Viva La Vida,\\" others will lament the fact that, on those same songs, Martin sounds like he's dying not to make Coldplay go down in history via originality but to go down in history via playing U2's similar-looking cousin.  The fact of the matter is that Martin looks nothing like Bono - he's not even Irish.  That's where Eno comes in.  If Martin has asked him to dress them like Bono, Eno has smiled and said, \\"Alright, I'll do it,\\" and done it just enough to convince Martin that it's been done.  In fact, though, Eno has added some stylistic flare to separate Coldplay from their idols.    Those less-tolerant listeners may find \\"Viva La Vida\\" a cold listen, though the quality of Eno's warm production is undeniable.  But for those who are willing to try to understand Martin's U2-bound aspirations, there's a lot to \\"Viva La Vida,\\" particularly in beautiful pieces like the instrumental opener, \\"Life in Technicolor,\\" the sensational and rock-sturdy \\"Lost!\\" (the group's own \\"Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\"), the forementioned title track, or the mind-bending psychedelic \\"Chinese Sleep Chant.\\"  Coldplay still isn't in the same league as Radiohead or U2 -- they're too afraid of upsetting anyone -- and, heck, they may never be in that league, but regardless, \\"Viva La Vida\\" is an excellent album.  More importantly, it's a softly-cooed lover's whisper of wonderful things to come.
B000002IZ4|4.0|STP continued their high songwritting/playing standards in this 1994 album, their second effort following their big hit album CORE.  Actually all their albums preceding the departure of vocalist/lyricist Scott Weiland (to be a member of Velvet Revolver for a couple of albums)are consistently very good R´n´R albums with the occasional ballad.You won´t be disappointed.
0553579908|5.0|This is excellent fantasy.  The sweeping epic begun in A GAME OF THRONES continues in A CLASH OF KINGS.  Once again George RR Martin takes us deeper into his magical and beautiful world that stretchs from the icy wastes beyond the Wall to the burning deserts across the ocean.<br /><br />The old King is dead; the succession disputed.  The brothers of King Robert, Stannis and Renly contend for the crown while his queen upholds the claims of her son Joffrey.  Other lords strive; some bend the knee to this or that claimant; others raise the standard of dormant kingdoms.<br /><br />The family of Ned Stark is scattered across the kingdom: daughter Sansa a prisoner in the capital, daughter Arya adrift in the wilderness, sons Bran and Rickon at the family seat in Winterfell.  The eldest son, Robb Stark, namesake of King Robert has raised his own banner as King in the North and fights battle after battle while his mother Lady Catelyn rides as envoy to this lord or that.  Meanwhile, Jon Snow, Ned's bastard son, finds evidence beyond the Wall that a greater doom is about to fall upon this divided land.<br /><br />And I haven't even mentioned the Queen Across the Water and her brood of growing dragons!<br /><br />Martin's handing of his huge cast of characters and complex plot is nothing short of masterly.  Every chapter ends with a potent hook and events, which go from bad to worse for the characters, will sweep the reader along.  Martin has placed sympathetic characters on all sides of this contested realm.  They can't all win or come through safe, but the reader can't help but hope for all of them.<br /><br />This really feels like a juggling act done by a man dancing on a tightrope strung over a volcano.  I've got a feeling this series can't be ended or resolved successfully, but that will be part of the suspense of reading the other books in the series.

0307387178|5.0|and for me - Jon Krakauer's writing is the kind of stuff that makes for late nights and tired workdays. I can't pay him a higher compliment. This one was a bit different than his other efforts in that Krakuer plays more the role of detective/sociologist rather than an an insightful expedition biographer. However, the story was as rivetting and perhaps even more powerful. I'm anxiously awaiting his next one! I'd also recommend reading Georgiou's masterpiece-- THE FATES, [[ASIN:143823323X Fates (classic)]] if you haven't yet. I stumbled upon it at a book store and can't stop talking about it. His writing style is very similar to Jon Krakauer
B0013D8LCW|5.0|If you're a romantic and want to see a 'real' relationship develop, (not the Hollywood version) then this movie is for you. It shows how persistence, love, encouragement and support can take you out of even the worst situation. This is a film grounded in reality and will touch your heart and leave you wanting more. More out of life. More out of love. Nobody ever made their dreams come true by staying in their comfort zone. Take a risk. It's worth it!

But this book is excessively violent, and the ultimate \\"reveal\\" is simply not believable. Nor are many of the plot twists along the way.

B0000009SY|3.0|Now, this could've potentially rocked the house, but instead it'll have to settle for just being pretty good. For those who don't know, this is Zappa's attempt at a rock opera, telling the tale of a dystopian future where music is made illegal. And while Frank loses sight of the concept fairly quickly and spends most the rest of the opera trying desperately to tie random people getting plooked into the rather sketchy plot, he still cooks up a few of his most enjoyable songs, a majority of them found in the brilliant first act. Act I is arguably his best album other than Hot Rats, containing several of Frank's funniest songs: the ironic nostalgia of the title track, a hilarious, strangely touching story of a garage-rock band; \\"Catholic Girls\\", a great send-up of society's hypocrisy; the uproarious \\"Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt\\", which condemns all those sex-crazed maniacs out there by making us realize just how idiotic a wet t-shirt contest really is (sample lyric: \\"Our grand prize tonite is fifty American dollars to the girl with the most exciting mammalian protruberances...\\"). Plus there's always the juvenile but funny rocker \\"Why Does it Hurt When I Pee?\\", for those looking for considerably less \\"intelligent\\" laughs. And even when his humor fails him on \\"Crew S***\\" (trite, tasteless, obnoxious sexism), he's still got a great guitar riff to back it up. There's also the enjoyable, crunchy instrumental \\"On the Bus\\" - the only weak part of act one is the neverending reggae mock-up \\"Lucille Has My Mind Messed Up\\". For the most part, though, the second act is a waste of time, with Frank flaunting his ignorance of the gay community by giving into nauseating stereotypes (\\"Stick it Out\\"; \\"Sy Borg\\"; \\"Dong Work for Yuda\\"; \\"Keep it Greasey\\") and failing to add melodies to his unfunny one-joke tunes - the biggest offender is the nine minute Quiet Storm satire \\"Sy Borg\\", though the equally lengthy, equally turgid disco of \\"Keep it Greasey\\" isn't much better. It is great to hear Scientologists get their dues on \\"A Token of My Extreme\\", though. Act Three is far better. At this point, I think Frank had realized that his story had spiraled off into something he couldn't recover, so rather than desperately try to tie it all back in, he decided to take his own advice. Shut up and play his guitar, that is. A fine idea, too, because it resulted in a triptych of fascinating guitar solos: the jazzy \\"He Used to Cut the Grass\\"; nonstop hard rock riffs on \\"Packard Goose\\", and especially the haunting emotional odyssey \\"Watermelon in Easter Hay\\". That's my favorite song on the album. I have a history of thinking that Zappa's guitar solos are the best songs on his albums - my favorite track on Over-Nite Sensation is \\"Inca Roads\\", my favorite on Sheik Yerbouti is \\"Yo' Mama\\", my favorite on Hot Rats is \\"Willie the Pimp\\", and so forth. If I can just hear Zappa soloing for between seven and twelve minutes, I am perfectly content. That's why Hot Rats is my favorite Zappa album. So, getting back to the album, Zappa closes things off with \\"A Little Green Rosetta\\", which is really repetitive but tolerable.ntologists get their dues on \\"A Token of My Extreme\\", though.

B000NZD9RS|5.0|Probably the most famous and complete of Pink Floyd's many concept albums. In fact, it's a full-blown rock opera, about a rock star's descent into madness and isolation. An interesting theme, and it's executed a lot better than I thought it was, with plenty of psychological manipulation, musical impact points, and big-deal radio hits. It also features arguably the greatest opening in any album ever, the beginning of \\"In the Flesh?\\" It opens with some barely audible keyboard noise, which dares you to turn the volume up, just so you can make sure there's nothing wrong with your stereo. And, once you have turned it up, it kicks into the blaring, bombastic but wonderful riff. And that is how you start an album, especially an album as psychological as this one. There are also all kinds of sound effects, just to really mess with your head: helicopter noises, a baby crying in\\" the famous \\"how can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?\\" recitation, anguished screams, answering machines beeping, TV sets being destroyed, backwards messages to Syd Barrett, a naïve \\"Look, mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky!\\"... The album is packed with classic songs: \\"Another Brick in the Wall, pt. 2,\\" a strident disco-rocker with a brilliant guitar solo; the disquieting, folksy \\"Mother;\\" the desolate \\"Hey You,\\" with some of the best guitar work on the record, hard rockers \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"Run Like Hell,\\" and especially \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" with a brilliant guitar solo and swooning strings. Besides the hits, the best songs are usually on the eerie side (\\"Goodbye Blue Sky,\\" \\"The Thin Ice,\\" \\"Another Brick in the Wall pt. 1,\\" \\"Empty Spaces,\\" which could be an excerpt of \\"Welcome to the Machine,\\" \\"Don't Leave Me Now,\\" \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\"), though \\"One of My Turns\\" is a fine rocker with a searing wah'ed guitar. Of course, talking about individual songs on this one is useless. It's about the experience, you know? If you were to take off all the neat production tricks, the album would still be good, but not as good as it is with them included. Can you imagine what, say, \\"One of My Turns\\" would be like without the hotel-room-destroying? Or \\"Empty Spaces\\" without the messages to Syd? Or \\"Hey You\\" without the little \\"ping\\" noises and echoing vocals? Granted, you'd still have a hell of a guitar record (and not just on the hits, check out the acoustic stuff on \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\"), but it would not be anywhere near as good. But the lightly orchestrated, downright beautiful \\"Nobody Home\\" stands alone even without the crazy effects (other than some talking in the beginning), so maybe I'm wrong about that. I don't know. Roger's vocal on that song is a head-trip unto itself, and I mean that in the most positive way possible. However, despite all of the album's many strengths, I still refuse to admit it's Pink Floyd's masterpiece, magnum opus, or whatever. There are a few very, very weak tracks scattered across the second disc. The first is nearly perfect, but the second is bogged down with theatrical \\"showtuney\\" crap like \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" and especially that wretched \\"Trial\\" (far and away the worst song Pink Floyd ever recorded - I'll give you kudos if you can make it through that wretched excuse for a song without vomiting, but I just skip over it every time), and two awful Queen tributes (\\"Waiting for the Worms,\\" \\"The Show Must Go On\\"). Still, I recommend this one. Sit back, prepare to get your brain scrambled, and pretend that \\"The Trial\\" isn't one of the worst songs known to mankind. You'll probably like it.

031606792X|3.0|Breaking Dawn was a better than average closing to a phenomenal series. I have always been a true fan of the vampire novel, and I feel that Stephenie Meyer has really found her place within the supernatural realm. Breaking Dawn was not all that fans may have wanted, nor was it a horribly written drawn out conclusion that kills off half the characters (cough Harry Potter cough).     ~Spoiler Warning~    I completely agree with other reviews when saying that Meyer could have done better. What I always loved about the series was that Bella was an average girl who was insecure and, more often than not, made mistakes. Unfortunately, Breaking Dawn ruined this aspect of the series for me. Renesmee did not send me over the edge, like many reviewers, although I cringed when Jacob imprinted on her. I thought that went way overboard and I just couldn't appreciate the book completely after that. I'm glad that Edward was more prevalent in this book. I found the entire context of Eclipse lacking when he left Bella high and dry. And truly the ending left something to be desired. I'm sorry, but the anticlimactic atmosphere was so palpable that I could have cut it with a butter knife (excuse my overused analogy).    ~End Spoiler Warning~    Despite all this, I found myself enthralled with the relationships as they unfolded. The back and forth, up and down at least kept me involved with the book. And although I believe Meyer tried much too hard to make this book the all encompassing end, it was satisfying in some ways to finally see a close to one of my favorite series.    This book is a must read for all enthusiasts, but do not be surprised if, by the end of it, you feel cheated of what could have been an epic ending to a favorite romance.

This book just takes all of the magic and absolute love that I have for this series away. It saddens me that Stephenie had to try to end everything neatly, but as everyone else says, was a horrendous fanfiction. The pregnancy, imprint on baby, overdramatic dialogue, and characters acting out of character is not the way this great series was supposed to end. Yes, there are parts that make me smile, but everything else is wrong. Times when I wonder what happened???

The only thing I might caution anyone on is unlike American television the BBC shows are not censored like ours are so you will see some risque stuff. The characters are wonderful and the acting is amazing and it was just a huge bonus that it's a spin off from Doctor Who (The greatest series of ALL TIME!!!) I really recommend the show if you are a Who fan or even just a regular sci-fi fan.

My wife started watching it when Tom Baker was the Doctor and she kept telling me about this show I just had to watch so we rented the new season with Christopher Eccleston and the rest is history! Another Who fan is born or regenerated, whatever. I would recommend this series for anyone. Whether they watched the old ones or never even watched it at all. They do an awesome job on the story lines, the special effects and even of picking the right characters. It seems like your favorite character leaves and they bring in a new one and you are like \\"Okay this person is just as likeable as the last\\" so you don't really mind the switching off.....Course I really like David Tennant and lets hope he is the Doctor for some time to come. Anyway 2 thumbs up all the way around. I highly recommend this series.
B00004CP59|3.0|Didn't know how Feministic the women were in the old West, or how open society was to bi-sexuality. Plently of unsubtle dabbling in these themes - although anachronism is part of the B+ movie lexicon.<br />The best moment comes from the very sensuous, under-appreciated actor Dana Delany: she steps off the Coach as she arrives in town and shares a rapturous, prolonged glance with Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp). Her close-up is enough to wake Truman Capote (All due respect...).<br />Val Kilmer does okay as Doc Holliday - I think he might have unconsciously refereced Brando in \\"Mutiny On The Bounty\\", but here he seems slighlty less interested in the fairer sex. Not that there's anything wrong with that.<br />Cinematography is excellent and the picture is well-paced.

Heh.) or the Gerry Rafferty (Poignant sax solo, sense of great space).  I can listen to both back to back & never be able to choose.<br /><br />If you don't already have this remastered version or the original, you should get it simply for the fact that \\"Everlong\\" is one of the best rock songs ever created.

At first, I didn't know what to make out of it, but it definitely grows on you!      By the way, the blu-ray, which has already been released overseas, has received rave reviews so the U.S. release should be just as good, if not better.

B0017XOF5A|2.0|When we viewed the blu-ray release of the original StarGate Movie....we \\"had to watch it again\\" as well as the extras.\\"It was so good\\"!  Having missed the Stargate TV series and the second Stargate Movie we found that \\"Continuum\\" had almost an entirely new line-up of characters. Mr Bridges was back as the all knowing General though, but that's about all.  Made only for DVD and relying on special effects did not result in a good movie...  The Stargate Continuum movie we ordered from Amazon dot com still has to arrive at our house in Bandung Java. We watched it on BluRay hired from a local video DVD shop......and it is hoped this is pure co-incidence. Amazon US's customer care center tells us that both the Stargate Continuum order and another for 3 standard DVD's were shipped via DPGM (most likely Deutsche Post) and that the problem might be with the Indonesian Postal service. Considering we've never had a problem with the local labour intensive Indonesian postal people, I'd be of the opinion that there has been a gltich somewhere else. DVD's ordered via Amazon.co.uk arrive at our place within days from the United Kingdom. We've given it another try for some more blu-rays....fingers crossed I hope these will get here without \\"going missing\\".

031606792X|1.0|When I first got into the Twilight series a while back, I enjoyed it a good bit. The writing and plot certainly wasn't fine literature, but I just enjoyed it simply for what it was, not expecting anything more or less. But with the fourth and final book in the series, it seems that it's Stephenie Meyer who lowered her expectations. Of her own writing.    When I first started reading some of the spoilers circulating about the book, I just had to laugh. Surely Meyer couldn't sink that low with the quality of her storytelling! But when I finally got my hands on the book (blessedly not purchasing it myself), I was completely shocked. All the events that I'd read online and had laughed about as completely ludicrous were absolutely 100% true.    In the first three books, Bella hadn't always been the best role model, but she at least wasn't the Britney Spears or Paris Hilton of the books. With the fourth installment of the books, however, all of that is reversed. Bella becomes reduced to a simpering, sex-crazed whiner, going so far as to CRY and BEG Edward for sex after she wakes up from an erotic dream after he refuses to engage in intimate behavior with her anymore for fear of hurting her. Edward, of course, gives in, sending a message to it's readers: girls, sex is the most important thing in a relationship, something worth tearing yourself up over, and if you don't get something you want, cry, beg, and plead until you get it.    One of the pluses of the series has always been how easily relateable a character Bella is, and how easy the reader can put themselves into her shoes. This rare positive is completely lost, however, once Bella finds out (through a \\"miraculaous\\" happening that goes against previous back story Meyer had established) she's pregnant. A YOUNG GIRL who had never even thought once of having children throughout the rest of the series is suddenly gunning to be mother of the year, even when the unborn child LITERALLY starts killing her. Not only does this completely remove any way the reader can relate to Bella, it goes against everything established about her character. I won't even begin to go into the grotesque descriptions of Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, which aren't so much horror-filled as just horrifically-written.    One of the other things I found most disappointing in the book, however, was the simple fact that NO ONE has to make sacrifices. Nothing is given up, nothing is truly gained, no one learns something or becomes a stronger person because of it, and EVERYONE ends up with their own tailor-made happy ending. It seems almost as if Meyer was trying to please everyone by making sure every character ended up in the best way possible, which backfired horrifically. For example, Jacob, who has spent the entire series pining after Bella, suddenly finds that he's imprinted upon Bella's child (the tragically named Renesmee). Even if I didn't find this mildly disturbing (hey, if you can't be with the mother, her child's the next best thing, right?), it's still more than terribly clichéd. It looks like Meyer was just trying to find a way to keep Jacob's rabid fans happy by providing him with a love interest, while still keeping him firmly rooted in Bella's life.    I could go on more about the numerous faults found in the book, but that would take up far more space than I believe I have, and more time than I'd care to waste. In short, this honestly isn't worth the read, and there's no force on Earth that could make me have personally paid for this book. If I had bought it, I'd honestly be returning it for a full refund. The writing, plot, and characterization are horribly contradictory and contrived, and the only message that can be taken away from this novel is one I certainly wouldn't want my daughter to be learning.    Meyer needs to stop complaining about the complaints, saying \\"you can't please everyone, someone's always going to be unhappy with what you end up doing.\\" If she would only own up the the fact that she apparently copped out of doing her job properly, that this thing she's written is sub-par writing at it's finest, I might have an easier time accepting this farce as what it is.
B00140PK6O|5.0|This series is very endearing!  There are some surprises and several character stories going on at once.  All the actors are very good in this.  It is so like the time period and I found it very humorous!  Quite a joy for my husband and I both to watch!
031606792X|4.0|What a perfect ending to a perfect series.  Meyer had my attention with Twilight and kept it all of the way until the end...or is it the end?  Thank you for the great reading material, it was fun while it lasted!
1933784032|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I was expecting hundreds of images of models and props, and I didn't get it. Most (not all) of the images in this book can be easily found in other, and better better Star Wars reference books. Different book, same stuff.    I returned it.

0783240287|5.0|I have never enjoyed a musical production so much as I did \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat\\".  The magic between Donny and the children was wonderful and filled me with a warmth of which I've never before experienced.  And lastly, I thoroughly enjoyed Maria Friedman's performance.   And, as usual, the quality of the CD was superb.  For this last I am grateful to Amazon.

0930289234|5.0|My very essence of reading is to gain knowledge.  To me that knowledge has to be very real.  Hence, I seldom read fiction.  To me it seems a waste of time.  My viewing habits will go into the world of fiction but it must be historically accurate or again I will consider it a waste of my time.<br /> Two weeks ago my Son was going through the books that I'm currently reading and casually challenged me to broaden my horizons.  He described the Comic Series Watchmen and said that Time Magazine rates it as one of the top 100 novels.  I took the bait and I ordered Watchmen on Amazon.Com.<br /> The graphics are great and the writing is multi-layered and complex.  It deals with the Costume Super Heroes from the late 1930's to 1985. The story details the formation of their organizations and how they came to be.  Alan Moore creates an alternate history which is much different and darker than anything derived of in the Cold War period.<br /> In order to understand this serial Comic Series you must know history.  Please don't do as I first did and try to read things into Moore's writing.  Just follow the flow and the multi-layered technique used by Moore.  \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" is a comic series read within the Watchmen.  \\"Under the Hood\\" is a book within the Comic Series.  Please keep you eye on the ball.  Dr. Manhattan, Nite Owl, Rorschach, Veidt along with Laurie will keep you occupied.<br /> Throughout this tale, Dave Gibbons writes the graffiti on the walls of buildings in New York City always not complete and shown only partially.  We readers know it says Who's watching the Watchmen?  Literally we obviously are watching the Watchmen.  In the end the Watchmen are their own police.<br /> Oh and by the way, this review has solved the puzzle of what's the meaning of the Watchmen's book cover!  Do you know what it means?  Five stars, no problem!!!

B0018S6YOE|5.0|If you're a Rihanna fan, she has once again put out an incredible album. It has a good variety of music. Her songs with Chris Brown & Maroon 5 are great but so are the rest. Disturbia has a great dance beat, then Good Girl Gone Bad has more of a ballad feel to it. Definitley recommended if you like Rihanna.
B0019X3ZZY|3.0|Salo is a hard film to really give a star rating. If, at about the half hour mark you are not into it, stop watching. The film contains lots of unsettling scenes of forced sodomy upon young boys and girls, the eating of excrement and various tortures and degradations. If you are not willing to see these types of scenes, do not watch the movie. The basic message is that absolute power corrupts absolutely. The story is set in fascist Italy near the end of the war and concerns four men who play out their sadism on unwilling victims. That is basically it, there is a lot of social commentary that can be read into the film and a lot of it is intentional symbolism on the filmaker's part. But really it just comes down to absolute power corrupts. This new Criterion DVD is an excellent presentation; the picture is crisp and clean and contains a second disk of bonus features. This second disk is especially worth seeing as it can enhance ones understanding and appreciation for the film. It contains five featurettes of interviews with many of the people involved as well as outside critical observers who share their interpretations of the film's message. If you choose to watch this film all the way through, spend some time with these supplements as well. Salo is not for everyone but this DVD version is well done.
0385340567|1.0|A total waste of a good tree, I hate to say it but I am afraid the Jack Reacher franchise has run out of steam.  If you have never read a Reacher novel, do not start with this one - read the first ten and stop.
B001E780W8|1.0|Listening to this terrible music is just torturous. I skipped around the CD to see if I could find anything redeeming on it but it's just a lot of mediocre speed metal with a bad singer (if that's what he calls it...).     To me, this album is just a lot of awful noise :(    I would actually rate this a big zero.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|Um... is it just me or did this storyline borrow HEAVILY from John Boorman's 1975 Zardoz starring Sean Connery in one of his early post-Bond movies?  Similarities:<br /><br />* Isolated outpost created by scientists that is protected from \\"nature\\"<br />* People who live forever who are having mental issues (recycled clones in Flux)<br />* Sterility issues in the population<br />* A scientist manipulating the actions of an individual with a talent for extreme violence in an effort to take down the status quo (the old guy in the blimp thingy.  In Zardoz it was a scientist in a flying stone idol (that looks remarkably like Janus) trying to find just the right guy (Connery - \\"Seth\\" if I recall correctly) among a bunch of savages to do the deed.<br /><br />I mean, it isn't an out and out rip off, but the story certainly seems to borrow heavily from Zardoz - also a very weird film that seems to lack cohesion.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This is a very good cd.  I listen to it all the time.  I highly recommend it to everyone.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I'm having a hard time summing up all the good feelings and reasons why I love \\"The Lives of Others\\".  I can only say that it is a magnificent film that tells a genuine story about what life was like for Germany's citizens in 1984 when the Stasi secret police would listen to their conversations.  This was the era of the Berlin Wall when the GDR feared even their most loyal citizens were sympathizing with the West against their policy which involved monitoring their artists with a voice such as writers, playwrights, and actors.  Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck is a true, gifted German director and story teller with the ability to conjure strong emotion that elevates The Lives of Others above the political spy film. Actors Sebastian Koch, Martina Gedeck, and Ulrich Muhe all give beyond stellar performances as the main characters. You will feel your heart throb at the injustice done to Dreyman (Koch) as he keeps his hope that men can change through art, Sieland (Gedeck) who wants to keep her acting career while loving him, and Wiesler (Muhe) the Stasi agent who monitors their record while desiring to protect their futures. It is a film that shows how unfair people with power (GDR, political elite) can be to people who don't have it (Artists and citizens) and what the end result can be if taken far enough (suicide or incarceration).  The real tragedy beneath The Lives of Others is that other countries, including our own, can suffer the same fate.  A beautiful film that no one should miss and no one will forget if they give it a chance.

B0017V7GTY|1.0|I guess how much you dig these guys depends on how many great bands you've seen in your life. I bought this from Amazon after reading the raves on iTunes. Once I got the disc, after three quarters of the way through, I chucked it back in the stack, and I probably won't fire it up again. So I went back and reread some of the more critical iTunes reviews, and they were right. No great shakes.

B0017SWSCW|5.0|Virtually I could not put this book down!  It was full of suspense from the first chapters. Archer has masterfully woven several plot lines  into this story and yet does not lose the reader. I was speechless and  mightily impressed with the ending!!  So much so that I actually pressed \\"Next Page\\" on my Kindle several times.  If you enjoy excellence in suspense, this book is for you!
B000ASDFJU|3.0|CONSISTING OF 18 DISCS FOR SIX SEASONS OF SHOWS AND TWO MORE \\"EXTRAS\\"  This COLLECTORS SERIES of discs takes awhile to go through.

I am told the COLLECTOR SERIES GIFTset is no longer available, but amazon.com when contacted offered a full refund for return, or to work with me on obtaining selected replacements from the individual season sets, with some refund credit on original purchase.  We chose the latter.

B000002BBY|5.0|Noisy britpop from the 90s, an alternative to US Grunge from the same era, ill-bred children and, of course, a very british Beatlesque touch contribute to build up a good modern rock album supposedly meant to last and remain as one of the classics forever along with releases from Rolling Stones, Beatles or Led Zeppelin. Actually it includes the so-called 'best rock and roll song of all times' (based on a local radio survey), \\"Wonderwall\\", which just makes it worth listening.<br /><br />Trivia: even Coca Cola did not wanted to detach from the album's success by suing the band for plagiarism, claiming that one of the songs was very similar to a famous 80's jingle they had... which was it?<br /><br />A bit overexposed it still represents the best of Oasis ever, apart from the 'curious' personality of the band members or, better said, their idiocy.<br /><br />Someone once said this is how beatles would sound in the 90's if they'd continued their career...<br /><br />Who knows? Who cares?
B00005JKGK|4.0|When determining whether to view or purchase a movie or novel, I make it a point to read the highest and lowest ratings of that product. This film is no exception. However, I must say, while not surprised by the volume and intensity of the one-star reviews, I'm perplexed by much of their detail.<br /><br />One review sited the old adage that film should show rather than tell a story. While that may be true for some subject matter, it does not hold true for all. Additionally, narrative serves to do what action and dialogue cannot--fill the gap of the senses that sight and sound don't address. A well narrated tale is a pleasure to behold, especially when the narrator has the proper voice and emotion.<br /><br />Joy Luck Club has become one of my favorite films. The only reason I can't give it a full five stars is because it is emotionally painful to watch. That is to say, the emotional toll is so great I must take breaks between repeated viewings. It is much the same with City of Angels and Shindler's List.<br /><br />As to the issue of stereotyping Asians--especially Asian males--I can only say that from my perspective, \\"this\\" story addresses certain characters under certain circumstances. It paints some of them in an unfavorable light. However, I believe it would be unfair to believe the author was attempting to make a statement about all people of the group or even the bulk of the same people.<br /><br />We have only to look at our present culture and the instances of violence against women to realize that such men are not merely characters of fiction. They still exist in today's society and in nearly every country across the globe. A news article from just two days past (30 August 2008) reported where five women in Pakistan were stoned, shot, and then buried alive because they wanted to chose they own husbands. To deny that animals who prey on women do not exist in every culture is simply to be blind to the world as it is.<br /><br />That said, The Joy Luck Club was interesting, thought-provoking, well-paced, and emotionally draining. If that's the type of film you like, I would recommend it highly.paced, and emotionally draining. If that's the type of film you like, I would recommend it highly.

031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is last of four amazing books in the Twilight series. I could never put it down. The way Stephenie Meyer writes makes me feel like when i put the book down the whole world of Bella and Edward stop. Her descriptions are amazing. The way Stephenie Meyer uses words in such great detail would make someone want to keep reading and reading and reading and reading.
0140277447|5.0|Although this book is horrifying in its detail, it is a must read for anyone who wants to learn more about what happened in Asia during WWII. It is truly sad that as Americans we seem to only  focus on what has happened to us and our European neighbors during the war.

0143038419|1.0|I am beginning to see a trend here in reguards to \\"the Oprah book club\\". This book pretends to be a Christian book, however, it clearly denies the core Christian belief that Jesus is the only way. The language used in this book is almost exactly like Oprah said before on air during a debate on religion. This book, and oprah's club are capitalizing on people's ignorance. I think many buy this new-age garbage hook, line and sinker. If you deny that Jesus is the only way, are denying God, and you will not be able to go to heaven. Say what? Yes, God is a holy God, sin can not be in his presense. So, without Jesus dying for our sins, taking our sins away, How can we be in the presence of an all-Holy God? The answer is, we can not. Some may tell you that the true Christians preaching \\"JEsus is the only way\\" is mean, however you will be thankful on Judgement day, becaue your sins will be forgiven by what Jesus did on the cross and you will have access to God. Even here on earth, you do not have access to God without being born-again. John 3:3. You must accept Jesus in order to have communications with God. I would avoid this book at all cost, the author is dangerously ignorant.
B0012CJQY6|4.0|A stirring examination of the duality of man, \\"The Shield\\" follows detective Vic Mackey, head of the Strike Team in the fictional LAPD district of Farmington.  Along with fellow detectives Shane, Lemonhead, and Ronnie \\"Moustache\\" Dobbs, Vic navigates the back alleys of LA, committing criminal triage, allying himself with a wide array of characters like the two-bit drug dealer Rondell, the drug running rapper Kern, and drug cartel businessman Tio.<br /><br />The underlying question of the series could be, \\"What sacrifices, man?\\"  What sacrifices, man, indeed.  Through the continual snowballing of smaller infractions, the Strike Team finds itself ever more mired in the seedy underbelly of the streets.  Planted evidence here, blackmail there, and suddenly Vic has gone from sterling detective to ultimate supercop, capable of bringing in and bringing down the most horrific of criminal offenders.  What sacrifices, man!  I applaud Vic for making the difficult choices others cringe away from, and making them in a manner that brings the most harm to alleged felons while protecting some innocents.<br /><br />That's not to say the show is perfect, mind you.  There's an entire infrastructure of other, more law-abiding police Hellbent on preventing Vic from violating a street thug's 5th Amendment rights and stopping crime in the streets.  Fortunately, the bulk of these officers aren't that bright and even if they do wise up to Vic's war on crime, there's nothing they can do about it -- Vic cleans up his own messes, if you catch my drift.<br /><br />*Spoiler* Vic kills some people to cover his tracks. *Spoiler*<br /><br />Also, Vic's wife doesn't deserve Vic; man, you have got to get away from that girl.<br /><br />For fans of Greek tragedies, some of Shakespeare's more grim plays, and people who love watching cops beat the ever living Hell out of punks.
0142000655|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I read East of Eden. I certainly wasn't expecting to be swept away in Steinbeck's eloquent prose or on the edge of my seat, barely able to wait for the ending and yet not really wanting the book to end. At times this was difficult to read--Steinbeck is a master of showing the depravity of humanity--and at other moments you're blown away by his understanding of the good in all of us as well. He shows us that life is about the choices that we make, and not about the blood in us. Genetics have nothing to do with what our life can become, and Steinbeck works this into the novel beautifully. This book grips you and doesn't let you go even after you finish it. It tears away at your pre-conceived notions about life--and takes your breath away with the truth of humanity and what we are capable of--both for good and for evil.     Hauntingly, painfully beautiful in places, and just plain painful to read in spots, East of Eden is truly a masterpiece. It's not always easy to read, but even when you're disturbed beyond reason at what is happening, you can't stop reading. It's hypnotizing. Definitely one of my favorite books of all time.
031606792X|5.0|I am a 39 year old mother of 3 whose 15 year old daughter (she read Twilight when it first came out;met Stephenie Meyer at a book signing; rushed out for each of the other books as soon as they came out; a devoted Twilight fan)asked me to read the series. I was totally hooked. I thoroughly enjoyed Breaking Dawn and would choose it as my favorite book out of the series.   **Spoilers**  I teared up at the end when Edward and Bella thought it was all over and were saying goodbye to their daughter and each other. I felt their fear, their sadness and furious protection of their daughter above all things. I do not think Bella was too young to feel these things. She grew up very fast and found out the important things in life are worth fighting for. She was born to be a vampire. She had her gift before she ever became a vampire. Bella became the perfect vampire and amazed everyone.     I also do not find it creepy that Jacob imprinted with Renesmee. OK, maybe at first, but then after all that happened wouldn't you want someone that would fiercely protect your daughter? It's not like he was thinking about her in a dirty way; he is totally devoted to her and will always protect her.     Yes, everything turned out happy and that is exactly how I wanted it. I have enough bad things happen in my life and my friends' and families' lives, I don't need it in my movies and books too.     I especially loved when Edward could finally read Bella's thoughts (with her help). Like I said, an absolutely perfect book in every way. I don't understand why someone who enjoyed the first three books would want it to turn out any different.
1401207529|5.0|I can only say what has already been said about Batman: Year One. It is a great revamp of Batman's origin and a great story all around.

Batman: Year One stands the test of time as a great origin story for one of the greatest comic characters of all time.

0152048049|5.0|Written in 1943, this little book long ago attained the status of timeless classic. Yet, when discussed at our book club, our members could agree on little about the book's interpretation, sensibility, or even if it is appropriate for children. Some viewed it as an innovative form of literature requiring both a narrator and an inquisitor: What did that mean daddy? Where did the Little Prince go daddy? Does he love the rose? Who tamed whom? Some viewed it as a sort of religious work designed to teach our children \\"what is really important in life\\".  Do you like butterflies? What sort of voice does she have? On the other hand, some felt that the book allowed children to question the wisdom of adults, especially parents. Is this one of those deals Like Text Messaging where kids get it but adults never can? Others, who knew something about the author's life---why should it matter--- read it as a sort of suicide note disguised as a children's book. It was during these darker moments that one wag commented that any work that can stimulate a discussion this gloomy had to be something really special. And, here's where we all started to agree. This is not a work that speaks for itself. It is, instead, a sort of catalyst that will produce different enlightenments for different readers and narrators. While Saint-Exupery's little book can  open doors to wisdom, you have to enter by yourself. That so many continue to choose to do so is testimony to his greatness as a writer and a teacher.
0930289234|3.0|I must admit that I'm quite surprised by all the superlatives heaped on this comic series. When I read it I found it a bit slow and tedious at times. And the drawings are not very impressive either. It's certainly an interesting storyline, but definitely not something to wax all enthusiastic about and reread several times. If you're looking for a comic series with a good storyline, wonderful drawings, layers upon layers and unforgettable characters that is just awesome, read The Sandman books by Neil Gaiman!
0596009208|4.0|As a computer science teacher I am always on the lookout for introductory texts that make Java less intimidating.  Head First Java certainly fills the bill with a good mix of humor and content.

0143038419|4.0|I cannot believe the bitterness found in many of these criticisms. \\"Self absorbed\\" \\"talking only about herself\\" - get a grip, people! Have you never heard of the literary genres 'MEMOIR' or 'AUTOBIOGRAPHY'? It's a non-fiction book where the author mainly talks about - yes, you guessed it - his / herself. It's about THEIR life. If Miss Gilbert wanted to write about the poverty in India or the effect the breakdown of her marriage was having on her husband, I'm sure she would have written a book called \\"Poverty in India\\" or \\"My Husband, and What the Divorce Did To Him\\". In fact, it's credit to her that she did not delve into too much detail about the marriage - I am sure she was protecting his privacy. One reviewer had the audacity to complain \\"the marriage didn't seem that bad\\" - who is she to judge what constitutes a bad marriage, especially one about which she knows nothing!!? Liz Gilbert never promised to spill all the gory miserable details of her marriage, and why it went so wrong. As mature readers, we have to be able to guess some of it, imagine what might have happened. That's part of the art, and indeed the enjoyment, of reading. If you want a book that explains every single detail of every person and every thought and every place and every colour and every event ...etc etc. you should go back to reading Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and work your way up from there.  As reviewers we owe it to the readers of these reviews to at least make an informed and intelligent judgment on the books we choose to review.

Spoken fluently by probably about 400 million people worldwide, not including speakers of English-based creoles, English is not the most-spoken language, but it is the most studied, emulated, and widely distributed, being an official language in 44 countries. As it has become \\"the lingua franca of business, science, education, politics, and pop culture\\", it's worth taking a look at how confusing and wonderful English really is.<br /><br />Bryson writes mostly of British and American English, with occasional references to Australian and Canadian, but this book is written for an American audience. Although it does touch upon some different dialects, it does not address pidgins or creoles. It does explain what makes English simple -few inflected verbs and adjectives, few consonant clusters and tonal variations, no gender- and what makes it difficult -huge vocabulary and ridiculous spelling. No less fascinating than the discussions of English are Bryson's examples of the behavior of other languages for comparison, which give the characteristics of English some context and inspire interest in language in general.<br /><br />After a history of English's 1000+ years and an explanation of how words enter into language, the book launches into English's endearing (ahem) eccentricities: the evolution of pronunciation, development of regional dialects, how (and why?) we manage (or not) to spell 40 sounds in 200 different ways, word meanings and dictionaries, and a lightweight chapter on the lack of authority on English grammar. Bryson concludes with some fun chapters on names, swear words, and word games. He's dismissive of attempts to restore/introduce phonetic spelling, but there are good arguments for doing so, and workable alphabets have been devised for this purpose.<br /><br />\\"The Mother Tongue\\" does not go into a great deal of depth on its subjects but rather introduces the reader to the strengths and peculiarities of English. Though I think Bryson gets his main points across well, there are an unfortunate number of factual errors, particularly relating to other languages. Bryson seems to have taken a lot of information from popular books instead of consulting direct sources, such as linguists or foreign language scholars. Still, he is a good writer, and the casual reader cannot help but develop a new fascination and admiration for the English language. \\"The Mother Tongue\\" is a charming inducement to investigate its subjects in more depth. 3 1/2 stars.d workable alphabets have been devised for this purpose.    \\"The Mother Tongue\\" does not go into a great deal of depth on its subjects but rather introduces the reader to the strengths and peculiarities of English.

B000FGGE68|3.0|It's Ok. If you are a fan or at least a fan of Milla Jovovich you will enjoy it. She looks good but the story and the rest of the acting is blah.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Great sci-fi movie to watch. Bruce Willis does a great job playing the part, along with Brad Pitt also. Need to see movie.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Great Movie I enjoyed it a lot. If you are not a Johnny Cash fan then tough watch it anyway.

B000006O7C|5.0|CD One is LOVE, LOVE, LOVE - I LOVE IT... Even to a Non Jeff Buckley Fan.  CD One is VERY Polished (Yes, I am aware the CD is not polished to Jeff's or his band's standards due to Jeff's death) - BUT Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk will not disappoint!! Jeff Buckley's songs are always so original and never sound the same (so often found in today's indie and alternative bands).  The music is Timeless WITHOUT that  \\"classic rock\\" feel (I like classic rock - but sometimes sicken from radio overplay).  If you have a good ear for music you will quickly realize that Jeff Buckley was a multi-talented genius with endless musical possibilities just from listening to the CD the 1st time.  If you are poetically inclined, a lyric lover, or a deeper meaning seeker - this CD will submerge you in a state of perpetual bliss... The lyrics to these songs kick butt beyond the surface of everything that ever was.    CD 2 is a bit unpolished as these were \\"RAW\\" songs - some produced by Buckley alone via Home Four Track Recordings - and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE 2ND CD AS MUCH AS THE 1ST, but this may not be so to a Jeff Buckley Newbie - no offense...As a Buckley Fan (and I am the biggest that ever was and ever will be - I have listened to Sketches for my Sweetheart the Drunk EVERY DAY for the last 2 1/2 years) - I absolutely ADORE and LOVE the 2nd CD as it exposes and reveals Jeff in his natural, real, and raw music making process. The 2nd CD may be a turn off to a person who has not listened to his music for long.  Jeff Buckley was a paradox to many people, and the 2nd CD can appear as a confusing paradox as well.  I give Buckley's Mother, Mary Guibert, a round of applause for being bold in this decision.    Anyways - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD - BUY IT AND LET IT GROW ON YOU... then after you have a good grip on CD 1... venture on to CD2.  This music is heartbreakingly divine and beautiful -
B00188KD1Y|5.0|What do you get when you combine prisoners that have a chance to get out of prison and racing cars? DEATH RACE, the new action film with Jason Statham and Joan Allen.<br /><br />Jason Statham is a fantastic actor. He's one of my favorite actors as well, he's proven himself to be not just an action star, but a fantastic one as well. Action films like [[ASIN:B00003CY6P Ghosts of Mars (Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00008AOVL The Transporter]], and [[ASIN:B000K7UBSO Crank (Widescreen Edition)]] were definitely fun action flicks that definitely had me on the enge of my seat the whole time. The only movie of his I didn't like was [[ASIN:B000X1Z0CO War [Blu-ray]]]. But [[ASIN:B0019EXZY4 The Bank Job]] was a movie that proved he could act other than doing just action flicks.<br /><br />In Death Race, Jason Statham stars as Jensen, a factory worker who has just finished hs last day at work. He comes home to his beautiful wife and baby, whom he loves very much and would do anything for. But when a killer bursts into his house one night and kills his wife, the police confuse him for the killer, and is sent to jail. In order to get out, Hennessy, the warden of the prison gives him a chance: DEATH RACE, a deadly car race where if you want out, you have to win five races. He accepts, and enters the game, finding himself at competition against other criminals such as 14K and Machine Gun Joe. However, when he discovers that the killer is in the same prison as he, he makes him the number one target during the race!<br /><br />This is a fun and guilty pleasure movie. A Great cast, some great one liners and fantastic action, you can never go wrong. The acting is good and the girl as Jensen's partner is HOT!!!!!<br /><br />So if you want some fun crah-em-and-bang-em-up action, go see this!
B001ERCABA|5.0|I think I can say this is just about the best DVD I have ever bought. Everyone should own it, because no one will be disappointed. This has all the classic songs, guitar smashing, and Moon you could want.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|Do you remember that \\"telephone\\" game? The child at the beginning of the circle whispers a word to the kid next to them and it passes down the line becoming more distorted as it goes along. By the time it makes it back to the beginning it usually has no resemblance to what it was supposed to be.<br /><br />This is a pretty good metaphor for \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" The dramatic license in Phillipa Gregory's book caused controversy but ultimately resulted in an entertaining story.<br /><br />In contrast, the film plays somewhat like a game of telephone that started with a Cliff Notes version of Gregory's novel. As the film progress, the storyline spirals farther and farther outside the realm of credibility.<br /><br />The life and times of Henry VIII were tumultuous, dramatic, and populated by interesting characters. It should have been an easy task to write a reasonably entertaining script about this era. Unfortunately, a fifth grader's plagarized essay on this period would a lot easier to get through than this extremely boring and disappointing film adaptation.<br /><br />I can't fault Eric Bana's performance. He made a great Henry VIII despite limited screen time. Other cast members made valiant efforts to squeeze something out of the terrible script they were saddled with. Sadly, the beautiful costumes and scenery might have been an asset to this film if I could have stayed awake to appreciate them better.<br /><br />Avoid this turkey.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is a GREAT book to read while you are trying to diet. I read all four novels in a row. They were captivating and I never wanted to put them down. As a writer Mrs. Meyers knows how to keep you feeling as though you can see, hear and touch everything in the story, as if you were standing right there with them. I read to enter into the world of the characters, not to compare it to real life and I like happy endings, so after the ups and downs, it leaves me with a pleasant experience and makes me want to read her next novel. I most like the fact that Bella was never hungry in the beginning and Edward didn't eat because he was a vampire, so that killed my appetite, also there was so much \\"vampire blood talk\\" that my appetite didn't come back for two days after the last page. I lost almost 10 lbs in the process. Thank you for sharing your fantasy with us. Regards, Sue
B000YD7F10|5.0|This is, I believe, the strongest Eagles album start to finish.  It has a consistent Western theme though the styles of the particular songs vary from hard rock (\\"Out Of Control\\") to bluegrass (\\"Twenty-one\\").      Potential buyers who are first exploring the Eagles past their greatest hits albums should note, however, that there is a large stylistic difference between their first two albums and their later works such as \\"Hotel California\\".  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but something you should be aware of.      This would certainly be on my \\"trapped on a desert island\\" list of CDs.
B0017MO10U|3.0|Was not as good as the Arc of the Truth.  It had its' moments, but I felt like it was thrown together.  It was not as exciting as I had planned on with the hipe before it came out.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Being for warned about the sound was fine and not a problem, I managed it by turning up the volume.  A good concise video going over causes and political actions taken before and during the war.  It touches the war from all viewpoints.  I highly recommend adding this documentary to your video library.
B000J103WK|5.0|This was an excellent concert. Sound and picture were unbeleivable. The songs were done very close to the original versions in both voice and music, unlike some concerts where the try to change the music and voice tracks and ruin the song.
0743298020|2.0|The narrator's personal story was boring & tedious, & became \\"filler\\" to the supposedly real story of the reclusive writer.  I did stick with it to the end by speed reading over the repetitive stuff (and there's a lot)but I wouldn't do it again. Ultimately the story just wasn't much of a mystery or interesting.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara Bareilles is wonderful! I enjoy every track, and every time I listen...I hear something new!! She is an amazing artist. Take a moment,  and listen to \\"Little Voice\\". I'm sure you will find out as I have how  great it is to buy a CD and actually enjoy every song!!! Don't let the   title fool you, there is nothing little about Sara Bareilles' voice!!
B000002KKS|5.0|I needn't say much, most of the reviews of this work here speak volumes. I did want to correct Amazon's description writer, however, as this album and Mob Rules are NOT the only albums with Dio. In 1992 Ronnie James Dio and accomplished percussionist Vinny Appice joined with Sabbath once again (the classic Mob Rules lineup) to create the album Dehumanizer. Yet another necessity for your CD collection. But this one here, Heaven & Hell, belongs in your collection just like AC/DC's Back In Black or Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell. It's one you'll want to copy and play the copy, so you don't wear out the original.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams miniseries; history made interesting and entertaining.  What a concept.  Stellar performances all around though Paul Giamatti was so intense at times it was borderline insanity.  Probably just like the real Adams though.  I would recommend this to anyone with even a passing interest in American History.
B0010T0OCY|1.0|This is the dumbest sci-fi movie I've seen aside from Battlefield Earth.  I'm a diehard Star Trek and Star Wars fan and this movie does not have the character development needed to make a great movie.  It also doesn't have a plot that makes sense.  These aliens were dying so they kidnapped a bunch of humans to find out what makes them human?  What kind of sense does that make?  WHY were the aliens dying on their own world?  What do humans have to offer to change their situation?  Why take them off of Earth and make an \\"island\\" floating in space to house them for this experiment?  Nothing in this movie made any sense.  And if they have super powers to fling things at people, why did they always try to stab people with knives in this movie?  STUPIDDDDDDDD!!!!  If I could give this zero stars, I would.
0439023483|4.0|Clearly [[ASIN:0439678137 Gregor]] was merely the prelude. Suzanne Collins, you've been holding out on us, missy. As an author we were accustomed to your fun adventures involving a boy, his sister, and a world beneath our world. I think it's fair to say that we weren't really expecting something like The Hunger Games. At least I wasn't. But reading it gave me a horribly familiar feeling. There is a certain strain of book that can hypnotize you into believing that you are in another time and place roughly 2.3 seconds after you put that book down.  [[ASIN:0152061541 Life As We Knew It]] by Susan Beth Pfeffer could convince me that there were simply not enough canned goods in my home. And The Hunger Games? Well as I walked down the street I was under the disctinc impression that there were hidden cameras everywhere, charting my progress home. Collins has written a book that is exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns. It ascends to the highest forms of the science fiction genre and will create all new fans for the writer. One of the best books of the 2008 year.<br /><br />Life in District 12 isn't easy for Katniss and her family. Ever since her father died the girl has spent her time saving her mother and little sister Prim from starvation by hunting on forbidden land. But worst of all is reaping day. Once a year the government chooses two children from each of the twelve districts to compete against one another in a live and televised reality show. Twenty-four kids and teens enter, and only one survives. When Prim's name is called, Katniss exchanges herself without hesitation to compete alongside the baker's boy Peeta. To survive in this game you need to win the heart of your audience, and so District 12's trainers come up with a plan. Why not make it as if Peeta and Katniss were in love with one another? But in a game where only one person can live, Katniss will have to use all her brains, wits, and instincts to determine who to trust and how to outwit the game's creators.<br /><br />I described the plot of this book to my husband, particularly the part where Katniss and Peeta fake being in love to gain the audience's approval and the very first thing he said was, \\"Oh! That's the plot of [[ASIN:185242401X They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]\\" Then I mentioned that it took place in the future and that government leaders set up teenagers to fight one another to the death and he said, \\"[[ASIN:1427807531 Battle Royale]]\\". So sure, there are parts of this plot that have been done before. You could say it's [[ASIN:B000069HZP The Game]] meets [[ASIN:0783226039 Spartacus]] with some [[ASIN:B0001ZDKXI Survivor]] thrown in for spice. But that's not what makes a book good or bad, is it? Some of the greatest works of literature out there, regardless of the readerships' age, comes about when an author takes overdone or familiar themes and then makes them entirely new through the brilliance of their own writing. Harry Potter wouldn't have been any great shakes if it weren't for Rowling's storytelling. Similarly, Collins takes ideas that have certainly seen the light of day before and concocts an amazingly addictive text. About the time you get to the fifth chapter that ends with a sentence that forces you to read on, you're scratching your head wondering how the heck she DOES that.<br /><br />Your story often rests on the shoulders of the protagonist. Is this a believable character? Do you root for him or her? Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a \\"good\\" person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with. Because we readers know that we are flawed, we are often inclined to side with the similarly flawed people we meet between a book's covers. Katniss, on the other hand, is so good in so many ways. She sacrifices herself for her sister. She tries to save people in the game. But there's almost a jock mentality to her too. Katniss can figure out the puzzles and problems in the game, but when it comesto emotional complexity she's sometimes up a tree. Most remarkable to me was the fact that Katniss could walk around, oblivious to romance, and not bug me. Seriously, nothing gets under my skin faster than heroines who can't see that their fellow fellas are jonesing for them. You just want to bonk the ladies upside the head with a brick or something. The different here is maybe the fact that since Katniss knows that Peeta has to play a part, she uses that excuse (however unconsciously) to justify his seeming affection for her. Thems smart writing.<br /><br />Oh! And did I mention the dialogue at all? The humor? Yep, there's humor. We're talking about a story where adolescents hunger for blood, and Katniss is getting in lines about her trainers like, \\"And then, because it's Effie and she's apparently required by law to say something awful...\\" Good stuff. The words pop off the page. And then there's the fact that we're dealing with a dystopian novel where the author has somehow managed to create a believable future. No faux slang here, or casual references to extinct dolphins. There are some animals that were scientifically altered, but you can't have a future without a couple cool details like that, right?<br /><br />In general, this book throws a big fat wrench into the boy book/girl book view of child/teen literature. People love to characterize books by gender. It stars a boy? Boy book. A girl? Girl book. Now take a long lengthy look at the first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy. It stars a girl... and a boy too. There's a lot of hunting, fighting, and survival... and a lot of romance, kisses, and cool outfits. There's strategy, the world's most fabulous fashion designer, weapons and a girl who knows how to fight. This is not a book that quietly slots into our preconceived stereotypes. And you know what happens to books that span genders? They sell very well indeed. That is, if you can get both boys and girls to read them.<br /><br />The age range? Well, for most of this story I would have said ten and up. I mean, yeah the basic premise is that a lot of teenagers go around killing one another, and sure there's some romance to deal with, but none of it really seems inappropriate... until a final death scene appears in the book. I won't give any details, but suffice it to say it is gruesome. There are definite horror elements to it as well, so with that in mind I am upping my recommendation to 12 and up. I'm sure that there are 10-year-olds out there who've seen much worse stuff on cable, just as there are 12-year-olds who'll freak out ten pages in. Still, I'm more comfortable recommending it for the older kids rather than the younger. You'll see why.<br /><br />It occurs to me that there has never been a quintessential futuristic gladiator book for kids. That is undoubtedly the roughest term you can give this book. Now I'm not a person who cries easily when she reads something, particularly something for kids. Yet as I was taking a train to Long Island I found myself tearing up over significant parts of this story. It's good. And it's so ridiculous that a work of science fiction like this could even be so good. You think of futuristic arena tales and your mind instantly sinks to the lowest common denominator. What Collins has done here is set up a series that will sink its teeth into readers. The future of this book will go one of two ways. Either it will remain an unappreciated cult classic for years to come or it will be fully appreciated right from the start and lauded. My money lies with the latter. A contender in its own right.she's sometimes up a tree. Most remarkable to me was the fact that Katniss could walk around, oblivious to romance, and not bug me. Seriously, nothing gets under my skin faster than heroines who can't see that their fellow fellas are jonesing for them. You just want to bonk the ladies upside the head with a brick or something.

No faux slang here, or casual references to extinct dolphins. There are some animals that were scientifically altered, but you can't have a future without a couple cool details like that, right?    In general, this book throws a big fat wrench into the boy book/girl book view of child/teen literature. People love to characterize books by gender. It stars a boy? Boy book. A girl? Girl book. Now take a long lengthy look at the first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy. It stars a girl... and a boy too. There's a lot of hunting, fighting, and survival... and a lot of romance, kisses, and cool outfits. There's strategy, the world's most fabulous fashion designer, weapons and a girl who knows how to fight. This is not a book that quietly slots into our preconceived stereotypes. And you know what happens to books that span genders? They sell very well indeed. That is, if you can get both boys and girls to read them.    The age range? Well, for most of this story I would have said ten and up. I mean, yeah the basic premise is that a lot of teenagers go around killing one another, and sure there's some romance to deal with, but none of it really seems inappropriate... until a final death scene appears in the book. I won't give any details, but suffice it to say it is gruesome. There are definite horror elements to it as well, so with that in mind I am upping my recommendation to 12 and up. I'm sure that there are 10-year-olds out there who've seen much worse stuff on cable, just as there are 12-year-olds who'll freak out ten pages in. Still, I'm more comfortable recommending it for the older kids rather than the younger. You'll see why.    It occurs to me that there has never been a quintessential futuristic gladiator book for kids. That is undoubtedly the roughest term you can give this book. Now I'm not a person who cries easily when she reads something, particularly something for kids. Yet as I was taking a train to Long Island I found myself tearing up over significant parts of this story. It's good. And it's so ridiculous that a work of science fiction like this could even be so good. You think of futuristic arena tales and your mind instantly sinks to the lowest common denominator. What Collins has done here is set up a series that will sink its teeth into readers. The future of this book will go one of two ways. Either it will remain an unappreciated cult classic for years to come or it will be fully appreciated right from the start and lauded. My money lies with the latter. A contender in its own right.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|Yes the movie has some humor but as for a proper completion of the original Jones series it's a disappointment. It took far to long to come to fruition. For years we drooled over the rumor mill of an Atlantean adventure amongst others, but in the end it's as though they threw something together to finally get it done. Not the clever dialogue, suspense, or exciting action we hoped would end the series. The question now is, will it be carried on by a young \\"Mutt\\" played by Shia LaBeouf? Is Mutt a reference to the another dogs name Indiana took? After all perhaps they felt like father like son using dog names. The younger audience may feel this is the same kind of fun that the previous movies offered, but it is doubtful the original fans will be so forgiving. It was nice of them to give a nod to the \\"Pancho Villa\\" episode of the \\"Young Indiana Jones\\" series.  If you enjoyed this movie, catch the more enjoyable [[ASIN:B0009NSCRQ The Librarian - Quest for the Spear]] and [[ASIN:B0002J58GU King Solomon's Mines]] with Patrick Swayze.<br /><br />CA Luster
B000002J0B|4.0|OK this is more like 1 of the greatest hits cd's but it was compiled at once.  I absolutely love this album.  Most of the tunes you will know if your a zepp fan at all.  But if you were already a zepp fan you wouldn't be reading this review because you would already own this cd.
031606792X|3.0|I reread Breaking Dawn and liked it much better.  I think I read it so fast the first time to see how it ended that I missed some really good parts. But I will never buy any of her series again because of the Midnight Sun blunder.  I really feel like Stephanie Meyers fans are being jerked around with the whole silly, childish, crap about someone posting her rough draft of Midnight Sun. I understand her being upset, but to punish everyone for 1 persons action is beyond reason. If it is a marketing ploy then she has insulted our intelligence. I will never read another of her series even as much as I loved the Twilight series. I will not be jerked around with her childish pettiness. She won't get a chance to do it to me again!

B0013K1ALE|5.0|Most Zep fans know and enjoy any live footage of the band. For those who are not familare the mix of electric live footage mixed with the bands fantasy images makes an entertaining film. Sit back and enjoy a voyage back to the 70's.
